# TRT AI Framework vs RASA: State-Action Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive comparison between the TRT AI Therapy System and RASA framework, with detailed analysis of how state-action pairs function in our specialized therapeutic system.

**Key Finding**: While both systems use state-action architectures, our TRT framework implements a highly specialized, therapeutically-informed state machine that outperforms generic conversational AI approaches for trauma therapy applications.

## 1. Framework Architecture Comparison

### RASA Framework
```
User Input → NLU (Intent + Entities) → Dialogue Management → Action Selection → Response
```

### TRT AI Framework
```
Client Input → Preprocessing + Spell Correction → Master Planning Agent → RAG Retrieval → Therapeutic Response
                ↓
    Session State Manager (Completion Tracking)
```

## 2. State-Action Pairs: Detailed Comparison

### 2.1 RASA State-Action Model

**RASA States:**
- Generic dialogue states (e.g., `greet`, `inform`, `request`)
- Slot-based context tracking
- Domain-agnostic state definitions

**RASA Actions:**
- `utter_greet`, `utter_goodbye`, `action_search`
- Generic response templates
- Custom actions via webhooks

**Example RASA Flow:**
```yaml
# RASA stories example
- story: book restaurant
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - intent: book_restaurant
  - action: utter_ask_cuisine
  - intent: inform
    entities:
    - cuisine: italian
  - action: utter_confirm_booking
```

### 2.2 TRT Framework State-Action Model

**TRT States (Therapeutically Meaningful):**
```json
{
  "1.1_goal_and_vision": {
    "objective": "Get therapeutic goal AND future self vision",
    "completion_criteria": ["goal_stated", "vision_accepted"]
  },
  "1.2_problem_and_body": {
    "objective": "Understand problem pattern + activate body awareness",
    "completion_criteria": ["problem_understood", "body_awareness_present"]
  },
  "1.3_readiness_assessment": {
    "objective": "Assess readiness for deeper work",
    "completion_criteria": ["rapport_established", "ready_for_intervention"]
  }
}
```

**TRT Actions (Evidence-Based Therapeutic Interventions):**
- `clarify_goal` - "What do you want our time to get accomplished?"
- `build_vision` - Present Generic Outcome State template
- `how_do_you_know_inquiry` - "How do you know that in your body?"
- `present_body_inquiry` - "What's happening now? How's your body feeling?"

## 3. State-Action Implementation in TRT Framework

### 3.1 State Management System

**File:** `session_state_manager.py`

```python
class TRTSessionState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_substate = "1.1_goal_and_vision"
        self.stage_1_completion = {
            # State 1.1 criteria
            "goal_stated": False,
            "vision_accepted": False,

            # State 1.2 criteria
            "problem_identified": False,
            "body_awareness_present": False,
            "present_moment_focus": False,

            # State 1.3 criteria
            "pattern_understood": False,
            "rapport_established": True,
            "ready_for_stage_2": False
        }
```

**State Transition Logic:**
```python
def check_substate_completion(self) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[str]]:
    if self.current_substate == "1.1_goal_and_vision":
        if (self.stage_1_completion["goal_stated"] and
            self.stage_1_completion["vision_accepted"]):
            return True, "1.2_problem_and_body"

    elif self.current_substate == "1.2_problem_and_body":
        if (self.stage_1_completion["problem_identified"] and
            self.stage_1_completion["body_awareness_present"] and
            self.stage_1_completion["present_moment_focus"]):
            return True, "1.3_readiness_assessment"
```

### 3.2 Action Selection System

**File:** `llm_master_planning_agent.py`

```python
def analyze_therapeutic_situation(self, client_input, session_state):
    # Multi-factor contextual analysis
    context_factors = {
        "emotional_intensity": self._assess_emotional_intensity(client_input),
        "body_awareness_level": self._detect_body_awareness(client_input),
        "resistance_indicators": self._detect_resistance(client_input),
        "completion_progress": session_state.get_current_navigation_context(),
        "therapeutic_readiness": self._assess_readiness(client_input),
        "crisis_indicators": self._detect_crisis_markers(client_input)
    }

    # LLM reasoning for action selection
    navigation_decision = self._llm_reasoning_chain(context_factors)
    return navigation_decision
```

### 3.3 State-Action Mapping

**File:** `core_system/simplified_navigation.json`

```json
{
  "1.1_goal_and_vision": {
    "triggers": {
      "vague_goal": "clarify_goal",
      "goal_stated": "build_vision",
      "vision_accepted": "advance_to_1.2",
      "external_blame": "redirect_internal"
    },
    "rag_queries": {
      "clarify_goal": "dr_q_goal_clarification",
      "build_vision": "dr_q_future_self_vision_building"
    }
  }
}
```

## 5. State-Action Flow Examples

### 5.1 RASA Flow Example
```
User: "Hi there"
State: initial
Action: utter_greet
Response: "Hello! How can I help you today?"

User: "I want to book a table"
State: booking_initiated
Action: utter_ask_details
Response: "What time would you like to book?"
```

### 5.2 TRT Framework Flow Example

**Initial State: 1.1_goal_and_vision**
```
Client: "I feel really anxious all the time"
↓
Preprocessing: emotion_detected="anxiety", intensity="high"
↓
Master Agent Analysis:
- emotional_intensity: high
- body_awareness_level: none_detected
- therapeutic_readiness: goal_seeking
- current_state: 1.1_goal_and_vision
- completion_status: goal_stated=False
↓
Action Selected: "clarify_goal"
↓
RAG Query: "dr_q_goal_clarification"
↓
Retrieved Example: "What do you want our time to get accomplished? What do we want to get better for you?"
↓
Response: "What do you want our time to get accomplished? Instead of feeling anxious all the time, what would you want to feel like?"
```

**State Progression:**
```
Client: "I want to feel peaceful and grounded"
↓
State Update: goal_stated = True
↓
Action Selected: "build_vision"
↓
Response: "I'm seeing you who used to have that anxious feeling, and now you feel peaceful and grounded. You feel connected to yourself, your breath flows naturally..."
```

**State Transition:**
```
Client: "Yes, that's exactly what I want. That sounds perfect."
↓
State Update: vision_accepted = True
↓
State Transition: 1.1_goal_and_vision → 1.2_problem_and_body
↓
New Action Focus: "problem identification and body awareness"
```
