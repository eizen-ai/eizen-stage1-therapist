# TRT System Testing Guide

## ðŸŽ® **Interactive Testing**

### **Real-time Interactive Mode**
```bash
source therapy_env/bin/activate
python3 interactive_trt_tester.py
```

**Commands during interactive mode:**
- **Type client responses** to test the system in real-time
- **`guide`** - Shows what responses are expected at current stage
- **`summary`** - Shows current session summary
- **`save`** - Saves session log to logs/ directory
- **`quit`** - Exits and auto-saves session

### **Interactive Features:**
- âœ… **Real-time logging** of all system components
- âœ… **Spelling correction** tracking with before/after
- âœ… **Navigation decisions** with reasoning
- âœ… **RAG retrieval** with similarity scores
- âœ… **Session state** progression tracking
- âœ… **Automatic log saving** to JSON files

## ðŸ”„ **Batch Testing**

### **Predefined Sequence Tests**
```bash
source therapy_env/bin/activate
python3 batch_sequence_tester.py
```

**Available Tests:**
1. **Complete Sequence** - Full 1.1 â†’ 1.2 â†’ 1.3 progression
2. **Spelling Correction** - Multiple spelling errors handling
3. **Error Handling** - Edge cases and error scenarios
4. **Run All** - Complete test suite

## ðŸ“Š **TRT Progression Testing**

### **Stage 1.1: Goal and Vision**
**Test Sequence:**
```
1. Initial feeling: "I am feeling anxious and stressed"
   Expected: Goal clarification with acknowledgment

2. Goal statement: "I want to feel calm and peaceful"
   Expected: Generic Outcome State vision building

3. Vision acceptance: "Yes, that sounds exactly what I want"
   Expected: Advance to 1.2
```

### **Stage 1.2: Problem and Body**
**Test Sequence:**
```
4. Problem description: "Work pressure makes me panic"
   Expected: Body awareness inquiry

5. Body awareness: "I feel tightness in my chest"
   Expected: Pattern inquiry with 'how do you know'

6. Pattern recognition: "It starts when I see my calendar"
   Expected: Advance to 1.3
```

### **Stage 1.3: Readiness Assessment**
**Test Sequence:**
```
7. Readiness: "I understand the pattern and I'm ready"
   Expected: Ready for Stage 2
```

## ðŸ”§ **Spelling Correction Testing**

### **Common Therapeutic Terms**
Test these spelling errors:
```
"iwll feeling realy overwhelmed"     â†’ "will feeling really overwhelmed"
"I want to fel beter and les anixous" â†’ "I want to felt better and les anxious"
"Work presure makes me panick"       â†’ "Work pressure makes me panic"
"I can fel tightnes in my chest"     â†’ "I can felt tightness in my chest"
```

### **Emotional State Detection**
Test emotional categorization:
```
"I'm devastated" â†’ crisis_level
"I'm stressed"   â†’ moderate_distress
"I'm sad"        â†’ mild_distress
"I'm okay"       â†’ neutral
"I'm happy"      â†’ positive
```

## ðŸ“‹ **System Component Logging**

### **What Gets Logged in Real-time:**

#### **1. Input Preprocessing**
- Original vs corrected input
- Spelling corrections made
- Emotional state detection
- Input categorization

#### **2. Master Planning Agent**
- Current stage and substate
- Navigation decision
- TRT technique selection
- Advancement blocking reasons
- Decision reasoning

#### **3. RAG Retrieval**
- Technique query used
- Number of examples retrieved
- Similarity scores
- Example quality metrics

#### **4. Dialogue Generation**
- Final therapeutic response
- Response reasoning
- Authentic TRT style verification

#### **5. Session State**
- Completion criteria tracking
- Current progression location
- Advancement readiness
- Turn counting

## ðŸ’¾ **Log Files**

### **Automatic Log Generation**
All sessions automatically generate JSON logs in `logs/` directory:

- **Interactive sessions**: `interactive_session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_log.json`
- **Batch tests**: `complete_sequence_test.json`, `spelling_correction_test.json`, etc.

### **Log Structure**
```json
{
  "session_id": "session_name",
  "total_turns": 5,
  "current_location": "stage_1_safety_building -> 1.2_problem_and_body",
  "conversation_log": [
    {
      "turn": 1,
      "timestamp": "2025-10-07T...",
      "client_input": "original input",
      "preprocessing": {...},
      "navigation": {...},
      "dialogue": {...},
      "progress": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Testing Scenarios**

### **1. Perfect Progression Test**
Client follows ideal TRT progression:
```bash
python3 batch_sequence_tester.py
# Select option 1
```

### **2. Spelling Error Handling**
Client makes multiple spelling mistakes:
```bash
python3 batch_sequence_tester.py
# Select option 2
```

### **3. Edge Case Testing**
Unusual inputs and error conditions:
```bash
python3 batch_sequence_tester.py
# Select option 3
```

### **4. Custom Interactive Testing**
Your own conversation flow:
```bash
python3 interactive_trt_tester.py
# Follow the prompts
```

## âœ… **Verification Checklist**

### **System Correctness:**
- [ ] Spelling corrections are accurate
- [ ] Emotional states are properly detected
- [ ] Sequential progression follows TRT methodology
- [ ] Responses use authentic Dr. Q language
- [ ] Present-moment focus is maintained
- [ ] Advancement blocking works correctly

### **Performance:**
