We want your body in a state of rest because resting is what enables inside healing to accelerate. It's why colds, flus, and surgery, we tell people the same thing. We want you to get rest. And so we've got really cool levers that are designed to put the body at rest. First lever, super silly. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. So not a complete drop like, ah, but just a little bit like, and when you slightly lower your jaw, it stimulates the vagus nerve and starts to put the body into more of a resting state, right? The second lever is you're going to relax the back of your tongue so that your tongue rests at the bottom of your mouth. So it's like this. Right. Third, you're going to intentionally breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale and then a little bit longer on the exhale. So your jaw is slightly lowered. You're relaxing your tongue so it rests at the bottom of your mouth. You now begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer, right?

They're highly elevated in tunnel. We're going to move your brain waves down to the lower end of beta, higher end of alpha, right? Because in alpha waves, that's what surfers think of as flow states or athletes would call it being in the zone. It's those moments of alert, aware, relax. And what it correlates with is an expanding of awareness out towards your peripheral vision. So one more time, your jaw is slightly lowered. You relax the back of your tongue. It rests at the bottom of your mouth. You breathe in intentionally a little bit slower and deeper, and then out a little bit longer. And notice as you're continuing to breathe in this way, you can see me and you can see my nose. You can stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers. My fingers move off to the side so that with the sides of your eyes, you begin to pick up more of the space towards the sides of the room. Notice that you're more aware of the space between you and the screen, the space that's beyond the screen. the space that's behind you, the space that's underneath you, and the space that's above your head.

And notice that the space doesn't just stop in your location, but it goes well beyond the confines of the room you're in. all the way out in every direction, there's a lot more space towards outer space and beyond. And now just for a moment, go ahead and close your eyes. And then with your eyes closed, imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body, beyond the ceiling and beyond the roof so that you rise way up above it all in the sky. You're having this bird's eye view. You're seeing it all as being underneath and below you because you're above and over it. And like a bird free, soar and glide through the space of the sky. And move in multiple directions and in different ways. Big wide arching turns and curves. You soar, you fly, you glide, you move, you're free. To be becoming even more okay in you. Now, go ahead and bring your awareness back down and into your body so that you reassociate inside of you. Take a nice, slow, deep breath in. And then a big exhale. And open your eyes. That's right.

    "content": "Doctor: Yeah, to be both in nothing and feeling free. Right. And that's where we're headed as a you who's free. And just a little bit of a recap, we all recognize, and I'm going to say it in a little bit of a different way than the last time, but let's just say because of things that you've gone through throughout your life, there have been bad programming that got installed in you. Programming that made you more self-conscious. Programming that made you more question yourself. Programming that would have past things pop up or make you feel bad or that over concern about others and making sure I've got to do everything to make sure, right? What we're going to say is that there's been bad programming along the line that got installed. Does that make sense? And the bad programming got installed because you went through crappy stuff, right? And our brain develops in such a way that it learns how to survive something But how I learned how to survive it at four or eight or 12 or 16 may be different than now. So it's not that we want to get rid of any of the stuff that had you survive. We just want to expand the options that are available because we want those for when those situations, if they were to arise, arise so that we have it. But in other situations, they're not as effective. You being constantly worried about what and how all those people are going to feel, that's not helpful. At other times, a way that that operated worked really well because it was what I needed to survive. Second part is we understand that physical injuries heal and they heal over time. So a broken arm or a broken foot over time, With the right cast or whatever you put on it, it will heal, go through rehab, and then it's better. We also get that emotional wounds tend to not heal. No matter how much I talk about it, no matter how far I get away from it, it still seems to be there. Even though I know that it's over, even though I know it's done, it doesn't feel that way. And so the reason it doesn't feel that way is that when I went through those experiences, my emotional brain short-circuited. It got stuck on. Meaning when that happened, it froze it and doesn't know it ever ended. So there's a part of your nervous system, there's a part of your emotional brain that has never updated. So with any of the bad, awful experiences that you've gone through, all those ones that you try to never think about because whenever you do, you feel yucky, right? Those are experiences that at a different level are still on in you. So the goal of what we're doing is we want to change the relationship that stuff so the coding changes from happening to data about something that happened yeah makes sense yes right and that's what we want to do because what got tied into all negative experiences is the additional meaning that it meant something about me at a worth lovability identity level So when I was a little child and my dad left, I was two and he was no longer in the picture, I didn't have the processing skills that I do now. I know as an adult now that my dad wasn't, well, he was screwed up in some ways. And that him not being around wasn't about me or my lovability or whether he loved me or not. However, when I was a little child, it really felt that way to me. Because as a little child, it's my world and I've learned good happens when I'm good. Bad only happens if I'm bad. So, of course, my dad not being around must have had something to do with my lovability. Right? And even though I know that now as an adult, I don't know that where I'm emotional. Make sense?\nPatient: Yeah. Yeah.",

Now we know as he's telling us about that, what the heck is happening? We all go, he's reliving it. But what's really happening is that there's a different part of his brain that's confusing the memory. Thinking it's the experience, that's why it's affecting him. And we can tell when he was telling us about it because we saw it all over him, right? But that's the thing. It was affecting him even over the weekend when he was playing with his kids. It was under the surface, but still there. Logically, he knows that he's safe. He's with us. He survived. He's okay. There's no gun. The problem is that we're learning that there's another part of his brain that doesn't have the good news. Did that make sense? Yeah. Yeah, another part of his brain got stuck. And then once it's stuck, and this is why you experience it in an ongoing way, my brain is vigilant and sensitive and searching because it wants to keep me alive and it still thinks that awful stuff is happening. It's scanning, sorting, looking for anything that's a reminder of that stuff. Even if the reminder wasn't part of the problem, but happened at the same time, it can get confused.

And then you guys were probably back home and then you left the street and then you were standing there. And then mom said, you're like this and he's like this. And then you were out at the street. And then before you walk to the street, then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing. Now, as I went through it backwards, compared to you telling it to me forward, emotionally, how was it? Was it same? Was it more? Was it less?\nPatient: So you're asking how I felt?",

And then there's other stuff that happens that might have been violent stuff as well or sexual stuff or any of that kind of stuff. So the first thing is to kind of think about a time. And I know we talked about a beautiful thing like a lake, but a time that you're outside in nature and you see something really pretty. And as you're looking at it, you're like in it and it's like, wow, what is it that you see? but the beautiful mountain and the flowing river yeah and isn't there a moment that as you're seeing the beautiful mountain with that flowing river that you're feeling this sense of all wonder and peace yeah and some people would tell you it is seeing that that gives you these feelings But what if we looked at it from another lens and we were to say that seeing that and being there drew your awareness down and in towards your center? And what if at your center, you're always peaceful and excited? Kind of like if I'm outside at a bonfire and I'm cold and I take my hands and I move them towards the flames and I say, holy cow, the fire is getting hotter.\nPatient: Yeah.",

In those pains and hurts and angers and upsets and griefs and confusions and... But no matter where awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited. And you know that two of us are on this Zoom because your senses can bring in the data. Your intellect understands it. That's the knowledge of light. Light of knowledge. At your center, it's a brighter light of wisdom. So we have knowledge, we have wisdom. And you know that I work with all sorts of people who've had all sorts of awful stuff happen to them. And I remember one girl, her older brother used to take these little like cars, they're called matchbox cars, and drive them up her leg and park them in her. So she had a lot of yuck around all of that, right? Makes sense. But when we worked together, we cleared it all out, all the yuck gone. And I asked her the question, I go, all that, I go, where was it? And she looks at me, big smile, and she goes, it's gone, I don't feel it. I go, I know, isn't that cool? And she says, it is. But I go, my question was, where was it? And when we started thinking, I go, was it at the surface level? She's like, no, it wasn't intellectual. I go, maybe it was in your center. She's like, dude, how could that stuff survive in light? Or I'm peaceful and excited. I said, where was it? And she goes, huh? Well, it was hiding in the shadows between the lights. And she says, the lights are now touching. So the shadow's gone. And I said, whoa. And then we started talking about how people tend to over-identify their body as me. What if you have a body and your body's totally yours, but what if your body isn't you? What if there's no cell within your body that's the same as it was? What if they've all been replaced millions and millions of times, just like your feet are longer than they were when you were three?\nPatient: Yeah.",

But what if you're not the thinker of your thoughts? What if your brain is the thinker of your thoughts and you are not your brain? Your brain is an organ just like your heart, liver, and lungs. Yours, not you. So now you're not your body. You're not your thoughts. You can't be how you feel because you feel different ways at different times. You can't be a feeling. Oh, well, maybe you are what you do. But what if you're not what you do because when you did this and then that, you didn't stop existing? So you can't be what you do. So the weirder question becomes, if you're not your body, your thoughts, your feelings, or what you do, then what the heck are you? Weird question, okay? So just for our purposes, what we're going to say for today is, what if who you are is what you became aware of as you see that mountain and that river? That in that moment, your awareness was drawn down and into what we think of as the capital S, self, or what certain religions call essence, soul, spirit. What if the light that is you can't be touched by any of that stuff? Right. And that's what I was saying to that woman. I said, you know, you'll never believe it. I went to this dentist. She goes, oh, I don't like the dentist. I go, well, you know, he put my, I sit down in the chair and all of a sudden my head moves down like this. She's like, yeah, but you're at the dentist. I go, well, then what? He takes this big thing above my face and turns this light on. And now it's blinding me. I can't see anything. And she's like, yeah, but you're at the dentist. I go, well, then he took this cold instrument and shoved it inside of me. And she's like, oh my goodness. And you're what? And I went, my mouth, I'm at the dentist. But I said the same thing to her with her brother. I said, when you were little, he really messed with your stuff. And she looked at me and she said he did. And for a long time, that screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings. And then she looked at me and she said, but you know what? And I'm like, what? And she said, he never touched me. He messed with my body. It screwed up my thinking and feeling, but he never touched me. And there's not even a cell of me that's the same. And I went, whoa, isn't that cool? And so notice what happens now as you slightly lower your jaw and you relax your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper and you exhale a little bit longer and you notice more space and you notice that with your eyes open, you can see what's out in front of you. You can see me in the screen. But notice what happens when you close your eyes. You no longer see me or the screen or anything else that's in front of you, but instead you're seeing just the backs of your eyelids. When I see the backs of my eyelids, different hues of colors, dark, bright, go ahead and open your eyes. And as you do realize that you see me out in front of you, you see what's in front of you. Close your eyes again and notice that what you're actually seeing is just the backs of your eyelids. And so a really unusual question and get curious about it. What do you actually see behind you? Because this might surprise you that what you see behind you now is nothing. You see nothing behind you. And I wonder what it might be like to drift in nothing. Because in nothing, everything exists as a potentiality, even though no thing exists. Right? And all we're doing is organizing towards a you, right? who's present, who's clear, who's much more peaceful and lighter and easier on herself, more comfortable in her own skin and more space between her and other people's stuff so there's more freedom for her and how she maneuvers. All of this is happening inside of you now. Bring yourself out of nothing and back into now. And then when you're ready, take a nice big deep breath in. And a big long exhale. Right.

So I'm going to give you a different example and it's going to be about a situation. So when I was 12 years old, I got my own basketball court. Say I was a fortunate kid, I got a basketball court. My dad somehow used to think of my basketball court as his driveway. Sometimes he'd park right in the middle of my basketball court. Now, I knew we had an old car that if you put it in and it would roll down the gradient of the driveway and be out of my court, I'd be able to shoot. Now, I don't know what was going on with my dad that day. But when I went to get out of the car, he was standing there and he was screaming at me at such a high decibel. I couldn't understand what he was doing. He grabbed me and began to punch me multiple times. He punched me so hard that it broke my nose. It's why I've got this lovely bump. Now, there was so much blood, you could literally wring out my shirt. Me being okay, me no longer hurting, no longer angry, no longer resentful over what my dad did to me. Does that in any way, shape or form mean what my dad did to me was okay? Right. I get to be okay now, even though that awful thing wasn't.\nPatient: Yes.",

So it might be the thing happens and I get the feeling, but it doesn't last as long or it doesn't spike as high. Or it might be one of those moments where I'm going through it and as I'm in it, I'd be normally like I, and I'm not feeling all of it. Or I go through the whole experience and I think back about it and be like, hey, normally I would have been all uptight and anxious and I wasn't feeling it. So what I want you to pay attention to is what are you noticing that's changed already in your life because we now have new programming running. Meaning those same experiences, those same triggers, those same reminders, those same things don't cause the same internal response in you. Because once the brain gets that certain things are over, it stops confusing similar as identical. And it sees it as similar, but also different.\nPatient: Yeah.",

So now that we've got a green light, we're going to do a couple processes that start to put your body into the right states for healing. The right states for healing are always states of rest. It's like colds, flus, and surgery. We tell people to do the same thing, which is get rest. Right. And so we've got these really cool tools that neuroscientists discovered by putting fMRI scanners on people's brains. And the first lever, it sounds silly, is to slightly lower the jaw. So not drop like ah, but just a little bit like ah. When you slightly lower your jaw, it stimulates that vagus nerve. That comes out of the brain and connects to the vital organs in the body. As it's being stimulated, it starts to move the body towards more of a parasympathetic response. The second lever is you're going to relax the back of your tongue so it rests at the bottom of your mouth. Your jaw slightly lowers. You relax the back of your tongue. It rests at the bottom of your mouth. When you do this, it begins to satiate the body and it helps to turn down internal dialogue. The third lever is you're going to breathe, but it'll be an intentional breath in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. And then a little bit longer on the way out than how you automatically breathe. So your jaw is slightly lowered. You're resting your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You're breathing now a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out. And you'll notice that as you're attending to your breathing, slower and deeper in, slightly longer on the way out. what do you start noticing happening in your body? Feeling more tense or more calm?\nPatient: More calm.",

They're what we're in for waking state. Conversation, focus, communication, arithmetic, social interaction, all great. But when it elevates, it escalates. It runs at a much higher hertz. It's where all the anxiety, agitation, irritation, fresh, angst, worry, upset, anger live. And what it literally causes, Angelica, is a tunneling or a narrowing of our vision. Make sense? Yeah. We want to be moving your brainwaves down beta into higher end of alpha. alpha brainwaves are correlated with what surfers think of as flow or athletes call being in the zone, alert, aware, relaxed. And what it's highly correlated also with is an expanding of our awareness, so that we notice more with our peripheral vision. So how it works again is you slightly lower your jaw, You relax the back of your tongue so it's resting at the bottom of your mouth. You breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer, right? As you're breathing in this way, you can look out and see me and my nose. You stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers. Stay looking at my nose as my fingers move out beyond the screen so that with the sides of your eyes, you begin to pick up the space more towards the sides of the room. Right.

Because the part of your brain that directs emotions is the same as it is for an animal, any animal. Animals, Angelica, don't have emotions because their brains are concerned about their mood or their affect or their level of esteem or whether they feel lovable or good enough.

So the craziest thing for us to even comprehend sometimes is what if all of the negative emotions we experience, that hurt, that anger, that sadness, that sorrow, that grief, that guilt, that shame, that regret, the remorse, the angst, the upset, the worries, the pains, what if all those emotions are being caused by the same part of our brain? For the same reason, to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. The major error is that many times our brain continues to make us feel bad, trying to get us to solve a problem that we can't freaking solve. Yeah. Which is why we feel bad over and over about the same kinds of things. Yes. Good news, really good news. Many of the things that we still feel bad about are in one of two places. either A, in time periods that no longer exist, or B, in time periods that haven't happened yet.

So one more time, go ahead and slightly lower your jaw, relax your tongue, breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out. Notice that as you're breathing in this way, you can see me and my nose, my fingers, they go out. You notice more space. As you notice more space, close your eyes. With your eyes closed, imagine floating up and out of your body, beyond the ceiling and the roof, you're way, way, way up above it all in the sky. Everything is underneath and below you. You're above, you're over it, free to soar through the expanse of the sky in every direction. Big, wide, arching turns and curves, you soar, you fly, you glide. to be becoming even more of who you really are, beginning to lighten up on you. And because your unconscious knows more than you do and has been listening to the conversations we've been having, your unconscious knows which moments would be useful to bring to your awareness and in which order. your unconscious is gonna travel back down the timeline and begin to pluck those moments and experiences and then narrow and pinpoint a particular moment so that as you bring your awareness back down and into your body, your unconscious brings that moment to your awareness so that as you take a nice, big, deep breath in, You can exhale and open your eyes. And what moment comes to mind? Huh, that one. Yeah, isn't that interesting? That one happened like how long ago? You might have been how old?\nPatient: I may have been eight.",

You're going to see my nose. You're going to stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers.

And there's space behind you towards the TV and there's space underneath you. Yeah. So the other parts of your brain that are totally interested in working in the ways that are best for you have access to information that as things open up, we can transform how you've been feeling. So that as you connect more to the space, it's not just space in physical distance, it's space in emotional freedom. Because the problem in the interactions with that guy is that you haven't felt free to be okay in you. There's been that tug of war, I want, I don't, I wish, that. And so we're working towards the you who's free who's clear, who's distanced both physically and emotionally, and is experiencing herself as being much more calm. Right. Much more present. Happier. Feeling good in the moment, both about what she's doing, glad as she thinks back about it and having done it in this way. Got it? Yeah. So one more time, slightly lower your jaw. Relax the back of your tongue. It rests at the bottom of your mouth. Breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out. Continue to breathe in this way as you see my nose and my fingers. They go all the way out. You begin to pick up more of the space towards the sides. you notice the space between the screens, beyond the screen, underneath you, behind you, above your head, and begin to realize the space actually expands and goes beyond the room. That it goes really to outer space and beyond. That's a lot of space. And with your eyes closed, imagine floating up and out of your body, beyond the ceiling, beyond the roof, so that you rise way up above it all in the sky. You're having what we like to call a bird's eye view, meaning from up above, you're seeing everything as being underneath and below you, because you are above and over it all. Not just a bird that's perched, a bird that's soaring, flying and gliding through the expanse of the sky, moving in any direction it wants. Big wide arching turns and curves, it soars, it flies, it glides, moves, it's free. That's right, you're becoming more freed up to be much more okay. Bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you. As you do, take a nice, slow, and big, deep breath in. And now exhale. And open your eyes. Right.

Like you were loving you. Yeah. Do you follow me with that? That's what we want to get connected. Yes. Make sense? So what's going to happen is one more time, slightly lower your jaw. Relax the back of your tongue. Begin to breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out. Notice how much easier it is to become aware of the space. And that as you do, your body becomes more settled and your mind gets a little bit quiet. Go ahead and close your eyes and imagine floating up above and beyond. So from that lens way above, you're over all that. You're free to be much more okay in you. Right. Things are beginning to lighten up so that I'm seeing that clearly. And with distance, it becomes smaller and less significant. That's right. All of these things are beginning to integrate in the deeper parts of your mind. And because your unconscious is listening to everything we're talking about and knows how to heal you from the inside out, Every cut you've ever had, any broken bone, anything that your body is healing is always from the inside out. So your unconscious has direct access to the control panels. You don't even have to know which moments would be useful to unplug, whether they have to do with him or other things, because your unconscious knows. And so as you slowly begin to bring your awareness back down and into your body, simultaneously, your unconscious is going to travel back down the timeline of experiences that happened that created the faulty programming that's had me hooked in ways that I don't want to be hooked. And so as your awareness moves back into your body and your unconscious travels back and selects a moment, Good long exhale. And open your eyes. And a moment will come to mind for us to unplug. That's right. I know, isn't that weird? What's the experience that just came to mind? It happened when?\nPatient: It happened like one of the first times we saw it.",
