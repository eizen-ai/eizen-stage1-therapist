And so we've got really cool levers that are designed to put the body at rest. First lever, super silly. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. So not a complete drop like, ah, but just a little bit like, and when you slightly lower your jaw, it stimulates the vagus nerve and starts to put the body into more of a resting state, right? The second lever is you're going to relax the back of your tongue so that your tongue rests at the bottom of your mouth. So it's like this. Right. Third, you're going to intentionally breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale and then a little bit longer on the exhale. So your jaw is slightly lowered. You're relaxing your tongue so it rests at the bottom of your mouth. You now begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer, right? And as you're beginning to intentionally breathe in this way, just check inside your body. How's your body feeling now? Like more tense or more calm? It's feeling more calm, right?",

      "doctor_input": "Yeah, to be both in nothing and feeling free. Right. And that's where we're headed as a you who's free. And just a little bit of a recap, we all recognize, and I'm going to say it in a little bit of a different way than the last time, but let's just say because of things that you've gone through throughout your life, there have been bad programming that got installed in you. Programming that made you more self-conscious. Programming that made you more question yourself. Programming that would have past things pop up or make you feel bad or that over concern about others and making sure I've got to do everything to make sure, right? What we're going to say is that there's been bad programming along the line that got installed. Does that make sense? And the bad programming got installed because you went through crappy stuff, right? And our brain develops in such a way that it learns how to survive something But how I learned how to survive it at four or eight or 12 or 16 may be different than now. So it's not that we want to get rid of any of the stuff that had you survive. We just want to expand the options that are available because we want those for when those situations, if they were to arise, arise so that we have it. But in other situations, they're not as effective. You being constantly worried about what and how all those people are going to feel, that's not helpful. At other times, a way that that operated worked really well because it was what I needed to survive. Second part is we understand that physical injuries heal and they heal over time. So a broken arm or a broken foot over time, With the right cast or whatever you put on it, it will heal, go through rehab, and then it's better. We also get that emotional wounds tend to not heal. No matter how much I talk about it, no matter how far I get away from it, it still seems to be there. Even though I know that it's over, even though I know it's done, it doesn't feel that way. And so the reason it doesn't feel that way is that when I went through those experiences, my emotional brain short-circuited. It got stuck on. Meaning when that happened, it froze it and doesn't know it ever ended. So there's a part of your nervous system, there's a part of your emotional brain that has never updated. So with any of the bad, awful experiences that you've gone through, all those ones that you try to never think about because whenever you do, you feel yucky, right? Those are experiences that at a different level are still on in you. So the goal of what we're doing is we want to change the relationship that stuff so the coding changes from happening to data about something that happened yeah makes sense yes right and that's what we want to do because what got tied into all negative experiences is the additional meaning that it meant something about me at a worth lovability identity level So when I was a little child and my dad left, I was two and he was no longer in the picture, I didn't have the processing skills that I do now. I know as an adult now that my dad wasn't, well, he was screwed up in some ways. And that him not being around wasn't about me or my lovability or whether he loved me or not. However, when I was a little child, it really felt that way to me. Because as a little child, it's my world and I've learned good happens when I'm good. Bad only happens if I'm bad. So, of course, my dad not being around must have had something to do with my lovability. Right? And even though I know that now as an adult, I don't know that where I'm emotional. Make sense?",

But what if you're not the thinker of your thoughts? What if your brain is the thinker of your thoughts and you are not your brain? Your brain is an organ just like your heart, liver, and lungs. Yours, not you. So now you're not your body. You're not your thoughts. You can't be how you feel because you feel different ways at different times. You can't be a feeling. Oh, well, maybe you are what you do. But what if you're not what you do because when you did this and then that, you didn't stop existing? So you can't be what you do. So the weirder question becomes, if you're not your body, your thoughts, your feelings, or what you do, then what the heck are you? Weird question, okay? So just for our purposes, what we're going to say for today is, what if who you are is what you became aware of as you see that mountain and that river? That in that moment, your awareness was drawn down and into what we think of as the capital S, self, or what certain religions call essence, soul, spirit. What if the light that is you can't be touched by any of that stuff? Right. And that's what I was saying to that woman. I said, you know, you'll never believe it. I went to this dentist. She goes, oh, I don't like the dentist. I go, well, you know, he put my, I sit down in the chair and all of a sudden my head moves down like this. She's like, yeah, but you're at the dentist. I go, well, then what? He takes this big thing above my face and turns this light on. And now it's blinding me. I can't see anything. And she's like, yeah, but you're at the dentist. I go, well, then he took this cold instrument and shoved it inside of me. And she's like, oh my goodness. And you're what? And I went, my mouth, I'm at the dentist. But I said the same thing to her with her brother. I said, when you were little, he really messed with your stuff. And she looked at me and she said he did. And for a long time, that screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings. And then she looked at me and she said, but you know what? And I'm like, what? And she said, he never touched me. He messed with my body. It screwed up my thinking and feeling, but he never touched me. And there's not even a cell of me that's the same. And I went, whoa, isn't that cool? And so notice what happens now as you slightly lower your jaw and you relax your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper and you exhale a little bit longer and you notice more space and you notice that with your eyes open, you can see what's out in front of you. You can see me in the screen. But notice what happens when you close your eyes. You no longer see me or the screen or anything else that's in front of you, but instead you're seeing just the backs of your eyelids. When I see the backs of my eyelids, different hues of colors, dark, bright, go ahead and open your eyes. And as you do realize that you see me out in front of you, you see what's in front of you. Close your eyes again and notice that what you're actually seeing is just the backs of your eyelids. And so a really unusual question and get curious about it. What do you actually see behind you? Because this might surprise you that what you see behind you now is nothing. You see nothing behind you. And I wonder what it might be like to drift in nothing. Because in nothing, everything exists as a potentiality, even though no thing exists. Right? And all we're doing is organizing towards a you, right? who's present, who's clear, who's much more peaceful and lighter and easier on herself, more comfortable in her own skin and more space between her and other people's stuff so there's more freedom for her and how she maneuvers. All of this is happening inside of you now. Bring yourself out of nothing and back into now. And then when you're ready, take a nice big deep breath in. And a big long exhale. Right. And open your eyes. Yeah. And again, just check how's your body feeling now. Yeah, what do you notice? How's your body feeling now?",

So I'm going to give you a different example and it's going to be about a situation. So when I was 12 years old, I got my own basketball court. Say I was a fortunate kid, I got a basketball court. My dad somehow used to think of my basketball court as his driveway. Sometimes he'd park right in the middle of my basketball court. Now, I knew we had an old car that if you put it in and it would roll down the gradient of the driveway and be out of my court, I'd be able to shoot. Now, I don't know what was going on with my dad that day. But when I went to get out of the car, he was standing there and he was screaming at me at such a high decibel.
