So now that we've got a green light, we're going to do a couple processes that start to put your body into the right states for healing. The right states for healing are always states of rest. It's like colds, flus, and surgery. We tell people to do the same thing, which is get rest. Right. And so we've got these really cool tools that neuroscientists discovered by putting fMRI scanners on people's brains. And the first lever, it sounds silly, is to slightly lower the jaw. So not drop like ah, but just a little bit like ah. When you slightly lower your jaw, it stimulates that vagus nerve. That comes out of the brain and connects to the vital organs in the body. As it's being stimulated, it starts to move the body towards more of a parasympathetic response. The second lever is you're going to relax the back of your tongue so it rests at the bottom of your mouth. Your jaw slightly lowers. You relax the back of your tongue. It rests at the bottom of your mouth. When you do this, it begins to satiate the body and it helps to turn down internal dialogue. The third lever is you're going to breathe, but it'll be an intentional breath in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. And then a little bit longer on the way out than how you automatically breathe. So your jaw is slightly lowered. You're resting your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You're breathing now a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out.
