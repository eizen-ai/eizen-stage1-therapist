Notice that you're causing your breath to happen now. And that as you do, you're breathing differently than you do when you're not consciously breathing. Right. And as you're noticing your breath right now, just check inside your body. How's your body starting to feel now? Like more tense or more calm? Calm. It is more calm, right? So we're moving your brain waves down into more alpha waves. Low states, alert, aware, relaxed. The next thing we want to do is you're going to see me in the screen in front of you. You're going to see my nose. You're going to stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers. Continue to breathe in that slightly slower and deeper way with your jaw slightly lowered and relaxing your tongue. As you see my nose and my fingers, they're going to start moving out of the range of the screen all the way out.

And notice what's starting to happen in your body as you're becoming more aware of the space. Mm-hmm. How's your body feeling now? It's relaxed. It is, isn't it? Yeah. It's a little freaky.
