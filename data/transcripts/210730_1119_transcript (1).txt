[00:00] A: Today is the 30th of July. We got one more day left in July, Tammy. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that that recording may be made available if what we do is, you know, truly useful and transformative and life changing for you in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:23] B: Yes.
[00:27] A: Okay, cool. Yeah. So you said lots has changed.
[00:35] B: Yes, a lot have changed.
[00:37] A: So what's changed? Hopefully for the better.
[00:40] B: Well, of course.
[00:41] A: Oh, good.
[00:42] B: Yeah, I'm a lot calmer. I'm not as stressed out anymore.
[00:52] A: Okay. How did that change?
[00:57] B: I don't know. Just different situations. Like, I'm not at the program anymore. I'm at home now.
[01:07] A: Okay. So that's better.
[01:08] B: It's not so stressful, you know, I have a good job now. I just got things going for myself. That's in a positive way.
[01:21] A: Cool. So you feel good that, A, you're out of program, B, you're back home, C, you're working, and it seems to be a good job, and things seem to be moving in a. In a good, positive direction. So that actually has. You feel a lot less tense, stressed, anxious.
[01:39] B: Yeah.
[01:40] A: Cool. Okay. So that's good. Awesome. What else would be useful for me to know what else has been changing or, you know, because lots has changed?
[02:02] B: I don't know.
[02:04] A: Me neither.
[02:06] B: I don't know.
[02:10] A: Yeah, I don't know either. It's hard to know, right?
[02:16] B: Yeah.
[02:16] A: Yeah.
[02:30] B: I guess. The other positive thing is I graduate probation. And the other program that I'm in in two weeks.
[02:43] A: What does that change for you when you graduate from probation?
[02:48] B: Well, there's no more drug testing, no more curfew, no more answering to the cops. I mean, there's a lot of. It's more freedom. I'm back to a normal life.
[03:05] A: Cool.
[03:06] B: Without paper. I mean, I don't know.
[03:12] A: That's way better then.
[03:14] B: Yeah.
[03:15] A: Yeah.
[03:16] B: Like, I can do what I want to do and not worry about my probation officer or a cop messing with me because I'm on probation.
[03:26] A: Hmm. Did that used to happen?
[03:29] B: No. I mean, it doesn't happen. I'm just saying.
[03:33] A: That's so good. Well, I don't have to worry about it. Did it happen? No, it didn't happen, but I worried about it happening, that it could.
[03:39] B: Yeah. Every time I leave the house, I feel like, you know, I have to worry about, what if the cop pulls me over? Or what if a cop does this or what? If a cop does that, one way or another, it's gonna cause a violation of probation because it's interaction with the law enforcement, which will put me back in jail.
[03:57] A: Ouch.
[03:58] B: Yeah. So that's why I'm excited to get off probation. I don't have to worry about if my boyfriend and I are driving down the road and just for some random reason, the cop wants to stop us. I don't have to worry about getting violated, going to jail.
[04:12] A: Yeah.
[04:13] B: I mean, it's just a lot of things that come with being on probation.
[04:17] A: How long have you been.
[04:24] B: A year.
[04:26] A: Okay, so for a while.
[04:28] B: Yeah.
[04:28] A: Yeah. What got you to be on probation?
[04:38] B: Well, I took probation instead of doing three years, four years in prison.
[04:43] A: Probably a better decision.
[04:45] B: Yeah. It came with going into two different programs.
[04:50] A: Okay.
[04:50] B: You know, I don't know. It was just a better. I felt it was a better and more reasonable. It was reasonable for me because I didn't want to go to prison, and I knew I could do it. Yeah, well, I didn't know I could do it. I battled it, but I did it.
[05:18] A: Yeah. It looked as a federal alternative than prison.
[05:22] B: Well, yeah. I've never been to prison, and I know what they do in prison, and I didn't want to be a part of it.
[05:28] A: Yeah. So never been to prison, but have been to jail plenty of times, so good. Okay. So was some of this part of Tyla?
[05:39] B: All of it's part of Tyla.
[05:42] A: So good.
[05:45] B: All of it.
[05:46] A: Cool. Okay. That's how you got connected to begin with. With Salah.
[05:51] B: Yeah.
[05:52] A: Is through that when they said, hey, we've got this thing called Tyla. You go, what the hell is that?
[05:58] B: No, I asked for Tyla.
[06:01] A: You did? How did you know about it?
[06:03] B: One of the girls that was in jail with me knew about it, and she told me that I should sign up for it instead of just giving up and going to prison. She said, sign up for it and see if they'll take you. Well, at first they denied me, and then they came back and accepted me because I have a sales charge.
[06:23] A: What does it. Oh, sales mean. I got it.
[06:25] B: Drug charge sales. Not like, yeah, okay, I was selling drugs.
[06:30] A: Yes. I got that now.
[06:32] B: But I wasn't selling drugs. It was. I was a third party. Like, the person went through me to get to the drug dealer.
[06:40] A: Got it. You had the connection I had.
[06:43] B: Yeah.
[06:43] A: So I just weren't profiting from it.
[06:45] B: Right. But I ended up catching the heat for it.
[06:49] A: Ouch.
[06:49] B: So that was gonna put me in prison for Three and a half years, four years. And I didn't want to go to prison, so the girl told me about Tyler Corps, and I signed up for it. She did, too. But she got denied. And I got denied. Then they turned around and accepted me.
[07:06] A: Okay.
[07:07] B: So there's where my journey began.
[07:09] A: Got it. So what were the two different programs? One being what?
[07:14] B: Well, I'm still in Tylacort.
[07:16] A: Okay.
[07:16] B: Tyler Court is Salah. Yeah, it is Sayla. But I had to do the Harvest House, too.
[07:23] A: Got it. That's why you were staying somewhere other than home. Got it. Now you're back home. So Harvest House has. You've completed the.
[07:32] B: Yeah, I've completed that. And then I did that in June, and then I came, and then I got out, went home. Now I graduate tyler court on the 9th of August. Which is in two weeks.
[07:46] A: Yeah.
[07:47] B: Yeah.
[07:48] A: Well, that's exciting. And then what's next?
[07:51] B: Nothing. Nothing's next. I move on with my life.
[07:57] A: Yeah. So what's that look like?
[07:59] B: I don't know yet.
[07:59] A: Oh, well, maybe you want to start thinking, because it's coming up in two weeks.
[08:06] B: Not really there yet. I'm still.
[08:09] A: But, like, you know, I mean, if it's coming up, you might want to start thinking about, like, how do I want my life to go?
[08:13] B: Well, I take my GED test. I started doing ged.
[08:18] A: Nice.
[08:19] B: I take the language arts test next week.
[08:23] A: Okay.
[08:24] B: And I'm gonna continue working until I'm done with all four subjects. But I'm taking the first subject on the 4th of next week. The first one is language arts. And then I'm gonna move to social studies or science. Math will be last because it's the best. It's the hardest for you.
[08:42] A: Me, too. Any more than that's why I'm in this profession and not accounting.
[08:48] B: Yeah. I'm not good with numbers either, but okay.
[08:54] A: So that's in process.
[08:56] B: Yeah.
[08:57] A: That's cool. Good job.
[08:59] B: I mean, I'm gonna continue to work. I'm not gonna stop working because I'm graduating everything and be like, oh, hey, whatever. I'm gonna keep working.
[09:08] A: Yeah.
[09:09] B: As far as that. I mean, that's about all I have planned out.
[09:13] A: Okay.
[09:18] B: Yeah.
[09:18] A: I don't know what else.
[09:22] B: Not yet, huh?
[09:23] A: We have to wait. You're so good. We have to wait before we can start thinking about, like, what do we want? What's next?
[09:35] B: No, I'm thinking about it, but I'm just waiting for everything to fall in place. I mean, everything will come together eventually. It's not like I have to fight for it. It'll all fall in place slowly but surely. That's how I want it.
[09:57] A: Isn't that a weird saying?
[09:58] B: Yeah, but that's how I want it. I don't want it moving fast because then I get confused, overwhelmed, and I blow up.
[10:10] A: Not like a puffer fish or not like a. Yeah, well, you might get really agitated and yell and scream. You don't actually get overwhelmed.
[10:22] B: When I get overwhelmed, I end up doing stupid things. Oh, like drugs?
[10:28] A: Oh, yeah.
[10:29] B: So I'm trying.
[10:31] A: We don't want to do that no more.
[10:32] B: Exactly. So I'm trying not to move at a fast pace. I want to take it slow, day by day. Like, I want to live in the moment.
[10:40] A: Right.
[10:41] B: Move forward with my life that way.
[10:43] A: Okay. Or to be up above all of it so that it's no longer overwhelming you.
[10:49] B: Well, yeah, that's what I mean. I want to control it. I want to be able to ease myself into that situation.
[10:58] A: Okay.
[10:58] B: Yeah. So I'm not ready to, like, oh, this is what I'm gonna do, and then it not happen. So I don't know.
[11:04] A: Right. We don't want to have a high, fast moving expectation. Right. Feel overwhelmed and then get discouraged that I'm not, and then do something that later on I go, fuck. I wish I hadn't done that.
[11:17] B: Yeah.
[11:18] A: Okay.
[11:18] B: Pretty much.
[11:21] A: Cool. So the guy. Boyfriend, is he someone you live with now?
[11:26] B: I've been. I've been with him for three years now.
[11:29] A: But you weren't while you had har. Well, you were with him, but not living with him while you were at harvest.
[11:33] B: Right, because I had to live at the harvest, but I was still living with him because either way, I was over there every day.
[11:40] A: Got it. Stuff was still there, things like that.
[11:42] B: Oh, yeah. So I didn't move out. I just relocated for a little bit.
[11:46] A: Got it.
[11:47] B: Okay.
[11:47] A: That makes sense.
[11:50] B: Yeah. That was still my mailing address and everything when I was at the harvest.
[11:55] A: Okay.
[11:56] B: I didn't have anything coming to the harvest house.
[11:58] A: Yes. Yeah.
[11:59] B: No need to.
[12:00] A: So he's on board with what you're up to, right?
[12:06] B: Yeah, he knows.
[12:08] A: Graduating, looking at. Okay. I'm in the process of getting the ged. Right. I'm going to take it chunk by chunk by chunk. And he's on board with all that stuff?
[12:19] B: Of course.
[12:20] A: Yeah. And you're not so sure once I get done with that. The what? After that.
[12:26] B: Right. Because I don't want to be like. I don't want to have it all, like, bundled up in My head that. Oh, I'm gonna grab. I'm gonna come. I'm gonna pass the ged, and I'm gonna start doing this and start doing that. Because I do want to go back to school.
[12:40] A: Oh, okay.
[12:41] B: But I don't want to set that as a goal until I know what I'm doing with my ged. I want to see where I go with it first before I set that higher standard.
[12:55] A: Okay.
[12:55] B: Because then that's going to really depress me if I fail the GED and can't do this, you know?
[13:00] A: Sure.
[13:01] B: So, like, I want to make sure that I just focus on what I'm doing right now versus focusing on this and that.
[13:11] A: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[13:13] B: It's just too much at one time.
[13:15] A: Yeah. Well, useful that you chunked it in a way that is at a manageable chunk.
[13:23] B: Yeah.
[13:24] A: Versus I got all this shit.
[13:26] B: Yeah. No, I can't do that.
[13:28] A: Right. That's. That's too much. And you don't want to set yourself up. That. I've already got this scheduled, that I'm gonna be going to take these, you know, college, what have you, and then I don't get this completely done because then I'll start feeling shitty, and I don't want to feel shitty. Mm. Yeah. Because right now, with the current situation and what's already happened, based on what you've been doing, you're actually starting to feel good about what you're up to and where you're headed and what you're getting accomplished and what's changing and getting off probation, moving out of harvest, and, you know, graduating. Yeah. That's cool. Well, I'm excited for you in that regard.
[14:08] B: Yeah, me too.
[14:09] A: Yeah? Yeah. So given all of that, what do you want our time to do for you, given that we already have things moving in a really good direction. Right. I mean, you're taking right steps, right actions. Things are moving in the right direction. What do you want our time to do for you?
[14:33] B: I don't know. I mean, what's it supposed to do?
[14:38] A: Good question. I have no idea. It can do a lot of different things, so there really isn't a what is it supposed to do? So I'll give it to you in this way. Lots of people come in because they recognize that there are tendencies. Like, one of the things that you've recognized is if things move too fast or I've got too much, I feel overwhelmed. And when I feel overwhelmed, I'm way too stressed out. And then I do something that later on I Wish I hadn't done. And now I fucked up all sorts of shit. I definitely don't want to do that. So one thing that you've determined is if I go slower, then that doesn't set me up to feel overwhelmed. Right. And that's a doable step that you're in charge of because, like, you're having more control of that. However, there are things in life that aren't always under our control.
[15:42] B: Well, of course. I mean, I know that.
[15:46] A: Yes.
[15:46] B: But I can control what is under.
[15:48] A: My control, and you're doing that. So I don't need to do anything about the stuff that's already under your control that you're controlling at the rate that you're going at it to set it up so that you continue to feel good about what you're up to and where you're headed. Nothing we need to do about that. However, as we talked about, there are other things that are out of the control. And that what people recognize is that there are tendencies for them to, in those situations, still react in ways that they don't want to. Maybe they feel too agitated, angry, frustrated, irritated, annoyed, like that. They get triggered too quickly. Maybe it's that they're more worried, anxious, nervous, racy thought, uneasiness in situations, difficulty sleeping, panicky stuff. They don't want that. Right. Some people go, well, life is going okay now, and I don't foresee awful stuff. But I know that there's been shit that I've gone through that my coping mechanism is to never think about that shit. Because whenever I do, there's still a lot of distress attached to it. Bad feelings, guilt, shame, anger, resentment, pain. And they'd like to not have those feelings. Like, it'd be useful to be free from that versus what I've learned how to do is just avoid thinking about it. Because what we know with those kinds of situations is even if I avoid thinking about it, sometimes I think about it when I don't want to, or sometimes life just has a tendency to have it flash to me or something reminds me of it, or what have you. And now I'm in it. Not because I chose to, but like it. I got triggered, right? Some people go, for me, I'm like, down. I'm depressed, I'm lethargic. I used to have a lot more energy, and I don't. Some people go, you know what? I have things that I want to be doing, and I don't know how come I'm not already engaged in doing it. Right? One of the things you talked about is like, okay, so I have a goal, so to speak, of, you know, releasing weight. Releasing it is different than losing it. Because whenever we lose something, don't we try to go find it again? No, really, like, if I lost my keys, aren't I gonna go look for them?
[18:12] B: Well, that's different. I mean, losing weight and losing your keys are two different things.
[18:17] A: Except it's the same word. And see what our brain sets up? Like, if I catch a fish and I release the fish back into the water, am I trying to catch that fish again? No. So I kind of like to think of it more of like it's a weight release because I don't need it anymore versus I'm losing it. Because how often do people do a yo yo thing? Oh, look, I've lost some. Oh, no, I've gained some. Oh, no, I've lost some. Oh, no, I've gained some. Oh, no. Right. Like, there's a yo yo thing that happens with what we do. We'd like that way of eating healthy, nutritious, reducing the amount that's brought in, adding some physical activity. Those things to be done for you with more ease. Right? Because right now you find yourself, well, there's the thought that it would be good to. Yet I'm not finding myself doing it, and I'm not quite sure why I'm not finding myself doing it, but I'm not finding myself doing it. So, like, those are things that people go, you know what? I'd like that stuff to be better when it's the things that are already under my control. And I look back at where I was and where I am now. I'm actually, like, looking going, shit, man, I've done some really cool stuff here. Like, I've actually made really good, positive improvements in my life, and that's cool. And I'm happy with what I've already done. And I'm also happy in those arenas that are under my control with how I'm moving forward. I'm not taking all of it at once. I'm not going way too far out. I'm taking, you know, as you put it, day by day, more of a slower pace towards where I want to go. That stuff's all fine. So, like I said, we don't have to do anything with you around that. What we want to do are in other areas that you're not so under control, where you might get triggered not because you wanted to, but because shit happened in life and I got triggered by it or things that have happened that although they're over and I've learned ways to not think about them, they're still underneath the surface. Maybe they affect things like esteem or how I feel about me or. Or maybe it's in arenas where I'm not doing things that I think would be useful for me to do, and I'm not so sure how come I'm not fully engaged in that. Right. That's kind of the thing that surfaces of, hey, what could we do that would be useful for Tammy? Those are my thought. So given that whole dynamic that I just laid out, what kind of comes to the tip top for you in terms of what we would. So good, Tammy. I'm on it. You're like, I don't know. Why am I even here at home? Do you know? What, is it gone? Do I get it? Can I leave yet? I don't talk about feelings, first of all, and not to a damn stranger, second of all.
[21:19] B: I don't know.
[21:24] A: Yeah.
[21:25] B: Oh, my Lord.
[21:28] A: Well, that's a start. Oh, my Lord. And then the big breath. That's what I meant. That was a start. Because again, you didn't consciously decide to have that long exhale, but your body did. And part of what we want to do is we want to set up the automatic part of your brain, part that directs automatic functions, to work naturally more in the way that you want it to, so that it's even easier for you to think, act, react, feel in response to stuff more of the way you want to.
[22:06] B: I mean, I've been doing really good about it. Like, I don't. I don't get mad easily anymore. I really don't know what to say.
[22:19] A: Like, oh, Lord.
[22:26] B: I mean, I still have those visions.
[22:29] A: It would be useful to have that stop.
[22:32] B: Well, yeah, because it's uncomfortable.
[22:37] A: Okay, we can do that.
[22:42] B: Okay.
[22:43] A: Where do you see them? Just, like in your mind's eye, where do you see them? Are they. Look over here. Are they down here? Are they up here? Are they over there?
[22:52] B: Right here?
[22:53] A: They're that close. Oh. Okay. If the visions were further away, like out there, like beyond the door, how much better would it be?
[23:02] B: Way better.
[23:02] A: It would be way better. Okay, cool.
[23:05] B: Like, it's right there. Like, I close my eyes and there it is. Like, I can't. And then I toss and turn.
[23:14] A: And so that happens at night.
[23:17] B: It happens throughout the whole time, the whole day. Like, I'll try, like when I lay down, because I'm off for the next two days, so I like to take naps. And isn't that awesome. Yeah. I normally sleep all day, you know, just because I can. And I'll lay there tossing and turning and, like, these things would just pop up and it's crazy. Like, I can't.
[23:47] A: And they tend to be visions of things that you've gone through.
[23:50] B: No, they're tend to be visions of things that I never. I mean, my boyfriend has never put his hands on me. And, you know, from.
[24:02] A: Well, at least in that way. I mean, his hands might have been on you, but that might have been enjoyable. I mean, he is my boyfriend, but not in that way. Has he been physically violent towards me? He has put his hands on. And some of that has felt good, but we're not talking about that. Right.
[24:24] B: But. Oh, Lord.
[24:30] A: See, there it is again.
[24:31] B: So good. I love it.
[24:34] A: Um.
[24:39] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[24:43] A: So sometimes there are visions of violence happening to you.
[24:46] B: Yeah.
[24:47] A: Okay. Even though he hasn't been violent towards.
[24:51] B: You, he's not a violent person. There's not a violent bone in his body. And I mean, hell, he doesn't even raise his voice, let alone raise a hand toward anybody.
[25:07] A: Like.
[25:10] B: I mean.
[25:15] A: So good news that the content isn't about him.
[25:18] B: It is about him.
[25:19] A: Oh, it is?
[25:22] B: Yeah. It's like visions of him doing what other people have done to me.
[25:29] A: That's what I'm talking about.
[25:31] B: But he's never done any of that.
[25:33] A: Notice how the content isn't actually about him, even if you're seeing it being him. Right. You're having visions of him doing things that other people have done, even though, you know he doesn't have a violent bone in his body. He doesn't raise his voice. He's not raising his hand. Right. So what's getting confused when you're having those visions that are so close? And the reason, Tammy, that there's still discomfort about some of the things that you've gone through primarily, is because emotionally, your brain doesn't distinguish the difference between the memory of those experiences and the experiences. So think of it as although, you know, you're out of it and that stuff's over and you're with a different guy, part of your brain has never gotten the good news. We would like to get the good news in so that all of you knows it.
[26:44] B: Yeah. Because it's very.
[26:45] A: It's.
[26:55] B: It's frustrating because, like, I'll literally just be. He. He works from home, so he'll be at his desk, which is in our satellite room, our bedroom, in our front room all connect to that one room.
[27:15] A: Got it.
[27:15] B: And we have sliding glass doors and they stay open unless he has a phone call.
[27:19] A: Sure. Right.
[27:20] B: And, you know, he'll be sitting in there just typing away at his computer, you know, doing his thing. And I'll be sitting in the room either reading or, you know, maybe watching a movie or something. And just like. Or I'll just be laying there trying to fall asleep. And, like, just imagining him getting up for no reason, coming in there and just started slapping me and beating me and stuff like that. It scares me at the same time because, like, I know him, but at the same time, I really don't know him.
[28:01] A: Like, I mean, you've only been with him for three years.
[28:04] B: Well, no, I mean, like, you know your wife, but deep down inside you really don't know your wife, or she really doesn't know you because technically you can be the person that you want her to see, but deep down inside, you could be this other person that you don't want her to see that she hasn't seen. So she really doesn't know you. You know what I mean? Like, you can know a person but not really know them. Just like family, your mom, your dad, you can really know them. But deep down inside, there's a whole nother figure that they have maybe that you don't know about that they hide from you. Like, it's weird. And I just feel like I. I do know him.
[28:52] A: But there could be this deep dark under other him that I don't know. That could be the violent him that I haven't experienced. Even though there have been times that we've had disagreements. Oh, we've had bad disagreements and bad disagreements. And even though we've had those bad disagreements, he hasn't been physical. There could be a time when he might. And normally that would happen if somebody's typing on the computer for no particular reason, come over and smash the person on the couch.
[29:18] B: I mean, I've had it happen.
[29:20] A: That's why it shows up in your mind. It just hasn't happened with him.
[29:27] B: Right, right, right.
[29:29] A: Because he's not that. But I'll give you a different example. Think of this guy whose uncle molested him, like when he was eight. Okay? He's now 28 and he's got a girlfriend, and she's interested in being intimate, and he's interested in being intimate with her. And so they're making out and it's feeling really good. And there's kissing and there's touching, and he might have touched a little bit of her body, and all of a sudden she starts taking your hand up his inner thigh and he's like this. And now he's thinking to himself, what the fuck is wrong with me? My girl, who I'm totally into wanting to be sexual with is touching me in a way that's supposed to feel good. But I thought, yeah, why the hell did that happen to him? Well, is there any similarity to his uncle when he was 8? Yeah, but hand on leg, even though this is a woman's hand and it's something I'm interested in. When trauma is active, anything that's similar gets confused, is same. Does that make sense? Right. In part of your brain, in bringing that to your awareness is in thinking that if it's there, you'll be more prepared if it were to happen.
[30:49] B: Yeah.
[30:53] A: But me knowing what I would do if the plane were to crash.
[30:58] B: Doesn'T necessarily mean I'll do it.
[31:02] A: A, doesn't necessarily mean I'll do it, B, doesn't mean that I'll be even more prepared.
[31:06] B: Right.
[31:07] A: Or remember to do it when that. It's all that forecasting of what could or what might. But the forecasting is coming based on what I did go through. Right. Because there probably were certain other people that you didn't think had that violence tendency that actually did. Mm, right. So we want the impact that those things have had, clearly. So. So it's not running in you anymore so that you stop having those kinds of visions that would be useful. Anything else come to mind that we'd want our time to do because that we absolutely can get taken care of?
[31:44] B: No, I think that's pretty much what it boils down to because it's just, it's a lot of things that I go through with that. And you know, I mean, it's not all just about him. You know, there's people invading on the house, breaking in, attacking, you know, it's just.
[32:11] A: You have this zombie apocalypse running in your mind.
[32:17] B: Yeah, yeah, well. Cause I'm home a lot at night and you know, you hear stories about people breaking into homes and stuff and.
[32:27] A: It'S like not so often when they know that people are home at night.
[32:32] B: There's been a lot of break ins with people killing the people that were.
[32:36] A: Home, not because they thought they were home. See more frequently when somebody breaks into a house, they're trying to do it when somebody's not there. I mean, out of the world of home invasions.
[32:51] B: Well, I mean if you go past my house, you'll be like, oh, nobody's there. Because when I'm home by myself, there's Only one light on in the house. I don't go out front. I don't go out back. I stay in the house. I stay in my room and my bedroom. Lights off. All the lights are off but one light, and that's over the stove, you know, Because I don't want. It's just. I don't know. It's just a fear that I have of being home by myself.
[33:20] A: Yeah. Like. I don't know. Where's he.
[33:26] B: He goes running. He's athletic. He's a runner, so he runs the bridge. Or he runs Legacy Trail at night on Sundays or sometimes on Saturdays, he goes down to Naples to see his uncle.
[33:44] A: Okay.
[33:46] B: I mean, his uncle's 97 years old, and he's dying, so. Yeah, he goes down there to see him.
[33:52] A: Yeah. That's why.
[33:55] B: I mean.
[33:56] A: Yeah.
[33:56] B: It's like.
[33:57] A: So it's not all night that you're home alone?
[34:00] B: I'm home from 2 to 10 by myself. On the days he goes to Naples, sure. Five to maybe nine, maybe 10, depending on what's going on.
[34:12] A: Sure.
[34:13] B: When he runs, sure. But no, normally not. I'm at home all. All night, like, overnight? No.
[34:21] A: Yeah. Yeah. But we'd like you to have more comfort in the times that you actually are at home by yourself. That would be useful, too. Okay. Anything else or other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know? Mm.
[34:41] B: Mm. Oh, I have car.
[34:48] A: So good. I love it. Like. Oh, yeah. No, there's this other big fucking thing.
[34:55] B: I have this. It's weird. Like, hear a tire squeal, whether it's behind us, in front of us, beside us. It doesn't matter. I'll freak out. I have.
[35:12] A: What do you mean, you get really.
[35:14] B: I have PTSD because I've been in multiple wrecks, and I've been in almost multiple wrecks.
[35:26] A: Like, close calls.
[35:30] B: Really close calls. Like, flashing of the life close calls. So I have severe ptsd. Just one little. Like, he steps on the brake real hard, or, like, if he steps on it hard just enough to, like, jolt the car, it freaks me out kind of thing.
[35:51] A: Okay. Take your breath away. Heart Racy.
[35:56] B: Yeah, I have severe PTSD with that.
[35:59] A: Okay.
[35:59] B: And I really like for that to go away.
[36:02] A: Cool. So we'd like that to settle down so that it's easier for you to be in a car.
[36:06] B: Yeah. Because we've had a couple of close calls yesterday. We. I think it was yesterday before. Yes, yes. No, Wednesday. Because I worked from 6 to 12 or 12 to 6, and we went to his mom's house on Siesta Drive to, you know, check in on the house to make sure, you know, it's not blown up or nothing.
[36:33] A: Right.
[36:33] B: You know, it's still there. No one messes with it. It's not broken into or nothing. And the water and everything's running perfect. You know, we go and make sure and get her mail and stuff. She's in a nursing home. And he asked me what I wanted for dinner, and I told him pizza. So we went over to Clark Road, and as we were pulling out, he's like, oh, we gotta get milk. So we backed up into this street, the side parking thing alley, and went to pull out. And another car came out of nowhere and almost hit his driver side door. And it really freaked me out. Like, I went ballistic.
[37:18] A: Screaming, yelling.
[37:20] B: No, I just. When I. When he slammed on the brakes, I went like this to brace both of us but myself the most. You know what I mean? Like, I don't know, it was just like a. Like a hole. I couldn't breathe.
[37:37] A: Right. Yeah. Take your breath away.
[37:40] B: And then we were going down the road somewhere doing something, and this car just like, out of nowhere showed up. And it also sent me, like. It's just multiple. Just little things set me off.
[37:57] A: Yeah. Yeah. So we'd like that to turn way.
[38:01] B: Down, go to zero.
[38:02] A: Yeah. I remember as a kid when I would be in the car with my mom and she'd have to quickly hit the brakes, she'd put her hand out like that.
[38:09] B: Well, yeah, that's one thing.
[38:10] A: And of course, I always thought to myself, what the hell is her arm gonna do?
[38:14] B: But it does a little.
[38:16] A: I'm not sure that's gonna.
[38:18] B: He does that to me.
[38:19] A: If we're smashing into something, I'm not sure that her arm is gonna be strong enough to stop my body force.
[38:26] B: Well, I mean, it's a thought that counts.
[38:29] A: And the better part is I'm wearing the seatbelt.
[38:32] B: Yeah.
[38:33] A: I'm not going anywhere.
[38:34] B: I mean, arm. The arm. It's just a natural reaction.
[38:39] A: Reaction.
[38:39] B: Yeah, because he does it to me.
[38:41] A: I always thought it was, like, kind of silly because, like, I'm not sure your arm's gonna stop our me from.
[38:46] B: Right. He'll be driving and he'll have to step on the brake. Sometimes when I'm not paying attention, he'll step on the brake.
[38:54] A: Yeah.
[38:54] B: And it'll kind of like send me into a frenzy, but his hand will be over here on, like, comfort you. Yeah.
[39:01] A: Right.
[39:02] B: So, like, he does it to me.
[39:03] A: He's actually a Nice guy.
[39:04] B: He is. He's a really loving that.
[39:07] A: Cool. Good job.
[39:07] B: He's a Pisces.
[39:09] A: Good job.
[39:10] B: Mine and his birthday are the same exact month. Just one day apart from each other.
[39:16] A: All right.
[39:16] B: On the 27th, he's the 28.
[39:19] A: Cool.
[39:19] B: So he's got. He's got a really, really, really, really big heart.
[39:22] A: Like he's a good news. You can't ever forget his.
[39:27] B: I forget his what?
[39:28] A: Birthday.
[39:29] B: I can't forget either one of ours.
[39:31] A: Because it comes right after yours.
[39:32] B: Yeah.
[39:33] A: Yeah.
[39:34] B: Yep.
[39:35] A: Yeah. Okay, so we want to A, turn down that so that your brain is no longer still active with those prior accident stuff. And then it's easier for you to be more relaxed and at ease in the car. B, we want the impact that the prior stuff has had other violence things that have happened to you. We want that cleared and gone so that your brain stops mapping your guy with those experiences so close to your face. And then C, we want to get it so that when you're home by yourself, you have more comfort in being that you're okay.
[40:23] B: Yeah.
[40:24] A: Cool. All right. I can get behind all that. Okay. I'm glad you're here. Okay, so let me explain a few different things. I know some of it I talked about when you were in here the first time, but that was a while ago. So I'm gonna kind of outline it in this way. So we would tend to agree that it's the quick breaking or the loud noise that causes that reaction in you. It's the being home alone that causes that reaction. Right. That. It's the stuff what I went through that makes this feel this way.
[40:59] B: It's not really being home alone. It's like some houses make noises and like it's just like.
[41:10] A: Or all.
[41:10] B: I don't know, the house. 5.
[41:12] A: I'm thinking all houses make noises. Some more than others.
[41:15] B: Yeah, I mean, there.
[41:16] A: But I'm not thinking there's a house out there that doesn't have some weird kind of noise to it.
[41:21] B: Yeah, I mean, I'm used to the noises, of course in this one, but still sometimes like the window blow. Cuz he has like this plasticky thing on our windows and the. At the, at our. On our doors. Yeah, the. The back door has like. Because it's got these windows that you have to crank and they. You know, I don't know what kind of freaking.
[41:49] A: It's an old Florida style.
[41:50] B: It's an old, old.
[41:51] A: Right. I mean, it's an old Florida style. So it was plastic and you could open it up or close it, that kind of thing. Yeah.
[41:57] B: And it's, you know, different. Correct glass. So he has the plastic still in it. Yeah. And you know, when the wind blows it, it ruffles it. And sometimes when I'm not paying attention or that it does because it also ruffles when you open and close that door.
[42:18] A: Got it. Okay. And you know, has a similar sound.
[42:22] B: Yeah. And it's just, just. It's just some things around the house that you know, it, it. Only the noises come every now and then. They don't. Not like an everyday thing.
[42:33] A: Sure.
[42:34] B: So like when I'm home by myself, it's just.
[42:38] A: So it's not an everyday, all the time thing. No, it's at certain circumstances. But add to that that happens sometimes and then add to the other thoughts that are the worry thoughts that like people have home invasions and add to that makes it way more intense.
[42:56] B: Yeah, it does. Because I've been in houses that spend been kicked, doors been kicked in and windows have been buzzed like I've been in. Just so notice I've been there, done that.
[43:08] A: Many of what you find yourself from the past and disturbed with. Yeah. Has to do with what I'm going to call memories of experiences. But the memories are still active.
[43:23] B: Yeah.
[43:24] A: They're not sour, solely read as data about something that happened. Part of the brain, when they happened, froze it and kind of re experiences it as happened. Which is why whenever I encounter something that's similar to past, it causes the angst. Right. In the same way the person whose buddy got shot next to the tank gets a whiff of the diesel and he's flashed back to that. Well, the diesel smell wasn't the issue. What happened to his buddy was. But because they co occurred, they get stuck. Right. So a lot of things for you co occurred and so they're still stuck. And therefore your brain has a tendency to be on a more will call it hyper vigilant and super sensitive mode.
[44:23] B: Yeah.
[44:24] A: Right. Like it's way vigilant and way sensitive. So I'm way quicker to react to it than I would like to be. That's why I'm saying we want to turn down the intensity of all of that. We want to get it unplugged and separated so that my brain can experience what's happening no longer being combined with what did and having the reaction go high. Not to say that there might not be experiences. Like if out of the blue somebody cuts in front of me and we slam our brakes. I might have a. But it doesn't get as high and it doesn't last as long. That's what we'd like to have happen. Right. Because there's still going to be experiences, but we want our emotions to match the experience.
[45:14] B: Yeah.
[45:14] A: And what you've recognized is that there's a tendency for it to be more than and there's a tendency for you to be thinking about bad things based on what used to or did happen to you may be happening even though you know the guy you're with is not any of those other things. Again, we want that same separated because the brain confuses. That's why the gal's hand at the same spot. But it's a woman that I'm interested in, not uncle Yucky. Right. But if the brain doesn't know that that's over, anything that's similar gets confused. Got it. Okay. So when we look through the lens that the circumstances of my life cause the feelings, past, current or future, we have two choices. Try to change it, try to avoid it. Which is pretty much how most of us deal with this stuff in life. If I can't change it, I try to get away from it. But you've learned, and as we've just talked about, there's some stuff I can't change. There's some stuff that I can't fully escape or get away from. There's some stuff that I can't get that bad stuff to have not happened. So we got to come up with something else. What we're gonna do is adjust the way the more automatic part of your brain reacts and responds to stuff. I think I gave you this silly example of the lion approaching the zebra and how we all would say lion makes zebra scared. And of course, I don't disagree. But looking through the alternative lens, we go, wait, no, it's actually when the zebra sees, senses, feels, smells, thinks lion's coming, it's zebra's brain, not lion, that's making zebra alert, motivated, strong. Yes, it might be doing it in response to the lion approach, but it's zebra spraying. So from that lens, we're gonna say there's been some ways in which your brain has been working that's been causing you to feel bad. By bad, we're meaning that over angst stuff around driving, loud noise or weird noises in house. Right. By bad, we're meaning the of too close past. Your brain might do all of that to you in response to stuff past or in future, but you recognize that way of brain working has been problematic. That's really the issue. Got it. If we're looking at it from the weird lens that your brain has been doing to you, making you feel bad, first question really is, do you think that your brain wants you to feel bad? Do you think it would want you to feel good? Yeah, most people do. But unfortunately, no. See, what we've discovered in working with people is that your brain doesn't give a rat's asset. Not because it's not concerned about your well being, but that's not the purpose of emotion. What we've discovered is even though you're a bright guy, pretty bright guy, the majority of our emotional brain works like the brain of a simple animal. And an animal doesn't have emotions because the brain of the animal is concerned about its mood, its affect, how it feels about itself, whether it's having a good or a bad day. Day, its level of esteem, its sense of self worth. It causes emotion to motivate animal to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. It's that simple. So when the rabbit sees the fox, the brain makes it experience fear to get it to run away. When the squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire, pain. Not because it wants squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid dumb moron and not be down on itself because it's embarrassed. Simple get tail out of fire. All the negative emotions we experience, hurt, anger, sadness, sorrow, angst, upset, worry, pain, shame, guilt, all the stuff that goes on is actually caused by that part of our brain that works like an animal. Same purpose to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. But the glitch or the error is that many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. It's why it continues to loop. We continue to feel bad. If you notice about the same kinds of things over and over and over again. Now the really good news is that many of those items are in time periods that are finished. So we don't have to solve the problem. We want to update the timing. And that's where the error mechanism comes in, is that our brain malfunctions because of a timing error. And the reason it does is because we've got an additional part to our brain, our intellect. And with our intellect we have a timeline. Meaning, you know, you're sitting here now, you can remember something you did yesterday, you can think about something you're gonna go do tomorrow. No other animal can do that. For an animal, they're just now, always now that Is not a problem when experiences are positive or neutral, because in those circumstances, the brain gets the difference between the memory of it and the experience of it, right? Somebody telling you about a trip that they had to Key west, and when they were down there, they took their picture next to the sign that said 90 miles from Cuba. When they tell you about that experience, you know that they know the difference between remembering, doing it and doing it really clear. The problem is when things are negative. And it doesn't matter, Tammy, whether it's a big negative experience or a little negative experience. It doesn't matter if the negative experience happened a long time ago when I was really young or just the other day. And it doesn't matter whether it was a one time occurrence or multitudes of occurrences over time. Any negative experience, weird, painful, sad, scary, awful, upsetting, horrific, catastrophic, traumatic. Our brain confuses the memory data and info about it thinking it is it, and causes an emotional reaction, right? This guy is telling us about how 12 years ago when he was in Oklahoma City, he got mugged. And as he's telling us about it, he gets to the part where the guy has now got the knife at his throat, whispering, if you even breathe, motherfucker, I'm gonna slice you. And this guy's face has now gone completely white. His voice is all contorted, his arms are trembly, shaky. He's got tears. We're kind, we're nice people. We were kindly listening to him. What the F is happening with him? And what most people go, oh, he's reliving it. But what's actually going on is part of his brain is confusing the memory data and info, thinking it's the experience. It's causing that discomfort, trying to motivate him to get it to stop. That's the error. The brain doesn't. No, it's not causing it because it wants him to be paralyzed by the memory of that experience. It's causing it because it doesn't know that the memory of the experience isn't the experience itself. Right. Has no distinction. So it's causing it to try to motivate him to get it to stop. That's the first component that keeps it still stuck in me. Does that make sense? Second thing that happens with us human beings is it's a training thing. We were all trained to believe the same kinds of messages when we're little children. We're trained to believe that good things happen when I'm being good and that bad things happen when I'm being bad, which isn't True. But that's what we're told to believe, right? Santa brings toys and part presents to the good kids, coals to the bad. Which kids nowadays have no idea what that is. But you know, right, that good things happen. I'm good, I get hugs, I get kisses, I get praise, I get candy. Bad things happen, I get disciplined, I get smacked, I get yelled at, I get. Because I'm bad, Right. So that message gets installed. If good happens when I'm good, bad happens when I'm bad. So what happens if something bad happens to me? Well, it must have somehow been partially my fault or I should have known better, right? Nobody's shocked when, let's say the 23 year old who got a promotion at work, she goes out to celebrate with co workers. And one of the co workers brought a friend who seemed to be a nice guy. He bought her a couple drinks. They kind of celebrated, right? He said, hey, you're on my way home. I'll drop you off. Cool, I'll take Uber. All right. So he drives her, knowing that she doesn't live in the greatest neighborhood. He offers to walk her to the door. What a nice guy. Now, she had no idea that when she opened her door and went to say goodbye, that he was going to force himself into her apartment and rape her, which is what he did off her. But worse is when she's talking to us, telling us how stupid and careless she was, how she put herself in that vulnerable situation, how she should have known better. Yes, because you should be thinking that a co worker's friend is gonna rape you. Right. But notice because it was bad, it goes back into being my fault. Does that make sense? That's the thing that goes on. I had a woman one time, she literally left a parking lot like this, 4:00 in the afternoon, walked to her car. Now, yes, she happened to be texting, but it's light out, it's 4 o'clock in the afternoon. She's not in a dangerous situation. She goes to open her driver's car door, two men who were in a van jump out, grab her, throw into the back of the van, drive off to a secluded area. They wound up beating and raping her.
[55:37] B: Horrible.
[55:39] A: Worse is her telling me that I'm never going to forgive myself for being so stupid and not paying attention, putting myself in danger. You walk to your car, 4:00 afternoon in a suburban area. What the fuck? But again, because it was bad, notice how it gets stuck as my fault. So the problem is when we go through Negative experience. It always goes back to being about me. The little kid whose parents get divorced and dad's no longer present in his life, doesn't think to himself, oh, well, you know, know it's a mom and dad issue and dad's kind of a fuck up. He's an alcoholic and that's why he's not around. It has nothing to do with me or my loveability. Does that have anything to do with dad being a fuck up? No. He thinks, see, if dad mattered or if I mattered to dad, or if I was more important, if I was worth it, Daddy would be here, right? And that just starts a loop in me, right? So not only does he feel that at 4, well, now that teachers like reprimanding. Well, see, like if I was smarter, I wouldn't get. So now I'm not only I don't have a dad, but now I'm not good enough. And then he doesn't get picked for kickball. He doesn't think to himself, oh, I'm just not good at that game. He goes, see, nobody likes me. And it just continues to perpetuate this story line. Does that make sense? And that continues to ongoingly trouble him. And once the yucky moment and those two are merged, stuck together. That's where we talked about the brain is hypervigilant, super sensitive, scanning for anything that's similar to anything that was painful. But the problem is that it confuses similar as same, right? The soldier is diving on the ground when the firework burst bursts in the air. Not because he doesn't know it's the 4th of July and that he's at a fireworks celebration. It's because at a completely different level, part of his brain confused the sound, thought it was mortar grenade. He's the dude that lit it. You think? So that thing can run us all the time. Even if I know better, I don't feel different in here. It runs us until we do one really useful thing, which is turn the lights on, get in the good news, unplug the memory so the brain fully gets that it's over, that I'm okay. And that's what we want to be doing. So think of it in this way. There's a part of your brain when certain violent stuff happen. There's a part of your brain in certain accidents stuff happen that part of the brain doesn't know, A, that the accident is over and that you survived. B, that the violence over and you're not getting hit. We have actually really good news, you and I, to Get into that part of your brain so that it fully knows what you know, that those things are over and that you're okay. That's what we want to get in. Does that make sense? Yeah. So therefore, how we're engineer. Any questions? By the way, I know I went really, really fast. Any questions? Okay, cool. So you're following me. So as we think of how we want you to be a. That kind of feeling, the you that I'm seeing, she remembers feeling that way. But if you asked her to get it, she would not. Again, that stuff's been cleared and gone. The you that I'm seeing is emotionally present. Present, so that she's doing what you're already wanting to be doing, which is taking it one day at a time. But by being emotionally present, she's reacting to what's happening without the influence of what has got it. The you that I'm seeing is much more wise because she's got information about stuff that could because it did. And that makes her more wise as she moves through her day. She's not vigilant, but she's more wise. Right. The wolf who goes out hunting for rabbits and she happens to step in a hole and hurt your paw. Of course, now walking a little more gently, but knowing that there are holes out there, being outwardly focused and present, the wolf is less likely to step in hole. Right. Hunter who went hunting stepped in the same hole that the wolf did. Hunter's pissed. Right? First at the jerk who put the hole there without a sign. Second at himself for having been so stupid and careless, remembering all the other times that he did. Dumb shit. Hunter being preoccupied in that is more likely to step in another hole. Got it. So we want you to be more like the wolf. Emotionally present, clear, much more at peace, free from the effect. Got it. And this is where we're headed. So my question for you now isn't how it's gonna happen that we get you here. My question is, would it be okay. Would it be okay to no longer be bothered by any of these. The crap that happened to you, and you were younger with the other people. Yeah. And if you're no longer troubled by it, does that in any way, shape or form mean that what happened to you was okay? Right. You get to be okay even though that wasn't. So now we've got a green light. So what do we do next? Well, we want to put our body into the right states. By the way, do you need to use the restroom or anything?
[61:21] B: No.
[61:22] A: Okay, good. Because if you did this would be the time to do it. We want to put our body in the right states for healing. Now, how do you put your body in the right states for healing? Well, what do we know about people when they're in the process of healing? We tell them after a flu, after a cold, after surgery, what do we want them to do?
[61:47] B: Rest.
[61:47] A: Rest. So we have processes that use neuroscientific brain levers that are designed to put your body into a state of rest. The first lever is a silly lever. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. Now I don't mean completely dropping it, like ah, I mean just a tiny little bit. If you slightly lower your jaw, right. That just by itself begins to put the body into more parasympathetic, sympathetic response. So what we do is we slightly lower the jaw. The second lever we utilize is resting the tongue at the bottom of the mouth. It's pretty simple and easy. So you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. The third lever is that you begin to breathe. But as you breathe, you breathe in a way that's just a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. So go ahead with your jaw lowered and resting your tongue. That's right. Begin to breathe in a way. That's right. That's just a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. Right. And as you're now intentionally beginning to breathe in this slightly slower, deeper way, just check inside. What do you notice? How's your body feeling now? Yeah. Isn't that kind of interesting how that already happens? And then we want to add another lens. And that is this lever is all about when we're tense, stressed, anxious, nervous, agitated, irritated, quick, short tempered. What happens is our beta waves, which are what we're in most waking states, get very, very rapid and they become very, very narrowed. So it kind of almost moves us into tunneled vision. And when we're in tunneled vision, everything goes. What we want to do is be in more, what we'll call peripheral vision or expanded awareness. So think of like people who tend to be really chill. Are people like surfers. Right. Because a surfer is always by the water. They're always dealing with waves that they have no control over. Right. A surfer doesn't know which wave is coming next. Could be the big kahuna, could be a little one. And the surfers always seeing vastness, like out towards the horizon, like when you're at the beach, can't tell where the water ends. In the sky begins when you look way out in all directions. As we expand our awareness into our peripheral vision, it also starts to settle the body down. We're able to pay attention to more of what's around us than just in that nature. Narrowed, tunneled vision. Does that make sense? So again, your jaw is slightly lowered. You're resting your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You're breathing. That's right. In a way that's a little bit slow and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. Notice that you are looking across and seeing me. But as you stay looking at me, Tammy, notice what happens when your awareness is expands out. To see my fingers wiggling out here, Right? That you see it with your peripheral vision. And as you see it with your peripheral vision, notice how you can also pick up the side windows and door. That by staying looking at me, you can still see the space beyond my head. And you can even sense the space that's behind your head. You can sense how much space there is under the couch, how much space there is above your head towards the ceiling. And notice how you can begin to be aware of all of that at the same time. And as you are, once again, just check inside. How's your body feeling now? Right. Isn't that kind of cool? And then the last lever. This is an interesting one because you talked about one of the things you want to prevent is to make sure too much doesn't get laid on top of me so I don't feel so overwhelmed. And you may have said to other people or heard other people say I'm under a lot of stress, which we think of as just a metaphor. Right, but is it really a metaphor or is it how our brain represents stress? Right. And if I'm underneath a lot of stress, where must this stress be in relationship to me? On top. I'm being overwhelmed. It's always on top of me. Isn't that interesting? So what we know is one of the reversals is to get out from under it all and to rise up above it. I remember working with this teenager one time, and he was telling me, it's all piling up on me. It's all stacking up on me. It feels like I've got a huge elephant on my chest. Even when I'm at home, it feels like my parents keep putting things on me. I can't breathe. So notice his representation was all underneath it. And I said, I wonder what happens as we get you out from under it and you start to rise up above it like if you were in an airplane and you look out the little porthole, what happens to the stuff on the ground? He goes, oh, my goodness, it's starting to look like a small ant. I go, that's right, it is. And then I said to him, how's your body feeling now? And this is what he did. He went. And then he said out loud, it feels like I can breathe. But here's the cool part to all of that. Who answered my question first, him or his body?
[67:48] B: His body.
[67:49] A: That's right. Because he didn't consciousness decide to change it. So we started to change the representation of where he was in relationship to the stress. So the last lever is about getting you out from under it all and being up above it. You know what it's like to have a bird's eye view? No. Well, I mean, do you know what the metaphor means? Well, where are birds normally in relationship to us? Up.
[68:21] B: Right.
[68:22] A: So think about being up above something and seeing other things down below you. That's having a bird's eye view. So I'm like, kind of perched way up above. Kind of think of like the top of a, you know, really tall, light or building, and I'm seeing everything down below me. Right. That's a bird's eye view. But not a bird that's just perched. One that's able to soar and fly through the sky and move all around in all directions. So how we do that is simply this. Again, you're going to slightly lower your jaw, resting. That's right. Your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, beginning to breathe in a way that's just a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. So that as you're breathing in this slightly slower and deeper way, you're controlling your breath, which is an unconscious process that doesn't require you to do anything in order for it to get done. Therefore, when you're intending how you're breathing, it changes your consciousness, fueling more the trance. Notice that you can look across and see. But as you do, you can see my fingers out here. You can see them wiggling. And you can notice more of the space in the room. Space between you and me and space beyond me, space underneath, space behind, space up above. And notice how there's more space in the room than anything else, and that the space actually goes beyond the room, out in all directions. And then what you're going to do in just a moment is you'll go ahead and close your eyes. And then when your eyes are closed, I Want you to imagine what it would be like to float up and out of your body. So go ahead and close your eyes and then imagine what it would be like to float up and out of your body so that you rise up above the ceiling and beyond the roof so that your weight up above it all in the sky. Having what we like to call a bird's eye view. Seeing things up above so that you're over it, all the things that are underneath and below you. But again, not just a bird that's perched, one that's able to soar, glide and fly through the sky, moving in all ways and in all directions, maybe making these big wide turns and curves through that space and sky, arching angles. Soaring, moving, gliding, flying all around in all ways and in all directions. That's right. Bring your awareness back down and into your body so that you re associate inside you. When you're ready, take a big deep breath in and then exhale. Good job. In those few short moments that eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself?
[71:41] B: That I'm present.
[71:42] A: You are present, aren't you? And see, as you're present and your body is present, we're going to ask your unconscious to travel back through negative experiences where there were things that happened that were yucky. And we wanted to begin to categorize and group them. And then we wanted to narrow and pinpoint a particular moment that as we bring that moment to mind, it'll have like a ripple effect. Would ripple affect me like if we had a clear lake and we dropped a large boulder and do it how it would just send ripples towards the shore. We're going to narrow back to a particular time, something that happened that was yucky. We're going to bring that moment to mind so that as we clear it, it starts to clear even more. Right? So as you're here and we're organizing towards the you becoming more free and present, the unconscious is going to travel back. It's already grouped here, categorized. Now it's going to narrow and pinpoint and bring a particular experience to mind. Clear. What is it that comes to mind? Now you have one of those, you know, those things that I don't really like to think about or talk about because they make me feel yucky. See? And as your brain is already selecting it, it's there.
[73:05] B: I'm going to explain to you how clear it.
[73:08] A: Clearing it is really simple. Requires one thing. The one thing that it requires is you to have the intention of being with me, being here. Now, the reason you want to be here right now is that this, what we're doing is what's happening. And that is two, we're working on the mutual goal of this future you. Three, I'm way more. More fun than sucky moments. And I don't even have to be a lot of fun. Got it. Second, we want to think about when that moment happened. So about how long ago did that one happen?
[73:40] B: July 21, 2017.
[73:42] A: Okay, good. So that was a while ago. At least it's, you know, accurate in terms of the date. So there have been a lot of things that you've done after that moment that were more enjoyable than that moment in your life, isn't there?
[73:55] B: Um.
[73:59] A: No. No, there's not been anything more enjoyable than that moment. That was a highlight.
[74:04] B: Well, yeah.
[74:06] A: Huh. There have been things that you've done after that moment that were more enjoyable for you.
[74:13] B: Like now, probably. Yeah.
[74:17] A: What's one thing that you've done after that moment ended that was more enjoyable than that moment?
[74:35] B: November 29, 2018.
[74:38] A: That was a more enjoyable experience. And what was that?
[74:43] B: Meeting my boyfriend.
[74:44] A: No, meeting your boyfriend. Way more enjoyable than that. Good. Something else that you've done.
[74:50] B: December 29th. Having my daughter.
[74:53] A: Yeah, having your daughter. Way more enjoyable in that moment. Good. One other thing. We don't have to have exact dates, but something you've done that was more enjoyable. I mean, heck, putting your shoes on today was probably more enjoyable in that moment, wasn't it?
[75:07] B: Yeah.
[75:07] A: Yeah. We don't have to go to.
[75:09] B: Oh, okay.
[75:10] A: Right. I mean, we can. Like meeting your boyfriend, having you. All those moments were more enjoyable.
[75:16] B: Yeah.
[75:16] A: Right. Right. Getting into Tyler was better than that moment. Right. You know, moving out of Harvest House, way better than that moment. Got it. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond that moment. We have good news to get it. So when that particular moment happened. When it happened, you were where?
[75:38] B: Orlando.
[75:39] A: So you're in Orlando. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[75:42] B: Night.
[75:43] A: Night time. And you're where in Orlando? Like, inside? Outside?
[75:46] B: Inside.
[75:46] A: Inside. Like at a house or a hotel? At a house. Right. Good. And you're like, where in the house?
[75:52] B: On the porch.
[75:53] A: So you're on the porch. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[75:57] B: That's when it happened.
[75:58] A: Well, what happened? So you're on the porch, and then what happened?
[76:01] B: I was attacked.
[76:02] A: So somebody came up to you, right? Like from the sidewalk?
[76:07] B: No, they lived in the house.
[76:09] A: Oh, so they lived in the house. They came out of the house?
[76:12] B: No, they went shopping and came back Right.
[76:15] A: So they had gone shopping and they had come back. They were carrying groceries.
[76:18] B: I was.
[76:19] A: You were carrying groceries? I couldn't. Then what happened next? Well, you're here. Right? So what happened? So you're on the porch. He did what?
[76:32] B: He grabbed me by my throat, started beating me.
[76:34] A: And then he started hitting you. Right? Good. And then what happened next? And stay here. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Be here. Hi. Notice how you're going there. Hi. I want you here. Hi. Good. So he started hitting you. Right. And that hurt. And then what happened next?
[76:50] B: He tried to kill me.
[76:53] A: He did what?
[76:54] B: He was choking me.
[76:55] A: Unconscious. Right. Good.
[76:57] B: And then he raped me.
[76:59] A: Right. And then he did stuff to your body?
[77:00] B: Yeah.
[77:01] A: Right. Inside. Not on the porch.
[77:03] B: Inside.
[77:04] A: Inside. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[77:06] B: That was it.
[77:07] A: Then that. Then he stopped. And then that moment ended. And then you probably put clothes back on. And then later on, you did something more fun, like meeting your boyfriend. Writer. Have your daughter. Right. Or, you know, get out of Harvest House.
[77:23] B: Yeah.
[77:23] A: Right. Get into Tyler. Right. Good. So notice, as we recall, that there was discomfort, not because that was such a sucky moment, even though it was, but because part of your brain doesn't fully know that it stopped. So here's a crazy thought. We never go backwards with memories. We only go forward. But when you go backwards, it literally begins to unplug the memory, flatten out the neuron and take away the charge. So we're gonna go backwards. So we've got, you know, leaving Harvest House, we have getting into Tyler. Right. We've got having daughter. We got meeting boyfriend. Right. And then you'd gotten clothes on, and then he had stopped. And then he'd done that stuff to your body.
[78:04] B: Right.
[78:04] A: And then he pulled you inside, and then he was hitting you. Right. And then you'd been bringing in groceries. And then before that, you'd gone shopping. Then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. And now as we ran through it backwards, compared to as you were telling it to move forward emotionally, how was it saying more or less? Less. Isn't that weird how it's already less now? There's another component we want to add to this. And that is oftentimes things happen to people and to their bodies. And we relate that it happened to me because we walk around thinking that I am my body. Right. But what if you're not your body? I know it's going to be a weird thought. What if you have a body? Your body is totally yours, but it isn't actually you. And the reason I say, that is my mom when she was 17. Snow cone machine. She was working ice cream store. It got stuck. She decided to break, remove the ice. So she stuck her finger in. Tip of her finger gone. Now when she goes to visit people, they don't say to her, susie, I'm glad almost all of you could come over. They don't say that to her. Why? Because she's totally all there, even if that part of her body's missing. So we could say that you have a body totally yours, but isn't you? Neuroscience has determined that if you and I came back a year from today 99.9999999, almost all of the subatomic particles that are making us up would not be here. They don't all leave at once. That's Star Trek. So you have a body, totally yours. It isn't you. You have thoughts. They're your thoughts, but you're not the thinker of them. Weirdly enough, your brain is. And you have a brain. It's an organ like your heart, which means it's not you, it's yours. Emotions are things that you feel, experience, express, but you're you regardless of how you're feeling. So you can't be an emotion. There are things you do, stuff you've done, jobs you've had, but when you stop doing one thing to do something else, you didn't stop existing.
[80:10] B: Right.
[80:11] A: So that leads us to a weird question, because if you're not what you do, or your thoughts or your feelings or your body, then what are you? So I want you to think of it when you were outside in nature and you see something that's just beautiful. Like the moment you're looking at it, you're like, wow, what is it that you see?
[80:36] B: Well, I was 72ft in the air.
[80:39] A: Yeah. In a.
[80:42] B: It's. It's at the Myakka State Park.
[80:45] A: Yeah. And as you were up above it.
[80:48] B: All, seeing tops of the trees and.
[80:52] A: Stuff, you were feeling a sense of, like, peace. And some people would tell you, well, duh, of course being there, seeing that is going to give you those kinds of feelings. But if we looked at it from a different lens, we could say that seeing it and being there simply drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because at your center, you always are peaceful and excited in the same way. We're at the campfire and I'm freezing, and I move my hands closer to the flames, and then I say, holy shit, Tammy, the fire is getting hotter. Is the fire actually getting hotter? No, no, I'm becoming more aware of the heat or.
[81:39] B: Right, yeah.
[81:40] A: So let's just say that in your life we know that there have been many times where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Stressors, upsets, angst, guilt, shames, pains, worries. But no matter where awareness has been, at your center, you're peaceful and excited. And that peace and excitement we like to think of as light, right? We've got light of knowledge, knowing that you and I are in this room, right? That's knowledge. Light of wisdom at the center. And see the light that is you, that light actually can't be harmed, hurt or touched. It only experiences the love that it allows in. And I say that because people, when they come in to see me fuck up identity all the time, they tell me things like they're anxious, they're depressed, they're shy, they're obsessive compulsive, thinking that the way they feel or how they act is who they are.
[82:40] B: Yeah. No, it doesn't.
[82:42] A: Right. But if I go to the dentist, do you need to be somewhere?
[82:45] B: No.
[82:45] A: Okay.
[82:46] B: I just, I don't know.
[82:49] A: Uh huh. Right. We're on our way. It's really cool. So if I go to the dentist and I'm upset, and you go, why are you so upset? And I go, you never believe what he did. You go, what did he do? Well, he put me on a chair, right, you're at the dentist. My head went down, my feet went up. You're like, you're at the dentist, Right? He shined a light in my eyes, I can't see. Okay, you're at the dentist. He took a cold instrument, shoved it inside of me. You're like, huh, oh my goodness. And you're what he go at the dentist? My mouth. But like I work with people of all sorts of stuff happen to them. People do different things to their body. I remember this one girl that I worked with her older brother, Matchbox cars when she was 6, parked them in her. So there was a lot of shame, guilt, anger, hurt. And when we worked together and cleared it all out, I asked her the question afterwards ago, your brother, when you were little, he really messed with your stuff. And she said he did. And for a long time it hurt my feelings and screwed up my thinking. And then she said to me, but you know what? He never actually touched me. He messed with my body, but he never got me. And I said, whoa, that's powerful. And see, we want to be getting in that same kind of good news to the earlier you so you can remember that moment happening with that guy, right? You can remember what he did, but you also can remember other things that you know that you're not doing right now. Like, for example, put your pants on. You can remember putting your pants on. You can even know where you were when you did it, right? But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your pants on, and then I went, tammy, stop putting on your pants. You'd look at me and go, but I'm not putting on my pants. Because what's crystal clear is that, you know, there's a difference between your remembering it and it happening. They're not the same thing. We want to get that kind of good news in, right? So you can remember putting your pants on. You can remember him hitting you, choking you. You can remember him doing that stuff to your body, grabbing you, putting his penis in your vagina, doing that. You can remember all that happening, right? You can remember putting your pants on. Tammy, stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants. Remember putting your pants on. Stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants.
[85:07] B: I'm not putting on my pants.
[85:08] A: Well, stop putting on your shoes. Say, I'm not putting on my shoes.
[85:10] B: I'm not putting on your pants.
[85:11] A: Well, stop me from putting on my pants. Say you're not putting on your pants.
[85:14] B: You're not putting on your pants.
[85:16] A: Well, then stop him from choking you. Say, he's not choking me.
[85:19] B: He's not choking me.
[85:20] A: Well, stop him from hitting you. Say, he's not hitting me. Well, stop him from doing that sex stuff to your body. Say, he's not doing that.
[85:26] B: He's not doing that.
[85:27] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. And as that starts to get in, what do you notice happening to the feelings going away? They are. Isn't that interesting, by the way, that earlier you doesn't know what you know now fully, that that's over, finished, defeated, that it no longer exists. That earlier you doesn't know that he may have messed with your stuff, but he never got who you really are. Watch, I'll show you something that's weird. Ready for something that's weird. Not that any of this shit hasn't already been weird, but this is really weird. Take your hand, hold it out like that, right? Look at that spot on your hand, right? I'm gonna take my hand, I'm gonna move it towards your hand. You're gonna notice that you see my hand. Moving in. As my hand moves in, as it gets a little bit closer, before it touches your hand, you'll notice you can feel it. Warmth. Isn't that weird? You feel the energy right now. What that means right now is I'm coming closer to touching who you are than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with respect and love. Right? So he messed with your stuff. Right. So say this after me. I have a nose.
[86:40] B: I have a nose.
[86:41] A: I have two elbows. I have ten fingers.
[86:45] B: Ten fingers.
[86:45] A: I have ten toes.
[86:46] B: Ten toes.
[86:47] A: I'm not my elbows.
[86:49] B: I'm not my elbows.
[86:50] A: I'm not my fingers.
[86:51] B: Not my fingers.
[86:52] A: I'm not my toes.
[86:53] B: Not my toes.
[86:54] A: Or my nose.
[86:55] B: Or my nose.
[86:56] A: I have a vagina.
[86:59] B: I have a vagina.
[87:01] A: I'm not my vagina.
[87:02] B: I'm not my vagina.
[87:04] A: It's mine.
[87:06] B: It's mine.
[87:07] A: But it isn't me.
[87:08] B: But it isn't me.
[87:09] A: Okay. So we mess with my stuff.
[87:12] B: So he messed with myself.
[87:13] A: And it hurt my feelings.
[87:14] B: Hurt my feelings.
[87:15] A: And it screwed up my thinking.
[87:16] B: Screwed up my thinking.
[87:17] A: And he hurt my body.
[87:18] B: He hurt my body.
[87:19] A: But he never touched me.
[87:21] B: But he never touched me.
[87:22] A: He never got who I really am.
[87:24] B: He never got who I really am.
[87:25] A: That's right. So he messed with my stuff.
[87:28] B: So he messed with my stuff.
[87:29] A: But he never got me.
[87:31] B: But he never got me.
[87:32] A: Take a deep breath in. And then exhale. That hand can drop down. There we go. So now what you want to do is get that fully into the younger you. So now go ahead and close your eyes. Think back to that earlier you in that moment. Let her know that that moment is over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists. Let that you know that that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was fucked up with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Let the you know that he may have messed with your stuff, but he never got who you really are. Let that younger you know about your daughter, about the guy you're dating now. Let her know about getting out of Harvest House. Let her know about completing the program so that she gets it. Let her know that she's on her way to be getting your ged. Let her know. And as that earlier you is getting all of it now. Tammy. What do you mean is happening to the earlier you? You?
[88:32] B: Yeah.
[88:34] A: Isn't that weird? What are you noticing now? H. I said, what are you noticing now?
[88:51] B: Awkward.
[88:52] A: How so?
[88:54] B: I don't Know. Cause I've never done this with anybody before.
[88:57] A: I didn't think you would.
[89:01] B: It's just a little awkward.
[89:03] A: Oh, why? Cause we said vagina. I mean, it is a vagina.
[89:10] B: Yeah.
[89:11] A: I mean, people call it different things. Yeah, well, we have all sorts of different names for it. Just like we have all sorts of different names for penises. When I do a talk, people, it's really funny because people are really embarrassed about conversations when it comes to sex. I'll have a group of therapists and I'll put on the board, I'll put penis, or I'll put vagina. And I go, I want you to tell me all the slang that you hear for it. I mean, you hear all sorts of stuff.
[89:38] B: Yeah, right.
[89:39] A: Because people have a hard time using those words. But the question that I have for you now, given that this might be a little bit awkward, isn't that. This isn't that. But when you think about that experience that happened with that guy, then, what do you notice?
[89:55] B: Now it's gone.
[89:57] A: Hmm. Try to feel really bad about it.
[90:00] B: I can't.
[90:01] A: Try to be really angry or hurting.
[90:03] B: I can't.
[90:04] A: Oh, isn't that weird? And notice how that's different than it's ever been.
[90:11] B: Yeah. I've been dealing with it for a long time. So.
[90:19] A: You have been dealing with it for a long time. Since 2017. July. But the difference is, are you dealing with it now? No. See, I'm asking you on purpose to try to feel really bad about it.
[90:39] B: Yeah, but I can't.
[90:41] A: And isn't that different and different than it's ever been? And not because you've been dealing with it for a long time, because we haven't dealt with it for that long at all. What do we spend about 10 minutes on it? Maybe 15.
[90:59] B: Yeah.
[91:00] A: Oh, wow. So in 15 minutes we get something that you been dealing with that was troubling for, you know, now it's not troubling. Isn't that weird? I mean, awkward, but kind of cool.
[91:16] B: Yeah.
[91:17] A: Right. Do you know what happens when your brain heals things? You don't. Well, I mean, you've had cut, right?
[91:28] B: Yeah.
[91:28] A: And your body brain healed. It.
[91:30] B: It disappears.
[91:31] A: It does. It stops being a thing. You don't even think about it anymore. Right. And even if you do think about it or if something reminds you of it, it doesn't have any of the stuff.
[91:41] B: Right?
[91:41] A: Right. Isn't that cool? Right. As you think about the earlier, you now getting what you know now, what did you notice happened to her face?
[91:51] B: She Smiled.
[91:52] A: She did, didn't she? Yeah. Not cool, actually. Not troubled. No. So again, you can slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. As you're breathing in this slightly slower and deeper way, notice you can expand awareness. And as awareness expands, notice that you can also imagine what it's like to be floating up and out of your body, above and beyond all of it, way up above so that you can see things underneath and below you, because you're over it, free to be becoming more of the future you that you and I are collaborating on. All of that is happening now with whether you fully realize it or not. Because here's the cool part about change. More of it happens before you know that it's happening. Kind of like with growing plants. More goes on underneath the surface before you see it sprout. That's right. And see, as all of this is going on again, your unconscious is going to narrow back and select another experience for us to clear, which, of course, because we've already done one, it'll be easier to do the next. It's kind of like once you get up over the hill, it's easier to go back down. So as your brain travels back, back, back, back, back, what's another moment that comes to mind for us to clear? No way, man. I am not bringing another freaking moment to mind. It was already awkward enough. You said vagina. We could have just said ass. I have an ass. I'm not an ass. Sometimes I'm an ass, but I'm not my ass. My ass is mine, but it is me, right?
[94:00] B: Oh, Lord.
[94:01] A: That's right. See, there it goes again. We know that we're getting somewhere when the oh, Lord comes out. You're doing great. I'm proud of you. Yeah. What's surfacing now? That one that we don't like to think about. The one that went. Mm, mm. Right. Your brain's going, come on, Tammy, do this fun. Turn the fun. We want to get this better. I mean, we don't want it to, you know, be that you, you know, no longer have these visions. Oh, no, actually, we do want to make sure that you no longer have those visions. Right. Your brain stops confusing.
[94:55] B: Mm.
[94:56] A: Right. Other guy with this guy. Hmm. Right. We wouldn't want you to be totally free and okay. And no longer have any of that stuff there. Oh, no, actually we do. Right. So what's the moment that's coming to mind?
[95:11] B: No.
[95:12] A: Yeah, that one. Right.
[95:22] B: The vision of him beating me.
[95:25] A: Who?
[95:26] B: My boyfriend.
[95:27] A: Oh, right. You can. That's something that you've seen in your mind's eye, right? So as you think about that moment in that vision, what does it take you towards? What experience, by the way, as you see it, it's it in color or black and white?
[95:53] B: In color.
[95:54] A: And are you watching it happen or is it like looking through your own eyes? Like, are you, like, watching it like it's on a TV show or are you seeing it through your own eyes?
[96:03] B: Through my own eyes.
[96:04] A: Oh, what happens if you watch it like a TV show?
[96:07] B: I don't know.
[96:08] A: Oh, we'll try. You don't know, do you? Because you haven't done it yet. Right? Right. What happens if you're to watch it like it's on a TV show? And what happens if it goes to a black and white show? And what happens if we move the picture and we kind of make the picture, like, you know, about the size of the iPhone screen over there. So now you see it. Him coming, but in the iPhone screen in black and white.
[96:41] B: Still pretty aggressive.
[96:42] A: It is pretty aggressive. But now you're watching it, right? And what happens? See, we've got one way that we could watch it, right? You could look at it through your own eyes, right? We could watch it as if you're up above it seeing it happen, right? We could watch it like a blink view, like straight up above it, looking straight down on it. We could watch it from underneath looking up at it. Right. We could watch it from like a diagonal corner looking back down at it. We could watch it here looking back. We could watch it from behind him looking at it. Right. We could watch it from this other corner looking down. We could watch it from down looking up. Oh, now it's in black and white. What happens if it like gets freeze from frame like they were decks, like card from a deck, you know, where you could, like flip them. Remember those old card things where you could flip through the card and like, that would show you that. Right. But see, it isn't about him. Is. Isn't about him, is it? No, it's about something else. Yeah. So when was that time? Ah, that's a good breath. Yeah. Right. Because your brain brought the time to mind. That's why it was a really good breath. So that one happened, you were about.
[98:14] B: How old where it all happened about between 2014 and 2017.
[98:23] A: Yeah. Good. So like 2000. Whatever. You're where in Orlando, Disney. People up. I'm telling you. All right. So you're in Orlando. Are you on the porch? Porch?
[98:38] B: No, I'm in a. An apartment.
[98:41] A: So you're in an apartment. Good. Right. And like, in a bedroom or, like, living room or kitchen or.
[98:45] B: It's kind of like the side.
[98:47] A: Like an open plan. Yeah. Good. Like you're there. Right. Good. And then what happened? Sitting or standing?
[98:53] B: Standing.
[98:53] A: Right. And then what happened?
[98:57] B: He.
[98:58] A: Same guy?
[98:59] B: No.
[98:59] A: Oh, good.
[99:01] B: His name is Rudy.
[99:03] A: Yeah, Rudy. So Rudy comes in.
[99:06] B: Rudy was already in there.
[99:08] A: Oh, good. So he was already in there, and you walked in there. Right. Good. And then what happened?
[99:11] B: And he just started punching me.
[99:14] A: Like where? Like in the face. From the body?
[99:18] B: Yup.
[99:18] A: Right. And that hurt? Like closed fist?
[99:23] B: Yeah.
[99:24] A: Slaps?
[99:25] B: Both. He knocked me down.
[99:27] A: So he knocked you down, and then he started stomping on you? Right. Good. And then what happened next? By the way, check where you are right now.
[99:34] B: Huh?
[99:35] A: Check where you are right now.
[99:37] B: What do you mean?
[99:39] A: I said check where you are right now. Where are you?
[99:43] B: In Sarasota.
[99:44] A: You are. That's right. It's not a good news thing.
[99:49] B: Yeah.
[99:50] A: That Tammy back then doesn't know she's in Sarasota. We want her to know because we got really good news. Right. So then he was stopping. Right. And then what happened next?
[100:00] B: Then he picked the stick up and was gonna hit me with it, but stopped and told me to get out.
[100:05] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[100:08] B: That was it.
[100:09] A: You got up and you got out. That was smart. And then that moment ended. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like have your kid, meet your boyfriend, get out of Harvest House, or, you know, go through Thailand. So we got going through Tyler. We got getting out of Harvest House, we got having the kid. We got meeting boyfriend. Right. And then you left. And then he had said, get out, and then he had the stick, and then he was stomping on you, and then he knocked you to the ground, and then he was slapping and hitting you, and then you walked in. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. And again, as we go through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it? Right. You can remember him doing that? You can remember putting your pants on. Candy, stop putting on your pants.
[100:49] B: I'm not putting on my pants.
[100:51] A: Well, then stop him from hitting you.
[100:53] B: I can't.
[100:54] A: No, you don't even have to.
[100:56] B: Not hitting me.
[100:57] A: That's right. Good job. All right, he's done. Well, you stop putting on your sneakers. Not putting on my will Stop me from putting on my sneakers.
[101:05] B: You're not putting on your.
[101:06] A: We'll stop him from hitting you.
[101:07] B: He's not hitting.
[101:08] A: Yeah. So then where is that? Satan no longer exists.
[101:11] B: He no longer exists.
[101:13] A: Right. By the way, him doing that, did that have anything to do with you? Him doing that to you, did that have anything to do with you? No. Who did it have to do with?
[101:24] B: My body.
[101:25] A: Hmm. Different. Slightly. So think of a kid. He comes home with two Ds and two Fs. Mom's pissed. Says, you wait until your dad comes home. Dad comes home, Dad's pissed. Dad goes into the kid's room, pulls the kid's pants down, take his belt off and starts hitting the kid. The kid's feeling him getting hit because I got poor grades. Is he? No, No. I mean, as a parent, isn't there more than just one way to deal with that?
[101:54] B: Of course.
[101:55] A: Like, lots of different ways. So did it have to do with the kid or did it have to do with the parent?
[101:59] B: The parent.
[101:59] A: Right. Him hitting you, did that have to do with you? Or did it have to do with whatever was fucked up in him?
[102:05] B: Him.
[102:06] A: Right. Because it had to occur that, you know, it'd be a. It had to occur to him to actually hit you. Right. But see, back then, that earlier you thought him doing that had something to do with you. Right? Maybe having done something or. Or. Or. But even if you did do something, did it warrant that? No. So it didn't have anything to do with you. So repeat these four words. Here we go. It's. It's not about me. Right. There we go. Good. So you already got it. You're fast learning. That's right. Good. Now close your eyes. Picture the earlier you letting her know that that moment is over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists. Let that you know that him doing that had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was screwed up in him. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Let her know who she's with now. Kind guy who wouldn't raise his hand. He doesn't even raise his voice. Let the ewe know about daughter. Let the ewe know about the positive changes about getting out of Harvest House. About going through Tyla. Right. So that she gets it. And as that earlier you is getting it. What do you notice now happening to the earlier you's face?
[103:26] B: She's smiling.
[103:27] A: She is. Right. And you can open your eyes. She's not stuck. Nope. Isn't that weird? Notice how it's never Been that way. Right. Isn't that cool? Right. And we want to do another experience because we're on a roll of getting things healed. Whether it's anything to do with violence or loud noises or screeches or close calls. Right. You're doing great, by the way. How's your body feeling?
[104:02] B: Good. What?
[104:06] A: Isn't that weird?
[104:08] B: Yeah.
[104:09] A: That your body can be feeling okay. Even though we're talking about stuff that was really yucky. Notice how that's also like, you know, unusual. Awkward. Awkward. You said vagina awkward. So good. Right?
[104:33] B: Mm.
[104:34] A: Uh huh. I mean, you do know that my PhD is in clinical sexology?
[104:44] B: No.
[104:45] A: Oh, well now you do.
[104:50] B: That's cool, isn't it?
[104:51] A: Like if you're gonna get a PhD in something, get it in sex.
[104:57] B: You're okay, right? I guess.
[105:01] A: I mean, wouldn't that be a fun topic to study?
[105:04] B: No, it wouldn't. Why?
[105:06] A: I don't know. Because there's all sorts of stuff that goes with it. You know, in school they actually brought people in that were dominatrix that like showed us what flogging was. I had no idea what that was.
[105:19] B: They showed a lot of stuff. They used to have sex ed.
[105:26] A: Which.
[105:26] B: They don't no more.
[105:29] A: Yeah, I'm not sure in sex ed they showed flogging though.
[105:32] B: No, not flogging, but they showed everything else. Like from a condom to.
[105:40] A: They wanted to have people to be prepared. And then we had a whole certain faction that said don't have people be prepared. They might do it then. Oh no, they're going to do it regardless of whether they're prepared or not.
[105:51] B: Exactly.
[105:57] A: So again, as we're organizing towards this future you, who's present, who's emotionally responding to what is without the haunting effect of what has. Right. Who's dealing with the distressors with more ease. Again, that unconscious part is traveling back. It's gonna. And bring another moment to mind.
[106:26] B: How many more moments do we gotta do?
[106:28] A: We don't have to do. We get to.
[106:32] B: How many do we get to do?
[106:34] A: I don't know. Depends.
[106:44] B: I guess. Let's do the car.
[106:45] A: One that might be useful, right? I mean, you make it sound like we're doing like torture.
[106:51] B: No.
[106:55] A: God, he's really wanting me to get better and not be troubled by these things. Things. What a jerk. How many more do we have to do? So I'm not troubled anymore?
[107:08] B: No.
[107:10] A: So good. I mean, I am going to go home and take a nap.
[107:16] B: I am.
[107:17] A: I know. He's interrupting my nap time. Damn it. Hey. I had A good chunk of time scheduled for you today, so.
[107:25] B: I know.
[107:26] A: I'm taking it. So what accident? Where was that? When did that happen? Well, that happened. You might have been where?
[107:53] B: I was here in Sarasota.
[107:54] A: Huh. And are you driving or riding?
[107:57] B: I was in the passenger seat.
[107:59] A: Okay, so you're in the passenger seat. Right. Daytime or nighttime?
[108:02] B: Daytime.
[108:02] A: Daytime. And you're, like, on an interstate or regular?
[108:05] B: Right here?
[108:07] A: Like right here? No, man, that would have been really scary.
[108:14] B: No, right there on 41.
[108:16] A: All right, so you're on 41. Right. Good.
[108:18] B: We were crossing over 41 on the side street.
[108:22] A: Yes.
[108:22] B: And a car was coming down, and as we were crossing, it just barely missed us.
[108:28] A: That's right. Good. And you had. They hit the brakes.
[108:34] B: I don't know. It was. It all happened so fast.
[108:37] A: It's.
[108:37] B: I was dazed.
[108:39] A: Right. Holy shit. Right, good. Then what happened next?
[108:44] B: Well, I panicked enough. I got out of the car and walked.
[108:49] A: Well, you're like, holy shit. Right. And then they stopped the car, and then you got out. Right. And then you walked for a little bit, and then that moment ended.
[109:02] B: Yeah.
[109:02] A: And then later on, you did something more fun, like go get pizza.
[109:07] B: Yeah.
[109:08] A: Wait. Or get out of Harvest House. Yeah. Right. So we got getting out of Harvest House. We got getting pizza. Right. And then you were walking. Then you got out of the car, and then you're like, ah. And then the car almost hit you. And then you guys were crossing over 41. And before that, you were just driving down the road. But again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it good? Huh? You can remember it happening? You can remember putting your shirt on? Tammy, stop putting on your shirt. I'm not putting on.
[109:39] B: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[109:40] A: Well, then stop that guy from almost hitting you. Say, they're not almost hitting us.
[109:43] B: They're not almost hitting us.
[109:45] A: So then where is that experience? It no longer exists.
[109:47] B: No longer exists.
[109:48] A: And what did that you not know?
[109:51] B: That it no longer exists.
[109:52] A: That. And that you are okay.
[109:54] B: That I'm okay.
[109:57] A: Right. What happens as you close your eyes and she learns that you're okay? That you survived, that you made it through it, that It. That you didn't get hurt? That you're okay. That you got to get French nails done? French manicure, Isn't that what it's called?
[110:21] B: Yeah, it's either manic.
[110:23] A: Yeah, it's a French manicure. Right. The ones that just have a little white and then the light pinky color.
[110:31] B: Yeah. I gotta get them redone, huh?
[110:34] A: They look Nice to me.
[110:37] B: Well, what you don't see from a distance so good.
[110:41] A: Right?
[110:43] B: I mean, the distance view looks good, but the close up knows. I need a new set.
[110:49] A: Ah, okay. Need to fill or another one popped on?
[110:53] B: No, I need these ones taken off and new ones put on. They're old.
[111:01] A: Yeah, well, you know.
[111:05] B: But from a distance, you look perfect.
[111:08] A: All the things that women have to do that we don't have to do at all.
[111:11] B: Aren't you so lucky.
[111:13] A: I know. Isn't it weird?
[111:16] B: Yeah. Well, that's what we say about yarn.
[111:21] A: Right? We don't have to do none of that stuff.
[111:24] B: No, it's the things that y'all can do we can't do.
[111:28] A: Oh, like stand up and pee in.
[111:29] B: The woods or anywhere.
[111:31] A: Anywhere you want to be. Right. Yeah.
[111:33] B: There it goes.
[111:33] A: There. There it goes. Right. You actually have to find a restroom, and then. I don't want to sit on that thing.
[111:38] B: I mean, we don't have to. We don't have to find a restroom.
[111:41] A: But it's a lot harder.
[111:42] B: We have to have napkins or something, because we can't just shake three times and be done.
[111:49] A: That's right. Mm.
[111:51] B: How do we get into talking about that?
[111:53] A: I don't know. Cause we like to talk about awkward things and not be awkward about it.
[111:56] B: See?
[111:57] A: Isn't it better? Cause you weren't as awkward that time.
[111:59] B: Yeah.
[112:00] A: Right. So it's becoming more okay. Right. God, I talk to strange people about awkward things. Okay.
[112:10] B: Yeah. Y'all get to have short behind hair, and we have to have long, long hair.
[112:16] A: Right. Takes a lot longer to wash. You gotta put conditioner in it. Oh, your hair takes way longer than my hair does to wash, I mean.
[112:25] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[112:28] A: I don't have to put conditioner in my hair. I could, but I don't have to. Yeah, you kind of have to.
[112:35] B: No, I don't kind of. I know. I have to.
[112:37] A: That's right. Or it'll get all gnarly if I don't.
[112:41] B: It'll. It's easier to brush it when it's got conditioner.
[112:45] A: Absolutely. Yeah.
[112:47] B: Than it is without conditioner.
[112:49] A: Yeah. We don't have to shave our legs. All sorts of stuff. Women have to do way more things than men do.
[113:00] B: Yalls, legs, yalls, armpits.
[113:02] A: Yeah. All sorts of stuff.
[113:04] B: Just ridiculous.
[113:05] A: Thank goodness.
[113:07] B: But y'all have to do your faces sometimes.
[113:12] A: Nowadays we got all these people with these big monster.
[113:16] B: No, not mine.
[113:17] A: Well, good.
[113:18] B: He keeps his nice and smooth.
[113:20] A: That's better for you.
[113:22] B: I like it both ways. He Grows a beard sometimes. It's cute. You know, whatever. You know, it. His mother doesn't like it.
[113:34] A: Oh, boy.
[113:35] B: She's 95 years old. She'll be 96 in October 31st. Yeah, she despises a mustache. She will literally throw a fit if she sees him with one. All right, so he literally keeps the whole thing. He keeps a mustache, but the beard. She won't have it.
[114:05] A: So when he's going to visit her, he's making sure that he's clean shaven.
[114:09] B: I mean, he gets. He gets like, what? You have like, the little peach fuzz down here. He'll get that on his face. But as far as actually growing it, like he was growing it not too long ago. And we have to wear a mask to go see her now. Well, we did then, too. And he did pretty good with hiding it from her. But the more it grew, the more it was visible. And she's not that stupid. She's not stupid at all. Yeah, but she's going blind in one eye. But she can still see pretty good. She caught on to it and threw a fit. So, yeah, he makes sure he.
[114:53] A: He thinks to himself, mom's not gonna be around that longer. Screw it. It'll be fine. I'll just shave it off.
[114:59] B: No, he's very adamant about keeping her alive.
[115:04] A: Well, I'm sure he is, but, I mean, at 95, mom's not gonna be around that much longer.
[115:10] B: Yeah, I know she won't be, but he thinks she can live another 10, 15 years. Years.
[115:17] A: Which still isn't that much longer. Yeah, in comparison to how much longer my kids have.
[115:27] B: Yeah, really.
[115:30] A: I mean, they're 12 and 8. They got.
[115:37] B: Technically speaking, tomorrow's not promised.
[115:41] A: It's true.
[115:43] B: So technically speaking, they only have today to live.
[115:46] A: That's true.
[115:47] B: But actually, today is not a promise either, because they only have right now.
[115:51] A: Yeah, right.
[115:53] B: But if you want to get, you know, whatever, theories, whatever. They have a long time, but they technically only have this very second. Yeah, because nothing's promised. Same with me. I have this very second because there's nothing promised.
[116:19] A: That's right.
[116:21] B: So gotta make the best of each moment.
[116:24] A: That's right. That's what we want to do. That's all there is to do, is to make the best of each moment. Which is easier when we're more emotionally now. That's right. See, that was a good one, too. So awesome.
[116:44] B: Does it have to be three hours? It's already been three hours.
[116:49] A: It hasn't already been three hours.
[116:52] B: 11. It's 1:00.
[117:02] A: Huh? Maybe it has. Let's see. What do I have here?
[117:13] B: You had me from 10:30.
[117:20] A: Let's see what this is.
[117:22] B: What is that?
[117:24] A: This is a calendar.
[117:25] B: Oh. I have another session with you, though.
[117:31] A: You do?
[117:32] B: Yeah. Don't you normally do three sessions?
[117:34] A: Probably.
[117:36] B: How long is the second session?
[117:38] A: I don't know.
[117:39] B: Okay.
[117:39] A: This is the second session.
[117:40] B: I mean the third session, smartass.
[117:44] A: See, I have 10:30 to 1:30.
[117:48] B: Okay.
[117:49] A: Isn't that three hours? 10:30, 11:30, 12:30, 1:30.
[117:52] B: Yeah.
[117:54] A: So we're gonna be done before then?
[117:56] B: Why?
[117:57] A: Why not?
[117:58] B: Okay.
[117:59] A: Cause you said we don't have to. Do we have to go three hours? No, we don't have to do anything.
[118:05] B: Gee, thanks. Technically I do because they want me to. My phone is ringing.
[118:21] A: Yes, it is.
[118:23] B: Can I check it?
[118:24] A: You can.
[118:28] B: Oh, scam.
[118:30] A: Scam. Likely.
[118:32] B: Yep.
[118:32] A: Love that.
[118:34] B: Me and him. Me and him. Been getting them back to back.
[118:37] A: Like awful. Right?
[118:38] B: I feel like because they can't get him to answer his phone, they call me. Like they know we're together.
[118:47] A: Just Microsphere or There's just a lot of scams out there.
[118:51] B: There is.
[118:52] A: So you have to. You said.
[118:55] B: Oh, I have to. Cause when I spoke to Wendy.
[119:00] A: Complete programming.
[119:02] B: Yeah, I guess.
[119:04] A: And part of that's me.
[119:05] B: Yeah.
[119:08] A: Well, so I always look at it better that we get to not have to.
[119:13] B: Well, no, I mean, yeah, we get to.
[119:18] A: And my interest isn't about time, it's about getting people better. I just like to chunk out the time so that I have it if we need it.
[119:35] B: So according to Wendy, there's a final session next month, probably. But I graduate on the 9th. She said that I had to agree to complete the next session with you.
[119:54] A: Yeah.
[119:54] B: In order to graduate next month, probably. Which is cool, because I still get to graduate before seeing you.
[120:01] A: Right, right.
[120:04] B: Either way.
[120:05] A: And all we want, really, is that you're actually feeling better.
[120:09] B: Well, the reason why I'm asking if there's another session is because I want to be able to try what you've. What we've done here at home. Like, less like if something was like.
[120:31] A: Wasn't that the point?
[120:32] B: What?
[120:32] A: I mean, do you know why I have it set up after we do a treatment session to have somebody come back?
[120:39] B: Well, yeah, that's what I'm saying. I want to be able. Yeah.
[120:44] A: Not just to see how it's going. Hey, I want people to notice what they notice. That's different for themselves.
[120:49] B: Right.
[120:49] A: In terms of how they feel, think, act, react. If there's anything that's still off. We want to make sure that that's better because that's what we really want.
[120:59] B: Yeah. Because I. I wanna. I wanna meet. Make sure that, you know, it's. I don't want this to be the last session.
[121:06] A: No, it isn't.
[121:08] B: Oh, okay.
[121:12] A: Good. Yeah. The bigger question is when you think about the things that we've already talked about, what do you notice in terms of how. How you're feeling?
[121:22] B: You know, it's good because I wanna. I feel good right now talking about it, I guess.
[121:34] A: That weird?
[121:35] B: No, it's not weird.
[121:36] A: It isn't?
[121:37] B: No, I mean, I feel good because.
[121:40] A: Is it unusual?
[121:41] B: No.
[121:41] A: Oh. You typically feel good talking about things that make you feel shitty.
[121:45] B: Yeah.
[121:46] A: Or that used to.
[121:47] B: Because I know that me talking about it gets it off my chest.
[121:50] A: Oh, this isn't about that.
[121:53] B: Duh. But it does. It did both. Like, it relaxed me and it got it off my chest.
[122:01] A: What was it ever on?
[122:03] B: Huh. The weight of it.
[122:07] A: Yes.
[122:08] B: The weight of what I've been going through. Like the images, the past, the car. It weighs on a person.
[122:17] A: It can.
[122:18] B: So talking about it. Yes. Helped with your. The way you did it helped me. But I want to put it into action. Like, I want to be able to sit back and use it. Not just one and done, but it also.
[122:37] A: Watch. Yeah. I'm gonna give you a different thought for this. Once you learn balance on a bicycle, like once you got the distinction, which wasn't. I got. I know what to do. I put my hands on the handlebar, but on the seat, feet on the pedals, and move it in a circular fashion.
[123:01] B: Not that easy.
[123:02] A: Well, that's the knowledge of how to do it.
[123:05] B: Yeah.
[123:05] A: Then there's a moment that as you're in the process, the experiential process process of doing it, there's something that happens at a different level that you get balance. Once you get balance, can you lose it?
[123:22] B: You can. No.
[123:27] A: Without a traumatic brain injury, once you know how to ride a bicycle. Oh, you're always going to know how to ride bicycle.
[123:35] B: No, not necessarily. Because when I grew up on a bicycle, but there for a while, I guess I had some kind of injury.
[123:46] A: I don't know. Right.
[123:49] B: You can forget.
[123:51] A: No.
[123:53] B: Because I did.
[123:54] A: No, I'm gonna give you the. You can't forget how to ride a bicycle because it's not a remembering thing. You can forget your times tables.
[124:07] B: Yeah, I forgot those.
[124:08] A: Right. And then I would have to restudy it. I can't forget balance because it's not Something that I need to remember. It's gotten at a different level.
[124:20] B: Oh, yeah.
[124:25] A: So I may not be as fluid with it.
[124:28] B: Right.
[124:29] A: It's not like it was the first time where I kept falling and couldn't. I may wobble for a moment until I get. But I got it. It's not like the first time. And that's not anything I need to remember. You can go 10 years without riding a bicycle. Get on a bicycle and start pedaling and go. And you might have a little wobble, but you got it.
[124:50] B: Yeah.
[124:50] A: Like it was the first time. Because we. Where it's been learned is at a deeper, automatic level. So when we do change work, it's not about getting feelings off of me. It's about changing how my brain naturally reacts to this stuff. That's why I asked you on purpose. Think about what we talked about. Think about the guy stomping on you and try to feel the distress. And that is the part that's different. Prior to doing the work, you would think about it and feel it. Now you're remembering it and it doesn't have any of the feeling tones attached. It's been unplugged. Once your brain got it, it can't go back the other way. Once you've discovered that Santa Claus is a fictional made up character, you can't.
[125:47] B: Go back to being these real.
[125:48] A: Right. It's done, it's changed. That's the same thing with these kinds of things. That's why we want to go through the process to get it to change. And then. Yes. What is there for you to do in life? Well, what there is for you to do is to notice for yourself what you notice. That's different. Hey, I was in this situation that normally I'd be all like this and I wasn't. Huh. Or you'll go through a situation and then you'll be thinking back about it going, hey, normally I would have been all. And I wasn't.
[126:18] B: Mm.
[126:19] A: Or we'll come up to this situation where somebody cuts in front of us and I might have a. But it went away faster. Huh? Okay. That's what I want you to pay attention to in terms of what you're noticing.
[126:32] B: Okay.
[126:33] A: Or wait a minute. It was a little bit more of a struggle to get me to do something, and now that was a little bit easier for me to do. Right. All of those are the things that we want you to be noticing. That's different for you.
[126:46] B: Okay.
[126:47] A: Right. If you find yourself having certain content or material still show up. That was troubling then we want to know about that so that we can make that better. But it's really kind of noticing. And it'll be easiest at first to go, huh? Normally I would have been all, and I wasn't. Right? Because even if you think about, try to, you know, imagine now like you might be laying on the cog. I want to live like dream things and try to imagine it's like your boyfriend coming to beat your ass. See, that was such a good reaction. Even just the thought. All right, what do you notice? Notice how it's not doing the same thing, right? Because your brain got certain experiences complete when it gets a chunk of them. So you asked the question, how many do we have to go through? There isn't an answer to that. There isn't a how many. It's really okay. When is it better? So for example, if I told you orange, you don't know whether I'm thinking about orange as a fruit or orange as a color. Right? So in generalizing, our brain does a really good job. That's why we do one experience, not all of them. We do one at a time. Notice how you did two separate experiences with two different people and there may have been more than one experience with each of them over time that happened. Did we have to go through every single time? No. But did this guy's generalize to that guy? It can maybe, maybe not. So if I say to you orange, but if I say to you orange, apple bag, banana, you go, oh, it's fruit. Do I have to go through every single fruit? No. But if I've got Wheel of Fortune and a letter's turn and it says phrase, fuck, no fucking clue until a few more letters get turned. And then if I'm any good at the game, then I might know. But somebody like me, okay, I need all the letters to turn before I know. Damn thing is. You follow me with that? So there isn't a prescribed. Oh, we have to go through this number of. No, what we want to do is we want to get it better. Okay, well, how do we know when it's better? Well, we have experience of. Okay, now think about. You can think about a different time with one of those guys and try to feel bad. What do you notice? It's not doing it right? Notice how we didn't talk about it, but your brain already got it. Because what your brain is really good at doing is taking what it's getting and extrapolating. That's the whole ripple effect. But it doesn't mean that it Will take care of all things, with all things. Just one. Because it may need more of a generalized approach. Like if I dealt with somebody who, let's say their uncle molested them, but later on they got raped, will it transfer? Maybe, maybe not. So it might be useful. Do I have to go through every time uncle did something? No. Might be useful to go to their couple so then it can start generalizing to the rest. Does that make sense? And then other kinds of emotions that are unwanted, Whether I've got guilt and shames or regrets or remorses over stuff that I did. Want to get that left enlightened and cleared. Right. We want to get it so that when I'm in a vehicle, I'm reacting to what is happening. That's not gonna mean that, like, he slams on his brakes when you weren't noticing that, you're gonna be like.
[130:49] B: No.
[130:50] A: Right. You would think no, because that would be a distressing thing for anybody. If I'm walking down the road and I hear a that came out of the boat, I'm gonna have that reaction because I wasn't expecting it. And it was a surprise. Right. If I've got trauma related to it, I'm gonna have more of it. The heart's gonna race. I'm gonna be going with it for a lot longer, but I'm definitely gonna have a reaction. So it's not that we eliminate reactions to things. It's that we reduce the frequency, intensity, and duration when it comes to the prior stuff. Yeah. Those things get done. Because that's Santa. The issue, why I was still troubled and why it was still haunting is that part of my brain didn't know that it was over. Right. Didn't know that he may have messed with my stuff, but he didn't get me. And that now there's no single part of your body that's the same as it was when any of that violence stuff happened. Right?
[132:04] B: Right.
[132:04] A: Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. So we can stop with that for now, and then we'll schedule an hour and a half the next time. Do you know what your calendar is?
[132:19] B: I'm good on Fridays.
[132:21] A: Okay, let's look.
[132:22] B: I can do Fridays.
