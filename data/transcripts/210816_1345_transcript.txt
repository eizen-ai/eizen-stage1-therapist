[00:00] A: So Today is the 16th. Is it really the 16th? It is the 16th of August. And Marianne, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is transformative and life changing, what we do may be made available in teaching and training other professionals and how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:23] B: Yeah.
[00:24] A: Cool. Morning.
[00:25] B: Okay.
[00:26] A: Awesome. So when you were in here the first time, you had shared with me one that there has been a whole bunch of things that have happened that although they're over, lay underneath the surface, impact you some more than others, some in different ways than others. But there's been a lot of stuff, some from when you were really little to some more recent. And one of the things that we want to do is unplug the emotional effect that those experiences have had. So the weight and heaviness is lifted. I'm understanding that there's been a lot of hurt and anger towards different family members, siblings, stuff that happened with houses, parents, what have you. There's also been a lot of heaviness with like health related stuff that's happened with parents, dad, mom, what have you.
[01:16] B: Losing my mom right now.
[01:18] A: Yeah.
[01:19] B: She's losing her ability to talk.
[01:21] A: Yeah. So like all that stuff has been really heavy and weighted. And I get that you had been somebody that was up, functioning, active, doing things and gradually things have kind of gone off kilter and even more so after sun passed. Yeah.
[01:43] B: His name was Chiodis.
[01:45] A: His name was Chiodis Jiotes.
[01:48] B: J Y O T I S okay. Means the sun's light.
[01:53] A: Interesting. Cool.
[01:55] B: How'd you pick that Jiotis Sage? I'm not sure. From a baby name book. I knew he was gonna be gyodis if he was a boy or a girl. It's East Indian gyodis Sage if he was a boy, and Giottus Kachina, which is sacred dancer, that they was gonna be a girl.
[02:17] A: Okay.
[02:18] B: It was a boy.
[02:19] A: Okay. Yeah. And that what we want to do is we want to get it so that the impact that those experiences have had are lifted so that things lighten up, that you become more okay in you, more comfortable in your own skin. That would be useful. Yeah.
[02:46] B: Yeah, yeah.
[02:49] A: Well, cool. So you may want to sit up for it. I mean, that's always going to put you into a different state than laying down on the job, right? Yeah. So if, you know, we do stuff that's really, really effective and useful and you're not finding Yourself troubled in the same way you were. If that stuff was no longer an issue, how would you actually be, Marianne?
[03:24] B: Helpful to other people. That's how it would be.
[03:35] A: And what's it like when you feel helpful for you?
[03:40] B: I like it.
[03:41] A: Uh huh.
[03:43] B: I like making people feel happy.
[03:55] A: What's happening now? I don't.
[04:15] B: I just can't anymore.
[04:17] A: I can't do it.
[04:36] B: People think I'm a hoarder.
[04:40] A: And I.
[04:41] B: Have rats, leather, bats, my friends and family to help me. Finally Wendy's helping me. But Christy.
[04:57] A: But.
[05:11] B: You think of trying. I'm tired.
[05:15] A: It.
[05:34] B: I feel like there's nothing left inside. Wherever you go, there you're at. Maybe if you commit suicide, it's the same. I don't know. I just know people shouldn't be like this. Everything's gone. Everything's gone.
[06:41] A: Everything. I mean, you said nobody's helping except people are now. And that you really like to make people happy, but you haven't been. You know what? Make me really happy?
[06:56] B: No. If I was happy personally.
[06:59] A: Oh no, no. What would make me happy isn't about you being happy. What would make me happy is us going. Okay, so there's been a lot of shit that's happened. And I can't get your house to not have rats. Right. And I can't get the shit that you've gone through to have not happened. Well, I can't do a lot of different things other than do stuff to adjust how you find yourself feeling in response to this stuff, Right? Like you're at the effect of a lot of stuff in particular, Sister, as you were telling me about it earlier, her doing one thing, saying one thing, causes all sorts of feelings in you. And wouldn't it be useful for her to not have that much power over you in particular, given that, you know, for you, she's somebody you don't really like at all, hate her. Right. You haven't been liking her at all. So it'd be useful for her to not have so much power.
[08:04] B: It would be.
[08:05] A: And see, the problem in life, Marianne, is that we look through the lens at the stuff in my life makes me feel the way that I feel. Whether it's the past shit that's happened to me, the current stuff that is happening, or the future stuff that might. It is always the stuff that causes the feelings. When that person did that thing, I felt this way. When I did this, it felt this. When this thing happened, it made me feel this way. When I did that thing, I felt like it's always stuff, external Things make me feel on the inside. The problem with that lens is we've got really small amount of power. We've got two choices. I'm either gonna try to change the stuff we work hard to change that, or I'm gonna try to avoid it and get the hell away from it. Those are the two options we tend to have. But you've already learned that in life, there's some shit I can't change and some stuff I can't fully, completely get away from. And then there's all the bad stuff that's happened that I can't get the bad fucking stuff to have not happened. So we got to do something else. That's where I'm going to come in. It's about adjusting how your emotional brain reacts and responds to stuff. I may have given you this silly example that when a lion approaches a zebra, most of us, you and I included, would say, lion is making zebra scared. Makes a hell of a lot of sense. But if we looked at it from another lens, we'd go, wait, no. Isn't it actually the zebra's brain immediately making the zebra alert, motivated and strong? Doing it as soon as the zebra sees senses, feels, smells, thinks lines approaching, it's literally zebra's brain that's causing it in zebra, even if it's doing it in response to the lion approaching.
[09:40] B: Right.
[09:41] A: So from this lens, I want us to consider something that there's been ways in which your brain has been working that's been causing you to feel bad. By bad, we're meaning the stuck and frozen lingering grief. By bad, we're meaning the lingering effect of the prior stuff that's happened. By bad, we're meaning the sometimes hating me, wanting to punch me or choke me out. By bad, we're meaning the anger and hate that I've got towards siblings. By that I mean the weight and heaviness that goes on with how the decline's been happening with Mom. Right? Your brain might do all of that shit to you in response to the stuff all sister's been shit that's happened. But you've recognized as we're talking right now that that way of your brain working has been problematic.
[10:25] B: Yeah, yeah.
[10:26] A: That's really the issue, which I've always.
[10:28] B: Known, I've told people that.
[10:31] A: So this is the issue that's on the table for us to get addressed so that it stops doing that to you. Right. And if we're looking at it from this crazy lens that your brain is somehow making you feel bad. First question, do you really Think that your brain wants you to feel bad. You know, the thing that beats your heart and breathes for you? Is it really out to get you?
[10:53] B: No.
[10:54] A: No, it doesn't want you to feel bad. Do you think it would want you to feel good?
[10:57] B: No, I don't think it cares either way.
[10:59] A: Isn't that weird? See, most people go, well, of course my brain would want me to feel good. But the real answer is your brain doesn't give a rat's ass how you feel. Not because it's not concerned about your well being.
[11:12] B: Right, because it's just a fucking organ.
[11:15] A: Because that's not the purpose of emotion. See what we've learned in working with thousands of different people over time? You're a bright gal. I'm a pretty bright guy. The majority of our brain, emotionally though, works like the brain of an animal. And an animal doesn't have feelings because the brain of that animal is concerned about its mood, its affect, how it feels about itself, whether it's having a good or a bad day. Its sense of esteem, its sense of self worth, whether it feels lovable. It causes emotion for three specific reasons. Get the animal motivated to do something. Get something to stop or solve a problem. It's that simple. When a rabbit sees a fox approach, the brain immediately makes it experience fear to get it to run away. Not because it wants it to have a bad day. The squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire pain, but not because it wants the squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid dumb moron. And now it's embarrassed because it's marred around all the other squirrels. No, simple. Get tail out of the fire. All the negative emotions we experience, hurt, anger, sadness, sorrow, grief, angst, upset, worry, resentments, pains. All those emotions are being caused by that part of our brain that works like a simple animal for the same purpose. To motivate us to do something. Get something to stop or solve a problem. Here's the error. Many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. Solve. It's why you and I have a tendency to feel shitty about the same things over and over and over and over and over again. Good news. Good news. Really good news. Many of the things that we feel crappy about are in time periods that are finished. So we don't actually have to solve the problem. We want to update the timing. Timing is the malfunction that happens. And the reason why is we've got an additional part to our brain that an Animal is missing our intellect. And with our intellect that gives us access to a timeline that no other animal has. Right? That timeline is not a problem if the experience is positive or if the experience is neutral. Because in either of those two instances, the brain distinguishes the difference between the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening. Somebody's telling us about a great trip that they had to Key west three years ago. And when they were down there, they went and partied on Duval street. They went out deep sea fishing, they got to see a Florida marlin, they took their photo next to the sign that says 90 miles from Cuba. They get to ride around on cute little mopeds. Of course they tell us about that experience and we know that they know the difference between remembering being there and being there. It's crystal clear. But see, if it's a negative experience, doesn't matter whether it's a big one or a little one, doesn't matter if it's one that happened just the other day or when I was a young child. And it doesn't matter whether one time occurrence or multitudes over time, any of the negative experiences, the weird, the bad, the awful, the sad, the shocking, the upsetting, the horrific, the catastrophic, the traumatic. Our brain will confuse the memory data and info about it thinking it is it and cause an emotional reaction.
[14:52] B: You mean thinking that it's still happening?
[14:55] A: It doesn't know that it's not.
[14:57] B: Why does it do that?
[15:00] A: Because our brain emotionally has no access to time.
[15:05] B: But why doesn't it do that with positive things then?
[15:09] A: Positive things nobody comes in troubled by positive things aren't being read, is still happening because they weren't troubling. It freezes troubling experiences because it was troubling. Right. Our brain has a negativity bias. So it's pre programmed to remember the negative experiences way more intensely and full body compared to positive ones for survival purposes. So that's part of the error mechanism. When it's a negative experience, the brain freezes it at short circuit. Which means the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening got glued together. So at that deeper, more emotional level, the memory is being read as if it is the awful experience. And it's always ongoingly on. Right. Somebody's telling us about horrific violent encounter they had with an ex boyfriend and how they beat him up badly and broke one of their fingers and bloodied their nose. That may have happened 15 years ago, but as they're telling us about it, all the sender faces all white and their voices Choked up and their arms are trembly shaky. They've got a tear. What the fuck is happening? We're nice people. We were kindly listening to them. Where are they? Back in the experience. We call it that they're reliving it. But what's actually happening is that the memory of what happened is being confused, thinking it's the experience. That's why they're having that emotional reaction. And we can tell that it's affecting them when they were talking to us because we got to see it all over them. But it was affecting them even over the weekend when they were in their pool playing with their kids. It was under the surface. Logically, that person knows that they're safe, that it's over, that they survived, that their nose, that their eye, that their finger, that it's all okay. The problem is that we're also learning that there's another part of their brain that never got that good news. So why I say therapy got it wrong is that therapists were trained to believe that people repress it, bury it, slide it under the carpet, lock it behind the closed door, and that the job is to encourage the person to painfully re experience emoting about that, thinking that that'll get them better, which after a good cry, we do feel slightly better, but we get re triggered by the same crap. So this is not about getting the bad feelings out. It's more about getting the good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know certain really awful experiences stopped, that that moment is not happening, that I made it through it, that I'm okay, which I might know logically, but I don't fully feel emotionally. I think of the person, this guy, his uncle molested him when he was nine. He's 49 now. He's done decades of therapy, and from the therapy he's really recognized and realized that all of what happened was not his fault, that he didn't do anything wrong at all, that it had to do with uncle and uncle being off. He knows that some of what uncle did felt good to him. Not because he wanted it and not because he's gay. But body parts touch in certain ways, are designed to feel, but he totally knows it. He's even done the intellectual work of forgiving his uncle for what uncle did. You would think the guy's fine now. Why inside does he still feel all the guilt and the shame? And he feels it because part of his brain never got that that is over. So it doesn't matter what he learned, where he's Logical. If it doesn't change where he's emotional, it never gets in. It doesn't fully heal. Right. We have the saying in our culture that time does heal all wounds. Except we were only talking about physical ones. We weren't talking about emotional ones because we also still think all those emotional ones, they stay on forever. But it's not that emotional wounds can't heal. They haven't, because part of the brain doesn't know that it's not happening. And if it doesn't know that it's not happening, it can't start to heal.
[20:51] B: Is still happening.
[20:53] A: Well, it's not. See, if somebody was molested when they were nine, they're not still being molested. Where is that molestation? They go, oh, well, it's in my head because I have a memory of it. Right. There are going to be specific experiences that did happen that are not happening now. That doesn't mean that the person's life is working the way they want it to. And it doesn't mean that going through it doesn't still have a negative effect on them. And it still might be spinning problematic programming in them. Right. It's very common. Because the second thing that happens that keeps traumas stuck is that as soon as I go through it, a meaning gets attached to it. But the meaning that gets attached to it makes the person feel worse about what happened and worse about themselves. Primarily because meanings that get attached have one form. When we were little, we were trained to believe that good things happen because I am good. My behavior, my identity is the same thing. Little children are trained to believe that.
[22:16] B: Their behavior and identity are the same.
[22:19] A: That's right.
[22:20] B: And I was told I was bad.
[22:23] A: Well, so people are told lots of different things. But see, here's the issue. Wasn't that you were told that you were bad or stupid. It's that culturally, doesn't matter where you grow up, this country or another, good things happen because I am good. I get hugs, I get candy, I get kisses, I get praise. Once a year, some strange dude drops off gifts to my house because I'm good. Good things happen because I'm good. Which is great if life is good. But see, if that's the messaging, well, then the other messaging has to be true. Bad things happen because I'm bad. So it must be. If they're telling me that I'm bad, I am actually bad. Are they telling me that I'm stupid? I must actually be stupid because they're all adults, they're all older than me, and they Must know more. So I start believing that to be the truth about me. Even if I know it isn't. It starts to become my belief about me, right? The little kid who's six when his parents get divorced realizes maybe not that it's a mom and dad issue and that dad not being around isn't about his lack of love for his son, but has everything to do with dad's dysfunction. But the kid isn't going to feel that way. The kid is going to feel, if my daddy loved me, he would be around. And if dad promised that at 9 he's going to take that young boy to Disney. And so the kid wakes up early waiting for dad and the whole day goes by. Saturday, dad never shows up. The kid isn't thinking to himself, oh well, my dad is an alcoholic. He's probably on a drunken vendor. What a fucking loser. He doesn't get to hang out at the coolest place in the world with me. He's missing out. No, the little kid will translate that to mean if I was more lovable, if I was worth it, if daddy really cared, if I mattered, he would be here. Because the second thing that kids learn, not only bad happens because I'm bad, good happens because I'm good. I cause others to feel it's okay when I'm four to be a narcissist. My world, everybody else lives in it and kids hear it all the time. You make me happy, you make me joyful, you make me angry, you make me frustrated. Layered in, over and over and over again. I'm the cause of how they feel. So if it's bad, of course it's because of me, right? Nobody's shocked when the 27 year old goes out to the bar to celebrate a promotion with co workers. While she's there, one of the co workers had brought a friend. He seemed to be nice. They hit it off, he bought her a drink, they had a fun time. They laughed, they danced. He said, hey, instead of taking Uber, you're on my way home, I'll drop you off. What a nice guy, right? And because she doesn't live in the greatest neighborhood, he offered to walk her to her door. Nice guy. But she had no idea that when she was going to open the door, he was going to force himself in and then rape her, which is what he did. And that's fucking horrible. But worse is of course what she's saying. I put myself in that situation. I should have known better. Right? Because you should be thinking that a co workers friend is going to rape you. But again, the messaging all goes back to because it's bad, it's my fault. So not only do we go through troubling experiences, that gets stuck on the meaning that gets attached to it. Makes me feel worse about me, my identity. Because my behavior and my identity are stuck too. Right? Even if I have an enlightened parent that says, I'm not mad at you, I'm not mad at what you did to the young child, it's like you're mad at me. They have no distinction. So now that we've got trauma active and the meaning attached to it still there, guess what our brain is going to do On a hyper vigilant and super sensitive mode. It's going to scan for it constantly on the lookout for anything that's similar. Always looking, always searching, always looking, always searching for anything that's similar to anything that was painful. The problem is that it confuses similar as same. The soldier dies on the ground when the firework bursts in the air. But not because he doesn't know it's the 4th of July and that he's had a fireworks celebration. He lit it. It's because at a completely different level, part of his brain confused the sound and thought it was a grenade. This woman is telling us about this girl at a party. She goes, you know, she had happened a long time ago to be raped by a large, fat, grotesque man who had blackened nails and missing teeth, happened to be wearing a red bandana around his neck. She's at a holiday party, her boss's daughter, Sweet, innocent little like 13 year old kid wearing a pretty green dress with a lovely red silk scarf around her neck. And she's going, I don't know. There's something about her I don't like. What is it? Is she mean, rude, nasty? Does she have bad. But what? No, she was very pleasant and sweet. She's the boss's daughter. But I don't ever want to be. Yeah, well, is there any similarity? Sure. Red around the neck, brain will continue to confuse it, continue to reactivate over and over and over and over and over again. Sometimes I'm aware of it, a lot of times I'm not, but it runs me. There are programs inside of us that are running us, that are running our emotional states. They're faulty programs, they're not optimal, but they run us. And see, all three of those pieces have one thing in common. They're all based in distortion. See, if I take my hand and I slam it in the sand and I pick it up it does leave an imprint. But is the imprint the same thing as my hand?
[29:00] B: No.
[29:01] A: No. Is the meaning at all? What happened? Did she put herself in danger? Did she get a ride home from coworker's friend? Right. How different is a firework from a grenade? So instead of where therapy missed, we've got to get the bad feelings out. We want to reverse it and get the good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know that the real big negative experiences are over. We want to unplug the memory. That's not erasing it, it's unplugging it so that it's no longer active. So that when it comes to grief and loss, we have access to more of who the person is for us in an ongoing way. Because frequently the loss and the finding out about it gets stuck. And now I don't have access to all the other moments that I experience with the person, even though there's so many more of them, because this is in the way. And even when I try to access them, I've got to go through this in order to get there, which clouds it. I worked with a gentleman one time. He had been married for 42 years. His wife got ALS. There was just a gradual progressive decline. It was three years after when he came to see me. Every time he thought about her, and he was a psychology organizational psychologist, every time he thought about her, he was in extreme pain, even though he'd gotten remarried. Extreme pain, because every time he thought about her, the moment that was there was him kissing her cold forehead as her body was wheeled to the hers. And see Marianne with that moment right there. What was it blocking access to all of the other moments that he experienced in being with her through 42 years of marriage now, which is there more of? Yeah, all those other moments, there's way more of them. So we want to be able to put that moment in context so that we have access to more of who the person is. Second part, with grief, you know that people get conflicted with whether it's okay to not be in pain. Isn't that weird? People go, well, like, I want to not be hurting, but it's not quite okay to not be hurting, primarily because they have lined up that their hurting is their badge proving to the world how much the loved one means to them. Because if they're not hurting, then it kind of takes away how much the loved one means. Except if they're hurting is because of love, which is what it is. It's no longer serving the loved One or them, loved one's not better off with them hurting. I remember working with this young girl. Her grandfather was like her dad figure. And when he died, I'm like, would it be okay for you to not be hurting anymore? No. He's my grandpa and he's not around. How can I not be hurting? I go, oh, because he was a sadist? She goes, what? I go, he was a sadist. She said, no, my grandpa never wanted me to be hurting. That's right. Your grandpa never wanted you to be hurting. I wonder now, would it be okay for you to no longer be hurting? So we want to get things shifted inside so that you get to lighten up a little, so that you get to be more at peace. Even if what happened sucked and we'll never like it that it did. We want you to be more okay so that emotionally you're able to read other people's garbage as being about them. I mean, how much better would it be for you to have freedom as it pertains to your sister so that her doing, saying whatever shit she might do no longer causes all this disruption in you? How much better would that be?
[33:24] B: That would be great, right?
[33:26] A: And see, that's where we're headed, is a you who's much more okay in you who's lightened up, who's much more at peace. Even if there's a lot of shit she doesn't like that it went down. And maybe some of it is shit that happened to her and some of it is shit that she did. We want both to be changed because nobody's better off feeling bad. Right? The field goal kicker lining up for the game winner on our favorite team. We do not want him to feel awful about having missed the one at halftime. You know, thinking to himself, if I fucking had missed this one, I wouldn't even need to be kicking this one. I'm such a loser. I can't. That is not a good strategy for him to make the kick. Right?
[34:17] B: Right.
[34:18] A: We want him to be present and outwardly focused on what it is that he's doing. Feeling good on the inside, much more at peace, Realizing at a different level, deeper level, that everything that has happened, even the shit that I don't like it, that it did, unfortunately couldn't have not happened. So that the person gets to lighten up some. Right? Because watch. I bet different times, even as I was talking, you had different emotions. But I bet right now you can think about whatever you need to think about, feel a little bit of the bad feelings, right? Notice how it doesn't take a long time, right, to feel just a little bit of it, of the bad emotion. Yeah.
[35:07] B: Kind of been feeling them the whole time.
[35:09] A: Yeah. Right. But even as I said it, it turned it on and up just a smidge. Which wouldn't be a problem if it only happened when you chose it. The problem is that your brain has been doing that kind of shit to you at times that you haven't been choosing it. That's the glitch, that's the error. That's the malfunction in the way your brain has been working. So therefore, the you that I'm seeing, those kinds of feelings, that glitch, the you that I'm seeing, she remembers having had it. But if you asked her to get it, she would know how to get it. That stuff's been cleared. So the lingering hurts, angers, resentments, guilt, shames, pains, that's clear and gone. So the you that I'm seeing, she's emotionally present, she's at peace and much more comfortable in her own skin. The you that I'm seeing, her mind's been reorganized to be bringing thoughts to her attention and things that are beneficial and possible for her. So that as the thought comes to mind, it's, hey, I can be doing this. And she's doing it, actually feeling good. The you that I'm seeing is a lot lighter. She's much more at peace. She's present, she's outwardly focused and experiencing other people's craft as being about them. So it's not making her feel anything about herself. This is the you that I'm seeing. Got it. Now, my question for you is a different kind of question. It isn't how it's going to happen that I get you here. That's not the question. The question is, would it be okay? See, would it be okay for you to be like how I just described.
[36:53] B: It would be very okay.
[36:54] A: Yeah. See, with it, okay, guess what? You know what happened? You want to know? Your mind is already organizing towards it. See, just by conceiving of where we're going and it being okay, we're already on the way to it.
[37:07] B: Why do you think that? Because when I said that, I was thinking of myself dead in the van, out after this appointment.
[37:15] A: When you said what? That being this way would be okay?
[37:18] B: Yeah, it would be great. It would be great. I understand all of what you're saying.
[37:25] A: So why did I say that just by conceiving of it and it being okay is on the way to it? Well, first I have to know where I'm going. And then it has to be okay that I could go there. See, if I want. If I conceive of going to Tampa and it's okay for me to go, I'm much closer to being in Tampa than I was before I thought of it. That's on the way to it. Doesn't mean we're all the way there, but we're definitely knowing where we're headed and it's okay to get there, which is closer to it. And see, then our brain responds to things that are crazy, like symbols. Did you know that? Not like symbols like. But symbols like when you see a big yellow arch on the side of the road, you go, oh, that's McDonald's. And you see a swoosh mark on somebody sneak, you go, ah, that's Nike. But neither one of those two things have anything to do with cheeseburgers or athletic apparel. They're just symbols of the company. We want a way to symbolize a you who's at peace, who's present, who's clear, who's who's light, who's much more okay, who's doing things so that as she's doing them, she's feeling good about what she's doing. And when she thinks back about the things she's done, she's glad she did it in that way. This is the you. This is where we're headed. If we were to symbolize this you, we could use a wild animal, something out in nature, something up in the sky, a natural formation of the earth. What comes to mind to symbolize the future you? We make it up. We don't really have one. We're gonna make up a lion. A lion? Yeah. Beautiful. As you see the line, is it moving or still? Still, yeah. So we got the still. Lion being a powerful symbol symbolizing the future you. Now, we want to do some processes that are designed to increase, activate and accelerate your mind response. Really simple and easy things. First, you're going to look up, you're going to think lion. You're going to take a slow breath in. That was the first part. That's pretty easy, right? Second, exact same thing as that. This time, though, after inhaling, you exhale. So look up and out. Think lion. Breathing in. And then exhale.
[39:47] B: I'm not done breathing in.
[39:49] A: No, you didn't have to do it exactly at the same time as me.
[39:54] B: I thought I was supposed to do it right then. Oh, you mean the breathing out. I gotcha. Okay.
[40:04] A: So good. Third is the exact Same thing. This time, though, when you exhale, you close your eyes. So look up and out, think lion, breathe in. And then as you exhale, you close your eyes. And then you can open your eyes. Same exact thing as that. This time, though, when you close your eyes, you're going to keep them closed for just a few moments, bringing your awareness into your breath.
[40:37] B: I forgot if I'm supposed to be bringing the lion down with me.
[40:41] A: No, I didn't even say anything about that. All I said was, you're gonna look up, think lying, and breathe in. Whether lion comes to mind after that or not, either way is perfect. And then when you're ready, you exhale and close your eyes, keeping your eyes close, bringing awareness into your breath. Notice that as you're aware of your breathing, your awareness influences how you breathe, that you're breathing in a way that's just a little bit slower. That's right. And a little deeper than how you automatically breathe. Take a deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Those short moments that eyes were closed, what did you begin to notice within yourself?
[41:45] B: That I wasn't breathing as deeply as I usually do. Because I usually do fill up my whole belly, my chest, and then up to my throat.
[42:06] A: And then.
[42:11] B: I drank something today.
[42:18] A: All we're interested in is just beginning to lengthen the exhale so that your exhale as you breathe becomes just a little bit longer than the inhale. And see, what you might notice is that as you're consciously aware of your breath, your awareness influences how you breathe, which means you're breathing in a way that's just a little bit different than how you automatically breathe, thus altering your breath state of consciousness. Because you're consciously aware of a process. That's right. That requires no conscious effort at all. That's right. And eyes are open. And again, how's your body feeling now?
[43:34] B: Feels better.
[43:36] A: Feels so more intense. More calm.
[43:47] B: I guess. More calm? I. I don't really know.
[43:49] A: You don't really know?
[43:50] B: Maybe it doesn't feel better. I barely breathe a. I work with my breath a lot.
[44:07] A: And the good news is this. Isn't that meaning this isn't about belly breathing? I mean, you can certainly breathe from your belly. That'll be breathing from your gut. But we also want to incorporate that you're breathing from your heart. And then we also want to incorporate that you're breathing from your head so that you can imagine instead of breath going all the way to belly, that it goes in and out from your heart like you can Imagine your breath going in and out from your head, the center of your head, where the pineal gland is located. That as you integrate, you're now integrating your three brains of your head, your heart and your gut. Because they do different things. Head, brain, heart, brain, gut, brain. And that literally your heart and your gut are separate brains, more one way connections and communication goes from heart to head and gut to head than from head to heart or head to gut.
[45:14] B: Say that again, sorry.
[45:16] A: So your head is a brain, your heart is a brain, your brain, gut is a brain. There are 50 million neurons in your heart and about 500 millions in your gut. And there's more one way communication that goes from gut to head and heart to head than from head to heart or head to gut. We want all of your brains or organizing and operating towards the future you that's been symbolized by the lion. And so you don't have to do a lot to make change happen at a deeper level.
[46:03] B: Did you say from gut to heart to head.
[46:08] A: There's more one way communication from gut to head and from heart to head than there is from head to heart or head to gut. There are separate brains that do different things. Head. Brain is about insight, logic, knowledge, it's the idea. Brain, it's the timeline. Brain, past, present, future, it gets lit up by dopamine, likes novelty, newness, it's the predictor. Brain, heart. Brain is about love, passion, interest. Heart is what sustains us when the going gets tough. Heart is also where there's heartbreak and heartache. Gut is all about strength and courage because we hear that people refer to it all the time. She's got guts, she's strong, she's brave, she's courageous. But it's also about well being. It's also about being grounded and centered. 95% of the serotonin, which is our well being chemical, almost all of the benzodiazepines and all the covidnoids are developed in our gut for marijuana that settle the body.
[47:34] B: I was thinking kib.
[47:37] A: So we want the brains to be active in changing. But the other part to it, Marianne, is that there's not a lot that you need to be doing in order to heal, because healing is an inside out. So one of the things that we're always interested in then is getting the body in the right states to heal. And what do we know when somebody's got a cold or the flu or after surgery, what do we tell those people to do? Rest. Why? Because it allows the body to do the internal focus. On healing from the inside out, we're all about getting your body more and more into states of rest. So now that we've got a powerful activator of the lion, that's a symbol symbolizing the future you present, clear, at peace, outwardly focused with that strength. We also want to get your body in the right state by using levers that neuroscience has proven put the body into a state of rest. And the first lever is the one that's most interesting and kind of silly, because it's about lowering our jaw. Now, I don't mean completely dropping it, like, ah. I mean just a little bit. When you slightly lower your jaw, it starts to activate this vagal nerve and put the body into parasympathetic response. So what you'll do is you'll slightly lower your jaw. The second lever is you're going to rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, so your jaw is lowered and you rest your tongue. The third lever is you breathe. But as you breathe, it's a in a way that's just a little bit slower, a little bit deeper, so that the exhale becomes just a little bit longer than the inhale. That's right. So your jaw is lowered, you're resting your tongue, and you're breathing in a way that's just a little slower, a little deeper than how you automatically breathe. As you're aware of your breathing, you can think lion. And your unconscious is responding. Just like when putting seedlings into the soil, covering them up and watering the top. There's something that's begun to happen under the surface before you ever see it. That's beginning within you now as you rest, so that in a moment, when you're ready, you can take a deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And again, those short moments, eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself?
[51:13] B: Pain.
[51:26] A: And as you were noticing pain and peace. Isn't that interesting?
[51:32] B: And fight in my head.
[51:39] A: Mm. What does that mean, a fight in your head? Unusual to notice pain and peace at the same time was the fight in trying to stop thoughts.
[52:03] B: You already do this. You already relax your jaw.
[52:07] A: You actually don't do this. Do you know why you don't actually do this?
[52:12] B: Because I never pictured the lioness.
[52:15] A: No.
[52:15] B: Which changed all, by the way, from a lion to a lioness.
[52:21] A: Do you know why you've never done this? See, what our brain likes to do is think that what I've done, that's similar, is same, but you've never done this in a Guided way with me. So this isn't that even if there are components of what we're doing that's similar to things that you've done, it's not the same as what you've done on your own, by yourself or with somebody other than me. This is the first time that we're doing this together. And the purpose of doing this isn't just for that. It's about cultivating the right states for healing which we're on our way towards. We're just not there yet. So kind of like if we're baking a cake, we first need to gather the instructions to know which ingredients we need. Then we need to go and get the ingredients and then we begin to measure out the ingredients, but also only mix them in a certain order at a certain time. Which I didn't know because cooking is very different. You can dump it all in at the same time. Baking like I tried to make banana bread once, you can't really dump it all in at the same time. Doesn't quite work the same. You actually have to always the instructions in a particular precise order. Yeah. So anyway, we're on our way to be healing and changing. So next I'd like you to think of a time when you were outdoors in nature and you see something that's just beautiful. Like the moment you're looking at it, you might have been captured by and you're like, wow, what is it that you see?
[54:22] B: A drop, a raindrop, a dew drop hanging, hanging off a long piece of grass in the sunrise in the Everglades when I was in sixth grade.
[54:35] A: Yeah.
[54:36] B: It's the first time I ever felt peace.
[54:39] A: Yeah. There's a moment that as you were seeing that and being there, that dew drop during sunrise in the Everglades and you were feeling that sense of peace and people would tell you, oh my. Of course being there is giving you those feelings. But if we looked at it from a different lens. Uh huh. What's happening now?
[55:04] B: I can't even drive through the Everglades anymore.
[55:09] A: Not allowed. Well, good news. What? Because you keep thinking that it is the Everglades, it's giving you the feelings. And then it felt like the whole thing, I can't even drive through them anymore. And that's the place that I had that feeling. As if it's the location that gives it to me. So crazy. I thinking that that's the only place. See, if we think of it that it is that place that's giving you the feelings. What if we looked at it differently? What if we said that being there and experiencing that simply drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because at your center you always are are peaceful, excited. Kind of like if I'm at the campfire and I'm cold and I bring my hands closer and closer in towards the flames, and then I say to you, holy shit, Mary Ann, this fire is getting a lot hotter. Is it that the fire is getting hotter?
[56:37] B: No, you're getting closer to it.
[56:39] A: Right? So we know that in your life there have been multitudes of times where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. The pain, the angst, the upsets, the hurts, the sadnesses. But no matter where you're awareness has been always at your center. You're peaceful and excited. Even if you don't access it doesn't mean that it's not there. See, you can look around and see that there are two of us in this room that we call knowledge. Sometimes people call knowledge light. So we call it light of knowledge. At your center, it's a brighter light. It's light of wisdom. And we've got knowledge and we've got wisdom. And I work with people all the time who've gone through horrific, awful stuff. I remember one girl that I worked with, with long time ago, older brother, used to take Matchbox cars, drive them up her leg and park them in her vagina. Awful. And when we worked together, we cleared it all out. All the pain, all the hurt, all the angst, gone. And I asked her the question. I said, you know, all of that stuff. I go, where was it? And she looked at me with this peaceful and glowing smile and she says, it's gone. I don't feel any of it anymore. I said, I know. Isn't that cool? She goes, yeah. I said, but my question was, where was it? And as the two of us started thinking, I go, was it at the surface? And she looked at me and she's like, no, it wasn't an intellectual thing. I said, oh, well then maybe, maybe it was at your center. And she's like, dude, really? How could that stuff survive? And the light wound peaceful and excited. I said, oh, well then where was it? And this is what she said. She goes, oh, I know. It was hiding in the shadows in between those lights. I said, well, what happened? She goes, the lights, they're now touching. The distortion, it's gone. I said, whoa, that is powerful. And then we started talking about how people walk around frequently thinking that they are their bodies. But what if you're not your body? What if you have a body and your body is yours, but it isn't actually. You and I know that that's true because when my mom was 18, she lost the tip of her finger in a snow cone machine accident. And when, you know, she goes to see people now, they don't say, susie, I'm glad almost all of you could come over. They don't say that because she's all there. Even if that part of her body's missing. We know that there's no cell within your body that's the same as it was when you were born. They've all been replaced millions of times. Your feet are longer than they were when you were two. Yet despite those changes, you're still you. You have thoughts. And sometimes we walk around as if I am the thinker of my thoughts. But what if you're not even the thinker of your thoughts, Your brain is. And what if you have a brain, it's totally yours, but it isn't you. Oh, well, if I'm not my body and I'm not my brain and not my thoughts, maybe I am my feelings. Except you feel different ways at different times, so you can't possibly be a feeling. Oh, well, then maybe I am what I do. But there were lots of things that you've done. And when you stopped doing one thing to do something else, did you stop existing? So that leads us to an interesting, kind of weird question. Because if you're not what you do or your feelings or your thoughts or your body, then what the heck are you?
[61:02] B: Weird.
[61:04] A: Let's just say then, for our purposes with what we're doing, that the who you really are is what you became aware of as you see that droplet of dew on the grass, seeing the sunrise. That in that moment, what was happening, Marianne, is that your awareness was being drawn down and in towards your center. That capital S. Self religion likes to call it soul, spirit, essence. But instead of us thinking of it as a thing you have, let's think of your fingers and your toes as things you have. Let's think of the light at the center as you. And that light at the center, that light can't be touched, hurt or harmed, is whole and complete and totally indestructible. And I say that because you'll never guess. But people come into my office fucking up identity all the time. They tell me things like they're anxious, they're depressed, they're obsessive, they're borderline, they're shy, thinking that the way they feel is who they are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm upset. When I come out and you go, why are you so upset? And I go, you'll never believe what he did. Well, what did he do? Well, first he put me on one of those chairs where my head went down and my feet went up. Then he took this light, bright light, shined it in my eyes. I'm blinded. I can't see a darn thing. Then he takes this cold metal instrument, shoves it right up into inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness. And you're what? I go, my mouth. I'm at the dentist. Which is the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother in the Matchbox car. I said, when you were really little, your brother, he messed with your stuff. And she looked at me with that same glowing smile, and she said, he did. And for a long time, it fucked up my feelings and it screwed up my thinking. Then she looked at me and she goes, but you know what? He never touched me. He never got who I really am. He messed with my body. It screwed up my thinking and feeling, but he never got me. I said, whoa, that's powerful. And so what we want to do is we want you to think of the lion as you take a slow breath in. As you exhale and close your eyes slightly, lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, maybe even relaxing the back of your tongue as you breathe. Breathe in this slightly slower, slightly deeper way. That's right. Notice that with your eyes closed, you don't see the things around you, but instead you can sense the space in between you and everything else. The space that's towards the side window and side doors. The space that's in between you and me and the space beyond me. The space underneath the couch, the space behind you, the space up above your head. And how as you're becoming more aware of the space that moves out in all directions in all ways, space is un unending Space. That's right. When you're ready, slowly find your way back up. Big, deep breath in. And then exhale. And open. Open your eyes. Good job. Those few short moments that eyes were closed, what were you noticing within yourself?
[66:12] B: Space.
[66:13] A: Space. That's right.
[66:18] B: Nothing more lack. Peace. I guess it's the same thing.
[66:29] A: Isn't that interesting? And see, space is unending. And we want our vision to actually move to the periphery. Because when we get highly stressed out, our beta waves are running at a too high of a hertz. And when they run at a high hertz it narrows our field of vision. That's why we call it tunneled vision. When we move down into what the next brain wave is Alpha. Alpha is about flow. Alpha is about being in the zone. Alpha is what surfers experience on the board and alert but relaxed state. And what it does is it opens up our awareness to notice what's in our periphery. Our vision expands and we see more. So the easiest way to do it is simply to look across and see me. But as you stay looking at me, notice what happens when your awareness with your perfect free vision moves out and you can include my fingers staying looking at me and notice them wiggling. And now you're aware of more of the space. And as you become aware of the space, you notice that it goes beyond the room space, that the space moves out in all directions. That the space is unending all the way out. And now just for a moment, close your eyes and imagine what it would be like to float up and out of your body well beyond the ceiling and well beyond the room so that you're way up above it all in the sky space having what we like to call a bird's eye view. Which means you're able to see things underneath and below you. That's right. But not just a bird who's perched one that's able to soar and fly and move all around in all ways in all directions. Soaring, flying. Moving. That's right, free. Up above and over it all you're un conscious now is organizing towards your becoming more free to be more okay in you to begin to lighten up. That's right. And then in a moment, when you're ready, you'll bring awareness back down and into your body so that you re associate and inside. Take a big breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. And again. Those short moments, what did you notice within yourself?
[69:45] B: Freedom.
[69:50] A: Yeah. And as your mind is organizing towards your becoming more free, the unconscious parts can travel back. Back through experiences that happened in your own history. Stuff that left imprints. Meaning all those things that we try not to think about because whenever we do, there's attached. Your unconscious is going to travel back and will bring a particular experience to your awareness that would be useful to unplug and clear. One of those things that I don't like to think about because whenever I do it makes me feel yucky. What is it that's coming to mind now? You got it. Good. The thing that just came to mind happened when, like about how long ago?
[71:01] B: 2016.
[71:02] A: Uh, huh. And the feeling that comes up is a feeling of. What is it? Hurt. Sadness. Anger. Grief. Guilt. Shame. Okay. So the first question I have for you is, would it be okay for you to no longer be hurting in that way? If you were no longer hurting, hurting, would it in any way, shape or form mean that what happened was okay? Right. So you get to be okay now, even if what happened wasn't. And the quick headline, like it was in a newspaper, might be, what.
[71:54] B: Jihadist died?
[71:56] A: Yeah. And so do you have any particular belief Be here. Hi. Notice how you're going there. Hi. Hi. I'm gonna explain to you a couple different things that'll be really, really useful. First, your job, only job while you're here is to intend to be emotionally with me. The reason that you want to be here right now with me, Marianne, is this. What we're doing is what's happening. And that isn't two. You and I are working on a mutual and worthwhile goal that we're both interested in. So is he and you getting to three? This is really, really important. Where are you going? I'm gonna not do the thing. Get here. Hi. No, here. Hi. Right.
[73:05] B: Okay.
[73:09] A: I want you to breathe with me. I breathe all the time. Deep belly. Breathing, breathing, breathing. Woman has stopped breathing altogether. Hi. You do much better when you breathe. Not that kind of breath. That's the, like, panicky, like, anxiety attack breath. Right. Slightly lower jaw. Right. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know that the moment you're thinking about. Now, stop, Stop. Not quite. Okay. We'll get you to be okay. You're coming back to me, right? Because if I said to you, be a mirror, what? What would you do? Be a mirror? Yeah. Not a mirror, the guy, but a mirror.
[74:08] B: Not a mirror to what?
[74:10] A: Not a mirror, the guy. A mirror.
[74:13] B: A mirror.
[74:14] A: A mirror? Yeah. If you were to be my mirror, what would you have to do?
[74:21] B: Reflect.
[74:23] A: So what would you have to do right now?
[74:26] B: Be you.
[74:28] A: Right. What would you have to look like right now? If you were being my mirror, what would you have to look like? Look over here. See what you see about me that you're not doing. What are you not doing?
[74:47] B: That I am holding my hand up.
[74:50] A: Right. So are you being a very good mirror? No. Ha. See, if my mirror did that, I would freak the fuck out. Jesus, Marianne, you're scaring me. My mirror showed the wrong hand. I'm freaked out, okay? Don't mirrors show backwards when you look in a mirror?
[75:11] B: I don't.
[75:13] A: I don't right. Look at a lot of mirrors, but if you were looking in a mirror, it totally is going to be this. Right? It's a reflection, not the reverse. It's a reflection of how I'm sitting. Sitting. Seated. Right. It's a reflection. There you go. And notice as you're being a mirror, what's happening. Right? You're coming back here. Hi. So much better to have you here. Right. So my job is to keep you here. Your job is to intend to be with me. Right. If I notice like I did, that was pretty obvious that you're going there. My job is to get you back here and I'm going to do all I can to have you here. But we have to do a few different things, pieces first. Do you have anything that provides any kind of like, relief? Any beliefs around death, loss, dying, that provide any comfort for you?
[76:30] B: Yeah, hardcore, firm, black and white belief. No, I think I believe in reincarnation. I believe I'm part of Gyodis. They were all part of each other.
[76:58] A: Okay. Have you at all sensed him with you? Oh, yeah, yeah.
[77:05] B: Oh yeah.
[77:05] A: Uh huh. And when you sense him with you, is he in pain?
[77:10] B: I saw him once and he was.
[77:12] A: Oh, well, that would be a misnomer. So I'm going to give you a thought. Might be unusual, but I think it'll be useful if you and I were to do a science experiment with a young child. And we take a glass of ice and we put it out on our patio. And an hour goes by and the kid looks and he goes, oh my goodness, somebody stole the ice. They replaced it with water. We would of course giggle inside. But then educate the child, say, no, no, no, nobody stole the ice. What happened is that it melted, which means it went from a transformation, physical transformation, from something that's solid to something that's liquid. The molecule that's making it up is totally the same. H2O is H2O how we perceive it? Completely different kids looking. Okay, I get it. We leave now, that same glass of water out on the patio. A week goes by, kid comes back, goes, somebody stole it. It's gone. There's water, it's gone. And we go, no, no, the water's not gone. He goes, what? I don't see it. I can't feel it. I can't. I don't touch it. We're going to know what happened. Is the water of evaporated, which we know means that it went from a liquid state to a gas state. But the molecule H2O is H2O how we pick it up, completely changed. And the kid is, like, looking at us like we're crazy. What do you mean, if I don't see it, if I can't touch it, how is it Here we go, it's because you're in Florida. It's all around us. And then we drive that child to the desert of Arizona. We go, you don't feel it here now, do you? And we bring him back to Florida and go, don't you feel it? And we can show him the rain cloud and we can capture the water, we can put it in the freezer, and he discovers it's all the same thing. So what if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop working, it's that their bodies stop working, and because they're no longer in need of it, they exit it? We don't pick them up in the same way we did, but it doesn't mean that they're not here. The deal is, and you might get this even more, that our senses are limited in their scope, Meaning our senses don't have a lot of range to them. I can walk through the airport and not smell the marijuana in the guy's bag, but the dog sure can. Does that mean it was not emitting a smell? Or does that mean that my nose doesn't pick up as much as the dogs? If I blow a whistle and we don't hear any sound, but the dog is going, is the whistle not making noise? We all have cell phones, and those waves are coming in, even though I don't feel them bump off of me. And I can go to your car and I can turn the radio on and we can start listening to music and sing along. But it wasn't as if those radio waves weren't there before we turned the radio on. So there's lots of things that are outside of what our five senses can pick up, but it doesn't mean that they're not here. Einstein. Heard of him before. Freaking smart dude. Do you know how I know he's smart? Everybody who's brilliant after him is called an Einstein. So the dude had to be just like, right? He said two very important things for our conversation. Who we are as human beings is energy plus matter, and it equals this physical existence. And then what became second law? Thermal dynamics. Energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. So what if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, it's that their bodies stop? They're no longer in need of it, they exit it. We don't pick them up in the same way we did, but it doesn't mean that they're not here and they're not in pain. Have you ever seen a chase scene?
[81:04] B: A chase scene?
[81:05] A: Yeah, like an animal, predator, prey, let's say rabbits running for its life. It's far enough away that the fox hasn't caught it, but the rabbit is realizing that there aren't any exit routes and it gets the sense, the knowing that it's death is inevitable. There will be a moment that the rabbit's body will stop and the body will be completely still. Moments stop well before fox catches in that moment, the life force that is the bunny takes the bunny away to not be in the body. So when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop so that their bodies stop. We don't pick them up the same way we did, but it doesn't mean that they're not here. Because we know that your love is as strong as it's always been. That hasn't gone anywhere. He fully feels it. His love for you is also as strong as it's always been. The difference is that you haven't been fully feeling it. Not because it's not here, but because the shine of knowing him in his body is blocking access to, connecting to more of who he is. Because what we get from the people that matter to us, is it the trinkets, the stuff and the things, or is it the experiences of having been with them? And once you've acquired an experience, can you lose it? No. Can you, hi, get here. Hi, be here. Hi. This, by the way, is way more enjoyable than that was. And there's an aspect of your brain that doesn't know that stopped. And we want your brain to have access to more of who he is for you. Right. Can you lose things that you never acquired? Can you lose things that you don't yet have? Really weird thought. If I can't lose what I've acquired and I can't lose what I don't yet have, then where the hell is loss? What if when people's bodies stop, it's not that they stop, it's that their bodies stop? Okay, I see that and see the deal that keeps going on is that we stop seeing them with. So all the images that I have in my mind that used to be me and them together, they're separate. I only see them, not with me. That's part of the issue. I'm no longer seeing an associated picture of them and me together. Second part, I'VE never seen it from up above looking down at the scene so that I'm way up above it looking down, seeing what happened then. And three, my brain doesn't know that the moment of me finding out that that moment stopped. Because there have been, even though that happened in 16 things that you've done after that moment that were more enjoyable than that moment. What's one thing anytime from when that happened until yesterday that was at least a little more enjoyable than that?
[84:13] B: Dancing.
[84:14] A: Yeah. Dancing was more something else of something other than dancing. Yeah. In addition, we're gonna go with three.
[84:22] B: Three things.
[84:23] A: Oh, I know. I mean, putting your shirt on was probably more enjoyable than that moment.
[84:30] B: Yeah. Pooping this morning was more enjoyable.
[84:33] A: Right? Exactly. We don't have to go to the top tier things to get something that was more enjoyable. That's right. But see, there's an aspect when things are frozen that has no access to anything later. When something gets frozen, it gets separated from the rest of my nervous system. Lives on an island by itself. It's not connected to anything later that was more enjoyable. We want it to get connected to things later that were more enjoyable. In addition, we want to unplug it so that the brain begins to read the what happened as data so that I can access to more. Because that whole thing of energy doesn't go anywhere. What if he's closer to you now than he was when he was in his body? Because there's no body in the way. I'll show you something that I think is fascinating. Always blows my mind. Everybody that I know, and you probably included, have played or at least seen ping pong. But this ball is very different because it's got metal components on it. But what's neat is when you put your finger on makes a noise. Really exciting, isn't it? Now watch. Take your finger and touch. Does it do anything? Do it again. Take your other finger and touch mine over here. Isn't that interesting? Do you know what it's doing?
[86:17] B: Sending electric currents through our bodies.
[86:23] A: Who we are is energy plus matter. We know that a light switch, in order for the energy to flow, it has to be connected. It's a circuit. If the light switch is off, it's an opening. When it's on, it's a circuit. So what did I create? A circuit for the energy to flow. When you touched, there was an opening. When you connected, it completed a circuit and the energy was able to flow between you and me. We want you connected to more of who he is. For you, in an ongoing way because he's actually been doing better with this than you have for a while. And he's actually wanting you to be more okay. Like he's actually been doing a lot better than you have. And one of the things that's really troubling, not much of anything other than that he knows that people that matter to him are hurting. Right. Right. So how we clear something is a, you intend to be with me, you tell me very briefly, just facts, what happened in about a minute or less that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened. Then it's over. Three, we've got things that happen later, like dancing or, you know, putting your shirt on or pooping this morning. All of those things way more enjoyable than that moment. We want to get to the end. Then I'm going to do a process that's going to seem really, really weird with memory. I'll show it to you. So that thing happened about 2016. When it happened, you were aware, like the. How did you find out the moment that's coming to mind that's got the intense yuckiness attached? Not by the way. Your brain isn't making you feel yucky because it wants you to feel yucky. It's not causing it because it wants you to be in pain. Do you know why? Do you want to know why? Your brain is actually causing it, trying to motivate you to get that moment to stop. Hurry. Fucking timing is really fucked up. But that's why it's not causing you to be in pain because it wants you hurting. It's causing the pain to try to motivate you to get the moment to stop. It's that. That emotional brain doesn't have access to timing. It doesn't have access to the timeline. It has no past, present, future. Just like an animal. Your dogs are now always now they're as excited to see you when you've gone for an hour to when you've gone for five minutes. Yeah. So we want to get that in. So you're gonna intend to be with me. Hi. Because I'm more fun as you tell me the moment, what happened in like a minute or less. So that moment, when you find out or what it is, that's that you're where?
[89:23] B: At home in Miami.
[89:24] A: You're at home in Miami. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime? 8:10am, 8:10am and you're where in the house? Like in bed or living room or.
[89:31] B: Kitchen or room off the kitchen.
[89:33] A: So you're in a room off the kitchen. Right. And you had Your phone with your mom. Right, Good job. Right, and then what happened next?
[89:38] B: Phone rang.
[89:39] A: Phone rang. Right. And you picked it up.
[89:42] B: I knew, Right.
[89:43] A: And you said hello?
[89:44] B: Yeah.
[89:44] A: Right, Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[89:46] B: His friend is Uri, right?
[89:48] A: Said, so Azuri said, are you working?
[89:50] B: What are you doing?
[89:51] A: Right, yeah. Good job, good detail. That's always a fun conversation to be getting. Right, good. And then I'm gonna have the next and be here. Hi me. That's how you're going there. I want you here. No, not sorry, just be here. Cuz I'm right, right.
[90:05] B: Diotis Pass.
[90:05] A: Right, Good job, good detail. Right? Yes. And then what happened next?
[90:08] B: Through the phone screen.
[90:09] A: Right, Good job. Right, and then what happened?
[90:12] B: My mom held me.
[90:13] A: Right, she held you, Right, good. And then what happened next?
[90:17] B: I said, where are you?
[90:19] A: Right, Good job. Good. Right.
[90:21] B: I got an electric shock.
[90:24] A: Yes. Right. And then what happened?
[90:27] B: And I took a bunch of sandbags.
[90:29] A: Right. And then that moment was over. And then later on you did something more fun like dance or put your shirt on or you know, have a nice bowel movement. Now notice as you were telling me about what happened, there was that discomfort, but not as much because you were already intending to be with me. Isn't that weird? So here's next crazy part. We never go back into the memory. We only go forward. But when you go backwards in the memory, it literally unplugs the memory. It begins to flatten out the neuron and take away the charge. So we're going to go backwards. So we got having that follow movement, we got to put on the shirt, we got dancing, Right? And then you had taken the Xanax and then you had gotten that zap. And then you're like, where are you? Right. And then mom had held you and then you had thrown the phone and then he had told you, and then he had asked if you were sitting down, if you were working. Right. And then the phone rang. And then before that you were in that room off the kitchen with mom. And then before that you probably got up. And then before that you were doing whatever you were doing. And as I go backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it? Painful still same, more or less.
[91:47] B: Same.
[91:49] A: Identical. Maybe more, maybe more going backwards. Really? How so?
[92:01] B: I'm curious because I knew what I know it's coming.
[92:05] A: What's coming? But you knew it. See, memories go forward. But see, here's the difference. The issue is that your brain doesn't know that that moment is over. So if a memory can go backwards how can it still be happening? You're not troubled because it happened. You're troubled because your brain doesn't know that it's not happening. Weird third part that the brain starts to get is it doesn't get logic, it gets patterns of association. And the pattern of association is that the memory of that experience and the experience itself are glued together, so they're living as if they're the same thing. But see, there are things that you can remember doing that you know you're not doing. Like, for example, putting your shorts on. You can remember putting your shorts on earlier today. You can even remember where you were when you did it. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your shorts on? And then I went, marianne, stop putting on your shorts. He'd look at me and go, but I'm not putting on my shorts. Because you're crystal clear, you know, there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you doing it. They're not the same thing. Right? You can remember his friend calling and telling you that. You can remember that happening. You can remember putting your shorts on. Marianne, stop putting on your shorts. Say, I am not putting on my shorts.
[93:47] B: Not putting on my shirt.
[93:48] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. See, you're not putting on on your shirt.
[93:51] B: You're not putting on your shirt.
[93:52] A: Well, then you stop putting on your bracelet.
[93:55] B: Not putting on your bracelet.
[93:56] A: Well, then stop him from telling you that. Say he's not telling me that. Well, then stop that from happening. Say it's not happening. Well, stop me from putting on my shoes. Say, you're not putting on your shoes. Well, then you stop taking your shoes off.
[94:08] B: It's too late.
[94:09] A: Say, I'm not taking my shoes off. That's right. Well, then you stop putting on your shirt. Say, I am not putting on my shirt. Not putting on my shirt will stop me from putting on my glasses.
[94:17] B: You're not putting on your glasses.
[94:19] A: Stop him from telling you that. Say he's not telling me that.
[94:21] B: He's not telling me.
[94:22] A: Well, stop that from happening. Say it's not happening. Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[94:27] B: It no longer exists.
[94:28] A: Bingo.
[94:28] B: Which is what we want no longer exists.
[94:30] A: That experience no longer exists. Do we have a memory of it? Is the memory the same thing?
[94:36] B: No.
[94:37] A: No. That's what we're beginning to get in that. There's data. That's right. See, when you got that moment happened, it short circuited part of your brain, and part of your brain never updated. And that moment's been stuck on since 2016, right? You can remember it happening, right? You can remember putting your shirt on. Marianne, stop putting on your shirt. Say, I'm not putting on my shirt.
[95:05] B: Not putting on.
[95:06] A: Well, stop him from telling you that. Well, stop it from happening. It's not happening.
[95:11] B: It's not happening.
[95:12] A: Yeah. So then where is it? It no longer exists. See, I don't have to stop it from happening. All of the pain that you've been experiencing is your emotional brain trying to motivate you to get that to stop. Stop it. Hurry. Timing is really fucking like. I could say it to you in a different way. We'll stop that from happening in March of 16. Hurry, quick. And you go. What? There's nothing for me to do either, because that experience no longer exists. I still don't like that it did. We never will. But we're beginning to get the pieces to be unplugged. So the brain reads what happened as info.
[96:03] B: Okay?
[96:04] A: We want brain to begin to read it as info about something that happened versus happening. Right? So you'd gotten up, you'd gone to that room. You're with Mom. Phone rang. He asked, you know the lovely question, what are you doing? Where are you? You're sitting down. Son died last night, Throw the phone, all upset, hug mom, take some Xanax, go to bed. Later on, you had a really nice pollen open and you were dancing. So we got dancing. That happened in the bubble. We got put on your shirt, right? And then you're taking the Xanax and the mom was holding you. And then you throw in the phone, and then you got the news. And then he asked, and then he called. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. And again, notice what's happening is we're going backwards because you can remember it happening. You can remember putting on this necklace. Stop putting on that necklace. Say, I'm not putting on that necklace. Well, stop me from putting on my watch.
[97:11] B: You're not putting on your watch.
[97:12] A: Well, then stop that from happening. See, it's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[97:20] B: It no longer exists.
[97:21] A: That's right. That experience no longer exists. That's right.
[97:27] B: It's not happening.
[97:28] A: I know. That's what we're getting in. We still don't like it that it did. We never will. It's not happening. Right. Your brain had never gotten the update that that moment stopped. Your brain had been living as if that moment has been ongoingly happening for the last six years, five years. I don't know. I'm not good at math. Sorry. That's why I got into social work. I'm not good at math. Right. When? What are you noticing now? Right. What are you noticing now?
[98:20] B: Nothing.
[98:22] A: Not weird noticing.
[98:31] B: And I'm freezing up.
[98:35] A: How so?
[98:37] B: Like becoming a statue.
[98:40] A: Really? Huh. What happens like, you know, if we warm you up, you know, with light to lighten up? Because are we thinking that he's wanting you to be feeling shitty?
[98:55] B: No.
[98:58] A: No. Right. Are you thinking that he's wanting you to be like, you know, thinking it's your fault somehow you're to blame for this? No, no, no. I'm thinking that he's thinking, gosh, I'd like my mom to be doing better. I'd really like her life to work.
[99:23] B: I'm thinking that he.
[99:25] A: I was really glad that you were talking to the grandkids. Huh. Right.
[99:35] B: Thinking he wants to just pick me up.
[99:37] A: Cause he's in you just like he is in them. Because the love hasn't gone anywhere. That's right. It's as strong now as it's always ever been. And you're connecting to more of who he is. That's right. That's right. Notice what's happening as you're connecting to more of who he is for you. That's right. But.
[100:19] B: Then I become him.
[100:21] A: How so? Then you don't know, do you? I mean, he can be in you and not become him. Right. The light is the part that's ongoing. The energy. That's right. That doesn't go anywhere. We don't pick it up in the same way we used to. But it doesn't mean that it's not here. That's right. See, we're all interested in you beginning to lighten up. Right? Because just because his body stopped working and therefore life in this 3D dimensional way ended, doesn't mean that we wanted yours to. I mean, you wouldn't want to have a kick ass life, right. In honor of who he is for you, have like life start to work better for you. Mm. Right. Not be so affected by your sister. That might be useful for you too. It'd be more okay in you, right where you're at, getting that there's been a whole fucked up bunch of stuff, shit that happened and shit that I've done, but it's not done right. There's more to it, right?
[102:09] B: Maybe.
[102:10] A: Well, how could there not be? See, no matter what you think you are, you're always more than that. And even now, no matter what you think is happening right now there's even more going on than you know, because there's only so much that your conscious mind can track.7 + or -2 things at a time. Your unconscious is tracking so much more. And see, we're not so concerned with working with Marianne. We really want to work with the automatic part. It's been directing the problematic feelings and.
[102:48] B: Thought that have been there since before gyodis.
[102:52] A: Well, we are on our way to clear up more. Because there's been fucked up shit that you were told as a young child that you believed, but so much didn't want to be true and it wasn't true. It's just because shit got layered in that you started believing it and wanted to overcome it. And for a long time he did try to prove that it's not, but it never was. That's all the distortion. All the distortion. Because the meanings that get attached to negative things make it feel like it's about me.
[103:31] B: Why can't I clean my room.
[103:36] A: When ever? Huh?
[103:40] B: Why couldn't I clean my desk in kindergarten or first grade or second grade?
[103:46] A: Because that wasn't how it fit for you.
[103:49] B: I can't.
[103:52] A: See. And here's the thing. Back then you were told that having a messy desk meant that there was something wrong with you or that you were bad or somehow not. Okay?
[104:06] B: Right?
[104:07] A: Right. Does it have anything to do with that?
[104:11] B: But now I can't even take care of myself.
[104:14] A: I don't know whether that's true. I get that recently you haven't been doing a great job at taking care of you, but I'm not so sure I'm gonna buy into that. You can't. Because I'm thinking that you're a heck of a lot more resourceful than you've been feeling recently.
[104:37] B: I feel like I am.
[104:39] A: Well, we're getting there. We're getting to getting things lifted. Because now, as you think about that moment, what do you notice happening to those feelings.
[104:56] B: Is kind of tiny compared to.
[104:59] A: Right. Notice how that moment is tiny now. It means that the moment is not coded in your brain. Coded, programmed in the same way it used to. Right. We have more to get cleared for you to be free and more okay in you. One of the major things, things we're adjusting is for you to begin to read other people's shit as being about them, which a lot of times you might logically know but don't fully emotionally feel. That's the part that we want to get shifted so that you get more freedom to be more directive in how you want Life to be. That's right. You were directive in how you wanted life to be as you were doing things. But it was also with stuff that was still active.
[105:58] B: You mean when I knew when my life was going finally as I wanted it.
[106:07] A: You have been directed at different times in your life. The problem is that there were still programs that got stuck from negative things that were running it. That are still running it.
[106:26] B: Yeah.
[106:27] A: That are making you feel somehow I'm incompetent. Because you're telling me, like, forgetting my phone yesterday. That's not incompetent. That's being present to Mom. Did I need it for. And me seeing something pretty isn't about me having a photograph of it. Because my photograph of it never has it be as pretty as the thing I'm seeing. I had somebody recently out at the beach tell me about this beautiful sunset. And I got to see it in my mind's eye. And then they sent me the picture of it. Can't. It's a picture. Can't capture it. It's a representation. Right. The map, or map of the world is not the territory. It might be my map, but my map has to be limited because it's a map. Right. Even if we look at the globe and we go over where the Himalayas are and it's a little bit outlined, no way is it fully the Himalayas and how it's a representation of it. We want to update the map. I want you to be more okay in you.
[107:47] B: I want to know to be more okay in me. And part of me feels and understands. Like you said, logically. I know.
[108:04] A: So we want to get it emotional but not logical. Logic doesn't do anything.
[108:09] B: Yeah. And my family just sees me as a fuck up.
[108:14] A: I don't really care about your family and how they see you.
[108:16] B: I know you don't, but.
[108:19] A: Well, I would be liking it more so if you don't.
[108:22] B: I want to be with my mom.
[108:25] A: I got that. Which has nothing to do with what your family thinks.
[108:29] B: It does.
[108:30] A: Not so much.
[108:31] B: My sister's got power of attorney. She thinks I'm dangerous to be around my mom.
[108:38] A: Your sister's mad at you.
[108:41] B: I know that. I know my sister hates me or resents me. I don't know about that or whatever it is. Like, I know there's. There's a lot of issues with her towards me. She says it all the time. Aren't you glad you weren't first born? She thinks I live a carefree life or whatever. I don't know.
[109:10] A: But you don't Know that's the key thing. He just said it.
[109:15] B: I don't know. It's speculation.
[109:17] A: You don't know. There's lots of mind read. So what if what we do gets you to be more okay in you? That you get to lighten up that you're not so at the effect of. Because when you're at the effect of what has happened, you're not effective in communication. You're reactive.
[109:42] B: Right.
[109:43] A: Which isn't useful for what you want. That's right. That's right. So we want. Where we're headed is just like the lioness. That's right. Okay. In you. That's right. So slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Begin to breathe. That's right. In this way. That's a little bit slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. Notice that as you are you can expand awareness out and sense more of the space all around you. Isn't that cool?
[110:38] B: Time's up.
[110:41] A: Isn't that cool? Sometimes it does that. It's Bluetooth. Yeah. But again, checking inside. How's your body feeling now?
[111:01] B: Tired.
[111:03] A: Oh, good. Healing is happening. That's right. Because notice that's not so heavy as it used to be. As it's become smaller.
[111:33] B: It'S being.
[111:36] A: What's happening now?
[111:37] B: I see him in his coffin.
[111:39] A: Oh. Why don't we get that moment clear? Uh huh. Cause by the way, did you touch him when he was in the coffin? Of course. Did you notice that when you did that he didn't feel like him?
[111:57] B: The spider came out of his eye.
[112:00] A: It didn't feel like him, did it? No. Do you know why it didn't feel like him? Do you know why it didn't feel like him? Wasn't him because he wasn't in there anymore, was he? But see that earlier you didn't know that. So this thing happened when you're where? Right, but where were you when that part happened? Like where? Sarasota. Sarasota. Right. And you're in the funeral home. Right.
[112:38] B: This is the first time I got this.
[112:39] A: And was it an open cast or closed? Open. She'd gone up. Right. He ran up. Right. Good job. And then you saw the body. Right. Then what happened? He touched the body. Didn't quite feel the same as he normally did. Right. And then what happened next? What happened?
[113:04] B: My younger son.
[113:06] A: Uh huh. Grabbed you? Yeah. And hugged you?
[113:11] B: I don't breathe him.
[113:12] A: Okay. Right. Because our mind likes to stop the story at the shitty spots. But he had grabbed you.
[113:17] B: I remember him telling me no, about the spider.
[113:21] A: That's right. A little green spider, Right.
[113:25] B: Trying to clear away. And Silas is terrified of spiders.
[113:29] A: Right. Then what happened? People came in, they said their things to you. People maybe had, like, eulogy stuff. Right? And then that moment was over. And then later on, you did something more fun, like dance or put the shirt on or, you know, have a really good problem. That's right. That's right. So we got, you know, having a really good bowel movement. We got putting the shirt on. We got dancing, right? And then there probably was the eulogy. And then people were saying their things, and then he'd come up to you, and then you had seen and then touched. And then you ran in, right? And then you'd gotten to the funeral home. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[114:15] B: Do that again.
[114:18] A: So good. You know, isn't it weird thinking of leaving you were the funeral. I know.
[114:29] B: And how hard that was to do.
[114:32] A: Except not as hard then.
[114:34] B: That made me so fucking angry. Just.
[114:37] A: Huh. That you left the funeral home. So again, going back to. Would it be okay for you to be a. Okay.
[114:48] B: Yes.
[114:49] A: Oh, it would be.
[114:50] B: I know it would.
[114:52] A: Are you sure? Yes. Okay.
[114:56] B: Yeah, I know.
[115:00] A: So we got getting there, got running up, got seeing the body touching, not really noticing that he's not the same. I didn't notice his chest, that he's not the same as he was. Didn't feel the same as you've known him to feel. But at that moment that you. When you touched the body, didn't know that he was no longer in it, then your other son came and held you, grabbed you, moved you away. People had their sayings, might have been a eulogy. And then that time was over. And then you left the funeral home, and then you went and did whatever it was that you did. And then later on, you did something more enjoyable, like dance or, heck, even put the shirt on or have a nice bowel movement, right? So we got pooping. So awesome, isn't it? Yeah. So we got pooping. We got putting the shirt on, we got dancing, right? And then you were. You were doing whatever you're doing. Then you'd left, and then it was over. And then people had said what they said, and then people would come up to you, and then he had held you, right? Then you'd gone and touched the body. Then you'd ran up. Then before that, you had gotten there, and then before that, you're probably getting ready, and then before that, you're doing whatever you're Doing. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, what are you noticing?
[116:18] B: I noticed that my mind goes forward.
[116:21] A: It did. But as I went backwards compared to when you were telling it to me forward, what did you notice?
[116:27] B: I didn't feel as bad.
[116:29] A: I know it's not weird and kind of cool. You can remember all that happening, going up, touching the body, Right? You can remember it happening. You can remember putting your belt on. Marianne, stop putting on your belt.
[116:40] B: I don't know if I can remember. It was already in the shorts.
[116:43] A: All right, well, stop putting on your shorts. You can remember buckling it. Well, stop buckling your belt. See, I'm not buckling my belt. I'm not buckling my belt will stop me from putting on my pants.
[116:54] B: You're not putting on your pants.
[116:56] A: Right. Well, then stop touching the body that he's not in. Say I'm not touching the body that he's not in.
[117:03] B: I'm not touching the body that he's not in.
[117:05] A: That's right. He wasn't in it. He didn't know that he wasn't in it then. Like you are getting now. What? That's right. You didn't know then what you're getting now. That he wasn't in the body then. That's right. That he didn't feel the same. You can remember it happening. You can remember putting your yellow shirt on your hands. Stop putting on your shirt. What stopped me from putting on my shirt? What can stop that from happening? Say it's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Say that experience no longer exists. That experience no longer exists.
[117:45] B: That experience no longer exists.
[117:47] A: That's right. That's right. And see, from here, we want you to educate the younger you. Because she didn't know then that he had already left the body, that who he really is is ongoing, just no longer in the body. Because when the body stops, he had no need of it, so he exited it.
[118:12] B: What if she did?
[118:13] A: She did. Not in that moment. Not in the moment of shock. So go ahead and close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You let her know that that moment's over, finished, completed, that that experience no longer exists. Let her know how you're on your way to becoming okay. And even better than okay, let her know about, you know, dancing, the yellow shirt, pooping. She gets it. That's right. That's right. And what's happening now?
[118:55] B: Just seeing space.
[118:58] A: Right. See now what we want you to do, Close your eyes again and in your mind, eye, see you and him in an image, together, prior to any of that happening. See you and him together. That's right. And as that starts to integrate now, what would it be like to float up above the scene at the funeral home? And from way up above, looking down. Down. Seeing that you down there realizing what you already know. Closer to you now. Because there's no body in the way. That's right. The love that you have is ongoing. The love that he has is ongoing. And it hasn't gone anywhere. That's right. You're becoming more okay. In you. That's right. Seeing it from up above, looking down. That's right. Lightening up. Although nobody's ever gonna like that. It happened. Right. What's happening now? You're doing great, by the way. I'm really proud of you.
[120:35] B: Just thinking, that light, that shock of light. I felt it when he was conceived.
[120:45] A: Uh huh.
[120:46] B: I told my ex I just got pregnant. I just felt this like, explosion of light here.
[120:51] A: That's right.
[120:53] B: And then I felt that same explosion in here. I asked where he was.
[120:59] A: That's right. What are you noticing now?
[121:27] B: Holding his glass. I don't know.
[121:37] A: You don't know what? You're interesting.
[121:39] B: I'm noticing love.
[121:45] A: Right? That's right. Having access to more of who he is for you. Love. What's happening now?
[122:32] B: Thinking about Silas, my younger son.
[122:35] A: Mm. Notice how when you have kids, you don't have to split the love in two.
[122:47] B: You don't have to split the love in two.
[122:50] A: Yeah, it expands, you know, when you have your first. Like, I don't think I could love anything more. And then you have your second, and it doesn't take any love away from the first. It expands. Kind of like when somebody says to me, oh, well, you know, it was really hard for me because it was my only child. Oh, as if it would be easier if you had a second one. Some of the craziest shit that people say sometimes I'm like, oh, right. Because, you know, you're already. Well, it's only that I got another one. Then it's more. No, it's just the dumb things that people don't realize that even are showing up.
[123:28] B: Right?
[123:28] A: Yeah. Oh, right.
[123:29] B: Yeah.
[123:30] A: Because you wouldn't have cared as much if you had a second one. No, I think you would have cared just as much. Right. And the love hasn't gone anywhere for either one who's in his body now and one who isn't. You're gaining access to more. Right? That's right. And what's happening now?
[124:13] B: It's Never the same with Silas.
[124:19] A: How so?
[124:20] B: He always used to tell Gyoda Sona, you guys are so weird. Jyota says you're his best friend. When you said, picture him as you or whatever.
[124:34] A: See an image of the two of you together.
[124:36] B: Together. One time, we both came around the corner at the same time. My living room was my dance studio. It was all mirrored. So I walk and I see myself. And the mirror ends. And you go into the hall. Well, he was coming out of the hall, so it looked like I just faced the mirror. I literally thought I was looking at myself because our hair was the exact same length at that time. Or that exact same height. Silas is never wanted.
[125:14] A: Yeah, but not supposed to be. Do you know why a kid can't be the same as the older kid? Because if I was the same as the older kid, I wouldn't be seen.
[125:26] B: Right.
[125:27] A: So in. In family systems, they have to occupy different positions. The first one comes in and occupies whatever position they want. The second one comes in and has to occupy opposites. So I have a daughter. One has curly strawberry blonde hair and one has straight black hair, or I mean, brown hair. One older one has a hard time making a decision. Even as a kid, when you put out, which outfit do you want to wear? I don't know what, dad, you pick second child. You do the same thing. Which outfit do you want to wear? First child. No, no, don't touch that. She wouldn't. Second child. Oh, that. They have to occupy different positions even when they're sweet. The older one's sweet in, like, she's sweet, like she doesn't ever want to hurt anybody's feelings. Sweet. And the second one, sweet and thoughtful. The first one would never come and rub your feet if your feet were sore. Second one, rub your feet, put an ice pack. Thoughtful. Right. They have to occupy different positions so they couldn't be the same. That's right. And even if it's easier to get along with one than the other based on temperament and who I am and who they are, I can't love them the same. People go, you have to love your kids the same. I go, I don't. I don't love them the same. They're not the same with me. I don't love one more than the other. It's not like my amount of love is different for them, but based on who they are and how they are with me and who I am and how I am with them, I love them differently because they're different with me. Right. That's what you're getting. Right. Right. Not the same. Follow me with that. But not like a lack of the younger one is harder for my wife. She gets under her skin a little more. She doesn't love her any less.
[127:49] B: Right.
[127:50] A: Even if it's easier with the older one. Right. That's how it works. Notice what's happening in you right now. How's your body feeling?
[128:13] B: My butt hurts. And I'm hungry, I'm tired.
[128:18] A: Mm.
[128:20] B: Tailbone from my fall.
[128:23] A: Yeah.
[128:27] B: And yeah, I guess that's what my body is feeling.
[128:32] A: Or at least that's what you typically pay attention to. I bet you there's other ways that your body's feeling because those are the physical ways that it's been hurting and hunger. But what do you notice? What else is happening? Even as you think about the moments now that we just cleared.
[128:55] B: Not much is happening.
[128:57] A: No, you can remember it now. And it's not doing that.
[129:05] B: Yeah, okay. One did.
[129:07] A: How so? Not what it just did. No, not what it had done before.
[129:12] B: Right. It's trying to.
[129:14] A: We'll see if it can try to really get it back and let it. Well, see if. If you can.
[129:22] B: I don't want to.
[129:24] A: Well, before you could not. We're now having you do it on purpose and trying to get it. See. What's the thing that's coming to mind? Uh huh. The mental images. What image is coming to mind now? What happens when the image moves a way, becomes a little smaller down there for you see Beach. See there's a. Oh, beach. Huh. There's a really interesting thing that starts to happen in your brain. I don't know whether you realize it yet or not, but when your brain gets that an experience is finished and that it's data about something that happened versus where it's been coded, living, happening. It can't ever go back to thinking it's happening. I just in the same way Santa Claus. Once you have the distinction that Santa is made up, can you go back to believing in him?
[130:38] B: It depends how much acid I take, I guess.
[130:41] A: But not really believe in them. You can pretend, make it up. Yeah, right. See, your brain gets that it's data about something that happened. It still doesn't like that it happened, but it can't be reliving it happening. I turn on my you to check because I want to make sure we got this where we want it to be for you.
[131:10] B: You want me to go back to the funeral?
[131:14] A: Well, let's think. I mean, you know, you remember driving there, running up, seeing the body touching it little green spider, Silas holding you. People saying what they said. It ending. You'd leaving the funeral place later on having that like, is it the poop? Yeah, right. And see, I went through it that time and notice not the same. Check it out. Yeah, right. We still don't like that experience. Guess what? We're not putting it up on the top three of life will be. See, what we want is we want it to begin first to be read as information about an experience that happened that sucked. Once we read it as information about an experience that happened that sucked, then the brain gets to reorganize because the program isn't running that. That it's happening. It's changing.
[132:27] B: You drank a lot.
[132:30] A: Of different things.
[132:32] B: I was wondering. Is that coffee?
[132:36] A: This is a smoothie today. No coffee. Banana, almond butter, protein powder and.
[132:42] B: Oh, be quiet.
[132:43] A: Vanilla almond milk.
[132:47] B: I ate a nectarine today with rat bites in it and a cheese stick.
[132:57] A: Yeah, yeah. Gotta fuel our body.
[133:02] B: Yeah.
[133:07] A: Yeah. So what are you noticing now?
[133:19] B: I think dread.
[133:23] A: How so?
[133:24] B: I thought about going back home. How gross it is there and how endless the work seems.
[133:42] A: Is it actually endless?
[133:46] B: I think it might be.
[133:49] A: Only when we look at it all at once.
[133:55] B: But I. Right. I don't want to fight you. Like I hate saying, but.
[134:03] A: So it's interesting. If I want to climb to the top of the mountain, do you know the worst way to motivate myself to do it?
[134:11] B: Just tell myself I can't.
[134:13] A: No. Well, that would too. But to constantly look to the top.
[134:20] B: Yeah.
[134:22] A: Seeing how far I still have left to go.
[134:26] B: Just focus on my dishes.
[134:30] A: What it is, is doing that for five years. But what it is, is there's something that I need to take a step towards just that.
[134:42] B: How long can you live like that?
[134:48] A: Live like that? You got a lot of stuff that I'm not gonna know and I'm not mind reading it in filth. I'm not suggesting you live in filth.
[135:01] B: But everything I read. So, like, oh, if you do three things a day, you're great.
[135:08] A: I didn't say three things a day.
[135:09] B: No, I know. I said things that I read. You know, like, okay, so then I'll make myself do my dishes, take a shower, brush my teeth.
[135:18] A: Okay, so you're two separate things happening. There are daily maintenance things. Shower, brush my teeth, comb my hair, put clothes on laundry. Daily maintenance things. That isn't about having your house get uncluttered, decluttered, cleaned, cleared. They're two separate things. Right. So if you think of I'm gonna do Three things that are just the basic things that are daily maintenance, stuff that isn't about the other thing, right? So if we go top of the mountain, I want my house cleared, okay? When I think of doing that, it's overwhelming. So I do nothing. So what do I have to do?
[136:21] B: A couple of things a day I have.
[136:23] A: Well, no, I have to back it down. So if that's what I want, what is the smallest next step that I can take that's towards that. So what we have to do, Marian, is we have to back it, back it, back it, back it down. So let me give you an example. Let's say somebody's office is a mess and they go, okay, I gotta clean my office. They think cleaning their office, they're overwhelmed. They don't even do it. Okay? So, right. It's a lot. If we think of a clean office, what is the smallest next step that I can take that's towards me having a clean office organized? Well, we go, okay, the mail. I gotta go through the mail. Then they think about going through the mail, and it's overwhelming. So here's the problem. That's too big of a chunk. It's like taking a large piece of food and trying to eat all of it at once. Can't do it too much, so we gotta it down. So if that's too much, what's the literally smallest next step that I can take that's towards my outcome. And maybe that is when I go to the mailbox before I bring it in, I go through and rip the stuff that's junk and throw it in the garbage. We have to back it, back it, back it, back it down. So that when the person thinks of doing it, they feel absolutely okay in doing it. That's the smallest step. Then we just have them do that step. Then again, knowing what they want as they outcome, the next, smallest next step will show up. But they can't plan them all ahead of time. Oh, I'm going to do this and this and this and this and this. Doesn't work that way. Dave Ramsey, financial guy, Christian guy, whatever. But he had a philosophy that when people are in debt, most people say you got to pay off your highest and biggest credit card debt that's got the most interest. And his philosophy, fee is you want to pay off the credit card debt that you can pay off the fastest, regardless which one it is, regardless whether it's high interest or you want to pay the one off that you can pay off the fastest. Now, why did he want that? Because then you can build your credit. No, because it actually builds momentum. If I get this one done, then I start feeling good, then I can start tackling the next. If I've got this one that's going to take me forever to go, then I never get to build momentum. So his whole thing was about building momentum. We got a whole thing. We want to start building momentum. Right. So how do I go about doing that? Well, I don't know, because I don't know what your house looks like. But what I do know is, okay, if we want it clean, what's. When you think of it, the smallest next step towards a clean house, not the basic necessity. Stuff like my dishes got clean and I washed my hair and combed it. Not that, but that's towards having my house be getting rid of the rats. Okay. And if getting rid of the rats is the smallest next step, what is the smallest next step that's on the way to getting rid of the rats? What do you need to do first in order to have that happen?
[140:15] B: Find more holes where they're getting in.
[140:20] A: Is that something for you to do? And is there something even before that?
[140:31] B: Not that I know.
[140:32] A: Well, then we'll check, because here's how we're going to know. Doing great. By the way, if you think about looking around the house, that would be outside of the house. Yes. No, no. Inside of the house.
[140:44] B: Yes.
[140:45] A: Okay. As you think about looking inside of the house for holes, as you think.
[140:52] B: About both the holes are both in and out.
[140:55] A: That's what I'm saying.
[140:56] B: Yeah. I thought you meant the rats.
[140:58] A: The next. No. You know that you want to get rid of the rats.
[141:01] B: Yeah. Okay.
[141:02] A: The smallest step towards getting rid of the rats, you said was patching up holes. Oh, no, you said finding holes.
[141:09] B: Okay. Finding holes.
[141:10] A: So here's the question. As you think about walking around both the outside and inside of the house to find holes, as you think about doing that right now, does it feel doable? Okay, so notice that's too big of a chunk. Got it. So if we back it up, what might be the smallest step? Okay, so could the small step B getting the patching material?
[141:51] B: Yes, I have that.
[141:53] A: You already have that. Okay. Could the smallest step be. Look down the front of the house for holes? Not all of the house, but just the front of the house. So again, as I back it down, as you think about looking for holes on the outside of the front of the house, as you think of doing that, does that feel doable?
[142:18] B: Yeah.
[142:20] A: Okay. So did you follow me?
[142:22] B: Thank you. That's been five years.
[142:26] A: So. So the problem is what happens is we try to take too big of a chunk and then it's overwhelming. We don't do it. So we've got to back it down, back it down, back it down. What is the smallest next step? So if we go, the smallest next step, if I go, okay, I'm going to go down the front of my house, I'm going to look for holes, even having to patch them just. I'm going to see if there are any there. As you think about doing that right now, does that feel doable?
[142:58] B: That feels doable. And it made me feel better. But there was a voice that popped up, up in my head that said it doesn't matter. You're still gonna fucking hate yourself.
[143:08] A: Uh huh.
[143:09] B: I don't know where it came from.
[143:10] A: Huh. Whose voice was it in?
[143:13] B: Mine.
[143:13] A: Was. Did it come from back here? Was it over here? Did it feel like it came from top down? Is it on that side?
[143:23] B: No, right in the middle.
[143:24] A: Right, right in the middle. Uh huh. Right. And see that's a part of you that's saying that by the way. What do you think that that part's highest positive intention is for you to.
[143:37] B: Get me not to hate myself?
[143:39] A: No. Isn't that interesting? So that part, that voice, that part of you being hard on you doesn't matter. You're gonna hate yourself anyway. It's highest positive intention is to get you to be more okay in you, right? To feel better about you. But see what that part hasn't been realizing into the extent that you are now, what it's been doing is in direct conflict with what it wants for you. And to the extent that you can begin to realize that voice, what it's been doing is in direct conflict with what it wants. What do you notice happening now?
[144:34] B: You're not sure I want to hurt myself?
[144:37] A: Uh huh.
[144:40] B: Yeah, I'm sure.
[144:41] A: Uh huh.
[144:42] B: Just if I don't. If the voice.
[144:45] A: So now I want you to think of the voice hurting myself. You're gonna hate yourself. Self being that thing that you became aware of as you're in the Everglades, seeing that little droplet and the sunrise. See that self by the way, which I'm not thinking, is the part that you actually hate. See what I'm getting is that you don't like how you feel a lot of times, which is not self. See when you are connected to self seeing the sunrise and that little droplet dew off that plate of grass. That's right. Your awareness was drawn in to experience you. Right? That's right. Isn't that interesting? So a kid is that we haven't been liking a lot of how I feel. And because I don't like how I feel, and I don't know how to not feel that way, then I have thoughts about, like, hurting me or being dead.
[146:16] B: Then I have to take Xanax.
[146:19] A: So now that voice and those feelings of, like, you know, wanting to be dead or hurting me. Close your eyes, grab a hold of those feelings, and let those feeling tones guide you back. Let those feeling tones let that voice guide you back and grow you younger and earlier, earlier and younger. Back towards the first time you had that kind of thought, you heard that kind of voice. Let it travel you all the way back, back, back, back, back, back. That's right. And an experience will be brought to. That's right. Earlier, younger, all the way. And what experience is coming to mind? You might have been how old?
[147:44] B: Four, five.
[147:45] A: Right. And you might have been.
[147:46] B: If that.
[147:48] A: You might have been where?
[147:51] B: My neighbor's. My friend's swimming pool.
[147:54] A: Right. So you might have been in the swimming pool.
[147:56] B: Right.
[147:57] A: And then what might have happened?
[147:58] B: We were skinny dipping.
[147:59] A: That's right. Good job. And what might have happened next?
[148:03] B: Black cat came by.
[148:05] A: That's right. Good. Then what might have happened?
[148:07] B: And the two other girls were like, hey, he's a boy. Hi.
[148:10] A: That's right. Good job.
[148:11] B: Oh, I got out pool and was like, I'll shoot him. I'll show him my butt.
[148:15] A: Right. Good job. Good job.
[148:16] B: And then my mother walked in.
[148:18] A: Right. Good. And then what happened?
[148:20] B: I got an ass whooping.
[148:22] A: She was upset. Oh, yeah, right. She grabbed you. Right. She might have spanked you. Probably.
[148:29] B: Actually, I don't remember. But I do remember feeling horribly guilty about that.
[148:33] A: Right. And then. And then what might have happened next? An adult.
[148:39] B: She probably took me home.
[148:41] A: Right. And then that moment ended. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like dance. Put your yellow shirt on.
[148:51] B: I pooped.
[148:51] A: That's right. So we got pooping. We got put in the yellow shirt on. We got dancing. Right. Then you were back home. And then she might have spanked you. And then she had probably yelled. And then she had seen you. Right. And then you guys. You girls had been playing in the pool. And then you guys got in the pool. Then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. And again, as we go backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it confusing?
[149:15] B: It confusing because it took me a.
[149:18] A: Minute to realize you can remember that happening backwards. Right. Didn't have the same feeling tones. Even though it was confusing. You can remember that happening and her doing that. You can remember it in your short time. Marianne, stop putting on your shorts. Well, stop buckling your belt. Well, stop mom from doing that.
[149:38] B: She's not doing that.
[149:39] A: Yeah, so then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[149:43] B: No longer exists.
[149:44] A: Right. By the way, mom doing that, did that have anything to do with you? No. See, that's so weird. Isn't it cool that you actually thought it did? So the kid comes home with two Ds and two Fs. Mom's pissed, says, you're grounded, Go to your room, wait until your father comes home. Dad comes home, Dad's pissed. Dad goes up to the kid's room, pulls the kid's pants down, takes his belt off and starts beating the kid. Kids feel me, I'm getting hit cause I got four grades. But Izzy. Sorry, I know I left.
[150:19] B: Wait, what's the question?
[150:23] A: Yeah, so the kid is feeling like I'm getting hit because I got the poor grades. But is he?
[150:30] B: No, he's getting hit because his father.
[150:33] A: Because of whatever is going on in dad. Yeah, right. Because there's a lot of other ways a parent could handle poor grades than hitting the kid with the belt. So did it have to do with the kid or what was going on with dad?
[150:46] B: What was going on with dad?
[150:47] A: That's right. That earlier you thought that it had everything to do with you. No, it had nothing to do with you. Had everything to do with whatever was going on in mom. That's right. So I wonder what happens when we educate the younger you with these four words. I want you to repeat them after me. Ready? It's. It's not about me. Right? It's not.
[151:13] B: It's not about me.
[151:15] A: That's right. One more time.
[151:16] B: It's not about me.
[151:17] A: That's right. Now close your eyes. Think back to the earlier you. Let her know that it's over, finished. That it no longer exists. And that mom being that way had nothing to do with you. Everything to do with whatever's going on in mom. It's not about me. So that she gets it. That the earlier you is getting it. What do you notice happening to her face? That's right. And you can open your eyes. Notice how it's not stuck there now. That's right. And see, there has been the more recent thing. 2016. But see, my dear, 2017, 2018.
[151:55] B: 2019. But yes, all of those things, all of those deaths.
[152:02] A: Uh huh.
[152:03] B: Do the same thing.
[152:06] A: Do they now do I?
[152:08] B: I mean, I do the same thing with them.
[152:10] A: Do they do the same thing now? I mean, I mean, check. See? Hmm, That's a start. Is it doing the same thing or is it already slightly different? Even though we haven't talked about them? Isn't that weird that it's already generalizing? Right. Which means we get to go faster through them and getting them cleared. See, we're also interested in changing early programming that has been making you feel bad about you. That probably wasn't your voice to begin with, but then got incorporated. That it is. Right. So that you get to be more okay in you. Things that you would think, how could that still be running in me? But it does. Right? So that's what we're beginning to shift. Because even as you think about the moment with mom right now, what do you notice?
[153:31] B: Anger.
[153:33] A: Towards that. That four year old you?
[153:38] B: No, towards my mother.
[153:40] A: Uh huh. From that four year old you? Huh.
[153:45] B: Well, no, from the adult me.
[153:47] A: Oh, right. Which isn't about that. It's about other things with mom that we just haven't gotten to yet. Because notice the four year old you is actually okay. That's right. See, that's different. Do you follow me with that? Like that's different. We just haven't gotten there yet. On our way to getting things healed. Yeah. So I'm going to use the restroom and then we're going to come back and do more.
[154:22] B: Really?
[154:22] A: Why not?
[154:23] B: Okay.
[154:27] A: All right. So what do you notice for you right now?
[154:41] B: My left eyeball hurts.
[154:46] A: Mm.
[154:47] B: Yeah.
[154:49] A: And what are all the other things that you could be noticing that you don't pay any attention to, but are also going on at the same time?
[154:57] B: Say that again.
[154:59] A: See, there's a thing that you pay attention to certain aspects but not others. So no matter what you think is happening, there's always more going on than that. And see, things are starting to change and transform on the inside. And as you said, there's been anger towards mom. So do you know why anger is there? Not towards mom, but anger to begin.
[155:27] B: With because of fear.
[155:31] A: Anger and fear are physiological emotional responses to threat or perceived threat that for all animals other than human beings, as soon as the threat is over, the emotion's gone. So mama bear sees a man poking a stick at her bear cub. Mama bear gets ferociously angry and attacks man. Mauls him dead. Later in the bear den, the mama bear is not thinking, do you think I overreacted? I mean, I could have just scared him off. I didn't need to kill Him. I feel so guilty. He probably had children. I mean like, probably didn't even hurt the bear cub. That's not going on. Nor if the man was able to get away his mama bear storming around talking to the other bears. Okay, when you see this guy again in the woods, I want you to hold him. Let me know and I'm gonna. Right, sorry. That's not happening.
[156:43] B: Right.
[156:45] A: Because for the bear, it's there to deal with the situation. As soon as the situation's over, it's gone. We're interested in your becoming more okay in you. Anger is also a thing that retards the healing process. Ever heard that? Makes me so mad it makes me sick. It's literal. We're interested in accelerating the healing process of your becoming more okay in you. As you said to me, there were messages that you got told when you were little. You're bad, you're stupid. We want to get that reversed because you overcame that. Because I'm not bad or stupid. But still underneath the surface still felt that way. So no matter how much I overcame with that running, I never really felt fully felt.
[158:04] B: I am a little bad and a little stupid. I feel like still.
[158:10] A: Uh huh.
[158:12] B: Otherwise you'd be here and I'd be there.
[158:15] A: Why?
[158:17] B: Why?
[158:18] A: Yeah.
[158:19] B: Cause I'd probably be a doctor.
[158:21] A: Or not. Or not. That isn't what fit for you? Was it not because you weren't competent or capable?
[158:32] B: No, it's not what fit for me then?
[158:36] A: No, it wasn't. But see, we want the information to get in at a deeper level. That what you were being told wasn't about you. It's about them. Lots of times it wouldn't matter whether it was me or somebody else. That's how they would have been. Think of the kid who carries the tray into the cafeteria with soup. He happens to stumble and fall and now the tray splatters. Soup goes everywhere in all directions. The cafeteria was once really loud. Bustling. Now it's quiet. All the kids are turning. They all see the kids fraud on the floor and everything. And they all start laughing. Some calling them names. Loser idiom. Right. They want. He wants Harry Potter's invisibility cloak. Put it on top of me. Let me get the hell out of here. Feeling like they're all laughing at me. But are they?
[159:47] B: Yeah. Kids.
[159:49] A: Well, here's the thing. As an adult, you and I know better. Because it wouldn't have mattered if there was that kid or any other kid and that school having the same accident. That's what they would have done.
[160:04] B: Right, Okay, I see what you're saying.
[160:06] A: So it had nothing to do with the kid. It had everything to do with what, what happened. Right, right, that's right. See, we want to be getting more of that information in at a deeper level so that you're becoming more okay in you, that you connect more to the capital S self, the essence, more of who you are. Right.
[160:43] B: Fucking voice.
[160:46] A: Right. What'd the voice say this time?
[160:51] B: Dude, it's not gonna fucking work.
[160:52] A: Uh huh. Right. What do you think that that voice's highest positive intention is for you?
[160:59] B: I forget.
[161:01] A: Oh, check it out right now. What do you think that voice? You may have more than one.
[161:06] B: So I don't get let down?
[161:08] A: No. And if you didn't get let down, then what? Oh, that voice doesn't want you to be hurt. Right. So in saying that, it's wanting to make sure that you don't get hurt. What that voice hasn't been realizing is that actually by saying that, it hurts you. And to the extent that you can begin to realize that what that voice has been doing is in direct conflict with what it truly wants for you, it can change. That's right. That's right. Because we're wanting you to become more okay in you, to lighten up. Because this shit, by the way, is far too important for you to be so serious. Unless you're having fun. Because it's totally okay to have serious fun. This shit being life, you know, your life working better. It's far too important for you to be so serious about it.
[162:25] B: Yeah, I know.
[162:26] A: Unless you're having fun, it's okay to have serious fun. Well, we just want you to lighten up a little. That's right. We just want you to lighten up a little, Marianne. Right. So that you'd lighten up on you. Right. See, that's so hard on you.
[162:48] B: Well then it came in and said, well, the world's not a light place.
[162:51] A: Uh huh. It isn't. We just hang out where the darkness is. Maybe we just want to bring the light. Right. See, my job is all about lightening up trauma. It's already dark and happy. I don't need to do anything more to make it more dark and more heavy. I want to lighten up. I want you to be more okay in you, but to be more at peace.
[163:21] B: If even if I was at peace with myself, how can I be at peace with this world?
[163:28] A: Oh, right. Because we have to take on the world.
[163:31] B: Yeah.
[163:32] A: Do you know what I do take on the world? No, I Stay my lane. Do you know why? Because there's only so many things that I have direct influence and control with.
[163:51] B: Right?
[163:52] A: Right. I remember when there was all this fear about North Korea getting a nuclear weapon and it was freaking me out and I was looking on the news cycles all the time. Then it dawned on me. Even if it were true, there's not a fucking thing for me to do. Not like I've got his phone number or could call him. Hey, Kim, what's up? Right, there's nothing for me to do, right? Nothing at all. And I'm hoping that our government has people that have devices that are watching hell of a lot more closely than me. So from that moment, I took off news feeds, I took off Facebook, I took off things that don't make me happy. And I started focusing on what are the things that I can actually do. Stay my lane. I don't have to take on the whole world. I want to stay my lane. I mean, AA's got a great line for all of that, the Serenity Prayer. It's a great line. Not that we want to use it for aa, it's my sister's favorite, but it's about having an idea of what are the things that I can do something about, what are the things that I can't, and how do I distinguish the difference between the two? So I'm going to stay my lane. I'm going to live life. But I can't be so focused on what might happen later, if then now. Because much of it, there's nothing for me to do, even if it's true. Kind of like if you and I, we could walk around going, oh my goodness, we're gonna get hit by a meteor. Could be true. But right now, is there anything at all for you and I to do? Okay, you look now, right? I mean, nothing. So instead we want, want to be staying our lane.
[166:13] B: Right?
[166:15] A: One step at a time, small steps. Smallest step towards what I want for me in my life is moving me towards it. And the coolest part about all of it is life is nonlinear. You know what that means?
[166:31] B: Yes, I do.
[166:34] A: Sorry.
[166:35] B: I know many people who speak in non linear ways and you're like, but life is nonlinear.
[166:41] A: We can't predict what it's going to look like. We can't do it with the weather, we can't do it with hurricanes, we.
[166:47] B: Can'T do it with children, third world.
[166:49] A: Countries, we can't do it right. Life is nonlinear. So all I need to do is take small steps towards what I want somewhere along the way, there's, there's going to be a jamba leap. That's what happens when electrons, they leap. That's where quantum leap came from. So I want to focus on what it is that I can be doing now. It's towards what I want that when I think about doing it, I feel absolutely okay in doing it. Then I know I've reached the smallest next step. So are we all the way done with you? Are becoming more okay in you? No, but are we much closer to our end product than before we started? Follow me with that.
[167:44] B: Yes.
[167:45] A: Just like the baking, you got to get the instructions and you, you gotta get the ingredients and then you gotta measure them out and then you gotta put them in the right order.
[167:54] B: Yeah, I'll just buy cheese sticks. But yes, I know what you mean.
[167:59] A: And then you might be left with a gooey substance that doesn't look like a cake, but hell, it's a lot closer to being a cake than before you started. That's what's happening now. So as we think of your becoming more okay in you, more present and outwardly focused in reading other people's garbage as being about them, that the hurt, the anger, the sadness, the self blame, the resentments, the guilts, the shame, they go, that it adjusts so that you read and experience other people stuff as being about them. And then depending on who it is, you have options on how you respond. Maybe based on who it is and what they're saying, you might respond in a caring, loving, nurturing, supportive way. Other times you might respond in a very firm directive, fuck you. And other times you might let it slide by because it's got no fucking stick. Like rainwater on the roof. Brought the ducks back. It's gone on the next. That's how we want things to be. As you are becoming more okay in you. So one more time, think of the lioness. Take a deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. That's right. As your eyes are closed, slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Breathe in a way that's a little bit slower, a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe as you're aware of your breath, my voice, background sounds. That's right. Noticing all of that at the same time. The other than conscious parts of your mind are taking in and absorbing, fully integrating what it's got in mind. And because your unconscious now is interested in working in ways that are best, it's also scanning and sorting through experiences that have happened that left imprints on your Way to becoming more free to be more okay in you. That's right. And then when you're ready once again, take another deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. What are you noticing now?
[170:53] B: Kind of a sloppy cake.
[170:57] A: And what's a loss in 2017? That used to create a whole bunch of, you know, Just run through the. What happened? How'd you find out?
[171:09] B: I don't remember how you found out.
[171:11] A: Hmm.
[171:13] B: My godfather slash cousin.
[171:16] A: Yeah.
[171:17] B: He committed suicide.
[171:19] A: Yeah. Right. And you can remember that happening? Well, I mean, know that it did.
[171:32] B: Yeah.
[171:32] A: You can remember that it happened. You can remember that you put on bracelets. Stop putting on your bracelets. Stop putting on your necklaces. Stop me from putting on my socks.
[171:48] B: You're not putting them on.
[171:49] A: Well, then stop him from doing that. He's not doing that. Well, stop me from putting on my shoes.
[171:58] B: Don't put on your shoes.
[171:59] A: Don't stop me from putting on my shoes.
[172:01] B: You're not putting on your shoes. You're not putting on your shoes.
[172:04] A: That's right. See, again, look here. Would it be okay for you to be okay if you are okay, Marianne? Does it mean what happened was okay? If you're okay, does it mean what happened was okay?
[172:32] B: No, but.
[172:34] A: Right. I think it was okay that he did it. Yeah. So what about. It's troubling right now?
[172:44] B: I miss him.
[172:46] A: Oh, right. Cause you just haven't been feeling him with you. Right. Not because he's not here. Right. See, that's the problem with the grief thing, is that we think that when the body stops, they're gone. But what we've already begun to discover is that when the body stops, it's not that they stop.
[173:10] B: But what about suicide?
[173:13] A: Oh, you're gonna go with the religion thing.
[173:15] B: The dreams like crazy ass shit about everybody that's died. I've been able to like.
[173:22] A: Yeah.
[173:23] B: Feel semi Being contact with.
[173:26] A: Right. But you had a belief that suicide wasn't an okay. Only because you've had a belief.
[173:34] B: I guess I was brought up with.
[173:36] A: You were brought up that suicide is Right. That's right. You were brought up with a belief that.
[173:42] B: I don't know that I believe that now.
[173:44] A: Right. But you did believe it then.
[173:47] B: Yeah.
[173:47] A: Not even when that happened. But when you go to have. That's right. That there's apparently a place called heaven or hell, and only the Christians get to go to heaven and the rest go to hell. And if the Catholics, they get the penthouse suites.
[173:59] B: Yeah.
[174:00] A: In heaven. The rest of the Christians, Baptists, kind of. They get lower end, you know, leave them down on.
[174:06] B: The Catholics are behind a wall. They don't know anybody else is there.
[174:09] A: No, they're way up above. They're on top of all the rest of them. Right? Because they look down at the rest of it. Oh, you're not Catholic. We have the Pope. But see, that was a belief, right? That happened because he was hurting. Not well, but not him. Essence based on what was screwed up in the biology of the brain, of what was going on, based on experience and life circumstances and. Right. The essence of who he is is ongoing. But because I had that belief that it meant, like, he would be going to a different place. As if there's a different place that the Catholics go. Well, then fuck the Buddhist man. They're fucked. And then you got all those reincarnation people. Thank goodness for them because shit keeps growing.
[175:08] B: Oh, you're gonna fuck me up tonight. Oh, my God.
[175:12] A: But see, Marianne, all that stuff had everything to do with stuff that I learned that I believe to be the truth. Right.
[175:24] B: What is the truth?
[175:25] A: I'm not smart enough to know it, but I'm also not thinking that, you know, God and Jesus are made in man's image and that there's more than I know. And how come Christians aren't Christlike? They're the most judgy sometimes people that, you know, like, Christ was judgy. Really. And maybe we should take the Bible as the gist, not the word, because there's some good points in it, but maybe not all points. And if it was, if the Bible is the word of the Creator who created everything, boy, he didn't really know a lot about science.
[176:03] B: He was a jerk.
[176:04] A: And if we go Old Testament, asshole God, New Testament loving God, like, dude is bipolar to begin with.
[176:11] B: Yeah.
[176:12] A: And why do we start wars now? God's old, takes naps.
[176:15] B: God what?
[176:16] A: He's old. He takes naps.
[176:20] B: Nice.
[176:22] A: Why did a fucked up thing happen? Because Jesus, the disciples and God had, like, this fair spinning wheel. They all put money in the hat. Who are we going to fuck up with this time? And they pull a name out. Oh, and they spin the wheel to see what they're going to do. No, see, what we want to be getting is that there was a time that you thought that's what's been in the way. That because it was because of suicide, that he's no longer around. You don't have access. What if that's not true? What if nobody likes that it happened, but that he's okay because it just didn't work in this three dimensional world for him. Follow me with that.
[177:09] B: I do.
[177:11] A: And then that's what's been in the way. So close your eyes and think back. Because you don't fully even remember all of how you found out. But knowing that it was that let that you back then know what you know now, that no matter what you think is going on, there's always more going on than that. And that when the body stops, it's not that they stop. And that heaven and hell aren't places above the stars and skies and below. That it's simply all here, just in a different plane that I don't pick up and sense in the same way I used to. But the essence, the love hasn't gone anywhere. His for you or yours for him. And the only difference is that he feels yours and you haven't been feeling his. Not because it's not here, but because that belief has been blocking access to who he is for you in an ongoing way. That's right. So that you can begin to lighten up. That's right. What's happening now? Start.
[178:25] B: What?
[178:26] A: I said that's a start. See, it's kind of cool because when I said that's a start, you know who answered the question?
[178:39] B: My eyeballs.
[178:40] A: No, who? You're unconscious because you didn't decide to take that breath. It's like sometimes when you have a. Hmm. I didn't decide to do. My body did. Oh. That means what's happening is getting in. Because we're not just talking with the part of you that's up here. We want to talk with all of you, your conscious and other than conscious. That's right. So that you get to be more okay in you to lighten up. Because we know there were some. Some crazy priest like Uncle Boy he was. Well. Mm. Who might have even done weird things to your body. And some of it might have felt good, but not because you wanted it. Because body parts touch in certain ways, are designed to feel good. And that would have been all confusing. And then you were told that you were bad, but who was the adult and it was the child. The good news is you can remember that that stuff happened and what he said in the same way you can remember putting on your shirt. Stop putting on your shirt. Stop me from putting on my shirt.
[180:10] B: You're not putting on your shirt.
[180:11] A: Well, stop him from doing that. He's not doing it right. So then where it.
[180:17] B: I don't know.
[180:17] A: Say it no longer exists.
[180:19] B: No longer exists. Not doing it.
[180:21] A: That experience. No Longer exists. By the way, there's no part of you right now that's the same as it was then. So he may have messed with your body, screwed up your feelings and thinking.
[180:40] B: Oh, my uncle.
[180:41] A: Yeah. But he never touched who you really are. He never got you. He never touched who you really are. That's right. He messed with your stuff. He never got you. Watch. Shake your hand and hold it like that.
[180:58] B: Do what?
[180:59] A: Hold it out like that. Look at this spot right here. As you look at that spot, I'm gonna bring my hand close. You'll notice that as my hand gets closer, before it touches your hand, you'll be able to feel it. Isn't that weird? You feel the energy, the warmth?
[181:17] B: Yeah.
[181:17] A: From my hand. Yeah, that's right. Which means I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings or screwed up your thinking. Because you can repeat this after me. I have a nose.
[181:39] B: I have a nose.
[181:40] A: I have 10 fingers. I have 10 toes. But I'm not my nose, my fingers or my toes. I have an ass. I'm not my ass. I'm sometimes an ass, but I'm not my ass. It's mine, but it isn't me. Right. So he messed with my stuff. It screwed up my thinking and feeling. But he never touched who I really am. Cause right now, Marian, I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body or screwed up your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with respect.
[182:26] B: What if there's nothing there?
[182:27] A: And love that weird. What if where there's nothing where.
[182:34] B: Coming.
[182:35] A: Out of my hand is there needing to be something that comes out of your hand?
[182:40] B: Energy.
[182:41] A: Uh huh. Which you can begin to feel.
[182:46] B: Yeah, I can feel it.
[182:47] A: That's right. Isn't that weird? You can feel energy. Take a deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. That's right. And this hand drops down the same rate at which you drop deeper and deeper down inside. Towards that calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy. Delight at your center. What you became aware of as you see that blade of grass and that droplet of the dew and the sky as the sun is rising. Connecting to more of who you really are. On your way to becoming much more okay in you. Or lightening up, becoming even more okay in you. That's right. That's right. And then when you're ready, you can take your time enjoying the resting. You'll find your way back up. You can open your eyes. That's Right. What are you noticing now?
[185:20] B: Strength.
[185:22] A: Hmm.
[185:23] B: But sadness.
[185:25] A: Hmm. Sad that you're strong.
[185:31] B: Sad that I had to leave that spot.
[185:33] A: What spot?
[185:34] B: And that little girl. Everglades.
[185:36] A: No, you never have to leave it. It's in you. It's not anywhere other than in you. This is not the spot. If I didn't come back when.
[185:47] B: What if you.
[185:51] A: Or what if you grow her up? Taking all the resiliency and strength from having made it through difficult stuff. The only people in life that sign up to go through adversity to get stronger are those fucking crazy Navy seals. The rest of us just get it along the way. But there's not a single person that goes through adversity that doesn't come out stronger and even that much stronger when things are cleared and healed. See, why I don't feel stronger isn't because I'm not stronger. It's that it's not fully integrated because there's active trauma. In the same way, anxiety, somebody never feels stronger when they're anxious, yet they absolutely are stronger. There's no defense mechanism in the body that's going to have the body become weaker. It's that the strength is in the person's legs and it's not making logical sense to run fast.
[187:00] B: You lost me.
[187:02] A: See, anxiety makes people stronger over years.
[187:06] B: The.
[187:07] A: But the strength is in the legs.
[187:10] B: That the anxiety gives you.
[187:13] A: Yeah. So if somebody's got nervousness, think about it. Person gets pulled over by the police, it causes their nervous scared. They got an immediate physiological and emotional response. And the same thing that happens for the rabbit. Heart rate goes up, blood pressure goes up, breathing becomes faster and rapid shallower. Highly oxygenated blood is quickly circulated through the body infused with adrenaline and glucose. All of the energy is directed towards the animal's legs to get it to run fast. So the guy gets pulled over by the police. Is it a good idea for him to get out of the car and start running fast? Bad idea. Officer looks at him and goes, boy, not only are you stupid, you ugly not. Guy's fucking pissed. You don't get to call me ugly. All the energy that was directed towards legs now get redirected towards animal's jaw. Anger clinch. Is it a good idea? When the officer reaches for license and registration for the guy down, Bad idea. So we have to become stronger. Even though we don't feel it, we don't feel it because the. The strength is in the wrong spot. When somebody's nervous and anxious, they're not thinking, oh, I should probably go for a fast Jog didn't make any sense.
[188:39] B: I used to run till I would throw up.
[188:45] A: That was adaptive then. But for most people, that's not what shows up to do. Yeah.
[189:09] B: So I'm pretty strong.
[189:11] A: You are on your way to be getting stronger. Because what's happening with us clearing stuff up is it's reinforcing the resiliency. I can't fully be strong if stuff is still active because that's vulnerable. Open wound is still there. As these experiences get healed, it's no longer an open wound. Solidifies, makes it stronger. And that's what's happening. Because again, as you think about the experiences that we talked about, notice how they're not having the same feeling tones. That means your body isn't reliving it, it's reading it as data about bad shit that happened. That right versus happening. Isn't that interesting?
[190:16] B: It is, yeah. Why does that happen to some people with trauma and not others? It seems like.
[190:28] A: I don't think it doesn't happen. I would say that it's like a worn path. So there's not a single woman that we've worked with in Sala Freedom that's gone through programming that hasn't had some form of early childhood sexual abuse. What does that do? It makes her more vulnerable. So if I've had trauma after trauma after trauma, what am I more likely to experience on the next trauma? It's like weaken the bridge and then eventually it's going to collapse. Right. So I may go, how come that person didn't get affected like I did? Well, they may have not had the six earlier experiences that you did that were similar, that made you more susceptible to it lingering in affecting you. Right. They know in research the person who's prepared for the war scene has less post traumatic stress because they're ready for it than the person who was riding in a convoy and it hit an IED and blew up half the convoy. They survived. They will be at the. Because they weren't expecting it. So the Navy seals who are planned for, prepared for no going in have way less rates of post traumatic stress than the infiltrate who weren't expecting it to happen. It's shock that makes it.
[192:11] B: Marcus Aurelius says we should seek out adversity.
[192:18] A: Right.
[192:18] B: In order to gain strength.
[192:21] A: Right. Because all the stupid people I know know that quote. Uh huh. Yeah. I just wanted to say that just so you could get it. Uh huh. Notice what's happening. Right. Yeah. All the really dumb people know those quotes.
[192:44] B: Thank you.
[192:48] A: Right, right. Yeah. See that was A good breath, too. Yeah. So we're on our way. You did really, really great today.
[192:59] B: Thank you.
[192:59] A: We'll get back together again.
[193:01] B: Yeah.
[193:01] A: Yeah.
[193:02] B: I'll just wait here. Is that okay?
[193:10] A: Unfortunately, we have no kids.
[193:11] B: Did you need another kid?
[193:13] A: Right.
[193:14] B: You said you have a blonde and a redhead.
[193:16] A: Yeah. Well, strawberry blonde and see? Darn it.
[193:23] B: All right.
[193:24] A: Yeah. Yeah. You did great today.
[193:26] B: Thank you.
[193:27] A: Yeah.
[193:28] B: I feel better.
[193:29] A: I bet I do. Yeah. And then your job is to notice what you notice that's new and different for you. Not same and similar, but new and different in terms of how you're feeling, in terms of what you're thinking, in terms of even things that used to trigger that aren't. Because that's what you're going to notice. You're going to be in situations that normally you'd be used to feeling.
[193:49] B: And you're not like my sister, which is like ongoing trauma.
[193:54] A: Well, we're on our way. We haven't fully gotten that part done, but. But we're on our way to begin to get it read as info about her. Right. Because even with that uncle, it's not about me. That happening. And him saying that had nothing to do with me. Everything to do with what was fucked up in him. It's not about me. Right, Right. And as the younger he realizes it, what do you notice happened to her? That's right.
[194:27] B: Little spitfire.
[194:28] A: That's right. See, that's about changing the lens so it reads differently. That's what we want to be doing. Yeah. So we're on our way.
[194:42] B: Sometimes I get that feeling that people don't want me to be everything.
[194:49] A: I have no idea about that. Yeah.
[194:52] B: Get into that shit next time.
[194:54] A: No idea about that. So do you know what your schedule is?
[194:58] B: Yeah.
[194:59] A: See if I can find mine. I have mine.
[195:07] B: The only reason I remember putting on my pants and shirt this morning is because what the shirt says. I was like, you can't wear this shirt. Like it's the only clean one can find. Who cares? Yeah, that's funny.
[195:44] A: Okay. I can do Monday the 30th.
[195:47] B: That's my son's birthday.
[195:49] A: That works for you. Or I can do Thursday the 2nd.
[195:59] B: I don't know. Giottus's birthday is the 30th and my granddaughter's.
[196:08] A: Yeah.
[196:10] B: Might be good for me to be here. Might not be.
[196:15] A: I don't know.
[196:17] B: Shit. I don't either.
[196:19] A: But see, here's the cool part. You can think about it. Now, what do you notice? You just checked. What'd you see?
[196:29] B: I don't wanna notice.
[196:31] A: Was it the same?
[196:38] B: My denial part? Yeah.
[196:40] A: Well, you try to go to that, right?
[196:43] B: I try to go to my denial, Yeah. I just tried and it worked. I just went numb thinking of the idea.
[196:53] A: Except now we're connecting to more of him. And was that a troubling time?
[197:01] B: His birthday?
[197:02] A: Yeah, when he was born. Was that happy? I mean, you wouldn't want to actually like feel good.
[197:12] B: Okay, we'll do the 30. We'll do the 30.
[197:21] A: Oh, so good.
[197:29] B: Okay. What time?
[197:32] A: 10:00. Jesus, is that too early?
[197:39] B: I used to get up at 4. Now I get up at 5 in the evening.
[197:44] A: Right.
[197:45] B: What's your next? 10:00. I mean, that's ideal because obviously a great way to start the day.
[197:52] A: Great.
[197:54] B: Can I get here a ton? Sure, why can't you? You can do anything.
[198:02] A: Yeah, I work.
[198:05] B: What is your next time?
[198:08] A: Um, I can switch it and do 11 if that's better.
[198:13] B: But then we'll be hungry.
[198:16] A: I don't know whether you'll be hungry. No.
[198:20] B: Lunchtime.
[198:23] A: 11, is that better?
[198:29] B: What about 10:30?
[198:31] A: I can't do 10:30.
[198:32] B: You do have hours, huh?
[198:34] A: I do, but not that day.
[198:36] B: Okay, that's just weird. And that's your thing.
[198:44] A: So I have another block that I have that can be available for somebody. I'm gonna do lunch at 1:00 that day. That's why 11:00 would work or 10:00 would work.
[198:54] B: Okay, let's do 10.
[198:56] A: 10:00 it is. All right, cool. And the thunder rolls.
[199:05] B: I like the that.
[208:50] A: Hey, honey. Hi, daddy. Where are you? I'm at the office. Hello? How funny is that?
[209:07] B: Hey, honey. You're so cute.
[209:10] A: I love you. Oh, you're such a sweet kid. You're so fun. Did you want one of these?
[209:19] B: Us too.
[209:21] A: Is there the other stuff in your car?
[209:23] B: Other stuff?
[209:23] A: Yeah.
[209:24] B: Yes.
[209:24] A: When it's raining outside I can go get. I figured we would sit where Sarah is, cuz it's.
[209:31] B: Is it open, unlocked, and the lights on? She's running 15 minutes late.
[209:35] A: She called me whenever I was leaving.
[209:36] B: Which is when I decided to go do this one. No, daddy.
[216:51] A: Here you are definitely.
