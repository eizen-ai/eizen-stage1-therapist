[00:00] A: Alright, so today is the 30th of August, Marianne. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And if what we do is truly valuable and life changing, it may be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:16] B: Yes, that is okay with me.
[00:18] A: Okay, cool. So in checking, right, like I know that we did a bunch of different pieces with trauma. Now you were telling me that you. You had some dysregulation. That's what I would call it when you left. Because there's certain things that are changing in your brain from how it used to operate to what's beginning to happen.
[00:42] B: There was one more really weird thing that happened.
[00:44] A: Yeah.
[00:45] B: I've had left eye pressure all my life. Like my mom took me to a bunch of different eye doctors and one of them finally said something like, I have prenatal scars in that eye. But Dr. Marlow, who I worked for for years, said no, you have migraines. Those are migraines. And they happen quite often. So it's like 50% of the time I have. And when I was here, I had some pressure. No pain, you know, just pressure. It's just this weird, horrible pressure. But it became for the first time painful like that evening. And then it like almost popped and relieved itself. Not, you know, literally, but just like the feeling of it. And that was the first time that's ever happened.
[01:36] A: Okay.
[01:37] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[01:38] A: So a lot of things are reorganizing in the way that your brain has stuff coded and wired. Right. So I want to just check. When we think about specific experiences, that what I would call we clear, meaning unplugging. The emotional effect. When you think about, you know, learning about cousin and suicide. When you think about mom and the spanking after skinny dipping with friends. When you think about uncle. When you think about seeing son's body at funeral. When you think about those experiences. What do you notice as you think about those things now?
[02:23] B: I just got stuck in giotis at the funeral. The other things. Yeah, the funeral still.
[02:31] A: How so?
[02:36] B: I don't like it. I don't. I don't even like going downtown.
[02:40] A: Mm.
[02:45] B: It's shouldn't be. I don't know. Today's his birthday. He'd be 30.
[02:53] A: Yeah.
[02:58] B: I mean, I guess it doesn't. It's not freaking me out as much. Look, pressure's coming into my eye. I guess I. I guess I do like it was when you listed Those things, like the skinny dipping, made me giggle.
[03:21] A: Mm. Learning about cousin stuff that happened with.
[03:28] B: My cousin, I've been thinking about a lot. I don't know if that even really bothered me that much. My uncle, I think what bothered me more, because he didn't. It was so subtle. There was never any, like. I mean, the whole family's there watching tv, and he's just like.
[03:54] A: There wasn't penetration.
[03:56] B: Yeah, it was pretty. And my sister.
[04:00] A: The uncle's stuff was more not just what he did, but the saying that you're bad.
[04:07] B: Yeah. And the rejection of the family when I spoke out loud about it, which to me was very weird because I thought we all knew it, because my handicapped sister and I knew it. We laughed about it. We laughed about it at the dinner table. Even my dad, you know, kind of laughed about it. Creepy he was. But we were all going to get to go into heaven because he's a bishop. Catholic. Maronite. Bishop wrote.
[04:39] A: Right.
[04:41] B: You know, so. But when I, you know, said something to my cousins, that was the wrong thing to do. And I think that's maybe what bothers me more. Maybe it does bother me. I never realized it. I just have always joked about it all my life.
[05:00] A: Well, sure.
[05:01] B: I mean, he's a Catholic priest, so it is.
[05:03] A: But it's the coping mechanism.
[05:05] B: Yeah. And I'm the youngest.
[05:07] A: Is to joke about that stuff happening.
[05:11] B: Right. Really? I should just go to Lebanon and kick him in the fucking nuts?
[05:17] A: No, it's more about unplugging it so it's not running. And the same thing with. There are different components. So when we think of grief and how grief gets stuck or frozen, there is sadness and then there's frozen grief, Sadness over loss, sadness in that it was too young or it shouldn't have happened, or that's all sadness stuff. Frozen grief is moment being relived, re experienced, replayed in mind. Right. So my question, because we want to do pieces to get this to be shifted, lighter, better. Because I'm not thinking that Chaotis is wanting you to be feeling shitty, wanting you to be feeling stuck, wanting you to be hurting over what happened. Right. Nobody's happy that it did. But I'm not thinking Jiotis is wanting you. Oh, you know what? I hope my mom's life fucking sucks.
[06:37] B: You don't know. Jiotis. Let me. Some days, right?
[06:43] A: No, but some days, but not in the overall scheme of things. And not thinking that that's the plan, so to speak. Right. It's not like, oh, yeah, no, that's what I really want for her. And I remember working with a young girl, and, you know, when. When we have pain with stuff, pain tends to be there because pain is my badge of how much they matter. See, if I'm not hurting about their death, then maybe it means it didn't mean so much to me.
[07:21] B: Right.
[07:22] A: So my hurting is my proof to me and the world about how much they mean. And if it really impacts me and my life and how I'm doing, then they meant a lot. A lot, a lot. Except there's a problem with that, right? Because I remember working with this young girl, and it was really funny. Her grandpa was like her dad, so he, like, was there and present and raised her, and she was in so much pain. And I'm like, well, would it be okay for you to no longer be hurting? No.
[07:55] B: Oh, yeah.
[07:55] A: You told me that my hurting is. No, it's not okay. Oh, okay. So was grandpa a sadist? No. My grandmother never wanted me to be in pain. That's right.
[08:13] B: Yeah.
[08:16] A: So how else can we be honoring who the person is for me? Well, what would grandpa really want? Well, grandpa would want one whenever you think of him, to remember all the good in those connections with him, to really be connected to the presence and the essence of who grandpa is for you. That's one thing Grandpa would be wanting. Grandpa's not interested in you hurting every time you think of him. Grandpa's not interested in you being in pain and sad and angry. Right. Second thing that grandpa would want is wanting life to work really well. In the same way I frequently will talk with military guys who have had survivor guilt because they survived and their buddy didn't. And that makes a lot of sense. But where we get to with them is what your buddy, just like you would if it were you, would want the life to work really well. Right. Your buddy's not wanting you to have a shitty life. Maybe in honor of who your buddy is, isn't like, you know, to put his name on your chest or. But to actually have a good, wholesome, working life in honor of who he is. Right. That's what I was saying to this young girl. Like, grandpa, want your life to work really well. Want you to know that he's with you whether you can sense him with you or not. He's with you because of all the lessons you learned, all the experiences you acquired, all of the time that you spent together. You can't lose any of those things. You may not have a future time with him, but you never actually had that that was imagined. That was a thought about maybe, but not actually happened. You cannot lose all of those moments. So grandpa and the lessons you learned and the things that he taught you and the experiences that you acquired, all of those are still with you. They're in you. So he's in you, that light, right? And that's the same kind of thing for you, right? Because we know that Jiotis is not wanting your life to suck. He's not. He might every once in a while go, yeah, but not thinking, you know what? Gosh, I hope mom wakes up on my birthday and just feels shitty, right? Or the day of the funeral. I hope that next time that that comes around and the week leading up to it, she's just in such a fucking funk and doesn't even know why and then realizes, oh, I remember, it's because.
[11:29] B: Right, right.
[11:30] A: Like there's nothing going on about any of that that is desired or wanted, right? Instead wanting you to be more. Okay, wanting you to be more at peace with what happened, even though we don't like it that it did. Wanting you to. Instead of having. Well, it shouldn't have to be having that deeper level understanding that unfortunately it couldn't have not happened exactly the way it did. We want that deeper level understanding. So I'm not continuously trying to get back to a time period that is no longer in existence, right? All of the shoulds, Marianne, are about me trying to get back to a time period that no longer exists in the same way. And I may have given you this example. The guy whose brother died in the motorcycle accident a year ago is thinking he should have gone on the ride thinking that because if he had, his brother might still be alive. You don't even need to go to a chiropractor. That was pretty good. That was pretty impressive right there. Like, I gotta go to the chiropractor. And they go. You were like, all right.
[12:49] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:56] A: That was really good.
[12:59] B: Felt good, I bet.
[13:01] A: Yeah. So that whole thing of we want things to lighten up so that I have more access, ongoingly, to the essence, to the experiences.
[13:18] B: So. So when I first left, like the first week or so, whatever, I was trying to remember how the brain. I was trying to explain to somebody some of the things you explained to me, but I was like, well, it's like my brain is stuck in the past. I couldn't remember how to. Or that memory is like our bot. And I'm like, you know, are you still putting your shirt on? And they're like, never mind, man.
[13:58] A: It would be.
[13:59] B: I got a lioness on my head. Okay.
[14:01] A: Be really hard for you to explain it.
[14:03] B: Yeah.
[14:04] A: To somebody else when it was being done. That's like trying to describe surgery as it's happening to you afterwards.
[14:11] B: Ah, okay, good answer.
[14:13] A: You weren't the one doing it. Like, how are you supposed to describe it?
[14:17] B: Yeah, I can't. They're like, well, what is he, a voodoo doctor? I'm like, I don't know.
[14:20] A: Right. But the should is the person's brain. See, intellectually, I can think in the future and in the past. I can conceive of things that haven't happened yet. I can conceive of alternatives to things that are already over. I can think about something and conceive of it never going down that way. No other animal can do that. Animals can only think about doing things that they can do. If they can't do it, they can't think it. Dogs are not depressed because they can't climb trees. They're actually not thinking they should be able to. Wolves don't see birds flying in the air and say, oh, if I had wings, I'd be after those birds. Bird who got hurt and is hobbling wolfs, like, I'm after that one, not the one that's flying. Because for an animal, they can only conceive of doing things that they can actually do. So where the problem lies is, is if in my intellect I can think of an alternative outcome that if that were to have happened, it would be better. Like the guy in the motorcycle, if I go on with my brother, he might still be alive. That would be better. So the emotional brain will go, well, then what are you waiting for? Go on the ride with your brother. Come on. If that would be better, he might still be. What do you go. Go on the ride, quick. The problem is, can he actually do it?
[16:03] B: Right.
[16:03] A: Right. And that's where the error comes in. So all of what we would call the pain is actually trying to motivate him to go on the ride with his brother a year ago. So in trauma, when our brain recognizes either a, that the experience itself no longer exists, that's where that situation, silly thing about I'm not, you're not, it's not. Comes in when the brain realizes that the experience no longer exists, or secondarily, when it realizes that there's nothing for me to do, there's nothing to be done about, stops causing the feeling. Your brain isn't out to get you and wanting you to feel hurting just for shits and gales. It doesn't do that for the rabbit. It causes the response to get the rabbit to be motivated to run fast away from the threat. That's the whole purpose.
[17:03] B: Fight or flight. Also in that whole.
[17:05] A: Right. The whole purpose of the emotion is to motivate action. Do something, get something to stop, solve the problem. The error is that many times our brain is making us feel, trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. Because either the problem is already over, meaning the experience no longer exists, so there's nothing to be done about it, or it hasn't happened. Right. Somebody who's feeling anxious about flying and you go, when are you flying? They say six months from now. Well, definitely start early. There's nothing to do even right now about them flying in six months. Is there anything at all for us to do in this moment? No, there's nothing to be done about that. They're not even in the plane. And that's part of the problem, is that people think they get on the plane. Well, I gotta go get on the plane. No, no, no, no. You never want to get on the plane. Very shitty seat. You always want to get into the plane. It's kind of like when somebody has a fear of going over bridges. Nobody wants to go over the bridge. It's okay to go across the bridge to the other side, but nobody wants to go over the bridge.
[18:25] B: Words are strong.
[18:27] A: Yes. They matter.
[18:28] B: Oh, yeah.
[18:30] A: So that's why we want to get in. Because there are certain aspects when you've thought of that shouldn't have happened. Right. And some of it might have been we should have figured out what was going on with him earlier. Because then if we had, then we might have been able to get out of that place or have done different or da da, da, da.
[18:50] B: Right. But logically I know that even if we had, it wouldn't have worked and he would have been in the hospital for a year. Most the most likely scenario. Unless we caught it like that day.
[19:04] A: Right. Which is the interesting thing because we could say, well, hurry. Catch it that day, quick.
[19:09] B: Yeah.
[19:09] A: And when you get it that, oh well, there's nothing to be done. No hurry, what are you waiting for? Catch it now, quick. There's nothing to be done about that. Why? Because that experience doesn't exist. That's what we want to be getting in. Not that he doesn't matter to me, because again, where I get conflictual and it pains, ping pongs back and forth, flips is. But I've been so used to Being in pain over what happened, that my pain is my proof that he matters. I bet there's lots of other ways that we could show that he matters to you without you hurting.
[19:48] B: Right, right. Of course. But now, is that always just like.
[19:53] A: In talking with the grandkids and sometimes hearing. Hearing him in them and seeing him in them. That's right. That's right. There's that old song, you know, I wish I could have told him in the Living Years.
[20:14] B: Yeah, there's a lot of old songs like that. Say what you need to say all those.
[20:18] A: But the Living Years was like, I heard my dad say whatever in my baby's newborn tears. I wish I could have told him in the. Maybe it's like, you know, 80s. You would have heard it because it was.
[20:35] B: I wasn't born until, like, 86, I'm sure.
[20:39] A: Me neither. Right. Yeah, 87, 86. I didn't go through the 80s and have Ms. Pac man and Pac man and Galaga and all of the really cool games.
[20:50] B: My. My friend that's staying with me that I rescued.
[20:54] A: Yeah.
[20:54] B: Because I need to rescue somebody.
[20:56] A: Yeah. Cause you didn't have anything else going on.
[20:58] B: Yeah.
[20:58] A: He's a good painter, though.
[21:01] B: He's a good drinker.
[21:03] A: Well, tell him that he's got a pain a little before he drinks.
[21:08] B: You know, he. We grew up. I think I told you that. Maybe if you saw the movie Cocaine Cowboys. But you know Pablo Escobar.
[21:17] A: Oh, yeah.
[21:18] B: And he, you know, his family was right in there in the 80s. That's what we were talking about. The 80s. Yeah.
[21:26] A: Yeah.
[21:27] B: And what were you saying, Pac Man? No, we talk about it. We were just cocaine kids. But it was Miami in the 80s. It was like Pac Man. You would go to a party.
[21:41] A: Miami Vice, Don Johnson, you'd go to.
[21:43] B: A party, and they'd be, you know, on the tables like peanuts at that time. And I did play Pac man, too, though. But anyway, go ahead.
[21:56] A: They actually had arcades.
[21:57] B: Yeah.
[21:58] A: Go into. And play video games.
[22:00] B: Oh, my gosh. They don't anymore, I guess.
[22:02] A: Not like that. No. We played video games at home that are better than the video games in the arcade.
[22:11] B: Damn. How are you gonna look at boys?
[22:14] A: I have to do it a different way now. You Snapchat them or you swipe right, left, or whatever it's called.
[22:23] B: Yeah.
[22:25] A: So again, what we want is. We want things to lighten up so that you get to be more okay in you. Okay.
[22:33] B: Doesn't mean it's funny. It got heavy as soon as you.
[22:36] A: Said that, being okay. In you.
[22:39] B: We want things to lighten up.
[22:41] A: And I went, ah, right. Because we want them to stay heavy and dark.
[22:46] B: Apparently, something in there. Yeah.
[22:49] A: What's the conflict? You know, that part of you that actually caused it to get heavy.
[22:55] B: I think maybe the conflict is, how can you lighten up in such a horrible world? I guess. Absurd. Absurdity.
[23:06] A: Here's the best way to lighten up in a horrible world. The problem that we all got trained to believe when we were little is that life is good, and if I'm good, my life will be good and I'll live happily ever after. We literally had a person make millions of dollars drawing a stick figure with the word life is good on the top of it. And that stick figure is like playing golf or baseball. He's throwing the Frisbees out, camping with his dog. He's driving in the Beetle Bug. He's like, when I see somebody with those shirts on, I literally want to run up and clothesline him and knock him to the ground and ask him, how about now? Is it still good? And then kick him a few times in the ribs and stomp on their chest. How. How about now? Because the problem in life is that we think life is supposed to be good. And then every day we are constantly disappointed by how fucking shitty things are. It would be way better for us to be thinking that life isn't good. That way we're not upset when the bad shit happens. Of course life isn't good, but we get to be pleasantly surprised every once in a while. When you have an experience like you did in the Everglades, where you see the bead of water as the sun is rising off that grass. Because we all have those moments, too. Even if they might be fleeting or not as many.
[24:44] B: That's another thing, too. Since my last visit, I have felt like I could visit the Everglades.
[24:52] A: Yeah.
[24:53] B: Which before was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[25:02] A: So that's where we want things to be easier inside. Not that me being lighter means the world doesn't have heavy stuff, but the cool part about the world and me is that I only have my lane. So you may or may not be surprised, but a lot of people all day long have the news channel on. It doesn't matter what news channel it is. They're listening to the news all day long and surprise, surprise. Those people have a tendency to have higher levels of anxiety, higher levels of mistrust, higher levels of depression, and I wonder.
[25:57] B: But they're more functional.
[25:59] A: I don't know whether they're More functional. They might know about what's happening in the world, but they're not happier. They're not happier because constantly the news doesn't put out there the really great things that have happened. Right. The news doesn't say, we've gotten X number of people out of Afghanistan. Isn't that awesome? The news goes, 13 Marines died on the suicide bomb. Right. So it's not even that the news is equitable in terms of what we purport. We purport the bad. Why? Because sensationalism is what gets ratings. Outrageous. That's the whole silos of the Facebook. Facebook's whole marketing strategy is let's get you to be on our platform for a longer period of time. So they have now artificial intelligence watching you that know you better than you. And what they discovered is outrage. Having people be upset keeps people engaged longer. So if the artificial intelligence goes, huh? What keeps people on our platform longer is outrage, what does it start to feed them more of?
[27:22] B: Debatable things to be outraged about.
[27:25] A: That's right. And that's what they start to see more and more of. Because Facebook makes all of its money. We are the commodity. They make their money based on our attention. The longer that they're able to keep us on their platform, the more money they make. Instead of us being, you know, because attention is the Spanish commodity, we're the ones not being marketed to, we're the ones being sold. Our attention is being sold and they're monetizing off of it. Right. You know, so that's. The whole world does things in that regard. We want what's happening to not be focused on external. So one of my suggestions for people who are constantly having the news station on is have it on first thing in the morning. If you need to know what happened overnight, have it on at 6 o'clock, watching the local and world news. Turn it off the rest of the.
[28:38] B: Time or six o'clock in the evening.
[28:40] A: Or six in the morning, six o'clock in the evening. That's when the typical local and world news is. Then turn it off or don't have it on at all. Because the majority of it doesn't actually impact you on a day to day basis. So I removed all social media, I removed all news, I removed all of those informational things because none of them helped me in my day to day life.
[29:27] B: I've just started using Facebook a little bit more to try to keep in touch more with my friends. That's another thing I've been doing like texting, just seeing how different friends are and stuff. Because during those three days of total craziness, I realized how isolated I am in that big house alone with three dangerous dogs. Nobody wants to come over. I don't really want them to anyway. But at the same time, like, I've always. Not always been an introvert, but I am now. I've always am an ambivert, but more of an introvert now that these changes have come into my life, you know, the grief. And I don't drink anymore. Like, I never had a problem drinking. Well, I did in junior high, maybe a little after high school, but nothing, you know, like, I didn't have to go to aa. I just stopped drinking.
[30:43] A: That was all being done during the young and stupid years.
[30:46] B: Yeah. Yeah. And then Jiotis and I. He introduced me to craft beer. So that was kind of special. I drank some beer, but then when he passed, I couldn't drink the beer anymore. It was just. And I don't even remember the point.
[31:07] A: That you've been isolated and you're now connecting to people.
[31:10] B: Yeah.
[31:11] A: Through Facebook, which is useful.
[31:13] B: Yeah.
[31:14] A: If you use it for that modality.
[31:17] B: Do you know what I posted? And I had no idea. And then I started freaking out, thinking, oh, my God, do I have dementia? Because I'm getting paranoid now. Like, my sister. I posted, this guy and I are having major problems because I keep telling him, you know, the drinking. No, we can't be together. I don't care if we known each other since we were 15, you know, or even before that, and we were best friends and whatever, and I love you very much, but I don't like you when you're drunk. I don't like who you become. And, you know, come on, man, you're 50. It's a nice camper. But you're still in my driveway. But where was I going with that?
[32:05] A: Facebook. What you posted?
[32:08] B: Yeah. It was so weird. One evening when he was drunk. I mean, he's already, like. He already smells. He drinks all night. He smells like vodka in the morning. And he came up with this thing. He. I can't take it when you're sad. You knew I was sad before you moved back to Miami from Colorado. You know, we'd been talking. You knew I tried to commit suicide. I never knew that. I'm like, what are you talking about? You knew I was going to suicide camp in Key Largo, and that's why I spayed my dog and neutered my. That's what I call it, suicide camp. You know, I spayed and Neutered my two dogs to go there. And, like, we've been talking about this. No, you're on. I'm like, dude, your brother told you not to date me because of some of the things, you know, he's seen me post because his brother and I have stayed in contact on and off through the years on Facebook. Marcus had some major issues and drug issues and stuff and was just kind of MIA for a long time time. His brother George, though, when he found out he was, you know, gonna come up here and you. We were dating. He was like, I don't think that's a good idea, man. She's pretty bad. Like, I know she's cutting a lot now because I was very open about it on Facebook.
[33:44] A: What were you concerned about most recently?
[33:47] B: So the tech and the text just. I had a screenshot of this text and I put on it. You even. I mean, you knew before you started dating me about my cutting and my suicidal ideations. I didn't even put attempts. And he put. He wrote back, no, you're wrong. We even had a discussion that you told me George told you, you know, not to date me. And I guess that's where I had, like, cut it off with. I posted it on my freaking Facebook. I think maybe I meant to send it to him. I really have no idea because I wasn't even angry. Like, it wasn't like, you know, like, usually I remember anger, and then I started thinking, oh, my God, what if he just came in my room and did that just to embarrass me on Facebook or something? And then, like, he can't figure out a phone that well screenshotting. So I don't know, I immediately took it off. I wouldn't even have known it was there, but one of my friends, you know, reacted to it. So I've been mortified. I haven't been on Facebook since. I've been embarrassed. But. Yeah, no recollection at all.
[35:25] A: Yeah. So the part of you now, as we think of what we want is we want you to light up the part that felt heavy. What do you think that part's highest positive intention is for you?
[35:51] B: That's a hard question. Because I want to think scientifically, and I would say it would be to most motivate me to not do or think about doing or thinking about having done whatever it is that's giving me that feeling. I would think scientifically that is its highest intention.
[36:20] A: Now, all parts of you, Mary, want that may be a component of it. Right. All parts of you are interested in things being best for you. Survival is in there, right? But your brain and all the different aspects and all the different parts want to work in ways that are best for you. So if. When I say we want you to lighten up and a part feels heavy, what do you think the heaviness. That part highest positive intention is.
[37:11] B: Motivation is the only thing I can think of.
[37:15] A: Huh. Uh huh.
[37:17] B: I mean, I don't think it would want me to feel bad, but I.
[37:20] A: Think, well, it might be causing that. Right? And it might be causing it because what that part hasn't realized is what it's doing is in direct conflict with what it truly wants for you.
[37:38] B: So when you said lighten up that time, and I. I pictured the cemetery in Miami, when I got that feeling again. Because when you said it, it came again, it wasn't as strong. But then the flash of the cemetery came in and.
[37:53] A: Who's in the cemetery in Miami?
[37:56] B: Everybody.
[37:57] A: I'm not there.
[38:01] B: My grandmother, my grandfather on my mother's side. My mother's plot.
[38:07] A: Yeah.
[38:07] B: Is there. My father and my sister are there. And my aunt and uncle and my cousin Norman has a tombstone or whatever. I don't know what they're called when they lay down, but I believe he was released in the ocean. But my sister and my dad and my grandparents, we used to go every week.
[38:33] A: Right. Even though they're not there. I mean, their bodies might have gotten placed there, but they clearly were not in their body anymore when it was placed. Have you ever heard of Saved by the Bell? No. Do you know where that originally came from?
[38:54] B: No.
[38:55] A: Sometimes people would pass out.
[38:57] B: Oh my God. Save. Really? That's where it comes from.
[39:01] A: So they bury and they put a bell there so if the person woke up, they could ring the bell.
[39:06] B: I told my ex boyfriend to do that for me.
[39:09] A: Say by the bell. It's literal. Isn't that fucking nuts?
[39:13] B: That is.
[39:13] A: We used to bury people alive, not knowing that they weren't dead. And then when they came to, they'd be underneath and.
[39:21] B: And they were not Uma Thurman.
[39:23] A: Right, Exactly. They could ring the bell. That's where Saved by the Bell.
[39:28] B: That's where Blondie got her song from. You can read my book.
[39:39] A: Okay, so are we thinking that all of those relatives are still around or are wanting your life to be not a life worth living for you?
[39:58] B: No.
[39:58] A: No.
[40:02] B: But it's like. I guess they just were my whole life.
[40:08] A: They were the people that you knew.
[40:11] B: They were the bane of my existence, but they were my existence.
[40:15] A: Your life Matters more to you. Right. So if we do stuff that's about your lightening up so that you're on the way. One of the things that we talked about was small steps. Right. We talked about what's the smallest next step. That's towards.
[40:43] B: Yes, I remember talking about that. Being on the floor. I tend to do three squares at a time on my house. And that'll take eight years. Yes, yes. Small steps. I've been doing it.
[40:57] A: You are right. And we know that they're the smallest next step because when you start doing it, you feel absolutely okay in doing it. Right. It's all moving towards. Right. We talk about what is the thing that I can get done the fastest. Not the biggest project of it. Right. Yeah.
[41:24] B: I couldn't remember the separation between the maintenance. The bodily maintenance.
[41:29] A: Well, right. So like, you picking up dog shit is maintenance. You patching wall so rat doesn't get in isn't maintenance.
[41:41] B: It's a fix.
[41:43] A: Yeah. Because once that's done, that part stops. Dogs probably shit ongoingly. Right. Maintenance would be like, I gotta take a shower and wash my hair.
[41:56] B: Yeah, right. Let me go back to that one.
[41:59] A: That's like maintenance. Right. I gotta brush my teeth and wash my hair.
[42:04] B: So when we were picking, you were saying to pick something smaller, whatever. Those things didn't count. Right.
[42:13] A: There's a difference between what I do. That's maintenance. And there's a difference things of what I'm doing. That's about improving things for the longer term. So do we want some. Somebody to start doing some maintenance stuff if they haven't? Yeah. And what's a simple thing that they could start with?
[42:33] B: Shaving their legs.
[42:35] A: That might be one. Or brushing their teeth in the morning and in the evening. Right. That might be one. Because that then prevents things from becoming urgent later. Right. If somebody takes better care of their teeth, then they're not having to deal with going to a dentist to get one pulled or cavity repaired or root canal. Right, right, right. So certainly there are maintenance stuff. We want to keep maintenance with our vehicle. Right. That's why if it needs an oil change, we go get the oil change. Because that's like a maintenance project.
[43:15] B: Right.
[43:16] A: If there are other projects. Projects. Projects tend to have multiple steps to them. Right. Like brushing the teeth is a to do. Combing my hair is a to do. It's a to do.
[43:31] B: Because I don't know if combing your hair is.
[43:35] A: It's a to do in that it can be done in less than five minutes.
[43:43] B: If you can find your Toothpaste and toothbrush.
[43:47] A: Well, we may want to have the practice of putting it in the same place every time. It makes it a lot easier to find things when we put them in the same place.
[43:59] B: I believe I've been hearing that at least five times a week since kindergarten. And I agree. I try.
[44:08] A: But there's a difference between. Between a to do and a project. A to do tends to have one step, and I can get it done in five minutes or less. Like, call to make an appointment. That's done. Check it off the list. Paint my house. That's a project because it has multiple steps. A, I have to determine what color I want to paint. B, I have to actually go get the paint and the brushes and the rollers if I'm using that. C, I have to lay out tarps. If I'm doing that, I have to start painting. Once I've started painting great, then I can see that it got done. But then I also have to clean the brushes. So a project is a multiple step thing that I can't get done in five minutes or less. If I want to paint my house like a component of it. A to do would be pick the color, buy the paint. Like that kind of.
[45:27] B: Right, right. I think I cut. I think I painted my wall the same color as that yellow.
[45:42] A: This is called Safari. Surprise, surprise. That we picked a color called safari with all the African art.
[45:50] B: I know I saw your lion. I mean, I was going to run off with that, but I figured you have it nailed down. No, I was not really going to. Thoughts like that go through my head sometimes.
[46:04] A: Isn't it fun to have those kinds of thoughts?
[46:06] B: Yes.
[46:07] A: Yeah.
[46:11] B: I just wanted to show you a picture.
[46:23] A: Like I'm doing some rehab for a torn rotator cuff.
[46:29] B: You are? Are you straight? Okay.
[46:32] A: So I have certain exercises doing I's, Y's, and T's. So that's a to do, meaning I get it done in five minutes. Minutes or less. I's, Y's, T's, to hopefully rehab this tear so I don't have to go have surgery.
[47:00] B: Yeah. Maybe it's a little different.
[47:08] A: Yeah. Nice. Yeah.
[47:10] B: You should have seen the picture. Look at. I got the. Eh, whatever.
[47:19] A: I mean, we have some of it on you so you can see the color.
[47:24] B: I know. Like the shower last night? No, this.
[47:29] A: Oh.
[47:29] B: Because I see, you know, I. I get people's pots out of their garbages, like plant pots. And I get the oops paint from Home Depot whenever I go there just to get it. If I like the color so this color is actually a mix of that color and this green color. But anyway, I picked up a pot after I painted it.
[47:55] A: Right.
[47:55] B: But my hair feels clean, so I'm pretty sure I took a shower last night. I guess I just did scrub very hard.
[48:03] A: It happens. Paint stays.
[48:06] B: Yeah.
[48:07] A: So again, as we think of, like, go back to that whole aspect of. Would it be okay for you to lighten up a little, realizing that lots of life is sucky, but some of it's okay. And then every once in a while, you have a moment where I was pretty cool versus thinking that life should always be really cool, that I should only have little itty bitty moments of bad stuff happening. See, I think we're happier when we go. No, there's a lot of bad stuff that'll happen. And then every once in a while, there might be that bright light. Like the moment of seeing that plate of grass, the deep. Seeing the sun rising.
[49:00] B: You think we're happier Thinking, I think.
[49:05] A: We'Re happier with the base level. That life is challenging and difficult and a lot of things are not what I want. And many stuff will be uncomfortable as a base that now I'm not having the expectation that every day should be awesome because I'll be disappointed a lot if I think that, you know, life should be great or if I think that I don't need to work hard or I think that things should just come to me. I'm going to be set up for a lot of disappointment when they don't. But if I have it that it's not always easy, that there are going to be challenges, that there are going to be shit that happened that I don't like, that, you know, all of us are going to go through some forms of trauma. Then I kind of know that I'm not so shocked or hurt when those things happen. Yeah, of course it's part of it. But then I get to be looking forward to the every once in a while moments, or it just comes together where things go well. Or I might be awed or inspired, or I might connect to something beyond me. Those moments which may be blessed, but see, that's the same thing. I'll give you the best example I can. We talk about Peak experiences are the ones that people remember. So a kid going to Disney for the first time is not remembering all the lines and how long it took them to wait to see Cinderella. They have the moment of the first time, seeing the moment of the joy of going down Space Mountain because those are peak moments. Overall, the person would have had a more enjoyable time sitting at home watching a movie, eating popcorn. They would have had an overall more enjoyable period of time because there would have been less stress.
[51:11] B: But we were talking about a child.
[51:12] A: I thought people in general, peak moments are the moments that I reached the pinnacle right on my overall day. I would have had a more enjoyable time sitting at home in air conditioning watching a movie. But I didn't have the peak experience. So I don't like, oh, wow, you know, I had a really great time sitting on the couch watching a movie that's like. Even though I would have had more enjoyment because what was missing is I didn't have the peak experience. I had all that time where I was sitting where I'm standing in line in the heat. I didn't have the peak experience. Why people remember the amusement parks, theme parks, is that they have moments of peak experiences. So we want to be thinking that life. We're going to have moments of peak experiences. But within peaks, there are going to be valleys.
[52:17] B: Roller coaster.
[52:18] A: Yeah.
[52:19] B: Peaks and valleys.
[52:20] A: And that's life. So to think that things should always be smooth sailing will set people up for a lot of disappointment. Being a positive thinker works really well when things go great. Not so well when things aren't going great, because now I'm fucked. So again, what we want is we want you to lighten up and beginning to know that it's okay, even if there's been troubling stuff. That it's okay for me to be okay. That the people and the things that truly matter to me are all. Whether they're people that are in their bodies or not. Whether I would consider them alive or having died. That the people and the things that matter to you want your life to work well for you and that you're also worth it to you. So that's where we're headed. Is a you who's lighter and more free to be okay in you connected deeply to the things and people that matter to you. Having more ease as you maneuver through the difficulties that might come your way. That's how we're wanting things to be make sense. And as we think of you in this way. Go ahead and slightly lower your jaw.
[54:11] B: I had a question about that. When you say lower my jaw, because it's like I said, the first couple weeks I was trying to do the stuff we were doing and breathe from the bottom. Do you mean lower your chin or just.
[54:30] A: So lowering the jaw?
[54:32] B: Just relaxing the jaw.
[54:34] A: It's just relaxing it. Maybe the width of an index Finger. When you slightly lower your jaw, it stimulates the vagal nerve in the body. When you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, it causes the body to become more satiated. Starts to turn down internal dialogue. When you relax the back of your tongue, it also starts to turn down dialogue inside. When you. Then you allow your breathing to become a little bit longer on the exhale, so that as you breathe, you're breathing in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. That's right, as you're aware of your breathing. That's right, you can hear my voice and the background sounds. You notice that you can make your breathing happen, that you're in control of how long you exhale and that you can gradually exhale in a way that's a little bit longer. There's whatever it is that you are thinking about, and then there's all of the other things that are also going on that you're not having any conscious awareness about at all. Notice. Notice that you can feel what it's like to be in your body. As your awareness drifts deeper and deeper down inside towards a more calm, peaceful and easy flowing energy, your unconscious now is responding. Notice that you can sense more of the space, both inside you and the space that's all around you. The space that's in between you and me, the space towards the wall behind the wall, in front, the side doors, windows, that you can sense. Or all of that as your mind is responding towards what the lioness symbolizes. Making adjustments, making connections, knowing which buttons to press, knobs to, to turn, levers, to shift, switches, to flip, to re organize, to restructure, to optimize, to naturally work more and more in ways that serve you. Because whether you fully realize it yet or not, your unconscious is organizing, things are rewiring. And because your unconscious knows it's already begun the process and can scan back and bring to your awareness something you might not have thought about for a really long time. So that whenever you're ready, and of course you can take your time because there is no rush to ever so slowly find your way back so that when you're ready, it'll be all the way back. Back up. Take a deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. In those short moments eyes were closed, what. What did you notice within yourself?
[61:27] B: First, a little impatient, like antsy to go do things. And then you said, think of something. Way back. I wasn't sure if I should be thinking of a trauma or A happy memory.
[61:54] A: That's right. You weren't what came to mind.
[61:59] B: My dad ripping me off the toilet because he wanted to use that bathroom. Three.
[62:07] A: Yeah.
[62:08] B: And also him making fun of me. Hyperventilate all the time.
[62:12] A: Huh?
[62:14] B: Yeah. And something about giotis, but I don't know, just like a flash of the hospital maybe. Don't really remember.
[62:28] A: Right.
[62:33] B: Yeah. Then I kept reminding myself to relax my tongue.
[62:40] A: And as you think about dad now, by the way, having done that, you know, ripped you off the bathroom seat because that's the one that he wanted to use. Laugh at him laughatting you when you were hyperventilating. You can remember him doing that, right? You can remember putting on your striped sock. Well, Marianne, stop putting in your striped sock.
[63:10] B: I'm not putting.
[63:11] A: Well, then stop him from ripping you off the bathroom seat. Well, then stop him from laughing at you. Say, he's not laughing at me.
[63:20] B: He's not laughing.
[63:22] A: Well, then you start putting in your jeans. Hey, I'm not putting on my jeans. Stop me from putting on my shirt. Well, stop him from laughing at you. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Right. Do you know why the paper bag works?
[63:39] B: Something about carbon monoxide.
[63:42] A: Not monoxide, that would be the one that would be really bad. It's carbon dioxide. So the reason that something. Somebody hyperventilates is that they've been exhaling too much carbon dioxide. It's not about bringing in too much oxygen. They've exhaled too much carbon dioxide, which changes the PH level in their blood not significantly, but a little bit that makes them have that. So a bag forces them to breathe in because they're exhaling the carbon dioxide. Breathe back in the carbon dioxide. You can do the same thing with a shirt because it's just about re regulating the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. Bugs Bunny used to do that. The old Bugs Bunny cartoons. People would hyperventilate and they'd have a paper bag and they would call.
[64:45] B: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[64:49] A: That's why it worked, because they'd bring in the carbon dioxide. Right. Having too much oxygen isn't an issue because we put people on oxygen. It's that they've exhaled too rapidly. But as you remember that with dad, dad doing that, did that have anything to do with you? Right. Let's say the kid goes to sit in the chair and the other kid pulls the chair out from under him and he lands on the ground. Well, he doesn't get hurt. But what are everybody in the class going to start doing?
[65:28] B: They're going to laugh.
[65:30] A: Right. Would it have mattered whether it was that kid or any other kid? Right. Dad being that way wasn't about you, was about him and stuff being a little bit off there with him make sense. Kind of like he had that whole era. Like, you know, the adults are entitled to. Kids are meant to be seen, not heard. Probably kind of mindset at times.
[66:08] B: Probably growing up, you probably had that. I don't. I don't really know, you know. And yeah, definitely I went through the scene on her. What's that?
[66:21] A: You were sitting on my throne. You were on his toilet. You were sitting on his throne. Mm.
[66:35] B: Wagging my feet back and forth.
[66:37] A: So again, close your eyes and think back to that earlier. You letting the earlier you know first. That those moments are over, finish completed. That the experiences themselves no longer exist. That dad doing that stuff and being that way wasn't about you, it was about him. So that she gets it. It's not about me. Right. And as the younger you is getting it, what do you notice happens?
[67:16] B: I feel lighter.
[67:18] A: You do? Right. So part of the heaviness has been the lens has been pointed back and the feeling has been that the stuff is about me.
[67:32] B: Right.
[67:33] A: And what we're doing is turning the lens so that I get that other people's stuff is about them. Right. Right. Just like you logically know the guy that's parked in your driveway. His drinking problem is about him. Him not fully understanding what goes on with you emotionally is also about him. Him not getting certain things is also about him.
[68:12] B: Oh, everything is.
[68:14] A: That's right.
[68:17] B: Yeah. Right. I have found I've been responding to.
[68:22] A: That better that you're not able to actually rescue him. That instead what there is for you you to do, and you've already begun by putting the oxygen mask on you first, you're starting to take better care of you. Right. Which is what we're interested in. Right. Ah. So again, check. How's your body feeling now?
[69:04] B: It was good until right when you said which is what we're interested in.
[69:11] A: And then what happened?
[69:13] B: Then it was here. I thought of Cape Cod.
[69:17] A: Uh huh.
[69:18] B: Thought about getting better. Like, okay, I get better, then what?
[69:24] A: Right, well. And then what? Yeah, else is possible for you. And then what? What else is possible for you?
[69:34] B: What else is possible for me?
[69:37] A: Right. When I'm not so focused on this and I'm able to do that. What are all of the other or even some of the other things that are possible for you? Because it's only then that you focused on that stuff. For an extended period of time. But as we're considering now, what are all of the other things? Right.
[70:18] B: Yeah. It's exciting but scary at the same time.
[70:28] A: Oh. Cause you're thinking you have to do other things. Yeah. Why wouldn't it be okay to just be, you know, still peaceful getting things done?
[70:42] B: That's so boring.
[70:47] A: Sometimes on a bicycle ride, or even when you're rollerblading or roller skating, Sometimes it's nice to coast, right. That I don't always have to be in doing mode to travel a long distance. See, it's not that I'm not getting it done. It's that I don't always have to be the one manufacturing the doing. Sometimes it's nice to coast. One of my favorite things about living up north When I lived in the Adirondacks and I would go on a bicycle ride, One of the most enjoyable things After I made it to the top of the hill Was to experience coasting all the way down. Not having to pedal, just simply coasting and having it take me a long way. That's right. So if we go too far in the future, we start thinking of all these things that we'll have to do. If we just think about right now, it's more about being okay in you instead. Instead of thinking of all the things I must do, we want you to be more okay in you, to lighten up a little. Right. So that as you think of your boy, right, Your feelings feeling more okay, and him with you, because there's a place he's never left. And in all those experiences through all the decades, I. What are you noticing now?
[73:16] B: All the experiences through all the decades. You mean before he was here as well?
[73:23] A: Of course.
[73:25] B: Okay, so then probably my dad is too. See what I was thinking? Actually, I think that I've come to more of a spot of peace with him with his passing. I think where I really hit my wall was the house and things that I've had for 53 years, things that I've made as a child ruined. You know, like, my stuff is in all different places. And I know that's. And just, I guess, home. I have this weird thought that if.
[74:22] A: I go home, home being Miami or.
[74:26] B: Home being here, home being Miami, the house in Miami. Cause everybody's like, just move back to Miami. Well, first of all, that's expensive. Second of all, home is our yard, my house, the pelican and the ladybug in the terrazzo that I would look at when I was on the toilet all my life. Little things the smells, the.
[75:05] A: Notice how you just sense them right now. Right.
[75:13] B: But they're gone.
[75:14] A: No, they're not. Because you could sense them right now. You just saw the terrazzo and you smell the smell. So they're not gone. And you can hear every door. See, it's not actually gone. It's in you. Meaning that you have access to it. So all of the experiences that you acquire, you can't lose. You may lose access in the moment to them, but you can't lose those experiences. They're in you even if you're not there. Right.
[76:11] B: That's a good way to think of that.
[76:13] A: Right.
[76:15] B: Because I haven't been. Because it's a house.
[76:19] A: That's right. And you're not an accumulation of all this stuff. You came into this world without any stuff.
[76:33] B: Did I?
[76:34] A: And were whole and complete with nothing missing. All babies are whole and complete. Nothing missing. They're useless. You've gotta bathe them, clean them, change them. But they're perfect just the way they are.
[76:54] B: Yeah. That's how I.
[76:56] A: That's how we start.
[76:57] B: I realized I was perfect just the way I am.
[77:00] A: Right.
[77:00] B: That's when I had it.
[77:01] A: Shit happens along the way. Right.
[77:05] B: But we're still perfect in our imperfections for the most part, I think.
[77:13] A: And that there's nothing missing.
[77:15] B: Right.
[77:16] A: Right. And that's what they're wanting you to connect more to. Please. Really are. Which is ongoing. And who they are for you and all the stuff and all the things. Right. Right. There was a generation of people that grew up from the Depression. Their parents, maybe they were children as they went through it. Right. Parents that were. And that was all about keeping things because we were rationed and we didn't have as much. But we were a producing nation. So we made stuff and sold it. And then somewhere after 1950, we became a consumer nation where we stopped being the producer in the making. And where we got it from is we consume. And since then we've had gluttony. People get really overweight. People have hoarding issues. People have influenced Florida. Not enough room in their house to keep all their stuff. So they rent a space that they can put more stuff in. So we were never about our stuff because what truly gives us is the experience. So I went on a backpack trip to Europe right after grad school. Traveled all around and I got a patch that I sewed on from each place that I went to. It was really cool. Of course, that would put it then in now 1998. So now 22 years later, 21 years later, 23 years later. Whatever the math is.
[79:50] B: 23 years later, I was going with three years later.
[79:55] A: Do I still have that bag? No. Do I have the experiences? Yeah. Did I take a picture of the bag? Sure. Because that can be a reminder that brings back the experiences. But it wasn't the bag. It wasn't the patches.
[80:14] B: Right. Your memories or the memories. That's right. I have a picture of myself changing Giovis's diaper at a park in Miami. And I'm wearing a Jerry Garcia shirt. And then I have a picture of Giotis and Silas and I. Christmas picture. Like, I'm in the middle and there. And he must be like 14 or 15 in that picture. He's got that Jerry Garcia shirt on. It's so cool. I have them, like, next to each other.
[81:10] A: Yeah.
[81:13] B: Yeah. I don't know where that shirt is, but it brings me joy.
[81:20] A: That's right.
[81:20] B: I have the pictures. That's good.
[81:23] A: Yeah.
[81:30] B: Yeah.
[81:38] A: So you're on your way.
[81:41] B: And this keeps going without.
[81:45] A: Right. Because where it's changed is at a deeper internal level, which doesn't require me consciously doing things. What there is for you to do is to begin to notice not what's same and similar, but what's new and different in terms of how. How I'm feeling, thinking, acting, reacting in response to stuff that maybe it doesn't get as high or last as long or maybe didn't happen as frequent. Those are the things to continue to notice as things are changing. Yeah. You're doing great. Really proud of you. Really.
[82:31] B: I just felt shitty all of a sudden.
[82:39] A: And again, isn't that the typical feeling? Huh?
[82:45] B: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it really has been all my life. Yeah. But not as bad.
[82:53] A: So then we want to be thinking of, oh, well, that's not unusual.
[82:59] B: And instead.
[83:01] A: Right, right.
[83:02] B: Inviting Mara to tea. Buddhist, Siddhartha's all the negative. Mara represents everything. Negative, negative feelings. So Buddha, instead of pushing him away, you invite him in for two tea and sit with them.
[83:30] A: Right. That's another way of saying we're better off going, you know what?
[83:35] B: Here's this feeling.
[83:36] A: Life isn't good.
[83:38] B: Right.
[83:40] A: So I shouldn't be expecting to always be feeling great.
[83:46] B: Yeah.
[83:47] A: Right. Yeah. I. Cool. All right. We're going to stop with that for now.
[83:57] B: Okay.
[83:58] A: And then I'm going to put, like, in a month, we'll get back together to check in, make sure we've got things moving in the right direction. Okay. Yeah.
[84:08] B: And so what about, like, the breathing exercise of bringing it up? Like, should I. I've been doing that a little.
[84:19] A: Anytime you do that, anytime you add foursquare breathing into the count of four, hold it to the count of four. Out to the count of four, hold it to the count of four. They use in the military, any kind of stuff like that is useful. Anytime you think of the lioness, it's useful.
[84:39] B: Yeah, I think of bring it back.
[84:41] A: To the smallest next step. Whenever I'm doing something, all that's useful stuff to do as you're moving forward.
[84:50] B: And the tongue thing, you said wait. Lowering the jaw does what?
[84:55] A: Stimulates the vagal nerve and the tongue.
[85:00] B: Back of the tongue.
[85:01] A: You said when you relax your tongue, the back of your tongue causes a satiated feeling. When you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, it starts to turn down internal dialogue. I know, right? Isn't that cool stuff?
[85:16] B: Yeah.
