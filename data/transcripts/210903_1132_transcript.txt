[00:00] A: Okay, so today is what, the 2nd, 3rd, 3rd, 3rd, third, third of September, Tammy. We're making an audio recording what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful and valuable, it may be made available in teaching and training others in how to do this. And we just recently talked that like, stuff that we cleared up doesn't have the same emotional impact that it had been having. And you're not having the same nightmares or daydreams about stuff.
[00:26] B: Right.
[00:27] A: So that's better. And that your emotions are more matching the situations.
[00:31] B: Yep.
[00:32] A: Cool. Okay, good. Right. Oh, so one of the things that you're going to notice over time, because when things start to change in terms of how I find myself feeling or what I find myself envisioning or thinking about is I'm used to it being a certain way.
[00:58] B: Right.
[00:59] A: So the example I like to use is, let's say this person works in an office and every day they walk by this doorway at 2:00. And every day at 2:00, the person who's in the doorway punches them in the arm. So every day they walk by, they get punched in the arm. Not super hard, but they get punched in the arm. Well, over time, what are they gonna develop?
[01:23] B: It's gonna be an expectation.
[01:25] A: It's gonna be an expectation and they're probably gonna brace for it a little bit. Cuz like if my little girl goes, daddy, I'm gonna punch you in the stomach, I can brace for it and it's not gonna hurt. But if she sucker punches me, I wasn't expecting it. Follow me with that. So that person is gonna brace for it. The anticipation of this thing is going to happen, so to speak. Now we adjust it so the person who used to punch them is no longer there. Well, what are they going to have for a period of time?
[02:02] B: It's still going to be an expectation.
[02:03] A: They're still going to have a brace for it. But what they're going to notice is that the brace punch never came. The punch never came. And the bracing for it starts to over time diminish because they're no longer having the expectation that it's going to happen because they're seeing the situation clearly, that I'm in a different thing now.
[02:26] B: Right?
[02:26] A: Yeah.
[02:28] B: That's kind of what it is with me and my feelings and my emotions, with the dreams and stuff that I've been having.
[02:37] C: Yeah, yeah.
[02:38] A: And that that's the most common way that people begin to notice those kinds of changes is, hey, stuff that used to be bothering Me isn't. And even if there is some stuff, it doesn't get as high and it doesn't last as long. So I'm dealing with stuff better.
[03:02] B: Right.
[03:03] A: Yay. That's a good news thing. Cool. What else kind of surfaces or comes to mind that we might want to be doing for you? How has work been?
[03:13] B: Great, actually. I've been cross training.
[03:22] A: Cool.
[03:23] B: At my job by choice.
[03:26] A: To do another role.
[03:28] B: Yeah. I have. When I got hired, I was hired as a cross trainer from cashier to prep. But I've already learned those two items. So now I'm doing barista in line. I'm doing a quadruple training.
[03:45] C: Wow.
[03:47] B: I mean, it makes you personally. It shows that. It shows your managers and whoever else is watching to see what your employers do. It shows everybody how valuable you can be.
[04:01] C: Yeah.
[04:02] B: How willing.
[04:03] C: Right.
[04:04] B: Yeah. And how much you're willing to learn and how motivated you are to be working. And it gives you the opportunity to get raises and get promotions.
[04:17] A: Yeah.
[04:18] B: You know, get things that the ones that are choosing not to cross train and learn different steps and criteria of the job won't get. That you will get.
[04:31] A: Yeah.
[04:33] B: And eventually I would like to move up to manager again.
[04:36] A: Cool.
[04:38] B: So I spend. It's. It's a life. It's.
[04:42] A: It's.
[04:42] B: It's an experience. It's a changing experience for me. It's. Sometimes it gets overwhelming, sometimes it gets stressful, but then part of the job, you know, it's not a job if it's not stressful or overwhelming at points and times of.
[05:03] A: Yeah, because I'm sure there's different quote unquote rushes where there's more people that come in and then less people that come in. That's the nature of that kind of a business. Right.
[05:14] B: Yeah. We get a rush about 8 o'clock in the morning. We also get a rush between 11 and 1, and then we get a rush at night. So there's three different rushes.
[05:26] C: Yeah.
[05:26] B: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[05:28] C: Yeah.
[05:28] B: Right. And sometimes the rushers last a couple hours a day from 8 to 10, 10:30. And then sometimes they.
[05:39] A: And then there's time to breathe for a minute. Sometimes.
[05:42] B: Not always.
[05:43] A: No, I'm bad.
[05:44] B: Sometimes you go straight breakfast to lunch.
[05:46] A: Oh, my. Okay.
[05:47] B: And then it doesn't die off until about 2, 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
[05:50] C: Yeah.
[05:50] B: That's when it gets slow and boring.
[05:53] A: Okay.
[05:54] B: Because I really don't have nothing to do but stand there and twiddle my thumbs.
[05:58] A: I see.
[05:58] B: You know.
[05:59] C: Yeah.
[05:59] A: That's why things that the back end stuff of like the napkins has been filled.
[06:06] C: The.
[06:07] A: The straws are that like that kind of stuff is already handled. And then you have.
[06:12] B: Well, yeah, because you have three cashiers and there's only two cash registers. So it's not like you can have three people up front doing the same thing. So two are on cash, one's on barista. And then you have like five or six on the line, which are salad, sandwiches, soups, you know, stuff like that. So like if you're online, you have more to do. You have delivery orders curbside in orders to go, orders to make.
[06:46] C: Yeah.
[06:47] B: So you're constantly moving on the lines. Yeah. But cashiering is kind of slow and so is barista because not a lot of things come in throughout the day. You'll have time where you can just stand there and twiddle your thumbs. And it gets boring and old after a while. So I try to bounce around the store the calf to maintain movement.
[07:13] C: That would make sense.
[07:15] B: And it. And I just got a compliment. Last week or no, this week, Thursday, or was it Wednesday? I think it was Wednesday. I'm not sure which day it was.
[07:24] C: Yeah.
[07:25] B: But it was this week. My one manager and a couple of my associates went to the top manager and requested that I be online because I am a good worker, I am motivated, you know, stuff like that.
[07:43] A: Yeah.
[07:43] B: And then he told me to my face, cuz I asked him, I said, so I heard you put in a good word for me. And he's like, yeah, I see what I see. And I talk about what I see.
[07:53] A: Isn't that cool?
[07:54] B: So I mean, it's got to feel good, right? It does feel good.
[07:57] A: I bet that's awesome. It does.
[08:01] B: You know, not every job that I've been to do, they do that. Does that.
[08:06] A: Yeah.
[08:07] B: Because it's not. Some of the jobs that I've been to aren't really well managed. They have poor management, poor employee statuses. So I've quit working there.
[08:19] C: Yeah.
[08:20] B: Because I've been there long enough to see how they run their situations there and who gets to do what, who doesn't, who gets away with what, how they let them, you know.
[08:34] C: Yeah.
[08:35] B: Proceed with their day. And I just don't like it. It's poor management. If I'm a manager and this manager is my boss and I'm the one that's here taking care of the store and you guys are doing this on my time, it's my fault. It's on me.
[08:51] A: Sure.
[08:51] B: It's not on him. It's on me.
[08:53] C: Right.
[08:53] B: Because I'm here. He's not.
[08:56] C: Right.
[08:56] B: So I had to quit. I couldn't do it.
[08:59] C: Yeah.
[09:00] B: I'm not gonna have my neck out on the line for something that you guys want to do because he allows you to. I don't. You want to get mad and cuss me out? Well, then, hey, I'm gone. Because I don't have time for it.
[09:13] A: Yeah.
[09:14] B: I don't. And I've done it two different jobs now.
[09:18] C: Yeah.
[09:18] A: You got to find the one that works best.
[09:20] B: Panera does.
[09:22] C: Yeah.
[09:22] A: And that you actually feel comfortable at home. Right. And not. Yes. So there's the comfort part. But you actually feel like what you're doing is being seen and validated.
[09:38] B: Well, it's not really that it's being seen and validated. I feel. I feel confident in myself. It's more about how I feel. Because if I feel. If I feel like I'm doing something wrong because of what they're doing, I'm not comfortable. I'm not confident. I'm not seeing myself progress.
[10:02] A: Yeah.
[10:03] B: It's more about what you see in yourself, not really what others see around you, because eventually someone's gonna see it, regardless of what one person or the other sees.
[10:11] A: Sure.
[10:12] B: Somebody there is gonna see it, whether they say something or not. And time does tell. Over time, you know, it'll be out in the open.
[10:23] C: Right.
[10:24] B: Who's doing what, like, with you. As long as you're confident in what you're doing and, you know, it's the right steps and the right criteria and, you know you're getting something done, who cares what other people think about you?
[10:39] C: Okay.
[10:39] B: As long as you're not being fired or mandated or this or that.
[10:44] C: Yeah.
[10:46] B: You know, fine. Right.
[10:48] C: Yeah.
[10:49] B: So that's how I see it. As long as I'm not getting in trouble by my managers, they're not coming to me with something stupid out the ass to say, having any fights or conflicts with any of the other employees, I'm doing just fine.
[11:01] C: Nice.
[11:03] B: I mean, eventually my work will show.
[11:06] C: Yeah. Yeah.
[11:07] A: Well, that's cool.
[11:08] B: It's just. It takes time.
[11:10] A: Yeah.
[11:10] B: It's not gonna happen overnight.
[11:12] C: Yeah.
[11:12] A: And it was nice to know that that person, you know, said that.
[11:18] B: Yep.
[11:19] C: Yeah.
[11:19] A: That's cool. Yep.
[11:21] B: I mean, that's why I'm saying, like, it takes time. You can't expect them to see it all out of you at one time, you know?
[11:27] C: Yeah.
[11:28] B: I've been there for three months now.
[11:31] C: Okay.
[11:31] B: And I finally see what they're seeing.
[11:35] A: Yeah.
[11:36] C: Nice.
[11:36] B: You Know what I mean?
[11:37] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I follow you.
[11:38] B: They brought it to my attention. This is what's going on. This is what's happening. This is a great job that you're doing, and we commend you for it. Or. Yeah. Commander something.
[11:49] A: Appreciate. Acknowledge, Commence, whatever, all that kind of stuff.
[11:52] B: And they're recommending certain positions for me, so.
[11:55] A: Nice.
[11:56] B: It's a good thing.
[11:57] A: Yeah. Awesome. So when you were here the last time, weren't you, like, right on the cusp of being done both with programming and with Tyla and with other stuff?
[12:09] B: Yes. Tyla Court. I've already graduated. I did that a month ago.
[12:16] A: Awesome.
[12:17] B: I'm still. I think Selah is. This is part of Selah. So today, since this is my last session, she's gonna talk to someone about something because I'm trying to become a member of the Selah crew.
[12:36] A: Nice.
[12:37] B: Like, I want to work for them.
[12:38] A: How cool.
[12:39] B: So I had to wait until this session was over with to.
[12:47] A: Yeah, that'd be great.
[12:49] C: Yeah.
[12:49] A: What. What might you want to be doing?
[12:52] B: Wherever they can put me. I mean, I already told. I told her I work at the assessment house. You know, whatever. It doesn't matter. Whatever they can do.
[13:03] C: Yeah.
[13:04] B: You know, I'm willing to do it.
[13:05] A: Yeah. Because there's multiple roles. There's roles as an advocate, there's roles working, like what Bri and Wendy are doing. There's roles working in education, there's roles in different spots. But you have an interest in that. That's cool. Yeah.
[13:20] B: I told them that two months ago. So I'm still pushing for it.
[13:24] C: Yeah.
[13:25] B: Give back what they've given me to others. So. Yeah.
[13:30] A: Yeah. One of the cool parts with Sayla is that it really becomes an ongoing connection. Right. Like, I've had people that, you know, have been in, quote, unquote, outreach. They've gone through the stuff. They've done their genograms, they've done sessions, and let's say a year and a half goes by and something shows up. Sayla's really great at. Okay, well, let's get you back in.
[13:56] B: I know a couple of them.
[13:58] A: You know, I mean, that's. That's just a neat thing. That. That's. It's not like, okay, well, you're finished now. You're on an island. We don't ever talk like.
[14:05] B: Like, you're still, like, about them, right?
[14:08] A: Yeah, that's.
[14:08] B: Is. I like that because they're persistent about the help. They're. They are. They're a source of community.
[14:28] C: Yeah.
[14:29] B: Medical, health, yeah, Like, I'm getting medical help. I'm getting dental done through them.
[14:37] A: Beautiful.
[14:38] B: Like, I'm not paying for it at all. Yeah, it's coming through them.
[14:42] A: Isn't that cool?
[14:45] B: Education. I'm doing my GED through them.
[14:47] A: Awesome.
[14:48] B: So there it's multiple. Multiple steps that you can take.
[14:56] A: So they're really interested in the overall getting you uplifted and. Well, so what are parts that haven't been optimal?
[15:04] C: Okay.
[15:04] A: So I need to do stuff with my dental. Okay. So education would be useful. Okay. So there's this emotional stuff that would, like, it's all encompassing to be helping you, you know, have a life that you want to be living.
[15:19] B: Yeah.
[15:21] A: That's cool.
[15:22] B: Yep.
[15:23] C: Yeah.
[15:23] A: How have things been with your guy? Is he still, like, a running machine?
[15:26] B: Yeah, yeah. Yep. Tuesday, Thursdays and Saturdays, he goes for, like.
[15:34] A: He runs, like, long distance. Didn't you say?
[15:39] B: I know. Tuesdays and Thursdays he does close to five miles. Yeah, between three and five on Tuesdays and Thursday nights. Saturdays, he does between five and 10.
[15:52] A: That's a lot of running.
[15:54] B: It's what he does. It's what he does.
[15:56] A: It's good for him.
[15:57] B: And sometimes he runs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Fridays he don't at all. But Sunday, Monday, Sunday, Monday and Wednesdays, he tries to get, like, a good three, four miles in around the neighborhood or, you know, five, four or five miles out from the neighborhood and back. You know, he's very.
[16:27] A: Very equipped into running a little bit.
[16:31] B: Yeah, I need to. But I got some other issues I.
[16:36] A: Don'T know about needing to run. I might, you know, start with a real easy mosey.
[16:42] B: Yeah, no, I'm not gonna start.
[16:44] A: That's how I did. I used to be a runner, like, and I ran cross country in college. So I ran a lot and ran fast. And when I started running again, I didn't start running at all. No. I started walking.
[17:00] B: Walking gets you in the motion for running.
[17:06] A: Yeah, I started walking, and then I lost a couple pounds because I'm like, I'm gonna bang. And so then that helped. And then it was like, okay, let me go to a slower jog. And then it was like, okay, now I can start actually having my legs go and run and.
[17:24] B: Yeah, yeah. That's what I do. I used to run when I first got with him.
[17:32] C: Yeah.
[17:33] B: We would go to races.
[17:35] A: Yeah. Like, 5Ks.
[17:36] B: Things like that. Yeah. 5, 10. You know, 5 and 10Ks. I ran a couple of them.
[17:42] C: Yeah.
[17:44] B: And then I kind of just, like, said, screw that. Went off on my No, I relapsed. I went off on my vengeance.
[17:53] A: That definitely interrupt running.
[17:55] B: That definitely interrupted it. It interrupted a lot of things in my life. It set me back pretty far. So I still haven't gotten the courage and the energy up to start walking yet. I'm kind of lazy, but then again.
[18:15] A: So here's the cool part. So think of, like, in order to start a habit, in order to do something, we don't need to take on a big chunk of it. Like, too often people think, like, okay, well, I need to go to the gym for an hour. No, that's not the best way. So think of, like, when somebody starts having the habit of cigarettes. They don't start by smoking a pack a day.
[18:39] B: That's not how. It's like one or two.
[18:41] A: Not even one or two. They take a couple hits and. Right. And then over time, they might get to where they've gone through a half, and then they might get to where they've gone through, like a full cigarette. And then it might be one or two, and then it might be only when I'm at this. And then it eventually becomes like, okay, so I have it right? So when habits start, we don't need to start with a big chunk. Like, I remember talking to a guy, he had Covid and it really knocked him out, like, to the point that he was really weak. And the doctor said, your recovery is going to be like a marathon. So what he took it was, it's going to take a long time. But what he was frustrated is, I can't even get up from my chair and go to the kitchen without being winded.
[19:33] B: Yeah, right.
[19:34] A: So what I had to tell him is I go when they said that it's like a marathon. What we have to remember is if we were to train to run a marathon, and we've never run before, our first step wouldn't be to get the person out and start running a mile. That's way down the road. Our first step would be, well, let's go to the shoe store. Let's have you try on a few different pairs of shoes and get a pair of shoes that are comfortable. Right. And then the second step, go home. And when you're at home, like a couple times in the first week, go ahead and put those shoes on and walk around the house in them for like an hour. Notice how slow we're going at this thing. We're not even getting outside. Then I might have them every day, wear them for a couple hours walking around the house. Then I might have Them do a intentional walk for five minutes, maybe down their street and back, and then maybe 10 minutes. So we would very slowly progress into. We haven't even started the running part yet.
[20:53] B: Yeah, no, you don't always start.
[20:56] A: So when we think of restarting something up, we really want to go is what. Don't worry. I got that right there.
[21:07] B: It's just a habit.
[21:09] A: I know. It's so good.
[21:10] B: It's a habit. I do it at work because we have to. I have to keep track of time at work sometimes.
[21:18] C: Yeah.
[21:19] A: So. So. So as we think of, like, initiating something new, the first step would be like, okay, so maybe I'm in a place that I could go for a walk for five minutes. So how do I need to go about doing that? Well, I know for me personally, and I still do this every day when I work out in the morning, the night before, I put my. Bless you. So good.
[21:52] B: Sorry.
[21:53] A: It's okay. We do have tissues, too.
[21:56] B: I'm okay.
[21:58] A: So. So. So when I. When I. The night before, what I do is I put out my shorts, my socks, my shoes, my shirt, and my hat.
[22:14] B: You put them in that order on the bed?
[22:18] A: Maybe not in that order on the bed, but I put them. I put my shoes down and my socks, and then I put my shorts and my shirt in my hat.
[22:25] B: Yeah, but I put them out the night before. Yeah.
[22:30] A: Because I know one of the things that would prevent me from doing something.
[22:35] B: Is trying to decide what to wear the next day.
[22:38] C: Right.
[22:39] A: Because I got to get up and I got to put. If it's already out, I know as soon as I get up, I go use the restroom and I come back and I put my shorts on and I put my shirt on, and I put my socks and my shoes on, and then I'm ready. Right. So that would be removing a barrier. Yeah, I do it the night before. So as you're thinking about, okay, if I start to initiate some form of physical activity again, I want to actually change. Just like you told me. I can't do this. You can't call yourself that lazy. Right. Because if I can't do this, you can't call yourself that. Right. Because it's the same thing.
[23:27] B: I didn't call myself lazy. I said I'm being.
[23:30] A: No, you didn't say I'm being. You said I'm lazy.
[23:33] B: Okay, well, I'm being.
[23:34] A: You said I am, meaning I equals lazy. Just like I said, I am a loser. And you're like, you can't call yourself that.
[23:44] B: You can.
[23:45] A: I Can call myself lazy, though. So there.
[23:49] B: Yeah, like a little kid.
[23:51] A: Right. So you can't call yourself that.
[23:54] B: No, it's just I stand on my feet for nine hours a day, and it's my feet. I have this thing with my. My hands and my feet where they're in pain and they go numb. So I don't. I don't know.
[24:09] A: Do you know what part of the problem is?
[24:11] B: It's my weight.
[24:12] A: No, what part of the problem is you have really big cushions. So I'll give you. I'll leave you with this. I have a good friend of mine who is a neurologist that deals with people with imbalances. And so frequently he's dealing with older adults. And one of the things that we do with older adults is we put them in shoes that have really big cushions. And there's this thing called prop. Proprioception, which is my feet need to feel the ground. And so these people have imbalance issues because their feet are no longer feeling the ground beneath them.
[24:54] B: I walk. The only time I put these on is to go to work or to come here or.
[24:59] A: But I want you to realize that. Right. But why are you so tired all day long? Is that you're in. I know. We think it's a good idea to be in big, cushiony chairs shoes. Even Nike, when Nike came out and they started putting heels on shoes, you would think that that would help runners. There's been more running injuries since. Since Nike started doing that than there was before we ever had heels. So when I have literally a flat shoe. Right. He puts people in shoes that are barefoot shoes. So it almost is like I'm walking barefoot even though I've got a shoe around me. That will actually cause a proprioception to make it so that you don't feel fatigued and it doesn't go numb. The numbing happens because I've got big cushions. Isn't that weird?
[25:50] B: What about with my hands?
[25:52] A: They're related. Like, they're the.
[25:56] B: They might. Like, right now, my hands are hurting, but when I lay on them is when they go numb.
[26:02] A: Depending on where your arms are, you're blocking off blood flow to that. So sometimes laying. I need to lay, because that happens to me. If I'm laying on my side, all of a sudden my hands, like, starts tingling in its mouth.
[26:19] B: Yeah. No, there's no tingling.
[26:21] A: You don't get tingling? No, because mine starts to tingle.
[26:24] B: It goes straight to numbness. Like, I can't move my hand. Literally, my hands. Like, this hand has already been out of commission like completely. No motor, no, no movement. Like my hand was like this floppy.
[26:39] C: Yeah.
