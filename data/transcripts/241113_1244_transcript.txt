[00:00] A: So today is the 13th of November, Susan. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful and valuable, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:16] B: Yes.
[00:17] A: Okay, cool. So what would we actually want our time to do for you? Right. If we could really change in now the problematic ways that you've been feeling or reacting or thinking or acting, what do we want to get better? And then what would be useful for me to know, to understand how life has been?
[00:35] B: Okay.
[00:36] A: Yeah. Yeah. Right. So what comes to mind?
[00:42] B: So, like, not always.
[00:47] A: Hold on. Sorry. This needs to not be on.
[00:52] B: Not always worrying about people knowing my past, like jobs and things like that, because I do get paranoid about that.
[01:04] A: Okay.
[01:04] B: Don't find out because I have prostitution charges on my record and it comes up. So to learn how to deal with that, because I'm not good with dealing with that.
[01:17] A: So is there a lot of, like. I mean, it's discomfort.
[01:20] B: Yeah.
[01:21] A: Right. Is it. Is it like guilt, shame stuff, regret, remorse, stuff like angst because of person? What does that then mean about me?
[01:31] B: Or like, how so I was that person?
[01:36] A: Well, I don't know whether you ever were that person, even though that was stuff that you were doing.
[01:40] B: Okay.
[01:41] A: I'd like to think of, you know, you, Susan, as different than what you had been doing.
[01:45] B: Yes, so would I. And that's what I would like to portray to people. Because I am different than what I was doing.
[01:52] A: Sure.
[01:52] B: But that always.
[01:53] A: And what you were doing then wasn't ever you.
[01:55] B: Right, Right. I believe that.
[01:57] A: Yeah. Good.
[01:57] B: Yeah.
[01:58] A: Yeah.
[01:59] B: Right.
[01:59] A: Yeah. And we want that fully solidified.
[02:01] B: Yes.
[02:01] A: Yeah.
[02:02] B: Because I'm, you know, halfway there, but I still worry.
[02:07] A: Yeah. Okay. So there's some angst when you go to apply that somehow a previous record is going to get pulled up. They're going to see that, and that creates a whole bunch of discomfort just in. Even in the going and applying part of it.
[02:20] B: Right, right.
[02:21] A: We'd like to get that turned way down.
[02:23] B: Yes.
[02:24] A: So that you're not troubled by what you used to do.
[02:27] B: Right.
[02:28] A: Yeah. So that you're more okay in you.
[02:30] B: Yeah.
[02:31] A: Okay, cool. I know how to do that. We can get that better.
[02:34] B: Okay.
[02:35] A: Okay, cool. What else do we want to do?
[02:36] B: So I have a lot of trauma from those days.
[02:41] A: Sure.
[02:43] B: You know, and John's and blah, blah, blah.
[02:47] A: Yeah.
[02:47] B: Everything that goes along with it.
[02:48] A: And even as you're thinking a little bit about it right now. You're feeling some of the discomfort.
[02:52] B: I am? Yeah.
[02:53] A: Do you know why? Has anybody ever explained why?
[02:56] B: No.
[02:57] A: Do you want to know why?
[02:57] B: Yeah.
[02:58] A: Okay, cool. So the reason that we stay troubled by past moments isn't that what happened was awful or bad or wrong or they shouldn't have done it or I shouldn't have done it done it. It's because when it happened, emotionally, the brain short circuit froze it. That part of the brain doesn't know it's over. This part totally does. That part doesn't. Right. It's why anytime I think about it or I'm in something that reminds me of it or somehow I find myself thinking of it, or I. I'm almost back in it again.
[03:37] B: Right.
[03:38] A: Right. That. The reason that that's happening, Susan, isn't because of how awful it was. It's only because there's an aspect of the brain that doesn't know it ended. You survived it. You made it through it. You're okay. You're here now. There's a part that doesn't know that. I know it sounds really crazy to even think of it that way, but I'll give you this silly example. If. If I told you about how when I was 11, I fell out of a tree and I broke my arm. If, as I told you about it, right now, I'm as emotional as when it happened, you're gonna look at me like I'm crazy. This guy's fine. He moves his arms all over the place, right? On the flip side, if I told you what my uncle did to me when I was 11 and I started to get emotional about it, you'd be like, well, yeah, of course, but why? Right? We have a saying in our culture. Time heals all wounds. But we weren't talking about the emotional wounds. We were only talking about the physical wounds. Why don't the emotional wounds heal? It's a weird thought. Now therapy thinks I buried and repressed, or I didn't fully get to express, or I wasn't able to really let. And so I buried. And we've got to help me get it out of me.
[04:54] B: Yeah.
[04:54] A: That's the reverse, okay? Because you're not troubled because somehow it got stuffed down. You're troubled only because that part doesn't know it ended. You made it through it. You survived it. You're okay. That part got stuck. So instead of trying to get out and feel it, we want to keep you present with me because I'm more fun than that. Was as we go in and unplug the memory so the brain is able to read it as data about something that happened versus where it's been stuck in you as living, happening. Does that make sense?
[05:31] B: Yes.
[05:32] A: Okay. When that gets stuck in that way, what also gets attached are meanings. Right? Little kids learn good things happen because I'm good. Toys, presents, candy, cookies, love, kisses, hugs, grades, all because I'm good. Once a year, some dude I don't know drops gifts off at my house because I'm good. So little kids learn that good things happen when they're good, which is great only if their entire life is good. I've never met anybody I know. And so the reverse must be true. That's the problem. Not that they were lied to and told life is good when you're being good, good things happen. It's that the reverse must be true. If it's bad, it's because I've done something wrong. If it's bad, it somehow had to do with me. If it was bad, it was my fault. If it was bad, it's because I deserved it. Because bad things happen when you're bad. So even the kid whose parents are divorced doesn't feel like it's a mom or a dad issue. Feels like if they loved me, that one would be more present, right? That, you know, the little kid who's molested knows that it wasn't his fault, but it still feels like it was. Because that was something bad and I was involved. And maybe some of what that touching did felt good. And that would be even worse confusing because now the thing that I knew was bad and wrong to do felt good. Whoa. Like, that's fucked up, right? But all things that are negative, what gets attached to it, makes me feel worse about me, but not me, just my behavior. Me at an identity level like my worth or my lovability, or whether I'm good enough or. Or. Or got it. That's what gets stuck to those negative things. And then because it's still active, the brain, remember, doesn't know it's over, so it's looking for it in a more vigilant, insensitive way. And what I mean by that is a rabbit who hears a twig and snap and runs has a better chance of surviving than the one who heard the twig snap and thought it was his friend Joer Joe. Shit. Right? So what gets inbred for survival is if I part of the brain still thinks a lot of aw moments are ongoingly happening. It's constantly scanning for it searching for anything that's similar but confusing. Similar is same. Right. Even if it wasn't the part of the problem. Like the guy raped the gal. The guy was wearing a Taylor Swift shirt. This is not the right time of life to not like Taylor Swift. She's in everything and everywhere. Right. And of course, the issue, though, when the rape happened wasn't the name on the T shirt. It was what the guy did. But they happened at the same time. So this brain where it froze confuses it. Time of day, smells, tones of voice, all sorts of different things can be unconscious triggers. Right. That guy's making out, the one that had this stuff, making out with a gal that he's totally into, and she's into him and it's feeling really good, and they're gonna be intimate and it's gonna be great. And she touches his inner thigh and he does this. And he's like, what the fuck is wrong with me? The girl who I'm into is touching me in a way that should feel really good, that I really want her to do. And I. Yeah, but is there any similarity to Uncle Hank? Got it.
[09:19] B: Yeah.
[09:20] A: So what we want to do isn't to process it more, because I don't need to process it. What we actually want to do, Susan, is unplug it so that emotionally, that part where it's stuck is able to experience it as data about something that happened. Yes. Still sucky that it happened, but now it's data because where they've been coded in your brain and body is still happening. Got it.
[09:52] B: Yeah.
[09:53] A: So what we're going to do is we're going to take the emotional charge that was attached to those experiences and unplug it so it no longer troubles you in that way. That'll be useful.
[10:06] B: Yeah.
[10:07] A: Don't you think? Yeah. And we get to do that in a painless way. That's fun. Because again, I'm fun. At least more fun than shitty stuff. I don't set the barber. Okay. So we got the angst around what you did do and the worry about, like, how that might be with. And I'm a little awkward as a result of that. Right. So we got that. We got that. There's been a whole bunch of things that have happened along the way that although they're over, some of them over a long time ago, they still, underneath the surface, affect you. We want the effect that that's had going. Cool. Okay. What else are we wanting our time to do?
[10:44] B: So.
[10:51] A: Yeah. What's happening now?
[10:53] B: Just thinking about. I Don't know. This is what I should be talking about.
[10:57] A: Well, definitely don't talk about any of the things that make you go.
[11:06] B: It's just how to deal with my family who all think. Okay. Think that I'm not a good person that I can stay away from. Like, I'm not going there for things here, you know, But I. Okay. So my son, my kid's father, owned an escort service. And I didn't know that when I met him, but anyway, he raped me. And so now Sean is a result of that.
[11:43] A: I see.
[11:44] B: So. So When John was 2, I had Danny. Danny was 6 months old. I have the two kids. One morning he came out to me and told me that daddy said his. And he was stuttering really bad. And daddy says pee pee was a lollipop. And I knew immediately that something had to happen because he was. Couldn't talk. So that night I. When my husband went to sleep, I packed the car.
[12:08] A: Yeah.
[12:09] B: And the three of us left. So I went to Miami where my mom was and blah, blah, they did a rape test. And they said that he wasn't physically touched, but they do believe that something orally could have happened to him. And I went to court. They gave my husband no visitation rights whatsoever. Blah, blah, blah. So now, growing up, my mother told my younger son that that never happened. And I was just, you know, full of. That never happened. So my son has resentment towards me.
[12:46] A: Thinking that, you know, you intentionally kept him from his dad.
[12:51] B: Yes.
[12:52] A: Non protective way.
[12:54] B: Right. Right.
[12:55] A: Okay.
[12:56] B: Yeah. And. And so then the rest of my family, because my mother was like the, you know, gossip. Yeah.
[13:02] A: Yeah.
[13:04] B: I'll think that about me too.
[13:05] A: Okay.
[13:06] B: I know that. I know what happened. I took my kids away to protect them. You know, my oldest son never wanted to know his father, but. And he's okay. And it's the one that he's the one that happened to.
[13:20] A: Yeah.
[13:20] B: But he just seems fine, you know? Danny, on the other hand.
[13:26] A: Right. Because he would know that it happened to him.
[13:28] B: Yeah. I mean, I don't.
[13:30] A: Yeah, right. That's different. Nobody else did.
[13:32] B: Oh, my God. Wow.
[13:34] A: Do you get it?
[13:35] B: Yeah.
[13:35] A: Like, that's why he's not so troubled, because he goes, yeah, no, that is what happened.
[13:38] B: Oh, my God.
[13:40] A: Tell the other people are like, no, it couldn't have been.
[13:42] B: Wow.
[13:43] A: Right. To paint you in a bad light. Right. Yeah. But he knows, Right. Why you did that for him.
[13:53] B: Yeah.
[13:54] A: Right. Even if you weren't always the best. Right. I mean, come on. Like. But still.
[14:01] B: Right.
[14:01] A: Like, you did that for Him. Right? Yeah. Yeah, right.
[14:06] B: Geez. I never ever thought.
[14:08] A: Isn't that cool?
[14:09] B: That is so cool.
[14:10] A: Yeah.
[14:11] B: Wow.
[14:12] A: So we want you to have more ease in dealing with that difficult family. Right. Because.
[14:19] B: Yeah.
[14:20] A: Yeah. Because I don't know if I can always not interact with them, but they do things or they believe things and those things press my buttons.
[14:27] B: Yeah.
[14:28] A: And it'd be way better if when they did those things and press my buttons, my buttons didn't do that to me.
[14:34] B: Yes, yes.
[14:34] A: Because that's the thing about life. Even if we get rid of them, there's other people that know how to press the same buttons in you.
[14:40] B: Yeah.
[14:41] A: Right. So what we want to do, Susan, is unplug the buttons so that even when they get pressed, it doesn't do that thing to you. That'd be cool, right?
[14:51] B: Yes.
[14:51] A: Okay. I know how to do that too. Awesome. Wow.
[14:55] B: I'm just like, wow.
[14:56] A: Yeah. What else are you wanting to do?
[14:59] B: It's really all about that. And also my biological father leaving. But I don't even give a about that.
[15:06] A: What does that mean?
[15:08] B: Well, he left when I was a baby, so it was my brother, myself, and he left. And evidently he was an alcoholic. But so I've always felt I wasn't good enough. Why didn't he stay? Why didn't you stay?
[15:19] A: But that's felt like it was about you. Remember how I said that with little kids?
[15:22] B: Yeah, Right.
[15:23] A: When something bad happens, little kid goes, well, it must be about my lack of lovability or worth or. Right. But you know, as an adult, it wasn't about you.
[15:33] B: Right.
[15:34] A: It was about him being screwed up in that way.
[15:36] B: Right, Right.
[15:38] A: Not your lovability.
[15:40] B: Right.
[15:40] A: But the problem is that you don't know that where it counts. See, you know that here. Right. But you don't know that in here. Yeah, Right. So that's one of the things that we want to do is we want to get what you know so that you feel it too.
[15:53] B: Okay.
[15:54] A: Yeah. Right. And part of that is we gotta unplug certain things because I can't ever get into here. I can know it all here, but it doesn't get into here unless it's unplugged. Right?
[16:06] B: Yeah. And so like my dad. My mom married my dad when I was three.
[16:16] A: Yeah.
[16:16] B: And I had no idea. I don't remember anything about my biological father. I just knew him to be my dad. 18. My brother told me that our dad adopted us and had my little sister. And I was so mad because all these years I knew something wasn't Right. I mean, I remember looking in the hutch for papers to find something. I had no clue, you know.
[16:37] A: Yeah. And that you weren't. That Dad's biological. Yeah.
[16:42] B: And so my little sister is.
[16:43] A: Sure.
[16:44] B: But. So I've always felt like I didn't belong. But I didn't know why, because I.
[16:50] A: Sure.
[16:51] B: But when I was 18, I found out. So now my father, who adopted me, I took care. I love him more than anything. And my mother passed, and then I lived here. I went to Orlando to take care of my father for four and a half years. And my sister and brother lived there and used to always get mad at me because I'm taking too much care of my dad. Or my father died. My father and I were very close, but my father died and I was here. I had to come back here because I was fighting with Baba. Anyway, one of my family members and my brother called me and said that, you need to come. Dad's on life support. And it really hurt me because why didn't they tell me sooner? My dad. My dad was in a couple. But the thing is, I get it. He passed away, all that, you know. But my family has such resentments. And I think it goes back to when my mother told everybody that I was lying about what happened to Sean. And Sean had to go through speech therapy for three months. I took him three times a week. I mean, there was. Obviously. But nobody believed me. So now they all think I'm crazy. They all think I'm crazy. Like, I took real good care of my father. You know, he wore Depends, and I gave him his medicine. I fed him, not fed him, but, you know, anyway. I don't even know if that has anything to do with what we're talking.
[18:16] A: About, but that's also heavy.
[18:18] B: It's real heavy. And, Yeah, I have a sister that I don't really ever want to talk to again because she was the main one.
[18:23] A: Oh.
[18:23] B: Just put him in a nursing home and. Yes.
[18:29] A: But there's a lot of hard feelings with all that. And we would like to soften. Lighten those hard feelings so that you're more okay.
[18:38] B: Yeah. And I think.
[18:40] A: And more okay with what happened.
[18:41] B: Right. I think that's why, like. So when I found out when I was 18, I just went wild. Like, that's when I started doing drugs, prostituting. I wanted to find somebody that love me, blah, blah, blah. I was married three times, never over three years. So it's in my cycle. So now my dad loved me to death, you know, and I took care of him for that. You know, I felt like I paid my dues to my dad, you know, and my family. All people crazy. So I know I'm not. I mean, I know that I'm not. But now here's Thanksgiving and Christmas and deity says, or Sean says, oh, Aunt Debbie, want your phone number, and maybe you should reach out. But I just still have. I just.
[19:26] A: You're not there yet.
[19:27] B: No.
[19:28] A: So what we can do gets it so that you've got more freedom with all that, regardless of what you decide to do.
[19:34] B: Right.
[19:35] A: Right. Because right now, based on what it does to you, I can't do it. Right. What we want is we want you to have the freedom that if it makes sense to do it, you can or not in both ways be okay.
[19:46] B: Yeah.
[19:47] A: Because right now it's too triggering.
[19:49] B: Right.
[19:50] A: Right. So we want to turn that all down. Right.
[19:52] B: And I don't even know if that's appropriate to talk about in here, because I think this is for, you know, like, prostitution and the trauma that I went through with that kind of stuff.
[20:00] A: Oh, no. This is all about getting your life to work better now.
[20:03] B: Okay. So I was reluctant to even speak about this.
[20:07] A: Oh. But this is all about. So. So I said to you, nobody would give a. About the stuff that happened in life if now is working the way that I wanted it to.
[20:16] B: Okay.
[20:18] A: Why are you here? We want now to work better. What are you dealing with now? Well, I'm dealing with the after effects of a whole bunch of crap with my family that trigger me and press my buttons. And that's been really, really challenging and hard because they have all thought I'm at it, and I wasn't, and that's been really challenging. But my mom parlayed this whole stuff add into that. Like, I lost a father figure who was dad for me, grew up that way even when I felt like I wasn't really a part of. Because I was different then. But all that happened, too. So there's been a whole bunch of family stuff that has created more conflicts between different family members. And all we want for you is we want you to have more freedom in dealing with it and in being with it so that them and that stuff doesn't do what it usually does to you.
[21:14] B: Right.
[21:17] A: So that you're not feeling that anymore.
[21:20] B: Yeah.
[21:20] A: Yeah. That you're able to experience their stuff as being about them or it's not making you feel bad about you.
[21:29] B: Oh, my gosh. It just. Maybe that is. So that's it. Because this is what I'm Learning in my sobriety. You know, I'm a little over a year sober now.
[21:39] A: Hey, congratulations.
[21:40] B: I know. Thank you.
[21:41] A: And I heard it was your birthday yesterday. Hey, happy birthday. Yay.
[21:45] B: So when you said it's about them, not about me, it just really hit me because this is what I'm working on, is that when I. Someone treats me a certain kind of way and they're. It's not about me, it's about what they have going on. So this is about. Really about.
[22:02] A: Yes. And again, that's great to have that understanding.
[22:05] B: Right.
[22:05] A: But we want it in body.
[22:07] B: Yeah.
[22:08] A: So it's at a feeling level because the feelings are preconscious. Right. When you get triggered, you're not saying to yourself, oh, I'm going to decide to feel angry right now.
[22:17] B: Right.
[22:17] A: Boom. You find yourself feeling angry. Right. Like, so you don't choose it. We want to change things at that deeper level. At the deeper, more unconscious level. The automatic. The habit.
[22:30] B: Yeah.
[22:31] A: Right. Neuroscience calls it the default mode network. It's the house of habits. Right. You've got some bad habits in you. You've got some good habits.
[22:39] B: Right.
[22:39] A: But you've got some bad habits. Meaning there's a tendency in the brain and the way that your brain has been working to replay certain awful things that happened.
[22:52] B: Yeah.
[22:53] A: Recent or long time ago. That's an error.
[22:56] B: Yeah.
[22:57] A: In the way that your brain has been working. Right. There's been the stuff of thinking that, like, oh, I am what I did, but you're not what you did. That's not you.
[23:08] B: Right.
[23:08] A: That was just something you did.
[23:10] B: Right.
[23:10] A: Right. Who you are is much more than what you just did.
[23:15] B: Yeah.
[23:15] A: Right. So we want you to be more at peace with the things that have happened. Not saying that those things were okay.
[23:23] B: Right.
[23:24] A: But that you get to be okay now even though those things back then weren't.
[23:29] B: Right.
[23:30] A: Got it.
[23:31] B: Yeah. Yeah. Like when I. Watching TV in a rape scene or above or.
[23:37] A: Yeah.
[23:37] B: About prostitution. It's like, that's where I go. Like, wow. You know? So.
[23:41] A: Right. We want that all to stop so that you're more at ease and more comfortable in your own skin. Right. We want you to be much more emotionally present, meaning your emotions are matching what's happening.
[23:56] B: Yeah.
[23:57] A: Got it. We want you to be what I'm going to call much more outwardly focused, meaning that when you interact with others, you're not spending much of any time at all thinking or feeling about yourself.
[24:09] B: Okay. Because that is what happens.
[24:12] A: Right. You're much more outwardly focused so that you're simply learning about them. And you might actually be learning about how they might be feeling about something you said or did, but you're not actually learning about you. You're learning about them. Got it.
[24:30] B: Yeah.
[24:31] A: And that. That's fully integrated so that when you're learning about them, you might be learning that they might be upset over something you said or did. And based on who they are, we want you to have the breath of how to respond, which sometimes might be in a caring, compassionate, understanding, apologetic, nurturing way. At other times, it might be in a. Yeah, no, that's exactly what I was intending and being. Okay. And the other time, that stuff just goes by. It's like rainwater on the roof. It has no, like, stick. Right. This is the you that I'm seeing when we're done, the effect that the past stuff has had, stuff that you did or happened to you that's been completely cleared so that you're free from the effect that that's had. Meaning you could think about it and you could talk about it. And even when you think about it or talk about it, you're present and. Okay.
[25:23] B: Yeah.
[25:24] A: Got it. Yeah. This is where we're headed. Make sense. And the good part is you don't have to know how to get there. Only one of us in the room needs to know what we're doing. Right. And that's why the question isn't how it's gonna happen. You know it's going to happen that we get you here. That's not the question, though. The question is, would it be okay with you?
[25:43] B: Yeah.
[25:43] A: Yeah. To be this way?
[25:45] B: Yeah.
[25:45] A: Right. And with you. Okay. We've got a green light.
[25:47] B: Okay.
[25:48] A: Right. In order to get somebody somewhere, you have to know where you're going. And it has to be okay to go there.
[25:54] B: Yes.
[25:54] A: Once you've got those two things, you're much closer to getting there.
[25:57] B: Okay.
[25:57] A: Than you were before you started.
[25:59] B: Yeah.
[25:59] A: Right. Then what we want to do is we want to set the process up in such a way that gets your body in the right states for healing. The right states for healing are always states of rest. It's why colds, flus, and surgery. What do we tell people to do? Yeah. So we've got some really neat levers that neuroscientists discovered by putting FMRI scans on people's brains that are designed to put the body into a state of rest. The first one's really silly and simple. It's about relaxing the back of your tongue. So as you rest the back of your Tongue, relax the back of your tongue. You might notice that your jaw drops slightly. And so as you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, with your jaw a little bit loose, you can begin to breathe, right? But intentionally a little bit slower and deeper on the way in. And then intentionally a little bit slower and longer on the way out. So notice as your jaw is slightly lowered and you're resting your tongue and you're breathing in. Right. A little bit slower and deeper out. A little bit longer. As you're doing this right now, Susan, check inside your body. How's your body feeling now? Relaxed. It is more relaxed, isn't it? So then we add the next layer. And the next layer is when we're stressed, nervous, intense. We're in more tunneling vision, right? It's where all the anxiety, agitation, fear, worry, angst, upset, live. We're moving brain waves down from the high end of beta down to low end of beta, higher end of alpha, and then into the alpha waves, which are all about expanding alpha. Surfers call flow athletes. Think of it being in the zone, alert, relaxed. Got it. And it opens up vision to notice more with my peripheral vision. So how it works is again, your jaw is relaxed at the bottom of your mouth. Jaw is slightly dropped. You're breathing in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper in. A little bit longer on the way out, right. As you breathe in this way, stay looking at my nose. As you see my fingers, you stay looking at my nose. As my fingers move out all the way out, you look at my nose, but with the sides of your eyes, you now pick up my fingers. Wiggling, right? And notice how as you're doing this, Susan, you're becoming more aware of the space in the room. Like, you notice more that there's space between us, that there's space beyond me, that there's space to your right or to your left, that there's space underneath you, there's space behind you to the wall, there's space above your head. Right? And as you're aware of the space, check inside your body once again. And how's your body feeling now?
[29:10] B: Relaxed.
[29:10] A: It is relaxed. And then the last one, because you might have said this or heard somebody use the phrase, I'm under a lot of stress. And in order for somebody to be underneath the stress, where must the stress be? It's a weird thought, right? In order to be underneath the stress, where must the stress be? It could be in your brain on top, right? If I'm under it, it's got to be on top of me. Right. If I crawl under the table, where is the table top? Right. Got it. So the reversal is to get out from under and to rise up above it, having a different metaphor of bird's eye view. So how it works is you slightly lower your jaw and you rely Relax the back of your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper in and a little bit longer out. Right. As you breathe in this way. Right. Notice my nose. Stay looking at my nose. As you see my fingers, they go all the way out. You notice the wiggling. You're aware of the space in the room and notice that even though you can sense the space all around you, that the space goes beyond the room. Space literally goes out, Susan, in every direction, in all ways unending, towards outer space and beyond. As you're noticing this space, go ahead right now and close your eyes and just notice that with your eyes closed, you no longer see me, but you absolutely sense the space. Imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling in the roof, so that you rise up above it all in the sky, having this bird's eye view, you see it all as being under and below you because you're above and over it. And like the bird, free to soar through this space in the sky and move in different directions, maybe with big, wide arching turns and curves. You soar, you fly, you glide, you move. You're free. Right. Bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you. When you're ready. Ready. Take a nice deep breath in. That's right. And then exhale and open your eyes. That's right. That's right. Yeah. And what did you notice in those short moments? Eyes were closed.
[31:53] B: Everything's okay.
[31:55] A: That everything's okay. It is not just okay, but we're on our way to having it be even better for you. Right. Because your unconscious is responsive to you and interested in working in ways that are best. Right. It's what runs the automatic programs. It's the default mode network. It wants to operate in ways that are best. It's why when a bug splats the windshield, it blinks your eyes. Right. There are errors in the interaction between those aspects of the brain. That's why certain things stayed stuck. It doesn't work that way in an animal brain. Right. Animals have emotions to motivate them to do something or get something to stop or solve a problem. Right. It's why when the rabbit sees the fox, it immediately Experiences fear to get it to run away, not because it wanted it to have a bad day, do something. If the squirrel's tail is in the fire, it's pain. Not because it wants brain of the squirrel to hate itself and feel like an idiot, but to get the tail out of the fire, not because it wants a squirrel to later on feel like no other squirrel is going to like me because I'm marred. No. All of the negative emotions we experience are also trying to get us to do something. The problem for us when it comes to those negative moments is that what our brain is causing in those feelings trying to get us to do something, is in a time period that no longer exists. So I can't do something, which is really good news because that means I don't have to. All we have to do is update the timing. And that, Susan, is the biggest error in the brain is timing. And it's because with this other part of our brain, we have access to time. Like knowing you're sitting here now remembering something you did this morning, thinking about something you're going to do over the weekend. You have access to time. No animal does. Right?
[34:13] B: Yeah.
[34:14] A: Not a problem if it's positive or neutral, because brain gets the difference between the memory and experience. Got it?
[34:23] B: Yeah.
[34:24] A: When it's negative, weird, bad, sad, awful, scary, upsetting, horrific, catastrophic, traumatic, our brain confuses the memory, thinking it's the experience that's the error. Got it?
[34:39] B: Yeah.
[34:40] A: That's why somebody can tell us about getting mugged and gets to the part where they got the knife and now their face is white. Even though we're nice people kindly listening to them. What the fuck is happening?
[34:49] B: I know, right? Right.
[34:51] A: Their brain is confusing the memory. We know it affects them when they tell us about it, but it's also affecting them even over the weekend, maybe even when they were shopping in Publix. It was just under the surface. Up here. They know it's over, finished, done with it. But there's that other part that never got the good news. Got it?
[35:14] B: Yeah.
[35:15] A: We want to get the good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know unplugging the memory so the brain can experience it as data about something that happened, not happening.
[35:30] B: Right, yeah.
[35:32] A: Got it.
[35:32] B: Yeah, yeah.
[35:34] A: So as you're checking in you right now, how's your body feeling?
[35:38] B: Relaxed.
[35:38] A: It is feeling relaxed, isn't it?
[35:41] B: Yeah.
[35:41] A: Isn't that a nice feeling?
[35:42] B: It is.
[35:43] A: Right. And see, I don't know whether you realize it or not, but you didn't consciously Decide to put your left hand over and on top of your right hand. And earlier it was actually your right hand that was on top of your left. And again, none of those things were things that you were consciously deciding to do, which is interesting. Right?
[36:04] B: Yeah.
[36:04] A: That your body does stuff for you all the time without you consciously deciding to do it. Right. That much of what you do, you're not actually consciously deciding to do isn't that interesting. So, therefore, your unconscious is interested in working in ways that are best for you. You. That's why it does most of those automatic habits or, you know, house of habit, default mode, network. Right.
[36:32] B: Yeah.
[36:33] A: What we're going to do is we're going to change the way that some of that information has gotten coded in your brain. So we're not changing the information. Right. We don't get the experiences that were awful to have not been awful experiences because they were awful. We just get the emotion that's still been attached to those awful experience dispersed and gone. So I don't feel bad anymore. Yeah, that's where we're headed. Got it. Yeah. And it's very simple to do and only requires one thing from you.
[37:12] B: Okay.
[37:14] A: Do you want to know what it is I do? Okay, good. Your job, Susan, is to intend to emotionally be with me. The reason that you want to be with me is that I'm a happening guy. Right. This is what's happening. I'm a happening guy. This is. And that stuff isn't. Got it. Two, we're working on the goal that you and I both are aligned in and want for you. Right. And three, like I said before, the bar is not set very high, but I'm hoping hanging with me in a nice office is at least a little more enjoyable than some of the worst moments of your life. Got it. So that's what we want to get in. And then when we go through moments, because your unconscious is going to bring a moment to your awareness that it knows would be useful to unplug that. As it does, it moves us towards the future you. Okay. So what we know about that is when we go through it, we're just going to go through the facts, the what happened. And it literally is like in a minute or less, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened. Then it was done. Right. We never go through moments in that matter of fact way. But as you're intending to be here with me, the doing of that will begin to unplug the emotion. Then we do another weird thing. Have you ever noticed when people remember Stuff, they always go from the beginning of the memory towards the end.
[38:45] B: Yeah.
[38:46] A: And that where the memory tends to stop a lot of times is at the worst part of the worst part of the worst part.
[38:51] B: Yeah.
[38:52] A: Right. So we're connecting that worst part to something later that was more enjoyable. Okay. Because no matter what awful thing you've gone through, there were something later that was more enjoyable than the awful thing.
[39:06] B: Right.
[39:07] A: So we're connecting it to something later that was more enjoyable then. Because people go through memory forward, we're going to go through the memory in reverse, backwards, from the good things that happen later to it ending to when it was happening to before it ever happened. Which is weird. I know. But here's the cool part. When you go backwards with a memory, it literally unplugs the memory. It takes away the charge because the brain, for the first time experiences it as memory data versus happening. Because it can't still be happening if I can go through it backwards. You follow me? It's so weird.
[39:53] B: Right.
[39:54] A: And then we do a third thing to get it completely cleared up, which is the emotional brain doesn't get logic, but it does get patterns of association. And the error is that the memory of what happened and the experience are glued, stuck together. So the memory is the experience.
[40:19] B: Okay.
[40:20] A: But there are things that you can remember doing today, Susan, that you know with certainty you're not doing. Like, for example, putting on your white shoes, which you're only allowed to wear in Florida because your past season. In other places, it's only from Memorial Day to Labor Day when you're up north, but luckily you're in Florida, so it's okay. But see, you can remember putting on your white shoes.
[40:46] B: Yes.
[40:47] A: You can even remember where you were when you did it. But if I simply said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your white shoes on, and then I went, susan, stop putting on your shoes. You would say back to me, I am not putting on my shoes. Because what's crystal clear is, you know, there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually doing it. Got it?
[41:13] B: Yeah.
[41:13] A: So we're going to use that pattern of association came up. I call it the I'm not. You're not. It's not. I'm not putting on my pants. You're not putting on your pants. It's not happening. So that the brain.
[41:27] B: Yeah.
[41:28] A: Connects. It no longer exists. As soon as that happens, the pain goes away. Because the pain has never been there, whether it be anger or hurt or grief or guilt or shame or regret. Remorse or any combination. It's not there because it was so awful. It's there because emotionally the brain doesn't know it's over. Got it?
[41:53] B: Yeah.
[41:54] A: Yeah. So we have a lot of good news to get in to different parts of the brain. Right. So do you get to be more freed up? Last part to that is when those moments are unplugged and all of the energy that was being used to deal with it in an ongoing way in the body gets freed up, that energy gets to be recycled and renewed for healing, for forwarding, how we're organizing you to be, which is free and much more emotionally present and much more outwardly focused. That you're experiencing their stuff as being about them, that you're more at peace. Peace with who you are now, on your way to be becoming even better versions of you, no longer haunted by any of that stuff. This is where we're headed. Got it?
[42:51] B: Yeah.
[42:52] A: Yeah. So one last time. Maybe not. Go ahead and slightly lower your jaw and relax your tongue. Begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer. Right. As you're breathing in this way, notice that your fingers are interlocked. And again, did you decide which fingers were going to be on top and which fingers were going to be in between? No. But your unconscious did it for you. So your unconscious is responding to what we're doing. That's right. And we can deepen your mind's responsiveness. Right. When you begin to pay attention to movements that are not conscious movements, there's what you're able to consciously notice. But then there's movement happening. Like even within those fingers of that hand, there's movement happening whether you notice it or not consciously. Right. Because you do know that inside the fingers, there's blood constantly in motion, flowing and providing energy and nutrients to the cells. Right. So the thing that we're beginning to understand is that no matter what you think is going on consciously, there's always more going on that's not conscious. Right. And as your unconscious is responding, that part is going to travel back down that timeline of moments of things that happen. It's going to begin to group and categorize different moments, and then it's going to just narrow down and pinpoint and bring a particular time to your awareness. Right. And you got one. And the moment that just came to mind happened, like, how long ago? And you want to be with me. Not there, here. I know, but notice how I noticed that you weren't here. So my job in the whole role is to keep you here because I'm more fun. Your job is to just intend. You were about how old when that happened?
[45:18] B: That was eight years ago.
[45:21] A: Eight years ago. Right. Good. And the feelings, as you think about it, are feelings of what is it? Anger, hurt, grief, guilt, Shame, Regret. Remorse.
[45:28] B: Hurt.
[45:29] A: Hurt. Would it be okay to get the hurt gone?
[45:31] B: Yes.
[45:32] A: If the hurt was gone, Susan, would it mean what happened to you was okay? Yes, it would. See, if the hurt's gone, does it mean what you went through is okay?
[45:43] B: Oh, no.
[45:43] A: Right. You get to be okay.
[45:45] B: Yeah.
[45:45] A: Even though that wasn't okay.
[45:47] B: Right. Right.
[45:47] A: Right. You're being okay now doesn't mean that was okay then.
[45:50] B: Right.
[45:50] A: Got it.
[45:51] B: Oh, yeah.
[45:51] A: Notice the difference?
[45:52] B: Yes.
[45:53] A: Yeah. Now we have clarity. So then all you're going to do is tell me just the. What happened while being here? But before you do that, because it happened eight years ago, what's something you've done recent that was more fun than that? Anytime from eight years ago until yesterday.
[46:09] B: I had crab legs last night. Yeah.
[46:11] A: Having crab legs. Way more enjoyable than that. Right, Good. Something else?
[46:14] B: Yeah.
[46:15] A: What? Yeah, one other. Two other.
[46:16] B: Beach. Going to the beach.
[46:17] A: Yeah. Going to the beach. Right. And one other thing.
[46:19] B: Seeing my family. My grandkids.
[46:21] A: Seeing the grandkids. So you got seeing the grandkids, you got going to the beach, got having crab legs. All of those moments happen after that.
[46:26] B: Right.
[46:27] A: There's a part of your brain that doesn't mo. Doesn't know any moment beyond it. It. So we have good news to get in. Got it.
[46:37] B: Yes.
[46:38] A: So that moment happened eight years ago. When it happened, you were where, physically? Yeah.
[46:44] B: In Orlando.
[46:45] A: So you're in Orlando. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[46:48] B: Day and night.
[46:49] A: Well, like as it started with daytime. And you're where?
[46:52] B: At my house with my father.
[46:53] A: So you're at your house with dad. Right. Good. And then what happened next, Ellie?
[46:56] B: Brother told my father that I was on drugs and I need to leave.
[47:01] A: Right. So your brother comes in and says, hey, dad, Susan's on drugs. She's got to go. Yeah. Right. Good job. Then what happened next?
[47:09] B: Cried.
[47:10] A: Then you cried. Right.
[47:11] B: Then pack my stuff.
[47:13] A: And then you packed your stuff. Right.
[47:14] B: Good.
[47:14] A: Yeah.
[47:14] B: Talk to my father. And I left.
[47:15] A: And then you said, okay, dad, I gotta go. Right. And then you left.
[47:18] B: Right.
[47:18] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[47:21] B: I came back to Sarasota.
[47:23] A: Right. And then that moment was over.
[47:25] B: Yeah.
[47:26] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun. Yes. Right. Like go to the beach. Right, Right. Or have crab legs. Right, Right. Or what's the third one? Yeah, see, the grandkids. See, you got it. Right, Right. So notice, as you were telling me about it, a little less discomfort than normal because you were intending to be with me.
[47:45] B: Yes.
[47:45] A: Got it. Now, we never go backwards. Watch what happens when we go backwards. So we got, you know, hanging out with the grandkids. We had going to the beach. We got having crab legs. Right. And then before that, I was in Sarasota, and then I left, and then I talked to dad, and then I packed up. And then brother said, hey, we've got Susan using. She's got to go. And then before that, you were there doing that and taking care of dad. Right. And then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing. As I went backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[48:17] B: Uncomfortable?
[48:18] A: Was it the same? Was it more? Was it less?
[48:20] B: It was less.
[48:21] A: It was less. Was it?
[48:22] B: Yeah.
[48:23] A: Than it was when you told it to me.
[48:24] B: Yes.
[48:25] A: Right. Because your brain is getting that it's data. Right. About something that happened. Right. Not happening.
[48:33] B: Right.
[48:34] A: Right. So the third. Right. You can remember that happening. Brother telling dad, you packing up, you talking to dad, you leave. You can remember that happening. But you can also remember putting your white shoes on today. Susan, stop putting on your shoes. Say, I'm not putting on my shoes.
[48:50] B: I'm not putting on my shoes.
[48:51] A: Stop me from putting on my shoes. Say you're not putting on yours. Well, then you stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants. Well, stop me from putting on my pants. Say, you're not putting on your pants.
[49:01] B: You're not putting on your pants.
[49:02] A: Well, stop brother from doing that. Say he's not doing that.
[49:04] B: Okay.
[49:05] A: Well, then you stop doing that. Say, I'm not doing that.
[49:08] B: I'm not doing that.
[49:09] A: Well, then stop that from happening. See, that's not happening.
[49:12] B: That's not happening.
[49:13] A: Right. Stop him from kicking you out. Say, he's not kicking me out.
[49:15] B: He's not.
[49:16] A: Right. So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists.
[49:19] B: Wow.
[49:19] A: Right? Wow. You're so good. Right, Right, Right. Notice what's happening to the feelings.
[49:26] B: Yeah.
[49:27] A: Right.
[49:29] B: Wow.
[49:30] A: Right? Isn't that cool?
[49:32] B: It's very cool.
[49:33] A: Yeah. Yeah. Because now, as you're thinking about it, it. What do you notice?
[49:41] B: Relaxed.
[49:42] A: It is, isn't it?
[49:43] B: Yes, it is. I can breathe, like.
[49:50] A: Right. Notice what's happening to the hurt.
[49:52] B: Yeah.
[49:54] A: Right, Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[49:59] B: It is very good news.
[50:01] A: Yeah. And that's what we're doing.
[50:03] B: Yeah.
[50:03] A: Or Getting in. Good news.
[50:06] B: Yeah. That's crazy.
[50:13] A: Who would have thought it could be that simple?
[50:14] B: I know. I know, right? Yeah.
[50:20] A: It's not that hard.
[50:21] B: No, it's not.
[50:22] A: No. But most people go, no, no, you really got to feel more of it or they'll ask the worst question that a therapist could can ever ask. Well, then, how did that make you feel? Really, you have to ask me that question. Come on. It made me feel great. Come on.
[50:39] B: I know.
[50:40] A: It's the worst question ever. You can't guess like you're a therapist. Really?
[50:43] B: I know. That's funny. Oh, my God. This is crazy.
[50:48] A: Right? Right. So notice what's happening. We're changing things inside, Right. At a deeper, not conscious level. Right? Yeah. Yeah. So as you're noticing all of that, notice what happens as your jaw slightly lowers and you relax the back of your tongue. Right. And you breathe in a way that's slower and deeper. And how awareness expands. And you notice more again, knowing that your fingers are interlaced. Right. And I'm curious, do you know whether they're interlaced in the same way they were the last time, or is it different? And you might not remember because sometimes you don't need to because it's not conscious. That's right. And your not conscious is responding to what we're doing. And it's going to travel back again down and select another moment for us to unplug and clear. Right. And you got one. Right. And that one happened how long ago?
[52:10] B: Eight years.
[52:11] A: Eight years. It was a great time. Eight years ago.
[52:13] B: It was.
[52:17] A: Yeah. So eight years ago. You're aware when that one happened? Yeah. What are you noticing now, Susan?
[52:32] B: Just going back to other times.
[52:35] A: You are going back to other times. We only want to do one at a time.
[52:38] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[52:39] A: So which one came to mind now?
[52:45] B: Yeah. I was raped by my father.
[52:51] A: All right, that one happened how long ago?
[52:53] B: 40 years ago.
[52:55] A: 40 years ago. Okay. So again, would it be okay to get you to be okay?
[52:58] B: Yes.
[52:59] A: And if you're okay, does it mean what happened to you was okay? No. No, it doesn't, does it?
[53:03] B: No.
[53:04] A: No. Right. So before we do that, I'm going to explain one other thing to you. So, people often walk around in life confused, meaning we over identify as my thoughts or as my actions or as my behavior or what I do or what I've done, my past. Right. I overidentify it as me. If I have diarrhea, I don't say to you, I am diarrhea. I say, I have diarrhea. But if I, you know, think of myself, who's laying on the couch and I go, lazy piece of junk. I'm a lazy piece of junk. Right. I over identify that thought as well. Right. Makes sense.
[53:51] B: Yes.
[53:52] A: So in addition to people over identifying their thoughts, on a lot of times people think that I am the thinker of my thoughts. But what if you, Susan, are not the thinker of your thoughts? What if your brain is the thinker of your thoughts? And your brain is not you, which is a weird thought, but it's not you. It's an organ, just like your heart and your lungs. They're totally yours, but they're not you. So what if you're not your thoughts? And what if you're not your body, which is a weird thought to even have, that you're not your body. But we could say that you have a body, that your body is totally yours, but it isn't actually you, because your body has changed over time. Your feet have grown, all sorts of other things have happened, and you remained being you regardless of what was going on in your body. That if we take it and we came back a year from today, neuroscientist has discovered that 99.99999999% of the subatomic particles that are making us up right now would no longer be here. Weird.
[55:05] B: Yeah.
[55:06] A: So you're not your body either. Oh, well, if I'm not my body or my thoughts, I must be how I feel. But you can't be a feeling. You feel different ways at different times. Oh, if I'm not any of those things, I must be what I do. Except we already said earlier that you're not what you do and you're not what you've done. And when you stop doing that to do this other thing and then that other thing, did you stop existing? No. So the weirder question becomes, if you're not any of those things, your body, your thoughts, your feelings, what you do, what are you? So do this for me. Think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something and it's just beautiful. So that the moment you're seeing it, you're like, wow, what is it that you see? Me? Huh?
[55:59] B: The sunset?
[56:00] A: Yeah. Isn't there a moment that as you're seeing the sunset, you are feeling that sunset? Sense of awe, wonder, peace. And some people would tell you, of course it's seeing that and being there that's going to give you the feeling. But if we looked at it differently, we could also say that seeing there, seeing it and being there drew your awareness down and in. Because what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited? Kind of like I'm cold, or outside, there's a bonfire. And so I bring my hands closer and closer to the flames, and I say, holy shit, the fire's getting hotter. And you say back to me, the fire's not getting any hotter. Right. I'm becoming more aware of the heat. My hands are getting closer to the flames. Got it? Yes. So we could say that what happens when we see something beautiful is that our awareness is drawn in and down towards our center. We think of that white at the center is light of wisdom, different than light of knowledge. Right? And so I work with a lot of different people, have had awful stuff happen to them. I remember one girl that I worked with a long time ago, her older brother used to do awful stuff to her in the bathtub. And, you know, anytime she. There was just. But when we work together, we unplugged, gone, like, all the gone. And I asked her that question. I said, you know, all of that go, where was it? And she looks at me and she's smiling. She goes, it's gone. I don't feel it. I said, yeah, I know, that's cool. But the question was, where was it? And as we started thinking, I go, was it a surface level thing? And she's like, no, it wasn't intellectual. I said, maybe it was hiding in your center. She's like, how could it survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited? And I went, well, then, where was it? And this is what she said. She said it was hiding in the shadows in between the lights. And I go, well, what happened? She says, the lights are joined. They're touching. The shadows are gone. And I said, whoa, that is powerful. Yeah, right? So powerful that I decided to tell her about going to the dentist and how he put me on this chair where my head went down and then shined this light on me. And then I said, you'll never believe what the jerk that dentist did to me. And she goes, what did she do? I go, well, he took this metal instrument.
[58:55] B: I gotta call you back. Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
[58:59] A: Hey, it happened.
[59:03] B: I am so sorry.
[59:06] A: There you go. So as I was saying, right, I'm at the dentist. He took this cold instrument and shoved it right up inside of me. And she's like, oh, my goodness. And you're what? I said, my mouth. Because I'm at the dentist. But it's the same Thing I said to the girl with her brother, right? I said, when you were little, he totally messed with your stuff. And she looked at me and she had that same glowing smile. And she said, he did. And for a long time it screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings. And then she looked at me and she said, but you know what? I go, what? She says, he never touched me. He messed with my body, but he never got me. I said, whoa. She said, because what if who I am is the light at the center, and the light that is me, me can't get touched or harmed, and that light is energy. Right? Because Einstein said when people pass away that who we are as human beings are energy plus matter. And that equals this touchable physical existence. And then what becomes the second law of thermodynamics? Energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. So when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, it's that their bodies stop. They're no longer in need of it, so they exit it. Which is why when we see them after they've exited and we touch, their body doesn't feel like it used to because they're not in it anymore. Got it?
[60:46] B: Yeah.
[60:47] A: But the energy is not heaven far above the stars and sky, but here. Just like there are things that our five senses don't pick up as well as other species, right? I can blow a whistle and we not hear any sound. But the dog next to us is going. Because their sensitivity is different, right? I can sit next to the guy who's carrying a kilo of coconut. No, the dog immediately knows. Yeah, got it.
[61:22] B: Yeah.
[61:22] A: So we know that our five senses, what we can perceive, see, hear, taste, touch, smell, are limited in scope. Got it. So we want to be getting in that this thought. I want you to repeat these words after me, okay? I have a nose.
[61:45] B: I have a nose.
[61:46] A: I have ten fingers.
[61:47] B: I have ten fingers.
[61:48] A: I need two elbows.
[61:50] B: I have two elbows.
[61:51] A: I have ten toes.
[61:52] B: I have ten toes.
[61:53] A: I'm not my toes.
[61:54] B: I'm not my toe.
[61:55] A: I'm not my nose.
[61:56] B: I'm not my nose.
[61:57] A: I'm not my fingers. I'm not my elbows. Right. I have a vagina. I'm not my vagina. Right. I have an ass. I'm not my ass. Right. They're mine. They're not me. Right. They're mine. They're not me. Right, Right. Because they're yours, not you. Because there's no single cell within your body today. That's the same as it was when that happened. Right? It's all been replaced.
[62:29] B: Yeah.
[62:30] A: Right. And I'll show you something about coming close. Right. Because what you and I are doing is bringing energy together. And when people bring energy together, energy has a tendency to expand. But not in a one plus one equals two way. The expansion is more like one plus one equals eleven. Got it. So you're collaborating with me. I'm bringing all of my energy. Your bringing all of your intention. We're collaborating towards the future you. Right. So if you were to just put your hand and hold it up like that. Right. We can just try to get it to rest. And what you're going to do is simply look at that spot right there. Now, as you look at that spot there, I'm going to take my hand and move it in towards your hand. Okay. And with your peripheral vision, you'll begin to see my hand moving in close. Right. As it gets closer, you'll notice that you can feel the energy from my hand.
[63:31] B: Yeah.
[63:31] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[63:34] B: Yeah.
[63:34] A: See, Susan, I'm coming closer to touching who you really are. Right? That's right.
[63:41] B: That's crazy.
[63:42] A: Than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with mutual respect.
[63:52] B: Wow.
[63:53] A: Right. Right. And you can simply now just notice. That's right. What's happening with that hand as it's become more wax like. That's right. You can get curious about the vibrational movements that you're not doing. That's right. Your unconscious is letting you know. That's right. That it's responding to you. Responding to what we're doing and taking inside what it's learning, making new connections, freeing things up for you to be becoming even more. Okay. Connecting. That's right. To your own unconscious has your back. That's right. Right. And just notice how that movement isn't movement that you're doing. Right. That you couldn't even on purpose make it move that way if you wanted to. Each time you're noticing those little vibratory movements, you can simply think the word yes. Because when you think. That's right. The word yes. When you notice those movements. Yes. Right. You think. Yes. Your mind responds to you responding to your mind responding to you. Right? Yes. Yes, that's right. And see, we're noticing what we're noticing within your right hand, but we haven't paid much attention to your left, which is also cataleptic. And so I don't know which hand it's going to be.
[65:59] B: What?
[66:00] A: Whether it's going to be the left one. That's the one. That's right. Or the right one. That's the one that's left. But your unconscious knows whether it's going to be lifting your left hand up or dropping your right hand down, but only at the same rate in speed at which your dropping down and inside towards an even more calm, peaceful. That's right. Easy flowing energy. More and more healing is happening as you're resting. That's right. That's right. More and more healing. Because new neural networks are getting lit up, changing the house of habits so that you become much more present and settled and clear and calm and light and free. All of this is happening now. And you can notice, Susan, that you don't have to be doing anything. That's right. That your mind and body. That's right. Is doing it. That's right.
[67:42] B: For.
[67:42] A: For you automatically. Isn't that cool? And so that part, your unconscious is going to travel back. Right. And we've got the moment. Right. So when that moment happened with that guy that happened like 40 years ago, what had happened? You were aware. So you're in Fort Lauderdale. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[68:15] B: Night.
[68:15] A: Night time. And you're like, where? So you're in the house. Right. And you're like in the kitchen room, dining room, Bedroom.
[68:23] B: Bedroom. Sleeping.
[68:24] A: So you're in the bedroom sleeping. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[68:27] B: I woke up with him.
[68:28] A: You woke up and he had been on top of you and he had put his penis in your vagina. Right. And then he did that for a period of time.
[68:35] B: Yeah.
[68:35] A: And then he stopped.
[68:36] B: Yes.
[68:37] A: And then he took his penis out of you. Right. And then he got off of you. Right. And then that moment ended. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[68:45] B: Yeah.
[68:45] A: Like go to the beach. Right. Or see the grandkids. Right, Right. Right.
[68:49] B: Oh, yeah.
[68:49] A: Right.
[68:50] B: Okay. Yeah.
[68:51] A: Right. We gotta go to the. Or have crab legs.
[68:53] B: Yes.
[68:53] A: Right. Now notice again, as you were telling me about it, less because you were intending to be here.
[68:59] B: Yeah.
[69:00] A: Even though there was a little. But less because you were here. Now we go backwards again. So we got having crab legs, we got seeing the grandkids, we got being at the beach. Right. Then he was off of you, and then he was on top of you. And then he took his penis out. And then he had his penis inside. And then he got on top of you. And then before that you had been sleeping. And then before that you'd gone to bed. And again, as I go backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[69:25] B: Not so bad.
[69:26] A: Isn't that crazy? It's crazy, right? You can remember him doing that. You can remember putting on your white shoes. Susan, stop putting on your white shoes. Say, I'm not putting on my white shoes. Say that I'm not putting on my white shoes. Stop me from putting on my sneakers. Hey, you're not putting on yours. So you're not putting on your sneakers.
[69:44] B: You're not putting your sneakers.
[69:45] A: Well, then stop him from doing that. See, he's not doing that. We'll stop him from putting his penis and say he's not doing that. So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists.
[69:54] B: Wow.
[69:55] A: Right, Right.
[70:01] B: This is so crazy.
[70:03] A: Yeah. What are you noticing?
[70:08] B: That I'm happy right now. I mean, you are. And a lot of things are making sense, like energy.
[70:14] A: Yeah. Right.
[70:18] B: And look at things backwards. Wow.
[70:23] A: Notice how it's changing how you're feeling.
[70:25] B: It is.
[70:26] A: Which is giving you different thoughts.
[70:29] B: Yeah.
[70:30] A: Right. Right. Because you can remember him doing that. You can remember putting your white shirt on.
[70:37] B: Right.
[70:38] A: Well, stop putting on your white shirt. See, I'm not putting on my white shirt. Will stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that. Right. So then where is it? Say no longer exists. Right.
[70:49] B: Wow.
[70:50] A: That you back then felt some of that happening had something to do with you.
[70:54] B: Yeah.
[70:55] A: Did it?
[70:57] B: Yeah.
[70:59] A: Did it have anything to do with you? No, it didn't. Did it?
[71:02] B: No.
[71:03] A: No. Right. But see, back then, it felt that way.
[71:06] B: Yes.
[71:06] A: Right. So I want to repeat these four words. Here we go. It's.
[71:11] B: It's not about.
[71:12] A: About me.
[71:13] B: Me.
[71:14] A: Right. It's not. It's not about me.
[71:16] B: About me.
[71:16] A: Right. It's not about me.
[71:17] B: It's not about me.
[71:18] A: Now close your eyes.
[71:19] B: Oh, my gosh.
[71:20] A: Picture the younger you just after that was over. Letting her know that it's over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about her grandkids and crab legs in the beach. Let her know that he never touched who you really are. Right. He messed with your stuff but didn't get you. Right. So that she gets it as the earlier you is getting it. What do you notice now happening to her face?
[71:53] B: She's smiling.
[71:56] A: She is.
[71:57] B: She is.
[71:57] A: That's right. She's no longer hurting. She's not stuck there. And she got the best parts without having to stay, which was her son.
[72:09] B: Right.
[72:10] A: Right. That was the best part.
[72:11] B: Yes.
[72:12] A: Of the whole interaction. Right. And she didn't have to stay. She got him away. Right. Didn't you? Yeah. That's right. You got him away.
[72:20] B: Yeah.
[72:21] A: Right. And you wouldn't want to feel good about that.
[72:23] B: I would.
[72:24] A: Yeah. I wonder what it would be. Be like to start feeling good about it now.
[72:28] B: I know. This is so crazy.
[72:30] A: See? What would it be like to start feeling good that you got your son away from him?
[72:33] B: I know it would feel really good to start.
[72:36] A: Yeah. So what are you waiting for? Oh, you are doing it now, aren't you?
[72:39] B: I am.
[72:39] A: Yeah. I am feeling pretty good that you got them away.
[72:42] B: I am.
[72:42] A: That's right. Regardless of what the others say.
[72:45] B: Right.
[72:45] A: Right. You did the right thing.
[72:46] B: I did.
[72:47] A: You did.
[72:48] B: I did.
[72:48] A: Even if you weren't always the best mom.
[72:50] B: Right.
[72:50] A: You did the right thing.
[72:51] B: I did.
[72:52] A: Right. Even if you had your own drug stuff.
[72:54] B: I did.
[72:54] A: Right. You did the right thing.
[72:56] B: I did.
[72:56] A: Right. And you wouldn't want to feel good about that.
[72:58] B: I do want to feel good about that.
[72:59] A: Yeah. So check it out. How about now?
[73:02] B: I feel good about that.
[73:03] A: You do? Don't you? I do. Isn't that a good news thing?
[73:06] B: This is crazy.
[73:07] A: Right?
[73:08] B: Wow.
[73:08] A: Right? Things are changing.
[73:10] B: Yes.
[73:11] A: Right.
[73:12] B: Like, I feel overwhelmed with, like, happiness. It's crazy. Everything's starting to make sense too, you know?
[73:18] A: A lot more relief.
[73:19] B: Yes.
[73:20] A: You're getting freed up and you're having more energy.
[73:24] B: Yeah.
[73:25] A: That had been being used to deal with difficult stuff. Getting freed up.
[73:28] B: Right. Wow. This is really crazy because I'll tell you this, my son, Sean, he's very. He's like one of those tree hubers who's vegan. He believes in the universe and energy.
[73:49] A: Yeah.
[73:50] B: He's always telling me that, you know, yoga above advance energy. And I just really don't. I listen to him, you know, I'm like, oh, that's great. It's great. But I've never allowed myself to feel what he's saying about all these things. It's just connected to me just now, like. And it's weird that he's the one that's telling me this to too, because what happened? But this is crazy.
[74:12] A: Right? And we're changing. Yeah. Your energetic state. Right. No, that's good.
[74:19] B: Yeah, it is. Yeah.
[74:22] A: Right. Because it's down regulating the nervous system.
[74:25] B: Jeez.
[74:26] A: Right. Notice how much more calm I can't. And clear your mind is right now.
[74:32] B: I can't even describe how different I feel.
[74:38] A: Right.
[74:39] B: You know?
[74:41] A: Right.
[74:43] B: Wow.
[74:44] A: Yeah. Because what's starting to happen is you're waking up that you were never your past. You were never those experiences. You're not your thoughts. You're not the things you say to yourself. You are the light at the center. What you become aware of as you see the sun setting. You're connecting to more of you right now, becoming more okay in you. Right. Things are lightening up.
[75:21] B: Yeah.
[75:22] A: Right. Noticing now that the right arm and hand is above the left. That's right. Again, not consciously choosing it.
[75:32] B: Right.
[75:32] A: Yeah. So much goes on that's not conscious. That we're bringing the unconscious programming into awareness now. Unplugging and rewiring it so it optimizes. Right. So that we change the wiring. Because part of what continued to draw those same kinds of things in were the open wounds. Right. We're healing the wounds so that you're becoming more okay and more at peace. Right?
[76:15] B: Yes.
[76:16] A: And as we're organizing towards your becoming more okay and more at peace and free again, your unconscious travels back down the timeline and will bring another moment.
[76:34] B: Wow.
[76:35] A: That one that just came to mind happened when you want to be here. Because I'm fun.
[76:45] B: It happened a long time ago.
[76:46] A: Yeah, you might have.
[76:47] B: 18 years ago.
[76:48] A: 18 years ago. Right. And what was it that happened? You were aware and what happened?
[76:52] B: Yeah. Was prostitute and had it go.
[76:58] A: So you're like in Orlando. You're like in Sarasota. You're like. So you're in Orlando. Right. And like, you're on like a main drag. You're like, you got an apartment or a main drag. You're on a main drag. So, like, you're outside walking. Right. Good.
[77:11] B: Prostituting.
[77:12] A: Right. And then what happen?
[77:13] B: Guy picks me up.
[77:14] A: So guy comes over, asks, right, Good. Right. Then what happen next? So you get in the car.
[77:19] B: Get in the car.
[77:20] A: Right.
[77:20] B: Go to like a warehouse.
[77:23] A: Right. Go to a warehouse. Right, Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[77:26] B: Start having sex with them.
[77:28] A: Right. So in the car or having sex in the car? Right. Good job. Right. He gave you the money.
[77:34] B: Yeah.
[77:34] A: Right. Good job with detail. Right. Then what happened next?
[77:38] B: He was done. And he.
[77:41] A: And be here. Hi.
[77:43] B: He was done.
[77:43] A: Hi. Notice how you're there.
[77:44] B: Yeah.
[77:44] A: Hi. Get here.
[77:45] B: Okay.
[77:46] A: Hi. Be here first.
[77:46] B: Yeah.
[77:47] A: Before you tell me more.
[77:48] B: Okay.
[77:48] A: Right here. Cuz I'm fun. That wasn't. No, no. That was not fun at all. That was really scary.
[77:53] B: Yeah.
[77:54] A: But right now is not scary at all. This is actually kind of fun. We're in the light. You're sitting on a comfortable couch. You're here with me. Right. This is actually way more fun. That was scary.
[78:05] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[78:06] A: Right. So then he had the gun. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[78:09] B: Gave me two Seconds to give his money back.
[78:11] A: Right. He said, give me my. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[78:13] B: Me on the car and close.
[78:14] A: Right.
[78:15] B: Then I.
[78:16] A: Right.
[78:17] B: I don't even want to talk about it, but let me feel. I'm too happy.
[78:20] A: So isn't that crazy?
[78:21] B: Yes.
[78:22] A: Right. Cuz you're here.
[78:23] B: Yeah.
[78:23] A: And you're just telling me about a historical story.
[78:26] B: Yes.
[78:27] A: Something that happened. Right. So then you're out of the car, you don't have any clothes on.
[78:29] B: Yes.
[78:30] A: Right. Good job. Nothing on? Nothing? Nothing. Just like. Okay, good. Right. Then what happened next?
[78:35] B: I had to walk.
[78:36] A: Well, then you're walking with the clothes on. Right.
[78:39] B: Good.
[78:39] A: And then what happened next?
[78:40] B: Found a house.
[78:41] A: Right. Good.
[78:42] B: Knocked on the door.
[78:43] A: Yeah, that's right. Then what happened?
[78:44] B: A woman came.
[78:45] A: Yes.
[78:46] B: Called the police.
[78:46] A: Right.
[78:47] B: Police came.
[78:47] A: Right.
[78:48] B: Brought me back to the crack house.
[78:50] A: Right. Could you have a detail?
[78:51] B: Yes.
[78:51] A: And then that was over. And you got clothes on. Yes. Right. And then later on you did something more fun.
[78:56] B: Yes.
[78:57] A: Like go to the beach.
[78:58] B: Yes.
[78:58] A: Right. Or hang out with the grandkids or have crab legs. Yes. Right.
[79:01] B: Gosh.
[79:02] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[79:04] B: Yeah.
[79:05] A: Right.
[79:06] B: And I think the thing is I have to be more aware of.
[79:09] A: I don't think you do.
[79:10] B: You don't know it's coming back to the presence.
[79:13] A: No. See, that's what we're doing.
[79:14] B: Yeah.
[79:15] A: So the other part that you didn't hear.
[79:18] B: Okay.
[79:18] A: Yeah. We're doing this so that those emotional wounds are healed, so they don't reactivate anymore.
[79:26] B: Okay.
[79:27] A: When you recognized when you were a little kid and you learned that Santa Claus wasn't real, you couldn't go back to believing it.
[79:35] B: Right.
[79:36] A: When your brain gets that it's data about an experience, it's over. It can't ever go back to thinking it's happening. Yeah. And when it can't go back, it also isn't confusing. Things that are similar as identical. Right. The reason that we're unplugging those moments, the reason that those moments are the ones that your unconscious is bringing to your awareness is that as we clear these, it's organizing towards the future. You, who's emotionally present, who's reading other people's garbage, is being about them, Not. Not me, who's got freedom in how she responds, maybe depending the situation and who it is, caring and loving and nurturing, supportive, apologetic, whatever. Other times, just other times it goes by. Right. That's where we're headed as a you who's a lot lighter and much more okay in you for any of that Shame, regret, Remorse.
[80:39] B: Guilt.
[80:39] A: Stuff about what I gone. Right. Because you're better off without it. And so is everyone that matters to you better off without you having it.
[80:51] B: Right. Wow.
[80:53] A: Got it.
[80:53] B: Yeah.
[80:54] A: Right.
[80:55] B: Well.
[80:56] A: Right, because we're changing the way things are interacting with the way your brain responds to your world. We can't change the world.
[81:08] B: Yeah.
[81:09] A: Can't get rid of the button pressers. Yes, we can adjust the buttons. Yeah, Got it.
[81:15] B: Yes.
[81:16] A: Yeah.
[81:17] B: That's really cool.
[81:19] A: So as we go backwards, we got crab legs, we've got going to the beach, we got hanging out with the grandkids. I know, right? And then you had clothes on and then you were picked up by the police, Then she called the police, then you got to her house, then you were walking naked, then you got out, then you gave him the money back, Then he pulled the gun, and then you had done the deed, and then he'd given you the money, and then you had driven to where you went, and then you got in the car and then you were, you know, out on the street. Right, Right.
[81:52] B: Easy as that.
[81:53] A: Right.
[81:53] B: Wow.
[81:54] A: And now it's data.
[81:55] B: Yeah.
[81:55] A: And again, that happening to you, is that about you? See, would it have mattered? Or there was you in that situation or some other girl with that guy at that time, isn't that what he would have done?
[82:06] B: Yeah.
[82:07] A: Right. It had nothing to do with you. Right. So again, close your eyes, picture that younger you and let her know that moment is over, finished, completed, defeated, that no longer exists. That. That happening to you had nothing to do with you and everything to do with that guy. It's not about me. Wouldn't it matter whether me or somebody else? That's what he would have done. So that she gets it, Let the you know that you're okay. Right. Let her know that she's got like a year clean. Let her know about all the positive changes she's making, the things that she's learning, commitment she's making. Right. Let her know about going to the beach and having crab legs and seeing the grandkids. Right. Let her know about how things are getting freed up.
[82:54] B: Yeah.
[82:55] A: Right. Yeah. And how you're becoming more at peace inside you. Right? Yeah. And what are you noticing?
[83:13] B: She's okay.
[83:14] A: Right. And as you just got it, that she's okay, what do you notice in you?
[83:19] B: I'm okay.
[83:20] A: You are, aren't you?
[83:21] B: I am. I feel.
[83:23] A: You do, don't you?
[83:25] B: I do.
[83:25] A: Yeah. Isn't that interesting?
[83:28] B: Yes. Wow.
[83:35] A: Right?
[83:36] B: That's really good stuff.
[83:38] A: It is really good stuff.
[83:40] B: It's crazy good stuff. It's like, where were you a long time ago? Jeez.
[83:48] A: Yeah.
[83:50] B: It's just like disassociated with. And it's not about me.
[83:55] A: Right. Which you already knew, but you didn't feel.
[84:01] B: Okay.
[84:01] A: Got it.
[84:02] B: Yeah.
[84:03] A: So a lot of it isn't that you didn't know it already. You just couldn't feel it. Okay. If you can't feel it, then it doesn't matter what you know.
[84:11] B: Yeah.
[84:13] A: Until we unplug stuff, then it gets in. It was a log jam, so to speak.
[84:20] B: Yeah.
[84:20] A: It couldn't get into the feeling part of the brain because the feeling part thought the event was still happening. When the feeling part got that, the event is ended and I survived it. It went, oh, never mind. And the feelings went away.
[84:34] B: Yeah, yeah.
[84:37] A: Right.
[84:40] B: Yeah.
[84:40] A: It's updating to the present moment. You had a lot of old habits running, right?
[84:51] B: Yeah.
[84:52] A: Not because your brain was out to get you, but because it's a error in the machinery that it didn't update. Right now they're updating and we're changing the relationship to what happened from living is happening to data about something that happened. I still don't like that it happened. That was not a fun, enjoyable experience to one, do the thing with the guy for money and then two, get like a gun pulled on me that I had to get the money back and be outside naked, like.
[85:34] B: Yeah.
[85:37] A: I got both ways on that one. Literally. Right. That might not have been a guy that I would have chosen to do anything with if it wasn't for that, you know?
[85:53] B: Exactly.
[85:57] A: Yeah. Right. So we still don't like that it happened, but notice how it's not making you feel bad anymore, nor is it making you feel bad about you.
[86:05] B: Yeah.
[86:06] A: Right, Right.
[86:09] B: Yeah.
[86:09] A: Isn't that cool?
[86:10] B: It's very cool.
[86:12] A: That's right. Just like there's lots of things that you don't pay attention to. Like, you know, your left leg being over your right now. And again, you didn't consciously decide decide to do it. No. Your body did. Right. Your unconscious does lots of stuff without you having to do it. That's what's happening here. You're not having to do it. Right. And see, notice how's your body feeling?
[86:40] B: So relaxed.
[86:41] A: It is so relaxed. And how weird is it that you're able to talk about these really young, yucky things and your body feel like really so relaxed.
[86:51] B: I know. Like so relaxed.
[86:54] A: Right.
[86:54] B: And to a stranger. I don't even know you. I'm telling you, this is just crazy.
[87:00] A: Yeah. Right. Notice what's changing. That's why we make recordings. Because this is not usual. This doesn't tend to happen in therapy.
[87:13] B: No.
[87:15] A: Right. Right. So again, that other part of your brain, your unconscious, is going to travel back again down the timeline of moments and things that happened. And we'll bring another moment. Yeah, that one happened. You're how old?
[87:40] B: 32.
[87:41] A: Huh.
[87:41] B: 32.
[87:42] A: Yeah. And what was it that happened?
[87:45] B: I was arrested for prostitution.
[87:50] A: So you're on the street.
[87:52] B: Nose and Hotel.
[87:54] A: You're in a hotel. Right. Good. Right.
[87:58] B: Met a man in the lounge.
[88:00] A: Right.
[88:01] B: Talked to him for a couple hours. Just had a real stubborn. A realtor. Had a real estate. Had a real estate deal. I don't know why she keeps calling me. Had a real estate deal. Why won't it go off?
[88:11] A: Hey, take your time. There's no rush. Okay.
[88:15] B: Sorry. I don't know why my phone won't show up. Okay.
[88:35] A: I'm sorry. Hey, you're fine. We're trying to figure it out, Okay.
[88:41] B: I just did a real estate deal.
[88:44] A: You had just done a real estate deal.
[88:46] B: And it fell through.
[88:47] A: And it fell through. So you're bombed.
[88:49] B: Yeah. I went to Backstage Lounge. Real close to where it was right. To have a drink. It was 7:00. A man came in.
[88:55] A: Yeah.
[88:56] B: Okay. Sat at my table, talked for almost two hours.
[88:58] A: Right.
[88:59] B: Asked me up to his room.
[89:00] A: Yeah. Good job. Good detail.
[89:03] B: So I went up to his room and sat on the bed. He sat on the bed, pulled out his wallet, gave me eight 100 bills. And I looked up, took him, put in my purse. I knew what was happening.
[89:14] A: Right.
[89:15] B: Then all of a sudden, boom. Undercover. Busted in the door.
[89:19] A: Right. The job of detail. Right?
[89:21] B: Yeah. Woods and everything.
[89:22] A: And that was scary.
[89:23] B: Yeah.
[89:24] A: Right. Then what happened?
[89:25] B: Told me that I'm being arrested for prostitution. There's a prostitution ring in that hotel from Las Vegas. And I'm part of it. But the thing is that my kids. So I work for century 21.
[89:42] A: Right.
[89:42] B: My son Sean was dating the publisher of our neighborhood paper.
[89:48] A: Right. Good job, good detail.
[89:49] B: And so I got arrested, went to jail. First time ever.
[89:54] A: Yeah.
[89:54] B: And my. Call my mother.
[89:56] A: Be here. Hi.
[89:57] B: Called my mother and she said, sorry. That's really cool.
[90:01] A: I know you want to be here.
[90:02] B: I know.
[90:02] A: Not there.
[90:03] B: So called my mom, told her I was arrested.
[90:06] A: Yeah.
[90:07] B: And she said, I know. It's all over the Osawa Gazette.
[90:10] A: Good job.
[90:10] B: Everybody knows.
[90:11] A: Yes. Right. And then what happened next?
[90:13] B: Hung up on me.
[90:14] A: Right. Good. Then what happened?
[90:15] B: I had a nervous breakdown.
[90:16] A: Well, then you got really upset.
[90:18] B: Yeah.
[90:18] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[90:20] B: I just lost. I really did.
[90:21] A: Well, then what happened next?
[90:22] B: I was in jail.
[90:23] A: Right. Well then, then what happened next is you like stop crying.
[90:27] B: Okay.
[90:28] A: Eventually.
[90:28] B: Right.
[90:29] A: And then eventually got out of jail.
[90:31] B: Right?
[90:31] A: Right. And then that moment ended. Right. And then later on you did something fun, right? Like go to the beach.
[90:36] B: Yes. Right.
[90:37] A: Or hang out with the grandkids. Right? That's right.
[90:40] B: Gosh.
[90:42] A: Right. So we got the crab legs, we got hanging out at the beach. We got, you know, being with the grandkids. Right. We got getting out of jail, we got being in jail, we got being really upset, we got her hanging up, we got. Yeah, everybody knows it's in the paper. We got you telling her, you got you calling her, you got you going to jail. You got all the police coming in. Right. And then you taking the money and then him putting out the money and then you going upstairs and sitting on the bed with him and then him asking you up.
[91:04] B: Right?
[91:04] A: Right. You didn't ask him up? No, no. He asked you up. Right? Right. You didn't say give me money. No, no. But he decided to, right? Yeah.
[91:14] B: Yeah.
[91:15] A: Right.
[91:15] B: It's not my fault.
[91:17] A: Right.
[91:18] B: It's not my fault.
[91:19] A: Right. You didn't say give me money. No, no. You might have had sex with him without money.
[91:25] B: Right?
[91:25] A: Right. Because I wouldn't have sat talking to a guy for two and a half hours if I didn't find them, you know, nice. And I was drowning my sorrows. Anyway, so I might have had sex with them without the money.
[91:37] B: Right? Right, Exactly.
[91:38] A: But if it was throwing out the money, I'm not going to not take it. Right. Because I'm not going to see this guy anyway.
[91:43] B: Right?
[91:43] A: Right.
[91:44] B: Gee.
[91:46] A: Right. Yeah. And as you're getting it, what are you noticing?
[91:53] B: It's not my fault.
[91:54] A: That's right.
[91:55] B: The stuff isn't my fault.
[91:57] A: Right. So close your eyes and let the younger, you know, that's over, finished. That no longer exists.
[92:04] B: Yeah.
[92:05] A: It's not my fault. It wasn't about me. I just happened to be in that situation.
[92:09] B: Right?
[92:09] A: Right. I didn't go up to his room to have sex with him.
[92:13] B: Right.
[92:13] A: For money. I might have gone up to his room to have sex with him, but not for money. But then he did that. Right. I had a shitty day. I'm not gonna not take that, given what I done right before. Right. And this one would have been easier cuz it was somebody that I actually would want to do it with.
[92:30] B: Right.
[92:31] A: You can open your eyes, right?
[92:33] B: Yeah.
[92:34] A: Like, that's the whole difference. Right. In the world that you lived in, unfortunately, there were people that you didn't want to have to do it with that you had to do it with.
[92:41] B: Right.
[92:42] A: But every once in a while, there might have been somebody that you would have done it with. And it wasn't about just that. Right. And you had had a nice conversation with the guy.
[92:49] B: Yeah.
[92:50] A: Right.
[92:51] B: Yeah.
[92:53] A: Right.
[92:55] B: It's really cool.
[92:57] A: I'm so glad you think so.
[92:59] B: It's so cool. Like, I just feel like. Like free. Are you, like, happy? Go lucky free.
[93:05] A: Right.
[93:05] B: How else to explain it? That's how my insides are feeling right now.
[93:08] A: I bet. Yeah.
[93:11] B: It's like. It's.
[93:12] A: Right. You're becoming free.
[93:14] B: Yeah. It's like, to. I feel like it's as easy as that. Susan, when you go there, come right back out. That's not my fault.
[93:23] A: You keep thinking I'm gonna have to do something to get myself out of it.
[93:29] B: Yeah.
[93:30] A: Why am I here? Are you doing anything to get yourself out of it? Are you, Susan, doing anything? Are we changing the way that Susan's brain is interacting with Susan's work?
[93:42] B: Yes.
[93:42] A: So her brain works naturally in a preconscious way. More in the way that you want it to. So it's not anything that you need to do.
[93:52] B: Okay. That's what see?
[93:54] A: A a, N, A. You need to be vigilant against using. Right. You need to stay clear and focused on. This is what I'm doing, not that.
[94:05] B: Right.
[94:06] A: Right. This isn't the same thing. It'll make doing that much easier. So I won't be so triggered.
[94:15] B: Yeah. Because it's like, I feel like I don't ever have to go back there because that wasn't me.
[94:22] A: Right? It wasn't you.
[94:24] B: No. It wasn't my fault. So why did I feel bad when it wasn't even my fault?
[94:28] A: Right.
[94:28] B: And it's. Wow.
[94:30] A: Right. Even if we go back to you learning at 18 that your bio dad was gone before you were 2.
[94:41] B: Right.
[94:42] A: That also wasn't about you.
[94:46] B: Yeah.
[94:47] A: Right.
[94:48] B: Yeah.
[94:48] A: Him leaving had nothing to do with your lovability. Your brother's lovability had everything to do with him not being. What? Well.
[95:00] B: Right.
[95:01] A: You wouldn't have known at that age that he wasn't well. Right. Right. And therefore that younger Ewan growing up felt like she was different then because she knew that the new guy, which she's calling dad, which she's having a sibling, that he's her dad. She's knowing he's not really dad. He's playing the role of dad and he's a great dad, but he's not really my dad.
[95:33] B: Right.
[95:34] A: Follow me with that.
[95:35] B: Yes.
[95:37] A: Right. In the same way, the reason that your older son isn't troubled is because he knows that mom did the right thing. Because he knows that it happened.
[95:51] B: Jesus.
[95:52] A: Got it.
[95:53] B: Yes.
[95:54] A: The other ones just don't. And that's why that you felt like there. It must be me.
[96:01] B: Yeah.
[96:02] A: But again, it had nothing to do with you because it wouldn't have mattered whether it was you or somebody else in that situation. That's what he would have done.
[96:11] B: Right, Right.
[96:12] A: Right. And we all get screwed up because we live. Oh, that's my real dad. Dad. Yeah, but we really mean my bio dad.
[96:22] B: Right, right.
[96:23] A: Because the real dad is the one that actually played the role.
[96:26] B: Yes. Yes.
[96:29] A: Got it.
[96:30] B: Yes.
[96:31] A: Yeah.
[96:32] B: And I believe that with everything I have. That's why I took care of it.
[96:36] A: And now that's also getting in.
[96:37] B: Yeah.
[96:38] A: But we want to get it in at the earlier age. So close your eyes and think back to a younger you who's two and knows that the person who was dad isn't there anymore and is feeling like somehow that's about her. Because bad only happens when I'm bad. And let her know that him leaving had nothing to do with you or even his love for you or your lack of lovability. It had nothing to do with you at all. It had everything to do with what was off with him. It's not about me. Nothing to do with me. It was about him. So that she gets it. Right. Letting her know even at that early age that she's got a great guy that plays the role of real dad and that she's not any different and that he adopted her to make her her is. Right. So there's no difference between whether it was one that is biological or not. Right. So that she gets it.
[97:52] B: Yeah.
[97:53] A: And let the younger. You know how much love grew with that man. That's a real dad. Yeah. Because he played the role of it.
[98:02] B: Yeah.
[98:03] A: So much so that she was there towards the end of his life. Right. Doing what she could then. Right. And again, as all of this gets in, what do you notice now?
[98:20] B: It's gone. Like I'm free.
[98:22] A: Yeah, I'm free.
[98:24] B: She understands.
[98:25] A: She knows that's right.
[98:28] B: And she's okay.
[98:30] A: That's right.
[98:31] B: I'm okay.
[98:32] A: You are okay. You didn't need dad to be there in order for you to turn out and do the right thing for your sons.
[98:42] B: Yeah.
[98:44] A: Right. When we're little, we think we need them and need them in order for us to be okay. Because when we're little, we're more dependent. Like a baby can't feed itself and change itself.
[98:55] B: Yeah.
[98:58] A: So we get set up because we have a longest incubation period.
[99:02] B: Yeah.
[99:03] A: Right. The gazelle in, like, you know, 40 hours can start running. Yeah. We can't. Got it.
[99:15] B: Yeah, got it.
[99:18] A: Right. So because from the factory, we take the longest in incubation, it makes us feel that we need them in order for us to be okay.
[99:29] B: Yeah, Right.
[99:33] A: Got it. And notice how that's changing.
[99:37] B: Yes, I do notice changing. It's like.
[99:46] A: Yeah.
[99:50] B: It's incredible. Really?
[99:52] A: Yeah. Notice how it's not hurting like it did. Right. Even think about some of the stuff that happened when you were out on the street. Prostitution, trafficking. What do you notice?
[100:11] B: It's okay. It's not me.
[100:14] A: Right.
[100:15] B: It's. I'm not bad. I. It wasn't my fault.
[100:19] A: Right. So think about, you know, you might be going for a job interview.
[100:22] B: Yeah.
[100:23] A: To work somewhere. And you know that somewhere along the way there's that record that, you know, you did some prostitution and some time for. Right. With that weird arrest that I wasn't going up there to have sex with him for money.
[100:36] B: Right.
[100:37] A: Right. He invited me up to his room. I kind of liked him. I fancied him a little bit.
[100:42] B: Right.
[100:43] A: I'm not going to take. Not take the money if he throws it out there.
[100:48] B: Yeah.
[100:49] A: Right. Right. And I was set up.
[100:53] B: Yes.
[100:54] A: Right. I was set up because at that part in that time in my life, that was still an open wound for me.
[101:01] B: Yes.
[101:03] A: Because I hadn't been healing from what I went through and what I did. Right. Because if I hadn't had that and that wound was healed when he threw out the money, I might have gotten fucking offended and slapped him across the face. Who the fuck do you think I am?
[101:23] B: Right. Right.
[101:26] A: I thought you were smitten to me and I was smitten to you. You think, like, I'm a. Got it. See if that wound's healed. The reaction you have to that moment isn't the same.
[101:41] B: Oh. It's almost like.
[101:44] A: It's, like, offensive.
[101:45] B: Yeah, it is. Like. Okay.
[101:47] A: I mean, at least you're gonna give me two grand.
[101:52] B: I know.
[101:53] A: I mean, I know.
[102:00] B: For real.
[102:00] A: Salty.
[102:01] B: I know.
[102:03] A: No, but as you check in with it. Right. So notice when that's not an open wound.
[102:09] B: Yeah.
[102:10] A: How that gets healed.
[102:13] B: Yeah.
[102:14] A: Right.
[102:17] B: Yeah. It's really, like, a relief. But, like, I totally get what you're saying about it's not my fault good things happen. That wasn't my fault. We reversed it. It's done. It's gone. Like, I don't ever have to think like I was before. Right. I know now that it's not my fault.
[102:48] A: Right.
[102:49] B: And good things have happened and will continue to happen. And I know that. You know.
[102:54] A: Right.
[102:55] B: It's really crazy.
[102:58] A: Right.
[102:59] B: And the way you explain about your energy and, like, the factory in our brain really makes a lot of sense to me.
[103:09] A: I'm so glad.
[103:10] B: It really does.
[103:12] A: Yeah. Yeah. So notice how things are changing.
[103:17] B: Yes.
[103:18] A: Yeah. Notice how you're feeling different.
[103:23] B: I know.
[103:24] A: It's.
[103:27] B: Crazy. I can't even. I'm just really in awe of what is happening to me right now. I just really am. I can't even explain it to you.
[103:37] A: Yeah.
[103:38] B: Like, my insides feel. Feel like free. Not tense. Not. I just feel.
[103:43] A: Right.
[103:45] B: Like it's crazy.
[103:48] A: Yeah. That's your becoming more okay in you. Yeah.
[103:52] B: It's like a relief. Like, wow.
[103:55] A: Right?
[103:57] B: Yeah.
[103:58] A: Right. Right. Because you can think about the time with the guy with the gun.
[104:03] B: Yeah.
[104:04] A: And it's not doing anything.
[104:06] B: It's not at all.
[104:07] A: Right.
[104:09] B: Yeah.
[104:10] A: Isn't that cool? You can think about the guy, you know, with the rape thing.
[104:14] B: Yeah.
[104:15] A: What do you notice?
[104:18] B: Right.
[104:18] A: Right.
[104:22] B: Yeah.
[104:23] A: Right. They're feeling different.
[104:26] B: They are.
[104:27] A: Right. I still know that it happened. It's not making me feel bad anymore.
[104:33] B: Right.
[104:35] A: It's even in a different location when I go to remember it than it used to be. Isn't that interesting? Yes. When you go looking for it, it's not in the same place. It's now coded in the data about something that happened. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So all sorts of things are changing. Right. In ways that you haven't fully even realized yet. Because remember, Susan, no matter what you think is happening, there's more going on than that. Right. Just like seedlings. If we take seedlings and we have nice, fertile soil and we plant the seedlings in the soil, you and I both know that before we ever see anything above the surface of the ground, that more has begun to happen with the seedlings under the surface. Right. More is going on within you under the surface. Right. More connections are being made.
[106:07] B: Yeah.
[106:08] A: More integration is happening. New neural networks are. Are being formed and created. Wiring is adjusting. All of that is happening below the level of conscious awareness. And what you're recognizing consciously is I'm not feeling the same way I used to about that stuff. And it's not making me feel bad. About me, which some of that I knew, but I never really felt right. And so that's the part that you're consciously aware of. But see, with those things changing for you, just imagine what else is happening and how it changes the trajectory of the course. Because even if we had two ships out to sea on parallel courses and one got adjusted by a decent degree as it moves into the water, it doesn't seem like it's much, but we know the further and further and further it goes out in the ocean, how much more vastly different the course becomes. Same thing already happening inside of you. Yeah. Right. So you kind of check. We're going to have your unconscious check. Go ahead and close your eyes. And your unconscious is simply going to scan back through experiences in your own history, the ones that we've already unplugged and others, and begin to spread the good news. It's data. It no longer exists. It's not about me. It's data. It no longer exists. It's not about me. It's data. They never attached me. It's not about me. So that the unconscious spreads that good news all the way through. And the unconscious, unconscious will let you know when that news has been fully integrated by bringing sensations and maybe some small little twitches, jumps to your right handed fingers as that hand, ever so slowly in a voluntary movement, begins to lift up. Right. Lifting up. That's right. Noticing what you're noticing. That's right. So that as that hand. Right. Moves in ways that are different. That's right. Then how you would move that hand, you sink inside deeper, melting down and down and down into the light. Into the light at your center. That light, that is you are responding. That's right. To your unconscious responding to you. Or responding to your unconscious responding to you sinking more into light that is you at your center. That's right. And then whenever you're ready and you can take your time because there's no rush and eyes are open. Here we go. What are you noticing now, Susan?
[110:46] B: I really believe that things are connecting my subconscious. It's crazy. Like I can't even tell you how many people, like bad stuff is going away. Good stuff is coming in.
[111:14] A: Yeah.
[111:14] B: But it doesn't even matter anymore because being replaced by good energy.
[111:19] A: Yeah. Which by the way, the energy that's good is always there. It's just that the other shit was in the way of you feeling it.
[111:28] B: And the energies.
[111:30] A: See, it's that those experiences left imprints and we're blocking access to you, connecting to you as we Clear and unplug and heal those wounds. You open up access to connecting to more of who you are. Are waking up that I'm not my thoughts or my experiences or my body. I am the awareness. Just like if you walked into a room and there's a table and a chair and a sofa and I said, susan, which one of those objects are you? He'd say, none of them are me. Right. Because, you know, they're not you. But you're also gaining that I'm not any of the things that I thought I was. They're not me. I'm much more than that. I am the light. I am awareness. I'm waking up. Right. And there's lots of people that I'll interact with that aren't awake. Right, Right. So think about, you know, I mean, there might be an upcoming thing with family. You know that aunt.
[112:48] B: Yes.
[112:48] A: You know, and your son's saying, you might want to, like, have a conversation with her. Talk to her. Right. She might want to invite you. Right, right. And think about that now and think about, like, you know, talking to her and think about some of the things that she'll normally, you know, the tonation that.
[113:02] B: Yeah.
[113:03] A: You know, looking down on, like, know how she is. Right, right. And as you're thinking about it now, what are you noticing in you?
[113:12] B: That I'm okay. I'm happy. And doesn't bother me. Yeah, it doesn't bother me.
[113:19] A: It's not bothering you? No. Right. Well, I mean, you know, you did that stuff.
[113:23] B: Right.
[113:23] A: But no, what if she says, you know, susan, you did that stuff? I mean, you were a prostitute.
[113:31] B: She.
[113:31] A: I mean, that stuff that. With the. With the, you know, your son's dad never happened.
[113:35] B: Oh, yeah. I would say that's. I don't know what you're talking about. That wasn't me. That's. That's not me. This is me.
[113:42] A: Yeah.
[113:42] B: You know.
[113:46] A: The thing that you're checking is when she's saying it, is it making you mad?
[113:50] B: No, that's the thing is I'm smiling. It's like.
[113:52] A: Right.
[113:53] B: I can smile at her if she says it to me. Like.
[113:56] A: Right.
[113:57] B: Wow.
[113:58] A: Right. It's not pushing that button that would make you feel shitty.
[114:03] B: Wow. Yeah.
[114:04] A: Right?
[114:09] B: Yeah.
[114:10] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[114:13] B: It's very cool. It's like the missing piece that I've missed all along to now, you see?
[114:21] A: Isn't that weird? The missing piece has always been inside of you. Yeah. You actually are the missing piece because you haven't been connecting to you or the piece at the center. That's you.
[114:40] B: Wow.
[114:42] A: Right.
[114:50] B: Jeez.
[114:52] A: Yeah. The missing piece is you. And it's always been there.
[114:56] B: Yeah.
[114:57] A: Just kept looking for it over there.
[114:59] B: Yeah.
[115:00] A: When it's always been in here.
[115:01] B: Right.
[115:02] A: Right. The missing piece.
[115:03] B: Yeah.
[115:04] A: Isn't missing anymore, is it? No. No. Because you feel it.
[115:08] B: Yes.
[115:11] A: This is. Yeah. You feel. Feel peace. I do. Fully integrating all through you.
[115:17] B: I do.
[115:19] A: Yeah. Peaceful.
[115:26] B: You know what to say. Yeah.
[115:30] A: So let's take a brief break.
[115:31] B: Okay.
[115:32] A: We can use the restroom. Right. And then we'll get back.
[115:34] B: Okay.
[115:37] A: That'll break.
[115:39] B: 30, 12, 31. 30 is two hours.
[115:42] A: Well, almost two hours. We got five more minutes.
[115:45] B: Nobody. I was in here at 11:30. 12:30, 1, 30. Two hours.
[115:50] A: Right. You came to the office at 11:30. We didn't get in here at 11.
[115:53] B: Oh, okay. It's just that I don't have a ride and she's my only ride. I lived there, so. All right.
[115:58] A: I understand all of that. I'm sorry.
[115:59] B: I don't need to be.
[116:00] A: And you're fine.
[116:01] B: Okay.
[116:02] A: And yes, you can come back.
[116:04] B: Okay.
[116:04] A: But we just want to finish what we were just doing.
[116:08] B: Okay.
[116:09] A: So that we get a complete peace.
[116:11] B: Okay.
[116:12] A: That's why we were having you go out and come back in and just check.
[116:16] B: Okay.
[116:17] A: Because you already set it out in the hallway. Notice how you're feeling.
[116:21] B: I know. I just feel incredible. I don't know how to. I mean, I feel like I am so good right now.
[116:28] A: Right.
[116:29] B: Yeah.
[116:30] A: So what you're going to notice is you're going to notice that those things aren't going to trouble you like they did.
[116:36] B: Yeah.
[116:38] A: There are going to be three other things that I want you to pay attention to. One, you're going to notice that in the moment, things that used to bother you aren't going to be bothering you. Okay. Or if they do bother you, it's going to be way, way, way less. Like, it might come up and then it goes away.
[116:53] B: Okay.
[116:54] A: So you'll notice that in situation situations where normally I'd be triggering, you're not going to feel triggered. Or if you do, it might be a little. And then it goes right away.
[117:02] B: Right.
[117:03] A: You'll also notice after the fact, you'll have gone through a situation and you might be reflecting or talking with somebody, and you might think back and go, hey, that normally would have done all this, and it didn't do this to me.
[117:14] B: Okay.
[117:14] A: So you're going to notice that second part. Right. You're going to notice overall, that the intensity in which you used to Stress is going to be way less. The frequency in which it used to spike, way less. And the duration in which it used to last, way less. Got it? Yes. Your job in between now and when we get back together, is to pay attention to what you can notice that's new and different in how you're feeling, in how you're reacting, in the stuff that comes to mind.
[117:46] B: Okay.
[117:47] A: Got it. You're gonna paint attention to that, and then you have a powerful tool. So before you go to bed, when you wake up in the morning, maybe after lunch, slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue, breathe a little bit slower and deeper in, a little bit longer out. Open awareness. Doing those things are the practice. So three times a day, maybe takes you a couple minutes each time.
[118:15] B: Okay.
[118:16] A: We'll continue to reinforce all of the changes that we've done.
[118:20] B: All right.
[118:21] A: And you did great today.
[118:22] B: Thank you so much.
[118:23] A: You're welcome. My pleasure.
[118:26] B: Thank you so much.
[118:27] A: Yeah.
[118:27] B: Like, sincerely, thank you.
[118:29] A: Yeah, I get it. Isn't it cool?
[118:30] B: It's very.
[118:31] A: Notice how different things are.
[118:33] B: Yeah.
[118:34] A: Right.
[118:34] B: I, like. I'm just like, hi. Okay.
[118:36] A: Like, right. Good job.
[118:39] B: Thank you so much.
[118:40] A: You did great.
[118:40] B: So she will schedule.
[118:42] A: Yeah, I'm sure she will. We'll go out there, see, it wasn't gonna.
