[00:01] A: All right, so today is the 25th of November, and we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And, Jacqueline, given what we do is useful and valuable, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:19] B: Yes.
[00:20] A: Cool. All right, so give me an update. I'm really curious how our. Our session left you. What have you noticed for yourself? How have things been.
[00:30] B: A lot lighter?
[00:32] A: A lot lighter.
[00:33] B: I would say I'm not attaching myself to any emotions or any circumstances or things that have happened.
[00:43] A: Well, that's good.
[00:44] B: Yeah.
[00:45] A: So those things aren't getting attached to you?
[00:47] B: No.
[00:47] C: Yeah.
[00:48] B: And I'm not allowing myself to go down any rabbit holes, though the things have been brought up.
[00:53] A: Yeah.
[00:53] B: You know, know, of course. Like a memory or something.
[00:56] C: Right.
[00:56] B: But it's kind of like it doesn't.
[00:58] A: Take you to the same place it used to.
[01:00] B: No, I'm kind. Yeah.
[01:02] C: Yeah.
[01:03] B: And now I'm kind of like, okay, it happened.
[01:05] A: Yeah, right.
[01:06] B: You know, like, yeah, it happened. But, you know, I still don't like.
[01:09] A: That it did, but it's done.
[01:11] B: That's it.
[01:12] C: Yeah.
[01:12] B: Yeah. And what. It's almost like, what have I accomplished and who have I become since that happening? Because as along. And all these things have happened and things that we have to go through, we accumulate and can round out and evolve from them. So I'm taking what I got from it because I think that's more valuable and where I've become and who I am now from those situations. And also learning, you know, and knowing things about people is really insightful, because then you can cut those people off or it makes you more aware of what to look for.
[01:54] C: Sure.
[01:55] B: And others.
[01:56] C: Right.
[01:57] B: And also a little bit of yourself. You know, I mean, I was pretty naive. You know, I was very. What's that word?
[02:04] C: Gullible?
[02:05] B: Yeah. Yeah. Extremely. I was. And, you know, some of the things that you had said. Said to me, like, specifically the thing about Frederick.
[02:16] A: Yeah.
[02:17] B: Like. And I had a hard time accepting, you know, talking to my friend. I was like, do you really think he knew what he was doing the whole time? Like, I wondered if he did know that he was grooming me, as you would say. You said something like that. Right. And it kind of clicked. And I was like, well, think about it, Jack. I mean, he's much older than you.
[02:45] C: Right.
[02:45] B: I mean, he's had a lot of experience, like, worldly. Like, he has more experience and knows and have done things and.
[02:54] C: Right.
[02:54] B: In A combination of like hundreds and.
[02:58] A: Has lots of money. Powerful.
[03:00] B: Yeah.
[03:02] A: So there's already a little charisma in that. If somebody is able to make that much money and be that successful and be that worldly, there's charisma in that.
[03:20] B: But of what sense are you speaking of?
[03:24] A: Well, just in that there's a drawing to individuals.
[03:30] B: Oh. Oh, my gosh. So he's most likely have been put in this position before. Well, yeah. And I mean, he was married to, you know, a famous actress and his wife before me was, I think he was like 50 and she was like 24, five maybe, or something like that.
[03:58] C: Right.
[03:58] B: So he has that experience.
[03:59] A: That's his template.
[04:00] B: Yeah. So you're right. And you know, there's a lot of young women and girls that throw themselves at money.
[04:07] A: Well, sure, there's a. There's a. There's a guy who's a comedian and not really comedian, but he says stupid funny jokes. And one of the jokes he says is, you know, you go out to a bar and you see a girl and you. You ask her about a relationship with her dad, and if it's good, you say, see you later. Because you only want the ones that have issues with their dads, because they're gonna be. Yeah, so. So. So you've noticed that the things that used to aren't doing it to the extent that they used to, and you're finding yourself not getting caught in it.
[04:49] B: Yeah.
[04:49] A: For a longer period of time. That's like shrunken and how long that. And then what's been coming to mind is accessing. How did that make me who I am now in a useful and beneficial way.
[05:05] B: Yeah.
[05:05] A: So I'm gaining the value out of having gone through those awful experiences.
[05:13] C: Right, right.
[05:16] B: And that's how I'm doing it. Yeah. It takes a lot of work, but.
[05:19] A: You know, I don't know whether it does. Takes so much work. Well, I mean, I mean, I think it used to probably try to take a lot of work, but I don't think it's so much work right now.
[05:30] B: No. And something else I'm learning is just allowing it to come to you. Because if I keep. I've learned and I've read that if you suppress or cancel out the feeling as soon as it comes to you, you're actually. You're not releasing that energy. So then the energy just is coming back. It's sitting inside of you, and then it just comes back up and back up, versus if you just allow it to like, go out like a wave and just be dismissed and just like let it completely go.
[06:05] A: Yeah. Pay attention to how the sensations or changing.
[06:15] C: Right.
[06:15] A: I'm not like letting it go when it comes up. Instead of me distracting or xing, I'm noticing the waveicle of how the sensation changes over time. And then it's just a wave that subsides. Yeah, right. And a life of a state biochemically on its own. Maximum is 30 seconds.
[06:46] B: That's it.
[06:47] A: That's it.
[06:48] B: My gosh, Sometimes this felt a lot longer.
[06:50] A: Well, that's because if I get triggered and before it's able to come back down, it gets triggered again. And then before it's coming back down, it gets triggered again. So it's like somebody has this disturbing thought and they're like, oh no. And now the oh no makes their heart beat a little bit faster. And now they're noticing that their heart's beating faster and they have another oh no. Each one is layering on top of it. Right. Now that my heart is beating faster, my palms are becoming so oh no. What does that mean? Every time I'm doing the oh no, I'm adding more of it being bad. I'm not just noticing the sensations and how they're changing.
[07:30] C: Right.
[07:30] A: We get the bad image and we go unconscious. And then it runs the program. What you've been noticing, if I'm understanding you, is that that program's not running.
[07:42] C: To the extent that it used to. Right.
[07:45] A: It's not as often, it's not as loud, it's not as heavy. Right. And as a result of it, it gets dismissed much quicker.
[07:55] B: Yeah.
[07:55] C: Right.
[07:56] A: And you're getting the value which you can actually have installed in you when that stuff's no longer active.
[08:06] C: Right.
[08:07] A: That's when I become more wise. If I'm still emotionally reacted to this stuff, I'm not wise. I'm narrowed. Wisdom comes from experiencing more space in between and all around you.
[08:25] C: Right.
[08:25] A: Because when we're in that awareness that's expanded more peripheral vision. It settles the body.
[08:32] B: Yeah, right.
[08:34] A: It's what I want to be in When I'm standing in front of groups and I'm presenting. I don't want to be like this because I'm going to be nervous. I want to be expanded so that I'm seeing them, but at the same time I'm seeing the lamps, seeing the side windows and the side doors.
[08:54] C: Right? That's right.
[08:56] A: Because when you can start to notice more space, your body begins to settle. As your body begins to settle, your mind also quiets. How have Things been with you in terms of stuff with mom, I'm really curious how this has been.
[09:17] B: It's been calmer, surprisingly. Thankfully.
[09:22] C: Yeah.
[09:22] B: Though being that it's calm, I'm wondering, okay, when's the next time? When's the next time I'm gonna get hit up for money or, you know, a big blow up and things or something odd or weird. And so this morning was interesting, right? So the water's off. I gotta wash my hands. The water's off. I'm like, what's happening? Are they working on the water? What's going on?
[09:56] A: That'd be a good.
[09:57] B: Right?
[09:57] C: Yeah.
[09:58] B: And so. And I'm thinking, I'm like, are the dang guys out there working on the water? And they didn't inform us. So I go tell her. And she asked him. She's like, when was the water bill due? And he's like, the 22nd. And she's like, what's today? And he's like, the 2025th. And I'm like, are you freaking kidding me right now? Like, what is happening in my life? I was like, okay, the fact that I'm like, who doesn't pay their bills, right? Like that stuff that's kind of just like automatically taken out and you just like review the bill later.
[10:36] A: Not if you don't have the money.
[10:37] B: Okay, whatever.
[10:38] A: That's the. That's the challenge. But they do or they don't because they earmark it towards other things.
[10:45] B: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that. Okay, good point.
[10:48] C: Right?
[10:49] A: They may have the money, but they're not. That's not earmarked for that activity. You don't need any water.
[10:55] B: Forget it. I need some more blow up my nose.
[10:58] A: And if I, if I didn't, you know, pay the water bill on time, they wouldn't shut it off like in three days because I didn't pay because they'd give me a lot more grace. Well, I'm wondering because I don't have the experience of me not paying.
[11:13] B: Okay. So Chloe just brought that up to my attention. She was like. And my mom made a comment. She's like, well, three days later. And they didn't. And they turned it off. But I'm thinking like, he knew the dates. How do you not have that done? And so. But then Chloe was like. She mentioned the same thing. And I was like, I don't know. Because I've never not paid and mean, I've never had that experience. And so she's like, yeah. She's like, you would think that they wouldn't Have. So you guys are both. So they probably haven't. I don't know.
[11:45] C: Right. They wouldn't.
[11:46] A: Cuz if it was me and I hadn't paid the water bill and it was late, they wouldn't just shut it off. I mean they'd send me a late notice.
[11:52] B: Okay. And that's ridiculous. Like their water bill's like $40. They have solar panels.
[11:58] A: That's a lot for them.
[12:00] B: I don't know. So now I'm wondering if it's gonna now later on and I have an off day. I better stay busy.
[12:04] A: All I gotta say thing how is, you know, save a lot?
[12:10] B: Oh gosh, that's such a hard call.
[12:14] A: You really like it? It's fun.
[12:16] B: Okay. And I was talking to my grandfather about it. Yeah. And cuz I was telling him, I was like, okay, I can't, I gotta. I need to find another job. Cuz it's just not paying and I really don't want to manage that com. And they offered me that position.
[12:30] A: They offered you to manage the save a lot?
[12:32] B: Yeah. And yeah, I mean that is two weeks. And I was like, listen guys, I know I have like the management skills, but I don't want to be, I don't want to be running a save a lot. So that's why I didn't take it because I also felt that by me doing that then I'm. I'm kind of stuck in it. You are or I felt stuck because.
[13:00] A: Well, can't you transfer your management of save a lot to management of some other place that you might like to do better?
[13:07] B: Okay, fine.
[13:08] A: I mean just as a thought in.
[13:09] B: My church said too, she's like, well you could just do that then. And I'm thinking. And I told him I came back like a month ago and I was like, okay. Because sometimes you'll have like avoid or their scanners will double scan. So then you gotta void it off or whatever.
[13:27] C: Yeah.
[13:28] A: And so you need to have a manager.
[13:30] B: You have to. Yes.
[13:31] A: To come over and.
[13:32] B: Right. And I feel bad when I do that because I don't want to take away from them having to do whatever they're needing to do.
[13:38] A: That is part of what they're needing to do.
[13:39] B: That's it. Well, okay.
[13:41] A: Did you not realize that?
[13:42] B: I do.
[13:43] A: Really? I mean you think that they're, they're doing other things, but part of their job is to go and do the thing so that they can void the thing. That's part of it.
[13:51] B: All right.
[13:51] A: Like that's also what they're Getting paid to do, even though they're doing these other things. So you're not taking them off task. That's part of what their task is.
[13:57] B: Oh, that makes me feel better.
[13:58] A: Right.
[14:00] B: And I was like, you know what? I just come. Coming up for the season, you know, holiday season. Why don't I just do it? And then we'll have one last thing that they have to do. It would just the process, procedures, whatever production.
[14:17] A: It would make that go better.
[14:18] B: It's gonna go smoother. Okay, Right. So I told him that a couple weeks ago, but I also told him, and this guy's really flirty with me. We've kind of crossed the boundaries.
[14:27] A: How so? What does that mean?
[14:29] B: I don't know if I should tell you this.
[14:33] A: I don't know if I should tell you this. Oh, they definitely don't.
[14:36] B: Right.
[14:37] A: Let me leave it at that. Hey, by the way, there's this thing, and this is the only thing. Yeah.
[14:43] B: Well, somehow we've kind of gotten into speaking and talking a little dirty to each other. And at first. Okay, hear me out. At first it was innocent. Like, you couldn't. You didn't know if the other person was meaning it that way, but you could take it that way.
[15:07] C: Ah.
[15:08] B: So it started.
[15:09] A: It was an ambiguous.
[15:12] B: Yeah, just, you know, statement. A little nonchalant.
[15:16] A: Look at the size of those melons.
[15:20] B: Seriously. So that's how it started. And then I'm kind of, like, going with it because I'm having fun, you know, And I'm just like, you know, fun and flirty, and I make. I have fun there. Like, I literally. With my customers and stuff. I'm telling you, I go in there like it's a bar. I go in there.
[15:41] A: Right.
[15:42] B: That's my bar.
[15:43] C: Right.
[15:44] A: It's perfect.
[15:45] B: I have fun with these guys. And so I love it. But. Okay, so the conversations have gone a little too far, maybe. I mean, we've talked about, like, going into a corner.
[16:03] A: I mean, going into a corner of the store together.
[16:09] B: We've kind of. It's. It's definitely opened up now to where there is no way of you going around that or, like, even fathoming that you're not speaking about the same thing. But then. So we've openly discussed. And I asked him to stop because I was. It makes me uncomfortable because now I think about it, and I'm abstinent. Like, I don't want to do that till it's with my person. So here I am going against. Oh, my own. Yeah. Okay, here we go. That's the thing. That's the thing.
[16:41] A: Okay, so you'd like that to shift.
[16:44] B: No, I don't want to be with him.
[16:46] A: No, you'd like it to shift.
[16:47] B: Oh, my God. What the heck? Okay, that's gonna do.
[16:50] A: So that you're no longer engaging in that stuff with him.
[16:55] B: I don't know how to stop it.
[16:57] A: That's what.
[16:57] B: Right now we're snowballing.
[16:59] A: I get that you don't know how to stop it. I'm following you with that.
[17:03] B: I mean, I kind of like it.
[17:05] C: Yes, that's the problem.
[17:07] A: No, it isn't.
[17:08] B: I have like a.
[17:09] A: No, see, this is not the problem. The problem isn't that you like it. The problem is that you liking it and then it leading to something with him is in direct conflict with what you actually want.
[17:21] B: That's right.
[17:22] C: Right.
[17:23] A: So it's a part of you that's off.
[17:25] B: Yeah.
[17:26] A: That's wanting that with him.
[17:28] B: Yeah.
[17:29] A: I mean, or anybody likes that feeling that you get when you do that.
[17:34] B: Yeah.
[17:34] C: Got it.
[17:35] B: Yeah.
[17:35] C: Right.
[17:36] A: That's what.
[17:37] C: Right.
[17:38] A: And that is absolutely good to do in the relationship that you're in that you want to be in.
[17:43] B: Yeah.
[17:44] A: Like it wouldn't work if you were in a relationship that you wanted to be and that you couldn't do that.
[17:48] B: Oh, God, no.
[17:50] A: Right. So we absolutely want it in the right timing. I know, makes sense. But with that guy, it's not in the right timing. And that's the part that was caused by the grooming. You think, well, just check it out for a moment because I'm doing it. Well, watch. Because I'm doing it with somebody that I don't actually want to do it.
[18:11] B: Oh, my God. Exactly.
[18:12] A: That's the grooming. Do you get it? Do you follow me with that?
[18:15] B: That's the part.
[18:15] A: Remember, you went beyond. You went beyond doing things when you wanted to do it.
[18:23] B: Yeah, Right.
[18:26] A: That's what we want to get shifted so that you're freed up there.
[18:29] B: Well, and I tell you what, my. Another co worker, I don't know how she got into this. Right. And I've mentioned the money because I told him originally when he offered me the position, I said, listen, I said, I'm not taking it unless it's, you know, I want to be at. I'm not taking it unless it's at a minimum 25, 30. And that's minimum. Yeah, that's like, you know, that's like nothing still yet at that.
[18:59] C: Yeah.
[19:00] B: But I was like, okay. And that's kind of like what your area of Florida is. And so that's why I told him. And I. And he's like, well, it's not up to me. And I said, well, you know, shoot that past them, you know, get me more money.
[19:13] C: Right.
[19:14] B: So that was the main deal. So then I talked to the other coworker. Yeah. Assistant and manager. And she. She's in the company for like 10 years. I don't even think. She says she doesn't even make more than 20, but he says she does. I'm like, that's ridiculous. I don't even know you guys can live like that. Why would you stay with a company.
[19:32] A: Or business for 10 years? Come on.
[19:33] B: I know. And he says she's lying. And he said this. He said that. Why would she have stayed that long if she wasn't. Anyways, I don't know why. One day she comes up to me and because we're chatty or I make. I make people very comfortable around me. I do. Because I'm very intimidating somehow. So I have to make them more comfortable, you know, and like goof off and just feel it ease and somehow I can pull and pick their character. Well, it's a shame I can't do that with guys.
[20:04] A: Yeah.
[20:05] B: I am getting better.
[20:06] A: Not yet.
[20:07] B: That's right.
[20:08] C: Right.
[20:08] A: We want to get that part that's stuck there. The part that.
[20:11] C: Right.
[20:11] A: It's a parts conflict. We're gonna get that cleared up. So keep going with this assistant manager and then what happened with her and how. Get in this.
[20:18] B: So she comes walking along one day. She's like, oh, hey. She's like, I'm. My. I don't know if you'd be interested, but my husband and I are going to be doing something and wanted to know if you'd want to be involved. I'm like, what is going on here? What? Like, what is she speaking about?
[20:39] C: Right?
[20:39] B: And so then it comes out and she's like, well, she's like, you got a pretty face. You should use it. And I'm like, that is so vain.
[20:49] C: And I'm not just a pretty face.
[20:50] A: But.
[20:51] B: Yeah, but thank.
[20:52] A: Thank you. But I'm not just a pretty face.
[20:56] B: Well, and I hate to live like that. I don't want to live like that. And then she's like, she goes in, oh, you can do these tik Tok videos or something. And you could just be at these places and wearing whatever and do. I'm like, that's how you make money. That's how people make money.
[21:10] A: Yeah, people can make money doing that.
[21:12] B: I Guess so. I don't know. I have no idea. And so then I'm out.
[21:16] A: I'm like, okay, Dance only does a lot of stuff or only fans, whatever it is.
[21:19] B: Well. So I'm like, okay, so how do you get paid for that? Like, how do they send you money? Where does that part come in? Okay, shut up. Okay. So then that was last week. And I was like, I don't know about all that. Just a little word. And she's like, you could be grocery shopping or do whatever. People love it. I'm like, I don't want to live in that because I feel like that would be taking away from where my, like the spiritual work and my centering work. Yeah. I'm like, I don't. If I'm.
[21:52] A: So here's the thing. Could you do that? Sure.
[21:54] B: Yeah.
[21:55] C: Right.
[21:56] A: It's not. It's not whether you could or you can't do it. You absolutely could. It's again, does it align with. With who you say you're becoming?
[22:07] B: That's right.
[22:08] C: Right.
[22:09] A: That's where it's off. With that guy. Because it's not. In doing that. Because it'll be really good to do with the guy. That's the right guy.
[22:16] B: I think he's got a really big.
[22:17] A: Did you follow me with that?
[22:18] B: Oh, yeah. With a really good. Or the Moirai guy. Sorry. I was thinking about the size.
[22:23] A: Right. Of the other guy.
[22:25] C: Right.
[22:25] B: Of the wrong.
[22:28] A: My gosh.
[22:28] B: I know.
[22:29] A: Is that a zucchini or is that. Whoa.
[22:31] B: Hello.
[22:35] C: Yeah.
[22:37] B: So then she tells me last night because I was like, okay. So. Because she was like, have you looked into. I was like, I really want to, like, make videos of myself just walking around looking nice like that. Just. I don't. I don't want to be to where I'm always having to worry about my looks, what I'm wearing. I don't want to be performing again. Because that's what it was. Because I took it to myself. And I'm like, I don't want to perform.
[23:06] C: Right.
[23:07] B: Like, I don't want to be there. That's not. And then she tells me so. Because I asked her, you know, I was like, so how do you get the money? And she's like, oh, so you do like, tick tock. Then you put your website or whatever to it. She's like, here, I'll show you mine. This is what I'm doing. She's got like. She's a big girl. That's what she said.
[23:29] A: Some people like big girls.
[23:31] B: She's like, there's a market out there for me. I was like, okay, you go, girl.
[23:35] A: Hell yeah, you go.
[23:37] B: And she has, like. She, like, had one video of, like, her bed in there, and I was like, okay. So she's like, you do permit, like, promiscuous. Ish, like, alluding to, right? Snacks or whatever. I'm like, okay. And then she's like, here. And then, like, for me, I'm doing mine at to go to Onlyfans. And I was like, oh, my God. I was like. And you know what? That leads me back into the same stuff I was in before. Because I know. Because I'm like, oh, well, if I could just do like. Because I was selling these shoes online and my feet were in it, and then I got all these freaking stupid. A ton.
[24:20] A: God.
[24:22] B: I know. They really do. It's freaking weird, right? And I'm like, no, my gosh. And then I was like, oh, well, if I could get those guys if they wanted to give me money for shots of my feet and stuff. Okay, like, maybe, right? So that's where the things. Then my brain starts going, of course it does. Then I. Then this is my mind. And I'm like, okay, okay, Jack. And then you're. Then you're doing little videos of, like, you getting your nails done or your feet, things like that. And then what happens when they ask you for more? And then you're like, oh, well, maybe I'll just cut my face out or do this or that. I'm like, do you? And then I'm like, okay, no, I'm.
[25:01] C: Only a foot person.
[25:02] B: Yeah, well, and then it's like, okay. And then there's like, one big hit, you know, because then the hits are going to start coming in where they're huge lump sums and they're like, oh, for this, for that, you. You know where that leads. And then you're. I'm basically setting myself up for temptation. And then also what I think about is like, I think about those. The guys that I'm fueling, you see, by me doing those little things. This. That, like, it's fueling that. I don't want to call it sickness, but, you know, perversion or, like, whatever.
[25:36] A: It is, like, escape from being in the moment. Present. Yeah, to that thing, which, I mean, again, everybody does and has their own.
[25:49] B: To each his own, right? I'm like, do I really want to be a part of that again?
[25:55] C: Yeah.
[25:56] B: Like, I think I've done enough. I've contributed.
[26:01] A: So I roll it over on that, right? Yes. I'm done.
[26:05] C: Right.
[26:07] A: Yeah.
[26:11] B: I graduated. I've sold the company. Oh, my God.
[26:18] A: So that's what we're saying. Even in these two situations where you're having the kind of dialogue that you're having with that guy and she's sharing with you the kinds of things that she's sharing with you.
[26:30] B: You.
[26:30] C: Oh, yeah, right.
[26:32] A: Both of those things are part of the grooming.
[26:36] B: What do you mean that's part of the grooming? Oh, because I'm not cutting those people off immediately when it happens.
[26:41] A: And, like. Because they unconsciously can smell that.
[26:50] B: No.
[26:51] A: And know it.
[26:51] C: About that.
[26:51] B: No, don't say that. No, it's not. I don't have that perfume on right now.
[26:58] A: You do with them.
[27:00] B: My girlfriend said the same thing. She's like, listen, I don't know what you're attracting in your life.
[27:04] C: Right.
[27:05] B: You have a lot of sexual energy going out. Because I get. I still do. I get, like, guys, things.
[27:11] A: It's on.
[27:12] B: It's always sexual. I'm like. I'm kind of like. I mean, that's part of my being, but I don't think I can cut that off.
[27:20] A: Well, I don't know whether it's about cutting it off. It's about on the appropriate terms and time that you actually want to see. The problem for you is that it's on all the time. So sometimes you get unwanted approaches, a ton. Do you follow me with that? We want it to be on at the times that it serves you and works for you when you're deciding it. We want it to not be on at the times that you don't want it there.
[27:44] B: Yeah.
[27:44] A: And we want to have some fluidity in between. So that you get to be playful.
[27:49] B: Exactly.
[27:50] A: Right.
[27:50] B: I have to cut off my personality.
[27:52] A: No, we don't want to not have you be playful.
[27:57] B: In the context that we're saying. It works so well.
[28:02] A: Right. That's what we want. And that's why I say the part of you that's been having it on at all times.
[28:10] B: Ooh.
[28:12] A: Is different than the part of you that wants it on some of the time.
[28:15] B: Yeah.
[28:16] C: Right.
[28:18] A: But see, there's a higher positive intention of the part that's causing you to do it that's having it on all the time.
[28:31] C: Right.
[28:32] A: So all parts of us have higher positive intentions or they wouldn't be doing it.
[28:37] B: Okay, say that one more time.
[28:38] A: Yeah, I'm sorry. So all parts have higher positive intentions, meaning it being on all the time is supposed to do something for you that benefits you.
[28:52] B: All right?
[28:53] A: Right. Like, what do you Think that part's highest positive intention for Jacqueline is to.
[29:01] B: Take care of me the rest of my life.
[29:02] A: To take care of you for the. And if you were taking care for the rest of your life, how would.
[29:06] C: You actually be serene? Serene and at peace?
[29:13] A: So that part, highest positive intention is so that you're taken care of, so that you're feeling peaceful and serene.
[29:23] C: Right.
[29:23] A: What that part hasn't been realizing is that that by having it on all the time, it's in direct conflict with what it actually wants for you. What it's doing is preventing you from having what you want because you're. No, you're. You're unable to be selective with it.
[29:43] B: Yeah. It's going haywire.
[29:44] A: Do you follow me with that?
[29:45] B: Yeah, I do.
[29:47] A: So what that part hasn't realized up until now is that it being on all the time is actually in the way of you having what you really want because you're unable to be selective.
[30:02] B: And it.
[30:03] A: You follow me?
[30:04] B: Yeah, I do.
[30:05] C: Yeah.
[30:06] B: And somehow I always end up in, like, circumstances where I'm. I'm either not wanting to be with the person, but somehow it goes straight into that.
[30:20] C: Yeah.
[30:21] B: Or I want more with the person. Like the wholeheartedness, like the.
[30:27] A: Like, you know, the perfection before.
[30:31] B: But they don't.
[30:33] C: They.
[30:33] B: They want. They want this straight sexual aspect right away.
[30:38] C: Right.
[30:38] B: And I think I come across that more than others because there's no reason why I have so many of them.
[30:46] A: Right. So the part of the problem with it being on all the time is that that's what you lead with.
[30:55] B: What do I change?
[30:56] A: And you're a pretty girl. You don't need to lead with your sexuality.
[30:59] B: I'm not trying to.
[31:01] A: Yes. See, that's the problem. You don't have to try to because it's on all the time. And it being on all the time had everything to do with the grooming.
[31:12] B: Oh, yeah.
[31:13] A: So we want to get it unplugged. So it's on the time that you want it on that you've got a little say as to whether it's on or off.
[31:24] C: Right.
[31:24] A: That you get to have more say whether I'm approachable or unapproachable. Because being on all the time, I'm always approachable and I'm kind of playful with it.
[31:36] C: Right, right.
[31:40] A: Because I like that verbal sparring and it feels good and it's empowering. And, you know, some of it's a turn on and, like, all that.
[31:47] B: Well, and, you know, I had to open myself up to be like that Because I used to be very closed off and like considered, you know, a bee when I was younger. But I wasn't being my true happy, you know, sweet self.
[32:03] A: Sure.
[32:03] B: So I had to open and I just allowed myself to be that, you know, sweet, fun person. So I had to open that up. And it took a lot of work to do that.
[32:13] C: Right.
[32:14] B: But that does in is.
[32:16] C: Right.
[32:17] A: So the issue isn't it being opened up. The issue is that it's been on all the time and it's what's been being led with.
[32:26] B: Well, I guess that's what. Because I did have to leave it open or I did do a lot of. I had to be in that zone. I mean, I had to keep it kind of maybe like that or open like that for a while because.
[32:44] C: Right.
[32:45] A: What it went beyond is then I was no longer having say I was then doing things based on knowing that they wanted me to do them. And it was all transactional.
[33:00] B: Yeah. For money.
[33:02] A: And not just for money. It was transactional.
[33:05] B: Yeah.
[33:09] A: Got it. The kind of guy that you want to be with isn't going to be a guy that's transactional with you.
[33:17] B: Okay, so here's the problem I have with that. No, really. I mean, if we're going in there, we're going in. So I have a really serious problem with that, so.
[33:26] A: Problem with what?
[33:27] B: Okay, well, like I want to date. Like, I feel like I'm like I'm ready for my other to come to me. I'm ready for him to be here.
[33:38] A: Yes.
[33:38] B: Like.
[33:39] A: And it's all in who you're becoming that has you be able to attract the kind of guy that you actually want to be with. Not the guy that's managing the save a lot that might have a big cock.
[33:54] B: I know I can't even test it out. I don't want to save it for that person.
[34:00] A: And it's not about saving it for that person. No.
[34:04] B: Yeah.
[34:05] A: It's not even just about saving it for you.
[34:11] B: What is it for then?
[34:13] A: How to set up a successful relationship with a man. Women who have the most successful relationships with men are women who hold the keys.
[34:26] B: Oh yeah.
[34:27] A: Because they've got the goods. They've got what the guy is interested in. If a guy is interested in you, he likes the package you come in.
[34:37] C: Right.
[34:38] A: Girls don't just get turned on by what the guy looks like. It's important, but it's not number one. There's a lot of other aspects that go into what turns the woman on. And flip side, guys don't turn women on. Women turn women on. It's not the guy that turns her on. He's not the object of desire. He's not the peacock. It's her. She's the one that turns herself on. Knowing that she's turning him on and knowing that he can't have her unless I want to. It's the don't come here, don't you dare. Right? Like it's all that. That is the turn on for the woman, right? So we want women to hold the keys because they've got the goods. So for women there's no sex before monogamy.
[35:25] C: Right?
[35:25] A: That's a stand for her. Because I'm worth it to me. Because I'm worth me waiting to have more of what I want. I've done the other stuff, so I've done big. Okay, whatever. So like I've done stuff, I'm looking more for what I want. So it's a long term, you know, I'm taking, you know, temporary pleasure and postponing it. Setting goals for something that I want for me and myself.
[35:58] C: Right?
[35:58] A: That's where that millionaire matchmaker came from. She said no, no. Well, to drink maximum. I'll get shit faced on it.
[36:06] C: Right?
[36:06] A: And no sex before monogamy because why buy the cow if I can get the milk for free?
[36:11] B: Oh yeah.
[36:13] A: So. So the. So the idea is you want to be. You're in the process, right? Lots of stuff getting cleared up has moved you much closer. This lingering stuff that's left around what happened in the grooming so that that's wide open and it attracts more, more of the people that are deviant in it or not what you really want for you see, that's the problem. Like a predator, because that's what that world would show up as. Predators are only attracted to weaknesses because predators don't go after things that are strong because if they get injured, then they become the prey. So predators go after things that they can dominate. So the shark smells blood, right. The lion goes after the little gazelle, not the strong gazelle.
[37:06] C: Right.
[37:07] A: Like those are the things that predatorial. So if I have an open wound, which that's still an open wound. If I have an open wound, then I'm more attractive to that kind of person that I have that kind of exchange with which in and of itself that's not a problem if that's who you want to be. But the thing that you have told me numerous times and over and over again is that's not who I want to be. Got it? Like you already ran the tape and you went, oh, fuck, it would leave me and I could do. And then. Right. Like none of that's desirable.
[37:45] B: We think that I'm still having that in my life. And those people are showing up because I'm still a little weak.
[37:54] A: I think that the conversation is open at the wrong times.
[37:58] B: Oh, it's definitely inappropriate.
[38:00] C: Right.
[38:00] A: So the conversation would be better if it was on at the right times.
[38:05] B: Yeah. With the right person and everything else.
[38:07] C: Correct. Right. Right.
[38:11] A: That doesn't mean you can't be playful.
[38:14] B: Yeah, right. I mean, at this point, I'm just having fun. It's not that I'm going to do anything with it, but I really feel guilty about the fact that I've thought about how he would be in bed. Or like, sometimes when he'll make a comment, then I get a little.
[38:28] C: Right.
[38:28] A: It's turn on, turn on.
[38:30] B: Yeah, I do.
[38:30] A: Right.
[38:30] B: And I'm like, okay, I can't think like this because you know why? It's not where I want to be. Because I wanted to be with the right person. And I know he's not the right person.
[38:39] C: Right.
[38:40] B: So my other thing is, my big thing is this is whatever. So I. Okay. When I go to date. Yeah, I'm thinking about dating. I really haven't even been on a date. I think I've been on one. Guy's face surpasses me. I can't even remember what he looked like. Okay. It's like hard for me to get out to go on a date. That's how quickly I'm weeding through these guys. Which is great that all that has happened and have become who I've become. Come because it's helped me out there. This is my problem is that I go into looking at a relationship and I'm like, okay, well, if he's not going to give me money, if he's not going to give me money right away, I don't think I should be with him. If he's not able to take care of me like this, if he can't, you know, help me get out of my situation that I'm in now, then it's probably not going to work. You know, where does he live? How many houses does he have? What kind of lifestyle am I gonna. I. I go into it like, what.
[39:53] A: Are the things that I'm gonna get?
[39:54] B: That's it.
[39:56] A: And versus who do I want to be with?
[39:57] B: Well, and. But, yeah, but I. I still want that too, but that's not what's leading. I can't even think, Anytime I think about going on a date, I'm like, okay, well I'm not getting the money off. You're doing the like, am I really doing my time?
[40:12] C: Thing.
[40:12] B: I, I, that's my, that's my go to thing.
[40:15] A: Because no, that is the grooming. Because what you're leading with is what I'm going to get out of it.
[40:20] B: It's transactional and I'm not even wanting to do anything with it.
[40:24] A: I understand that, but it's. What am I going to get from this? Is it going to get me out of my situation? Is it going to get me some money? Is it going to get me things? Is it going to get me like, what am I going to get out of this?
[40:35] B: Yeah, like how's it going to look? Like, how is I do break it down? Like, how is like my monthly life going to look?
[40:43] A: Right. And you're not there yet. When you first meet somebody.
[40:49] B: I know, I don't know how to date. I look at it like I'm wasting my time.
[40:54] A: Yeah, but see, this is.
[40:55] B: Unless I find somebody really, and I want that, that's what I want to find. But how do I go without, like going not going into like bringing up some money right away or something because I feel like I'm, it's liable to slip off. I'm maybe the right guy and I'm.
[41:10] A: Gonna be like, hey, right, right. So you just did it.
[41:16] B: Because it makes me feel loved. Like, I feel more secure in it. Like if they give me money or if they're taking care of me and things. Like, I feel more like they have more to lose than me and I need them to be able to lose more than me because I don't want to put myself out there, be with this person. And what if something happens and then like, I don't know. Or what if I really like them? What if I really like them and I don't think, like, I don't think my other. I would have a problem with that. But I'm probably still gonna want my other to really have more on the line just to feel safe.
[41:56] C: Weird. It's not weird. Right?
[42:01] A: It's not weird. It's again, coming. The, the, what you want is not the issue.
[42:09] C: Right.
[42:10] A: What you want is to have some security and comfort in a relationship with somebody and that they're a take care of kind of person that they, one of their interests and one of the ways that they show love is by, you know, doing things, gifts and acts of service and stuff like that.
[42:33] C: Right.
[42:34] A: That's very different than. All right, you're gonna give me at least 50 bucks, right?
[42:41] C: Maybe 200.
[42:42] B: I mean, no. And I don't want that.
[42:45] A: So I do want that. Again, that whole thinking is in that part of you.
[42:54] C: Right.
[42:54] A: Because that part of you is the same thing. If you're getting money, what is it trying to do for you? What is its highest positive intention?
[43:05] B: To protect me.
[43:07] A: Protect you. And if you're protected, then what are you?
[43:09] B: Secure and safe.
[43:11] A: Secure and safe.
[43:12] C: Right.
[43:13] A: That part's been looking for security and safety. But again, by leading with that, what that part hasn't been recognizing is that by doing it, it's in direct conflict with what it wants for you. Because by leading with that creates every relationship to be transactional. Even if I'm not getting paid.
[43:39] C: Yeah, right, Right.
[43:48] A: So what we want is we want you to be clear and free from the effect that that stuff has had on you. So it's no longer running that program.
[44:04] C: Right.
[44:05] A: Because it's a program that's running in you that's causing it to be on all the time. We want the program running in you, where it's on in the times that it serves you and works for you, that it can be turned up or turned down, and that could actually be turned off in those times that, like. It doesn't serve me.
[44:25] C: Right.
[44:26] A: So that what's happening is all of me is more in alignment with what I really want, which is to postpone pleasure, joy, fulfillment down the road a little bit, versus immediate gratification. Got it. And I'm postponing it because I'm worth it to me.
[44:49] C: Right.
[44:51] A: That's why I'm postponing it, because I'm worth it to me. Right. Right. And you wouldn't want to be really worth it to you, would you?
[45:00] B: No, never.
[45:01] C: Yeah.
[45:02] A: Yeah. So as we think of this future you, as you check in again, would that be okay? Would it be okay that the program that's running is now? It can be on, it can be turned up, it can be turned down.
[45:16] C: It can be turned off.
[45:17] B: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:20] A: And that you're clear inside as to where and when it makes sense. Still being playful and fun.
[45:34] B: Okay. I think that's gonna be really hard to do.
[45:38] A: I know that you think it's going to be really hard to do, but what if it's not? Did you think cleaning up all that other early stuff was going to be really hard to do? Yes, if it's logical and conscious and I have to constantly concentrate on it. But Most of what goes on with you isn't conscious. That's just running by default. Your default mode network is your house of habits. It's just been habitual, so it's just been a constant thing that's been on. It's a, as we'll put it, a bad habit.
[46:16] B: Yeah, right.
[46:18] A: How we interrupt bad habits is we think about it and trigger the feeling.
[46:27] C: Right?
[46:28] A: And then we let the sensations go by just like we did with other things. But before we do that, we want.
[46:34] C: Your body in the right state to heal it.
[46:37] A: And so you simply can relax the back of your tongue and then slightly lower your jaw. And as you already are breathing in this way that's a little bit slower.
[46:49] C: And deeper and exhaling longer, notice that.
[46:55] A: As you're doing this, what's beginning to happen in your body?
[47:01] C: How's your body feeling now? Right? Notice even with your eyes closed, how.
[47:15] A: You can be more aware of this.
[47:17] C: Space all around you, right? To either side, to in between, behind, under, above. Notice more of the space.
[47:42] A: And the sounds.
[47:47] C: And there are many more things that you can be aware of consciously that you're already aware of unconsciously. Like, I can bring your attention.
[48:06] A: Towards.
[48:07] C: Your right earlobe, which you weren't thinking about much before, but now you are. And as you're paying attention to your right earlobe, you can also start to think about your left elbow, noticing that.
[48:27] A: Before I said it, you weren't thinking.
[48:29] C: About it at all. That's right.
[48:35] A: You can begin to notice the sensations.
[48:38] C: In your right knee and maybe all.
[48:43] A: The way down towards the left pinky.
[48:45] C: Toe, which none of those things were.
[48:49] A: You paying any attention to.
[48:53] C: But you can. And you might even notice how the music is changing, right? And how easy it is now for you to drift deeper inside towards the calm end peaceful, flowing energy. The light at the center is you are now connecting to more of who you are inside, light and free to be, becoming even more. Because without you having to do anything at all, your unconscious knows how to heal from the inside out. And having direct access to the control panels of your brain, knows exactly which buttons to press and in which order, which knobs to turn and how far, which levers to shift and switches to flip to reorganize and restructure your brain so that it's more optimized towards this future you worth it, right? Becoming even more of who you need to be so that you're attracting the kind of guy you want to be with. That's the transformation that's underway as you rest. That's right. That's right. And you can just notice what you're noticing. Right. You could bring your hands awareness of the fingers, whether it be the left one that's the one that's right for you. Or maybe it's the right one that's left. Just notice sensations in the fingers, your hands, and you can in very slow, voluntary movements, almost so slow that you.
[52:11] A: Might not even notice.
[52:16] C: The movement of your hand. Hands as you in voluntary ways, very slowly lift up. That's right. Very slow. Almost like you wouldn't even notice the hands and fingers lifting up. That's right. And up. That's right. And as you're noticing the movement, and I'm not sure which hand will lift up off your lap first again, maybe it's the right one that's the one that's left. Or maybe the left one is the one that's right. But see, what I do know is that your unconscious knows. Right. Which hand will lift up first.
[53:52] A: That's right.
[53:55] C: And you can become curious yourself about which hand I'll notice lifting up. Curious about how it's moving. That's right. Differently than how I might on purpose move the hands or the fingers. Either way. Right. I'm noticing now. That's right. That my breath has continued to slow down. As you also drift deeper down inside with the realization that the next time it'll be even easier to drift deeper down. That's right. So you can take your time beginning to find your way back up and up and up and up and up. And then when you're ready, nice big deep breath in. And then exhale. And eyes are open. There we go. What are you noticing within you now?
[56:04] A: Snap, crackle, pop.
[56:06] B: I know.
[56:08] C: Yeah. Isn't it interesting? Yeah.
[56:13] A: How's your body feeling now?
[56:15] B: It feels good.
[56:16] C: Yeah.
[56:16] A: So I want you to think of that guy, you know, save a lot.
[56:21] B: Oh, yeah?
[56:22] C: Yeah.
[56:22] A: Cause he's the guy that I definitely.
[56:23] C: Want to do stuff with.
[56:26] A: Realizing that by me flirting with him, it's in direct conflict with me attracting the guy that I really want to be with.
[56:32] B: You're so right.
[56:34] C: Right.
[56:34] A: And as you're getting that right, so just get that for a moment, grab a hold of that feeling. Let that feeling take you back. Let the feeling tone guide you back.
[56:50] C: Let it grow you earlier and younger. Right. Towards a moment. Right. What moment comes to mind?
[57:02] B: Chase.
[57:03] C: Chase.
[57:04] B: When we were flirting in school.
[57:06] C: Yeah. You're how old?
[57:08] B: 14.
[57:09] A: 14.
[57:10] C: Right.
[57:11] A: And he's also that age.
[57:13] C: Right, Right.
[57:15] A: And you can remember doing that with him?
[57:18] B: Yeah.
[57:19] C: Right.
[57:19] A: And what was it that you were doing?
[57:22] B: I don't know. Just messing around, fooling around, joking with.
[57:26] C: Right.
[57:26] A: And that was because he was somebody that you were interested in. Yeah, that's right. That's why you were doing it.
[57:33] C: Right.
[57:33] A: Then what happened next?
[57:36] B: Well, we were together for two years and I actually lost my virginity to him.
[57:41] A: You did, didn't he?
[57:42] C: Right.
[57:42] A: But you were doing that because you were into him.
[57:45] C: Right.
[57:45] A: And then what happened next?
[57:51] B: I don't know.
[57:52] A: If we split up eventually. You guys broke up.
[57:54] B: Yeah.
[57:55] C: Right.
[57:57] A: And that part of that was sad.
[57:59] B: It was because, you know, many years ago, when I was 30, he wrote me. Or before we were 30, before we graduated high school.
[58:07] C: Yeah.
[58:07] B: He said, you know, if we're not married by the time we're 30, we should just be together.
[58:12] A: Yeah.
[58:12] B: Because we're so good together. And then we did meet up when we were 30.
[58:20] C: Yeah.
[58:21] B: And I just wasn't. I had bigger ideas and plans. So I'm sure he is. And he does do good for himself. And I wonder why I didn't, you know, follow through with that. Because we would have been high school sweethearts, but I was so wrapped up in my. My home life.
[58:44] A: Yeah.
[58:46] B: I don't know.
[58:47] A: I pushed him away after high school.
[58:51] B: In between high school, because we still both. We got along so much.
[58:56] A: Yeah.
[58:56] C: Right.
[58:56] B: I mean, he was my best friend.
[58:58] C: Right.
[58:59] B: We had fun. We loved each other. It was amazing.
[59:03] C: Yeah.
[59:04] B: But I just was in my own whirlwind.
[59:07] C: You were right.
[59:09] B: Yeah. I started drinking, too, when I was 16.
[59:14] C: Yeah. Right.
[59:17] B: I got three DUIs by the time I was 18.
[59:21] C: Right.
[59:22] A: You have lots of shit happening in your world.
[59:24] B: Yeah.
[59:27] C: Right.
[59:28] A: The thing that we want to get.
[59:29] C: In is you're flirting with him was.
[59:35] A: Because you liked him and you dated.
[59:37] C: With him and you guys were playful.
[59:40] A: With each other for a long time before you wound up having sex.
[59:44] B: Oh, my gosh. Yeah.
[59:46] C: Right.
[59:47] B: That was a big deal.
[59:48] A: Do you know why that got brought up?
[59:52] B: Because it's pure.
[59:55] C: Right.
[59:55] A: And because it was 100% on your terms whether you're going to have sex. Sex or not.
[60:01] B: It was my idea, actually. When we did.
[60:03] A: Well, it was 100% on your terms.
[60:05] B: Yeah.
[60:06] A: That's how you know you've got a decent guy, is that it's 100% on your terms. And sometimes you might do it because he wants to, but it's still on your terms.
[60:19] B: Yeah.
[60:21] A: You follow me?
[60:22] B: Yes, I do.
[60:24] A: So that's a major difference.
[60:27] C: Right.
[60:27] A: That moment was brought to your brain because at that time that was all about.
[60:33] C: You got to decide. Right.
[60:37] A: And you were doing all that flirting because you liked him.
[60:41] C: Right.
[60:42] A: And that flirting led to having sex, but it wasn't to have sex. Got it. See, I wonder what it would be like to be in a relationship with a guy that you get to be flirty.
[60:55] C: Right.
[60:56] A: Because that's fun to do.
[60:57] B: Yeah, Right.
[60:59] A: And it doesn't have to be about having sex. I just get to be flirty. And sometimes it will be about having sex, but.
[61:05] B: Right, okay. Yeah. And you know what? I really should stop it with Sean. It's not very healthy.
[61:13] A: Well. Well, yes. It's like, you know, the person, you know, who is only having a toke of the cigarette because I won't have all of it.
[61:23] B: Yeah, same thing.
[61:26] C: Yeah.
[61:29] A: So check it out right now. What are you noticing even as you think about that stopping with Sean.
[61:36] B: You know what? It actually, like, motivates me and kind of empowers me to go more and looking like for what I want. Like, going for what I want is what it does. Versus, like, allowing some of these other guys that are so into my life. That's right. So why am I gonna allow all these other people to basically feed off of me when I don't even really want them? And what am I trying to do? Entertain myself? I got enough of that in here. I can do that myself.
[62:04] A: I got enough drama going to bring other people's circus.
[62:08] B: I'm the one that's the party.
[62:09] A: You know, there's a reason that I have those two monkeys there. To remind myself, not my monkey, not my circus. Oh, there's enough drama going on over here. I don't need somebody else's. I got enough.
[62:25] B: I got enough stuff to do.
[62:27] A: Yeah.
[62:27] B: You know, that's it. And because also, if I keep allowing all these other men that I'm like, oh, okay, maybe I'll push myself to go out just to go out, even though I know they're not the right one.
[62:38] A: So that's the first part. So notice how it's easier right now as you think of not doing that with Shawn or stopping that with Shawn. Check it out.
[62:48] C: How's it feel?
[62:50] A: Does that feel doable?
[62:52] B: Yeah, it feels good.
[62:53] C: Right?
[62:54] A: Because you're empowered because you're directive again.
[62:56] B: Yeah.
[62:57] A: You're having say. Got it. The second part is there's this whole thing about guys and money and that they need to give it to me.
[63:07] B: I just hate how my thinking goes there.
[63:10] A: So I want you to get that whole thing. I'm thinking about a guy okay. And, you know, he drives a nice car. I've already checked his Zillow, so he's got a big house.
[63:19] B: It's not even that. It's even before I even meet him, I'm like, okay, should I.
[63:26] A: Right. Got the. I want you to get that. Got the feeling I'm there. Where do you feel it in your body? Like, I gotta have them give me money. They gotta, like, take care of me. If I'm not gonna get shit from them, then it's not worth it.
[63:45] B: Because I've lived in.
[63:47] A: Because I've lived in a world where, like, you know, I've done stuff, but it was worth my time.
[63:52] B: Well, that's it.
[63:52] A: I got compensated.
[63:54] B: I'm like, do I really want to meet up with. I'm like, what am I really gonna get out of this?
[63:58] C: Right.
[63:58] B: Is there anything gonna. I think, is there anything gonna come of this?
[64:02] C: Right?
[64:03] A: In a.
[64:03] C: Right.
[64:04] A: And that's. Right.
[64:05] B: Look like.
[64:06] C: Right.
[64:06] A: Got the feeling.
[64:09] B: Yeah.
[64:10] A: Where do you feel it in your body?
[64:11] B: I don't know. It feels a lot, like, in my brain right now.
[64:14] A: Feels a lot like it's in your brain right now. So now get that and let that thing travel back. That kind of ants were like, I gotta make sure that I'm gonna get. Like, is it even worth it to do it? Because, like, you know, I got highly compensated before, and I don't get nothing for this. But John isn't about being compensated.
[64:39] C: No. Right.
[64:40] A: So that's a different thing. Got it. Notice how those two are different.
[64:43] B: Yeah.
[64:45] C: Right. Right.
[64:48] A: So what does it take you towards.
[64:50] B: That feeling, Wanting me to go towards a feeling?
[64:53] A: Yeah. Like, if you get that whole angst thing around, like, I gotta make sure that it's worth it or I gotta get something out of this.
[65:01] B: I just wonder where I'm. Where it's leading.
[65:05] C: Yeah.
[65:06] A: So get that discomfort about needing to know what it's leading to and what I'm gonna get out of it.
[65:14] C: Right.
[65:15] A: It's kind of like before I do it, I need to know what I'm going to get out of it to determine whether it's worth it to do.
[65:20] B: It or where it's going to go.
[65:22] A: To determine whether it's worth it.
[65:23] B: Like, if I'm going to even really like him.
[65:25] C: Right.
[65:26] A: How can. How can we know that ahead of time? We can't.
[65:32] B: And that's why I used to. Before I would go out and meet up on dates with guys for potential suitors, I would ask them for a lump sum of money.
[65:44] C: Right.
[65:44] A: But they Weren't potential suitors anymore.
[65:50] B: Oh, some of the time.
[65:51] A: Well, no, they weren't.
[65:52] B: Some of them.
[65:53] A: What if they gave you money? They were not a potential suitor.
[65:59] B: Oh. Because it was on. Just transactional.
[66:01] A: It was transactional.
[66:03] C: Right.
[66:04] B: And just in my mind, I convinced myself of them or thinking it was a potential suitor.
[66:10] C: Right.
[66:10] A: It's not a potential suitor.
[66:11] C: No.
[66:12] A: They know that I'm paying this person.
[66:14] B: Yeah.
[66:15] A: So if I'm paying them, they're going to do the things that I want them to do over time because I'm paying them. Got it. So where you've been thinking is, I need to get something. Where is it going to lead to?
[66:29] C: Yeah.
[66:29] B: Because you're. This time I was like, oh, well, let's see how they treat me in the beginning. And then it will only get better.
[66:35] C: Right, Right.
[66:39] B: Okay. All right.
[66:42] A: So we know that we've got a little bit installed already. That he's lucky if I'm going to allow him to spend time with me. See, as a woman, how we want a woman to feel is always that he's lucky that I'm allowing him to spend time with me.
[67:00] B: Well. And see, that's where the money factor would come in for me is because I thought. I had that thought and then the money came in too. Is that the reason why they.
[67:10] C: Right.
[67:10] A: He's lucky isn't about that. He pays me. See, I'm lucky if I get him to pay me to hang out with me. Okay, that's not him being lucky. He's guaranteeing himself getting lucky by paying me to hang out with me. Maybe not that first time, but definitely it's going to happen because why else is the guy paying? He's got some perversion. Maybe he wants to jack off on your feet. I don't know. I mean, there's all sorts of stuff out there. Right. So if he's paying you, it's for something.
[67:51] B: Yeah.
[67:53] C: Right. Right.
[67:57] A: So is. Is that the kind of relationship that you want?
[68:02] B: No, but I just feel like silly to do normal dating.
[68:09] A: Why would you do normal dating?
[68:12] B: That's what I'm saying.
[68:14] A: Why wouldn't you do dating where you're hooked up with people who have more high net worth, but it's not about them paying you.
[68:23] B: That's what I'm saying. Because I have to be in a certain caliber. I can't work and operate at a certain level. It just doesn't work with my being and who I am. It's like totally. Shots shot off. Like, it's like totally like out of whack. I couldn't do. I don't do well. Like, I couldn't.
[68:41] A: Don't do well.
[68:42] C: How?
[68:45] B: I only know of a certain. Well, I've seen a lot of different worlds. Don't get me wrong. I've seen a lot, I see a lot, but I don't, I don't mix well or get certain types of levels. Like my mom, for instance, right. Very close relationship. I can, like, compare to. I don't get her level.
[69:14] C: Well, why would you.
[69:15] B: Like. That's what I'm saying. I, I don't get it. So I don't know how, you know, she did that, how she would stay at the. I don't understand it. I don't get it. My, my brain isn't there, right. So I don't really. I don't know. And I just get along with guys that have a mental status of a broad range of different things, you know, highly intellectual men. I get along with great. I, I can, I can. I work, I operate like we, we move smoother together. You know, it just like goes together. I don't deal. I don't, I don't understand some guys that are at a lower, not even their income. I just. Because of the type of jobs that they end up in. I don't really. There's not much to talk about. Really. I don't know much about it. I mean, I usually given guys, like, ideas of how to do more.
[70:26] C: Right.
[70:28] A: So again, the issue isn't. The issue isn't the kind of guy that I want to be with. That's not the issue. I want to be with somebody who, you know, is successful, who, you know, has things going on for them. But we're not mentioning anything about like, you know, that wants to be a partner that is really interested in making.
[70:57] C: Me feel special and loved.
[71:00] B: Oh, no. That's a definite, right?
[71:03] A: Yes. That's not what we're leading with.
[71:09] B: Well, I thought you just mentioned you've got to be in a certain.
[71:14] A: Yes.
[71:15] B: Range of men that you're dealing. And then we, through them of how they treat me and the partnership and things like that.
[71:25] A: It's that, why am I going out on a date with this person? How you've been framing it is I'm going out on a date to kind of project how my life's going to be. And if they immediately don't give me money, then they get a, you know, check marked out.
[71:46] B: Well, I think. Well, I'm not doing that. It's. I, look, I don't Even know what I just said is I would. I think about that because I guess I did that, you know, for so long. I would. I would categorize them if they. Because I have gotten offered so much. I mean, any. Even now, like, you know, if they offer to fly me out here to do this, to go on a vacation right away on our first date, type of things like that. Like, I do categorize them and if, you know, they say, oh, I'll cover, you know, all your expenses and I'll give you some extra play money, you know, you can do whatever you want with. I mean, I do. I mean, those guys get, you know, the ahead of everything. You know, they're on the top tier.
[72:43] A: Have we dated a guy like that that hasn't been a transactional guy?
[72:49] B: I don't know. I've gone through so many, but I didn't like who they were. I didn't like their being. And yeah, they could provide me with everything, but it just. The connection wasn't there.
[73:02] C: Yeah.
[73:02] B: Or some of them ended up freaking weirdos. Or I saw something in them, like maybe a little tick that I knew, oh, that tick is gonna go somewhere and I don't want to know anything about that one.
[73:13] C: Right, right.
[73:18] B: Sorry, buddy.
[73:19] A: How many of these people have you dated since we work together?
[73:24] B: I haven't dated anyone, though. I was just asked on a. To go to freaking Jamaica, which to me is kind of a questionable place to go. Some to se. So they go there the first day. Somebody you don't know? I don't know.
[73:39] A: Probably not Jamaica.
[73:42] B: Yeah. Who knows? Him and his little private jet. I got to know about that. I start. I do. Before, I would have just gone. I would have. I wouldn't. Sure. Now I'm really thinking about things. I'm like, okay, this is why, you know, people always said you're crazy and you gotta be careful. You don't want to end up like.
[74:07] A: Table we want to have again. The thing that you're looking at isn't the activity. It's putting the activity in context of the bigger goal.
[74:17] B: So you think I should focus more on.
[74:19] A: Do you follow me with that? Like, the activity going on the trip. Do. The activity in and of itself is not the issue. It's does this activity at this time in my life fit and move me towards my primary goal that I want for me?
[74:38] B: Well, now I don't know.
[74:40] A: Does it get me closer to it? That's the question you want to weigh.
[74:45] B: I mean, it could have. See, there's the question. Because I asked myself that question. I said, is that where you want to go? Because you could leave, you could request time off, you know, but then. And it is by me doing that, no. Is that gonna.
[75:00] A: That guy asking you without ever knowing you to go to a tropical island is not the right guy.
[75:08] B: You're like, okay, let me brother you right now. Let's just get that you're not getting on the plane.
[75:13] A: Let's just get that one straight.
[75:15] B: Do not talk about her choice to him.
[75:17] A: No, the issue is not whether you get on the plane, plane. The issue is, you know what you're getting into before you get onto the plane. You don't think this is that right? There are people who during before the housing market crashed in 2008, they were playing a different game than other people. They were playing the game of buy the house, flip it, sell it for more. Buy the house, flip it, sell it for more. And as the market went up and people were getting. That was a different game than somebody who's buying the house that they want to live in for the next 20 years and are trying to get a decent mortgage so that they can pay it over time. Different game, right? There are people that are day traders. I'm going to trade this thing and when it goes up to this, it's going to be sold. And then. Right. And there are people who are going, you know what, I'm going to follow the index funds and I'm in for the long term and every year I'm going to reallocate that. The different games that people are playing, I don't care which game you play. Like I got no stake in that for me, right? It's that when you're playing the game, I want you to know which one you're playing.
[76:16] B: Well, I don't know which one I'm playing. Which one would that be playing?
[76:19] A: If you're going on a trip with a guy who just met you did.
[76:24] B: We haven't even met.
[76:25] A: Okay. If a guy that you haven't met asks you to go on his private plane to Jamaica, he's not the right guy. He's not the long term guy. He's not the guy that's going to.
[76:38] C: Really take care of you.
[76:40] A: Gosh.
[76:40] B: So maybe I have.
[76:41] A: He's the guy that's looking for the party girl that he might get to fuck while he's down there. And if you want to do that and be that, that's not a problem. There's not an issue with it. It's knowing that that's What I'm getting into before I go versus thinking, oh well, maybe this will eventually turn into that we have a long term relationship together because that is transactional.
[77:11] B: I'm gonna have to do like the really slow dating again.
[77:15] A: I'm gonna, I'm gonna say you're gonna need to be just a little selective.
[77:19] C: Yeah, yeah.
[77:21] A: Only because you're worth it to you.
[77:24] B: Yeah, true.
[77:25] A: You don't have to do it, but it's all about you being worth it to you.
[77:29] C: I know.
[77:29] B: I just have this thing in me because I'm very adventurous and you know, outgoing and the random trip to me is. Sounds like so much fun.
[77:36] A: It is. There's no issue in going on a random trip. You just need to know that it's not a, oh, this is going to turn into a, you know, long term dating guy.
[77:46] B: No, he would have probably turned into someone I just randomly had every once in a while. But then, you know, and what it.
[77:53] A: Would do is it would be a guy who's going to pay you to be with him.
[77:57] B: Well, yeah.
[77:58] A: And you know, so it's been very, very alluring.
[78:01] B: He would probably try to push to do that.
[78:03] A: It's been very, very alluring to you over time. Because I've gotten paid to spend time.
[78:12] C: With men.
[78:15] A: That I look at it, if I'm not going to get paid to spend time with him, is it worth it?
[78:22] B: Exactly.
[78:24] C: Right.
[78:24] A: But that's if you want transactional relationship. I spend time with the guy not because of how much money he'll give me.
[78:37] B: I know. I don't know why I have that random thought. I just hate it. You know what it is? It's. I haven't really found someone that I want to go hang out with that without any strange attached. I have no desire. No one's doing it for me.
[78:57] C: Not yet.
[78:58] B: Not yet.
[78:59] C: Right.
[78:59] A: Do you know why?
[79:01] B: Cuz the picker's off.
[79:02] C: Right.
[79:03] A: Cuz we hadn't done the work to heal the emotional wound that I was doing it with the kid when I was younger and it was all on my terms. I got to decide. I was the one that chose when we were going to.
[79:21] B: Now I always feel like there's some compromise or sacrifice.
[79:24] A: But the reason that your brain brought that moment in that experience back to your awareness was to remind you that when it is true, it's because it's pure and I totally want to and it's 100% on my terms. If I get money from him, I'm becoming a possession of his. So when it worked with that guy I had 100% total say.
[80:08] C: Right.
[80:10] A: And you're.
[80:11] C: Yeah.
[80:12] A: And you get it to the extent that you realize you're worth it to you. Right. To wait so that I get the healing. So that I become more attractive and attracting. The kind of guy that is interested in seeing me as more than just his possession.
[80:35] B: Yeah.
[80:38] A: Is more than just his fuck toy.
[80:42] C: Right.
[80:43] A: That gets to see me and therefore is really lucky that I'm allowing him to spend time with me. Got it.
[80:55] B: Well, we're both gonna be lucky.
[80:57] A: Yes. You'll also be lucky. But he'll be really lucky.
[81:02] C: Right.
[81:02] A: That's how we want it to be inside of you. Make sense?
[81:07] B: Yes.
[81:08] A: That's different than what can I get from him or if I don't get what I think I should, then it's not worth it. That's all transaction.
[81:17] B: You know what that's gonna link to now? Every time that I think about that, that means that I'm not interested really in that guy.
[81:26] C: That's right.
[81:27] B: There we go. 100 short circuits it out and it's done. I don't even need it about.
[81:31] C: Right.
[81:31] B: I do. I got it.
[81:33] C: Right.
[81:33] A: If I'm right. If I'm looking at it is what am I going to get?
[81:36] B: And then I don't need to go the back and forth because you don't much time.
[81:38] A: That's the guy that he's out.
[81:40] B: That's where I like. I'll push. I'll be like, oh well, I try to. I have to. I try to push to go out. But I don't really want to go out and have those thoughts. And that's why. That's the link.
[81:50] C: That's the link, Right?
[81:52] B: Yeah.
[81:52] A: So now that it's gotten exposed, it can't run you. It just is my tell that I'm not interested in that guy.
[81:57] B: Yeah. That's it.
[81:58] A: Right.
[82:01] B: I always have these signs.
[82:04] A: See, Isn't that awesome?
[82:06] B: I also have this thing with my eye blink.
[82:09] C: Yeah.
[82:10] B: Like when it's telling the. Like the truth or if I want the right one, I'll do that. I did this really messed up thing where I. I don't know why I did it, but I trained myself to lie. It was start out with a game. I was like, I wonder if I could like teach myself. My brain to automatically go to the lie versus the truth every time. And I did. And it's just. It messed me up. I had a really. I had a long period of time. Like it took me a couple months.
[82:40] A: Yeah.
[82:41] B: Of dedication.
[82:42] C: Yeah.
[82:42] B: To get Rid of that.
[82:43] A: Yeah.
[82:44] B: Where my brain would automatically go first to the initial lie because I wanted to know how, like, powerful I was. And I don't know why that thing popped in my head to do that.
[82:52] C: Right.
[82:53] B: I did. But it will mess you up to do something later on. I don't know why I did that. You know why? Now that we're talking about it, I think it might have been because I didn't want anybody to really know anything about me. So then if I came up with the cuz I wanted to, I trained it to be the exact opposite of what it was. So maybe that's why I did that.
[83:17] C: Well, right.
[83:18] A: And now you just got it because it's the exact opposite of what you want.
[83:23] B: Yeah.
[83:24] C: Right.
[83:24] A: If I start thinking about money, oh, that means that's not the right guy, because that's the exact opposite of what I want.
[83:30] B: Opposite.
[83:32] A: It's the same thing.
[83:33] C: Right.
[83:34] A: Click. Now I don't need to play with it anymore. I'm done.
[83:39] B: Exactly.
[83:40] C: Right.
[83:41] A: Because we want you, energetically, to be putting out the kind of pheromones of the kind of guy that you actually want to be with who's going to feel really lucky that he gets to be with you.
[83:54] C: Right.
[83:55] A: And as a result of that, he's also going to be a really good caregiver and caretaker. Right. Because that's something that you're interested in. But he's going to be doing it because he's really lucky that he gets to be with you, not because he's paying you to do whatever he wants.
[84:12] B: You to do or just because he can. Because he has the money.
[84:15] C: Right. Got it. Right.
[84:18] A: Because you value you and you're worth it to you.
[84:22] C: Right.
[84:22] A: Just check. Notice how much more you're worth it to you.
[84:26] C: Right.
[84:28] B: I feel more sound.
[84:30] A: I know. So think about, you know, Sean Zucchini shot Zucchini now.
[84:35] B: I think of him every time like that. Oh, my. His nickname is gonna be Zuki.
[84:42] A: There we go.
[84:42] C: Right?
[84:42] A: Yeah. I'm not even sure they sell that at sablenot.
[84:45] B: They do. Their prices aren't so Sable.
[84:50] A: No, I know. They just have the name.
[84:52] B: I'm like, what the heck? Some of these prices are higher than freaking one Dixie.
[84:57] A: It's like, there are people that actually go grocery shopping in cvs.
[85:01] B: Really?
[85:02] A: It's fucking nuts. But that's where they do all their shopping is. It's cvs. You know, they have toilet paper and they have. Okay, you're gonna pay, you know, way more than what it would cost.
[85:10] B: Much more.
[85:11] C: Right.
[85:12] A: But, you know, that's what people do.
[85:13] B: Convenience, I guess. Maybe it's the closest thing to them.
[85:17] C: Yeah.
[85:17] A: Think about the other girl. You know, I mean, because you meet the kind of guy that you want to be with on OnlyFans pages.
[85:23] B: No, I know. That was straight temptation.
[85:27] A: You meet those kind of guys. The guys that, like, feel really lucky on Only fans.
[85:35] B: I love you right now for this. Thank you. Because I seriously had to call my girlfriend last night because my thinking, you know, I'm going with it. And it's like, oh, well, maybe it's just if it's innocent. And then I'm like, you already know where your brain is.
[85:50] A: It's just my feet. You know, if the guy decides to give me 100 grand so he can see my feet and a little bit more of me, then it's 100 grand.
[85:57] B: Hello. Okay, no eyes, though. Not too much of a facial recognition.
[86:04] C: Yeah.
[86:07] A: Go ahead and just blur my face or only from here, I'll wear a mask.
[86:14] B: There we go. My girlfriend said that. She's like, and how much money are you going to have to put into props and stuff? I was like, okay, that's not the point. I think we're getting off track here right now. You still are having me consider this.
[86:30] A: And the issue isn't that you could do it or not do it if I don't want. It doesn't fit who you want to be in the world and who you're becoming.
[86:39] B: I mean, my gosh, didn't I do enough of that?
[86:40] C: Right?
[86:41] A: Yes. You know, stamp. The stamp. Yeah. And that's not me.
[86:52] B: It's not. And I really don't like how that came into my life, But I think it's just, you know, trying to bring me back.
[87:00] A: But remember, that came to your life.
[87:02] B: Oh, yeah.
[87:03] A: After stuff was done with the guy and you didn't have funds and you had to live at moms. So the eerily similar thing that has that repetitive cycle of the, you know, know, habit loop is that you're in the dynamic of living with mom. See, back then, getting with whomever you got with that was paying you.
[87:27] C: Right.
[87:28] A: Was the way to get out of living with mom, because you had to go back to living with mom. Okay, so this is after the breakup.
[87:36] B: Yeah. So there's this guy, another one. Which one is this now? Okay, I met him. He bought a laser hair removal thing for me right off, like, Facebook Marketplace. Anyways, so then, like, he wanted me to meet at his house, and I was like, okay, that's odd to Ask a stranger to drop it off. But sure.
[88:03] A: So then I go, no, see, in those situations, no, we meet at Publix.
[88:10] B: I know, but it's we. I live in a retirement community.
[88:13] A: Meet at Publix.
[88:14] B: I looked at his Facebook. He seemed like some old guy.
[88:17] A: He is some old guy.
[88:18] B: Big deal.
[88:19] A: We got that, you know, daddy old guy thing that we go for.
[88:23] B: I think I might have something there technically. Of course you do think it was because. Yeah, I've been with him for a long time. And so I get there and I'm like, I can already tell that he doesn't need it. And I'm like, whatever.
[88:37] A: The laser hair removal.
[88:38] B: And I was like, I bet he'll just pay me the full price. Not even like ask me lower or anything. So I get there and he does give me a little bit more. I sold it for like 95, right? I paid like originally 3 or something for it anyways, so. And I'm like. And I bet he's just gonna give me a hundred dollars, right? Because he's not gonna have the change. And then. So I still brought the change. And he. So I get there, his house is super freaking nice, like super ornate, beautiful. My cup of tea, like. But he brings me over and I. And before I got there I was like, he's wanting me to go over to his house because he wants to just show me his house. Because on my Facebook you can see my face and stuff. And so I was like, so that's what he's doing. So sure enough, if I don't get there, then he shows me around his house. I'm like, oh my God, this is back in the day when I would like go meet a guy and they show me their house.
[89:33] A: They're peacocking.
[89:34] B: Yeah.
[89:36] A: The wrong person is the desire. See, this is. I'm going to give it to you. The female panther never runs after the male panther saying, me, me, never. Does she pursue him? These guys that have money have been causing you to pursue them. That's the wrong way it goes for women. Women are supposed to be pursued. They're the ones that let the guy know that I'm approachable. Don't fucking come near me if I'm not wanting you to.
[90:13] B: Yeah, true.
[90:15] A: Alright, so go back to this. So you're at this guy's house, he's peacocking.
[90:18] B: Okay, Shows me his house. Then he asked me to out to lunch right away. I said, no, I gotta go back.
[90:22] C: Right?
[90:23] B: Anyway, so then I did end up calling him because I was gonna help my Mother. And she was all done with it. So I went out to lunch with him, blase blah. And he ended up being like a federal attorney, an ex federal attorney. I'm like, I don't really know if I want to be involved with someone like that.
[90:44] A: Do you know how to expunge records?
[90:46] B: Well, that's what I started thinking about. I was like, wow, she's probably got some pull.
[90:53] A: So now watch. As soon as you started thinking about that, what kind of relationship is it?
[91:02] B: A beneficial one. This is a friendship. We help each other out.
[91:08] A: Yeah. He also wanted Hilda, you know, who's a, you know, 6 foot 2 large woman that was selling something, to come over to his house and drop it off as well.
[91:22] B: Oh, I know. It was because.
[91:23] A: And you asked Hilda to go out to lunch too.
[91:27] B: Well, and he had to have looked up my record, I think because you invite someone over at your house, you're, you know, ex attorney.
[91:36] C: Right.
[91:37] A: Can I have the pretty girl come over and I can peacock for her and then show her what I know.
[91:44] B: I don't know. All right, so let's get to the rest of it. So he's wanting to hang out. I guess he got me something. I still haven't picked it up yet. I'm getting the gift.
[91:56] A: Just know what you're going into. It's fine.
[91:59] B: So then I happen to tell him. Okay. Cuz he told me about a bad situation that happened to him. His ex. He worked overseas too, in like one of the wars or something. And he, I don't know, he lost it. Or his ex.
[92:11] A: How much older is he than you?
[92:19] B: Am I guessing more than 20, like 65, 70.
[92:24] A: Yeah. Okay.
[92:26] B: Anyways, so I.
[92:28] A: You're going to have a guy that's a little older, but not that old.
[92:31] B: Yeah, I know.
[92:32] A: You don't need to marry your grandfather.
[92:33] B: I'm not. Grandpa's 91 my grand. He turned 91 yesterday.
[92:37] A: I know, but it'll be soon enough that that guy would be 91.
[92:41] B: Exactly.
[92:42] A: That's the problem.
[92:43] B: Well, so this is what I'm questioning you with is. See, I'm questioning you now. It's okay. So then I happen to tell him because he talked about how hurtful it was that. That his ex stole all that money from him and ran over some other guy. So I told him about my mother and what she did and he said, you know, no strings attached, you can come stay in my mother in law suite if you want to. And so I was like, you know, they all say that. They all say no strings Attached. I'm not a pervert. And, and he did say that.
[93:22] A: Yes. People who are, are not perverts say that. I'm not a pervert. It's like somebody saying to you, well, you know, to be honest with you. Oh, you mean all of the. That you were telling me earlier you weren't being honest, but now you want to be honest with me.
[93:40] B: Okay, but on the honesty thing, because I heard that. I do say that because it's, it's usually I'll say that when it's like.
[93:47] A: Well, no, you trained yourself to lie.
[93:49] B: Well, okay, forget that.
[93:51] A: You're so good.
[93:52] B: I'm not. Okay, but I don't.
[93:54] A: So you're asking the question, is this guy a transaction? And I'm going to say yes. How do we know? Cuz he's offering you something.
[94:04] B: This is very disappointing right now.
[94:06] A: No, I want you to get it. Cuz this is the same thing that's going to keep you stuck.
[94:11] B: I wondered the same.
[94:12] A: And not get what you want because you didn't want to be with him, be with him.
[94:18] B: And I wouldn't be with him. But it was going to come down the line where he's attracted to me. I'm not giving him what he wants. And then I'm, you know, out having to look for a place again.
[94:26] C: Right.
[94:29] A: It's transactional because he's offering you something and but here's the key thing. You met in a transaction, transactional way. He bought something from you different than I meet somebody at Save A Lot. They bought something from the store, not me. He bought something from you. It's transactional. You didn't just see each other and happen to be, you know, in line at Starbucks together with you carrying it and him going, wow, I need one of those. Right. So that's where. That's how you're going to know. That's your tell.
[95:21] C: Right.
[95:22] A: The problem isn't doing the relationship, it's thinking it's going to be the other one.
[95:30] B: Wait, say that one more time.
[95:32] A: The problem isn't doing it. It's okay to have a relationship with that guy. You just need to know what it is ahead of time.
[95:43] B: Oh yeah.
[95:44] A: And then you can check. Does that fit with who I want to be and who I'm becoming and the people that I want to attract to my life? Hey, next guy that I'm dating, that's a really great guy. Yeah, no, I live in this other guy's, you know, extra room.
[96:00] B: I thought it.
[96:01] A: I'm glad you, I mean, but I mean that's the thing, Right? So it's not even just that as an embarrassment thing. It's. It's transactional. And you want to get away from transactional because you're worth it to you. You keep looking at it that I gotta get out of this thing right.
[96:17] C: Now and I'm not making enough money.
[96:20] A: And there was the money that I had that she took, and I can't even go and live out by myself yet. Like, there's a lot of urgency to getting out of the situation I'm in.
[96:30] C: Right.
[96:30] A: We want to turn down the urgency.
[96:32] B: A little because, I mean, I really am. Okay.
[96:35] A: Yeah.
[96:35] B: I feel like. And I've tried to push my mom.
[96:38] A: So it's all about waiting when I.
[96:40] B: Look at it, the money, and giving.
[96:42] A: Yourself the time and space to cultivate more of what you want.
[96:48] B: See, I think the same thing, right? But my girlfriend, my best friend. Friend in California, she calls me the other day and she's like, you need to get in your own space. And, you know, you need to get out of your mom's house. You need to do it immediately. You need to be more independent. You know, you need to find a new job, all this stuff. And I got off the phone and she's like. And I did it, you know, because her ex husband robbed her mind. She's an insurance broker. You know, it's made a ton of money. Blase, blah. But also there was an alcohol factor and things that they were partying a lot, but. And then he really screwed her over.
[97:21] C: Yeah.
[97:22] B: And so she was like, got down to nothing to where she ended up, like, having to, like, live with her dad for a little period of time. Right. And she's older than me. She's like 50, so. But whatever. Okay. So she's comparing her life to mine and she's like, you know, I did it. You can do a blase blah. But then I step out and it made me feel bad because I feel like I'm pacing myself. I feel really good where my mental state date is where I'm at.
[97:45] A: So you're not on her timetable. No, you're on your timetable. And it takes a little bit of time to get yourself reoriented.
[97:57] B: That's true. And she's comparing herself to me.
[98:00] C: Right.
[98:00] B: And she gets like three grand from the government for caretaking.
[98:04] C: Right.
[98:05] A: But she's also looking at a different thing. You're looking at. You're playing. She's playing a different game than you. It's like the guy who's flipping houses versus the Guy who's buying the house to live in it for 20 years. They're playing different games. But if I think that they're playing the same game as me, then I'm gonna feel like I gotta quickly get into my house, fix it up and sell it. I know, but I wasn't buying my house to get it quick fixed.
[98:33] B: That's right. I'm going, I'm going.
[98:35] A: That's the difference.
[98:36] B: Yeah, yeah.
[98:38] A: So you're worth it.
[98:42] C: Right?
[98:43] A: There might be some catch and release if you're looking for a specific fish.
[98:50] B: It's gonna be rare, right?
[98:52] A: I don't know whether it's rare. It will, it gets set up. The more that you're in the state.
[98:58] C: That you're attracting that kind of guy.
[99:02] A: Versus who you've been attracting has been transactional. So I'm going to be really curious for you to notice what you notice that's different just now. And as you move forward in thinking about like interacting with guys, well, I.
[99:28] B: Know I'm gonna have to cut this them off right away for the ones that I know aren't it? Which I think my initial instincts will tell me.
[99:38] A: You'll know that they're not it. Cuz you'll be thinking of it that they're you. What can I get from them?
[99:44] B: Well, do you think that in meeting someone that I'll know whether or not they're the right person or not for me?
[99:52] A: I think in meeting with them you'll be attracting the kind of guy that's into you for you.
[100:00] B: I meet lots of guys like that.
[100:02] A: But I'm not yet. Not yet.
[100:06] B: So those ones I really shouldn't even mess with or go out on dates with.
[100:09] A: Well, you, you could, but see, that's a different thing than a guy who's going to give you. You want to. And it might be useful to go out on a date with a guy who's interested in you just to see what it was like. Not that I need to do anything with it, but why not? You know, and at least he's gonna, at least he's gonna, you know, pay for my coffee or buy me a meal. I mean, at least.
[100:37] B: And I'll be treated nice and normal.
[100:39] A: Because. Because I'm not gonna go out with a guy and he's gonna go, well, let's do Dutch. No, sorry. You asked me out on a date, dude. Like, I mean, are you kidding me?
[100:52] B: I don't even know if I dealt with that once.
[100:55] A: Right, so. So I mean that's the thing you want to have the experience of what that's like for you.
[101:04] C: Right.
[101:04] A: Because you've been so down the other path that we want to try this path.
[101:08] B: You know what I'm afraid of too, is like, so many guys offer me, like, even if I go out on a regular date with him, they start offering stuff right away.
[101:20] C: That's right.
[101:21] A: Do you know why? Because energetically, that's what you've been putting out there.
[101:33] C: Right.
[101:36] A: You've been putting out there that I'm struggling and I need your help.
[101:40] B: Okay. Well, I have been dropping a hint.
[101:43] C: Right.
[101:43] B: So occasionally. Well, because I was thinking. Because I did. Oh. Because I've been testing things out. Right. And I've been.
[101:49] A: But what we want is not you struggling. You're good.
[101:54] B: I really am.
[101:55] A: I know. But you're worth it to you. So you don't need something from them. And you're not going to come across as needy. You're going to come across as, I don't need them. Like I used my life works whether I have them in it or not.
[102:13] B: Exactly.
[102:15] C: Right.
[102:15] A: I'm worth it to me. So I don't need them. They can add to, but I don't need them. That's only going to come from a guy that you go out on a date with that's into you for you, and then you're still going to check all the other things. And yes, he needs to be chivalrous and yes, he needs to be doing caretaking and paying for and opening doors and all the other stuff that how I want to be treated because I'm going to train the guy on how I want to be treated.
[102:49] B: But be patient if they don't.
[102:51] A: But that's how we do it. If I want jewelry, I tell him the three pieces of jewelry that I like so he can pick one. I don't leave it up to him to get me something because he's not going to get me the right thing.
[103:02] B: Right.
[103:03] A: So you already have all of those things set up for you. It's just coming in a different container because it's from a different state of mind. It's not out of what can I get from them. It's transaction. It's their lucky. And I might feel lucky, too, but they're really lucky that I'm allowing them to spend time with me because I got like a lot of other stuff that I could be doing.
[103:26] B: Yeah.
[103:27] A: Rather than spend time with them. So they're lucky.
[103:29] B: And that's what stops me from even going on any dates is I look at, like, where is this gonna go right?
[103:37] A: The first part isn't about where it's gonna go. It's. I'm gonna see if I enjoy the interactions. We can't go 15 steps down the road before we take the first small step. And I can't know what step 14 is gonna be until I take step, step 13. So I can't know it all ahead of time. It's like golf. I can't tell you which club I'm going to swing on the third hole, my second shot until I'm there.
[104:03] B: And see, that's where I'm so confused with the other and why I correlate it with the money thing is because within getting and knowing the money or what's coming in or what you're gonna get, you know the deal.
[104:14] A: Yes, it's transactional and it's about money. And again, there's no problem with that. You just need to know it's transactional and about the money and similar down the path that you had been on. That's all.
[104:34] B: Yeah. And it will just end up leaving.
[104:36] A: So instead it's the guy and he takes you out and you have a really good time. And then you're a little. And then you're a little less. And then you're a little less available than he would want you to be. Then if he calls you to try to take you out on Friday, and he calls you Friday morning, you go, I know, I'm sorry. I'm busy. Even if you have nothing fucking to do, because if you want to go out with me, you need to ask me by Wednesday, Thursday at the freaking latest.
[105:02] B: Oh, seriously, I can't stand that.
[105:04] A: Do you follow me? So this is what you want to do. You want to train them? There's a great book. I want you to get it. It's called the Rules.
[105:11] B: The Rules?
[105:12] A: Yeah, you can listen to it on audio. It's by Ellen. Fine. It's the rules for women I'm dating. And it comes from the 50s, but much of it applies to today.
[105:21] B: Oh, that's great.
[105:23] A: That will give you certain things that will help me.
[105:26] B: Yeah, because my dating things.
[105:27] A: And you're gonna notice what we've done shifts it. Because I'm not doing it for money. As soon as it comes up that it's for money, I know it's not the right guy. Yeah, that's my tell.
[105:40] B: Yep.
