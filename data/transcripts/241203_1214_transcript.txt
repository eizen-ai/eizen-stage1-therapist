[00:00] A: Okay, so today is the third.
[00:02] B: Yeah, yeah.
[00:04] A: Of December. And Heather, this is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful and valuable and transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes. Cool. So I get the stuff, and I get the stuff around loss and I get the heaviness, I get about that and I get even some of the guilt and self blame. So I follow you with that.
[00:34] B: Yeah.
[00:35] A: Right. What else would be useful for me to know? What else do we want to get better for you?
[00:45] B: I don't know. I don't get close to people. I don't trust anybody. I don't trust myself. You know, my childhood, a lot was bad, so I completely blocked most of it out. I don't even remember good memories, you know, and when people talk about family and stuff, you know, it sucks.
[01:03] A: Okay. So growing up stuff, there was lots of challenges.
[01:08] B: Yeah.
[01:09] A: With family of origin. So birth parents and the like. To the point that there's not a lot of access to remembering even good things.
[01:20] B: No.
[01:21] A: Okay. And then you said, I don't trust people, which I think is probably a good idea. I mean, I do because we don't live in a trustworthy world.
[01:31] B: Yeah.
[01:32] A: Right. To think that that person over there is always going to have my best interest in mind is stupid.
[01:37] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[01:38] A: They will when my best interest matches theirs. They won't when my best interest doesn't match theirs.
[01:45] B: Yeah.
[01:46] A: Right. We do want you to have more trust in you. Trust in your ability to discern, trust in your ability to see things more clearly. Right. And I get that you haven't had trust in you because you found yourself doing things or not doing things that either later on you wish you had done or wish you hadn't done. Got it?
[02:14] B: Yeah.
[02:14] A: So we want to get it so that you're more in alignment, so that you're feeling good as you're doing the things that you're doing. And when you look back at having done them in that way, you're glad you did.
[02:30] B: Okay. Yeah.
[02:32] A: Does that make sense? We want to get that organized. Okay, cool. What else would be useful for me to know? I don't know.
[02:48] B: I just want to stop reliving the past couple years, you know, playing in my head. You know, the drug use of jails, the prostitution, like. Yeah, that haunts me. I feel like I don't measure up, you know?
[03:02] A: Okay, okay. That's been so. Because of what you went through and because of some of the stuff that you did that kind of recirculates in your mind.
[03:14] B: Yeah.
[03:15] A: And then you feel bad.
[03:16] B: Yeah. About you add up to other people, you know, like it's hard for me to go to meetings to just share, you know, because people have more clean time. They all seem happy and they've done all this, you know, and the life's perfect now.
[03:31] A: They act like you think that the people are going to meetings, their life's perfect.
[03:35] B: That's how they act too. I know it's not.
[03:38] A: Okay, good.
[03:38] B: But.
[03:39] A: Cuz that would be pretend.
[03:40] B: Yeah. Just like with my son. I want to get closer to him. He's 10. I haven't seen him probably in 30 years. I talked to him on the phone, but like even going to events at his school, I don't know what to talk to the parents about because all my stuff is not going to be funny or stories, you know, to them. And it sucks, you know.
[04:03] A: So does that then mean, Heather, that there's a lot more self consciousness and not feeling like you're as good as. Or a measure up or as you don't feel like you're worth it?
[04:18] B: Yeah.
[04:19] A: Okay.
[04:20] B: I've been feeling like that a lot. Like it's like, why am I here? You know, I asked God, like, why did you take these people that I'm still here with? What am I here for?
[04:29] A: Just to. With you? Yeah.
[04:30] B: Yeah.
[04:31] A: That's what God set back, right?
[04:32] B: Yeah. It's like that's crazy. But that's how I think.
[04:36] A: No rhyming reason.
[04:37] B: Yeah.
[04:38] A: God was just like. Well, you know, I thought it would really. With you.
[04:41] B: Yeah, I think so.
[04:46] A: So funny, right? Yeah. So then the second part to that is we want you to be more at peace with what has happened.
[04:58] B: Yeah.
[05:00] A: Right. Because part of what's been going on with what has happened is it's felt like it's been a part of you. Yeah, right. Versus just things that have happened to me or things that I've done. Yeah, right. The. The language that we used to use with people who have had major bouts of trauma and awful stuff is we would say to them, what's wrong with you? As if like there's some sort of character defect, there's something wrong with them. The language has now changed and the new language is what happened to you. Because it's most likely what happened to you that has led you to do the things that later on you wish you hadn't done or to not do the things that later on you wish you had. Right. So you're not what you've done. You're not those past experiences. Those past experiences aren't you. They're not even a part of you. I know. That's what it's been feeling like. Right. But what if those past experiences aren't even a part of who you are? They're just stuff that happened in things that you've done which are not what you do. Which is a weird thought to begin with, to even think. Wait a minute. Of course I am what I do. But you know, you were working earlier.
[06:40] B: Yeah.
[06:40] A: And then you stopped and now you're here.
[06:43] B: Yeah.
[06:44] A: And you didn't stop being you when you stopped working, Right. So you're not what you do.
[06:54] B: Okay.
[06:55] A: Do you follow me with that? Because you're here and you're still you even though you're not working.
[06:59] B: Yeah.
[07:00] A: So when you stop doing one thing to do something else, you didn't stop existing, so you're not what you do. Then the other part would be, well, if you're not what you do, you must be how you feel. Except you feel different ways at different times, right. Sometimes you might feel down and depressed. Other times you might feel blah. Other times you might feel more joy. But you're still you, regardless of how you're feeling. So now we go. Wait a minute. I'm not what I do and I'm not how I feel. Well, then I must be my thoughts, which is the thing that we over identify with. Because what if you're not your thoughts? What if you have thoughts? They're your thoughts, but they're not you. And what's really weird is what if you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? Your brain is. And your brain is an organ, just like your heart and your lungs, meaning it's yours, not you. So now we go. Wait a minute. I'm not what I do, and I'm not how I feel, and I'm not my thoughts. Well, then I must be my body. But what if you're not your body?
[08:13] B: What?
[08:14] A: I know. What if you have it? It's totally yours, right? You're in it. Yeah, but it's not you. And I say that because my mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident when she was younger.
[08:24] B: Oh, wow.
[08:25] A: And when she visits people now, they don't say to her, hey, Susie, I'm glad almost all of you could come over. Right? She's all there. Even if that part of her body's missing.
[08:37] B: Okay. Yeah.
[08:38] A: Right. So you're not your thoughts, you're not your body, you're not how you feel, you're not what you do. Weird question. Then what the heck are you? Yeah, right?
[08:50] B: Yeah.
[08:51] A: So for our purposes, just think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something beautiful. Like the moment that you're looking at it, it's like captured your awareness. And in that moment you're like, wow, what is it that you see?
[09:08] B: My grandma's butterfly garden.
[09:10] A: Yeah. And isn't there a moment as you're seeing the flowers and the butterflies that you're feeling that sense of awe and wonder and peace and excitement? And people would tell you, heather, of course, being there and experiencing that is going to give you those kinds of feelings. But if we looked at it differently, we could say that being there and experiencing it simply drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited? In the same way, if I've got a candle and the flame is burning and I take my hand from up here and I start moving it down closer to the flame and I say, holy shit, this flame is getting hotter. Is the flame getting any hotter or am I becoming more aware of the heat?
[10:05] B: You're becoming more aware of the heat.
[10:07] A: Right. So we know that in your life, with all of the experiences, there have been many, many times. Upsets, angers, hurts, guilt, griefs, pain, shames. Where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Yeah, but what if always at your center you're peaceful and excited? Isn't that cool? And so what we tend to do as human beings is we feel like there's something that's missing.
[10:32] B: Yeah.
[10:33] A: Right. Where I'm not enough. So I feel like I need something over there to make me feel okay in here.
[10:39] B: Yeah.
[10:40] A: And it still doesn't because it's never gonna come from over there. See, what if the mistake take has been that I'm just not connected to the light at the center? That's me. What if when I've gone through difficult, awful, yucky, troubling experiences, those experiences slammed in and have been blocking my access to who I really am?
[11:13] B: Thought of it that way.
[11:14] A: Right. And that what we're wanting to do isn't trying to get this to feel an empty void in here. What if I'm already full and what's been making me feel that I'm not is all of the gunk that's been in the way of me connecting to who I really am? Isn't that interesting?
[11:34] B: Yeah.
[11:35] A: Right. And that's what we want you to do, is connect to more of who you are, which isn't your past or. Or those experiences or those things that you've done or the things that happen to you or even how you feel. Who you are is much more than all of that. And none of that is you. It's just stuff that you've gone through. Right. Even your body isn't the same. Meaning every cell within your body has been replaced millions and millions and millions of times. Like your feet are longer than they were when you were three.
[12:12] B: Yeah.
[12:12] A: Yet despite the changes, you're still you.
[12:15] B: Yeah.
[12:15] A: Right. Interesting.
[12:17] B: Right.
[12:18] A: Right. So what we want to be getting to is where we're headed, which is a you who's a lot lighter and much more at peace with what has. That what she's gone through doesn't define who she is. It's just stuff that's happened. So the you that I'm seeing is much more at peace with what has happened and is a lot lighter and is feeling more free. So that what she's doing are the things that make sense for her to do so that when she does them, she feels good. And when she thinks back about having done it, she's glad she did. The impact of the weight of the stuff that's happened, both the recent stuff and the longer time ago stuff that's been completely cleared and gone so it's no longer weighing on you, meaning the effect that it's continued to have. It doesn't run that in you anymore. The internal programming has been updated so you're more okay in you. This is where we're headed.
[13:36] B: Yeah.
[13:37] A: Got it. You don't have to see the future you just like I do. Because that's not the question. The question isn't how it's gonna happen that we get you here.
[13:47] B: Yeah.
[13:48] A: The question is, would it be okay?
[13:50] B: Oh, yeah.
[13:51] A: Right. And with it, okay, we've got a green light. With the green light, we want to get your body into the right states for healing, which are states of rest, colds, flus, and surgery. We tell people to do the same thing, which is rest. Got it. So we're going to do the same thing by getting your body into a state of rest. But how we do it is we use brain levers. So really interesting neuroscientists, they're the game changer for effective treatment because they have put people in what are called FMRI machines. So basically they're a scan of the brain and they can see what's happening in the brain while they're doing interventions. So one of the things they discovered is that there are levers that put the body into a state of rest. And the first lever is you slightly lower your jaw. So not like ah, but just a little bit. When you slightly lower your jaw, it activates a nerve called the vagus nerve, which comes out of our brain and connects to all of the vital organs in the body. And that when the vagus nerve is stimulated, it starts to put our body into more of a rest state.
[15:11] B: Really?
[15:12] A: Yeah. So what you're going to do is you're going to slightly lower your jaw. Second lever is you're going to rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. And so kind of think of it that as my jaw is relaxed and lowered, I'm relaxing the back of my tongue, which causes it to just rest at the bottom of my mouth. The third lever is you're going to breathe, but it's an intentional breath. And the breath is going to be a little bit slower and deeper than normal on the way in. A pause, a little bit longer than normal on the way out. So go ahead and slightly lower your jaw, relax the back of your tongue so it's resting at the bottom of your mouth and begin to breathe. That's right. A little bit slower and deeper in, and then a little bit longer on the exhale. And just notice what starts to happen inside as you're breathing in. This slightly slow, slower and deeper way in and longer on the way out. Isn't that interesting?
[16:25] B: Yeah.
[16:26] A: Right, then we want to add the next lever. Because when we're in states of high stress or angst or upset, or when we're at the effect of troubling experiences, it literally tunnels our vision. Ever heard the phrase tunnel vision? So it literally puts these blinders on, kind of like horse races. You ever seen one? Horses have blinders. The only way they work is that they put them on behind the horse and come this way. Yeah, because you couldn't do it this way because a horse would be like, what is that? We also have them and they narrow our focus when our brain waves are up in that highly elevated beta. Tunnel vision. That's where all the angst, upset, anger, agitation, guilt, grief, shame, upset, live. We're bringing your brain waves down into the lower end of beta and into the higher ends of alpha. Alpha waves are what's correlated with surfers calling it flow states or athletes calling it being in the zone. So think of it. I'm both Alert and aware, but relaxed. And it expands and opens my vision so that I notice more with my peripheral vision, the sides of my eyes. So how it works again is you slightly lower your jaw. You relax your tongue so that it's resting at the bottom of your mouth. You breathe in a little slower and deeper out a little bit longer. Right. As you're breathing in this way way, you can look across and see me in my nose. You're going to stay looking at my nose as you continue to breathe in this way, you're going to see my fingers continuing to breathe. Stay looking at my nose as my fingers move out so that as they get all the way out with the sides of your eyes, you can see my fingers wiggling. That's right. You're aware of more of the space in the room. And notice that as you are now, you're able to pick up more of the space towards the side windows and doors. Right. Noticing the space between you and me, the space beyond me. Right. You can stay looking at me. Notice the space underneath where you're seated. You don't even have to look. You can just sense it. Right. This time you can't look. Notice how much space there is behind your head towards the wall. Right. How much space there is above your head towards the ceiling. And as you're starting to notice more of the space, check inside your body. How's your body feeling now?
[19:09] B: Relaxed.
[19:10] A: It is relaxed. Right. And then the last little one. Have you ever heard the phrase, maybe even uttered it yourself? I'm under a lot of stress.
[19:19] B: Yeah.
[19:20] A: And in order for somebody to be underneath the stress, where must the stress be? Well, that's where it feels. Right. But listen to it. Literally, I'm under a lot of stress. I'm under the table. Flip it around. If I'm under it and it feels. Feels like it's a weight on my.
[19:51] B: Chest, on top of me.
[19:53] A: Yeah. So we know that the reversal is to get out from under it and to rise up above it. Having the opposite metaphor, a bird's eye view. What does that mean? I'm up above. I'm seeing. Everything is being underneath and below me. Just like a bird.
[20:15] B: Yeah.
[20:16] A: Right. But not a perch bird. A bird that's able to fly and soar through the space of the sky. So one more time, your jaw is slightly lowered. You're relaxing the back of your tongue. You're breathing a little slower and deeper in a little longer. On the way out as you are, you can see my nose, my fingers. Stay looking at my nose. With the sides of your eyes, you pick up the wiggling. You notice more of the stick space in between and all around you. And me underneath and above, behind and beyond. As you're noticing more and more of the space, you also know that the space goes beyond the room. Literally all the way out to outer space and beyond. That's how much space there is. Got it. Close your eyes for just a moment and imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body. Beyond the stealing in the roof so that you're way up above it all in the sky. Having this bird's eye view, you're able to see everything is being underneath and below you because you are above and over it. And just like a bird, you're free to soar and glide and fly and move through the space of the sky in any direction in all sorts of different ways with big wide arching turns. You soar, you fly, you glide, you move. You're free. That's right. Bring awareness back down and into your body. Take a big deep breath in and then exhale. Right. And in those short moments, eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself?
[22:00] B: Felt free.
[22:01] A: You did. Yeah. And as you're feeling free, free, the other part of your brain, your unconscious, will travel back down the timeline. That's right. Of those negative experiences, recent or long time ago. And it's going to narrow and pinpoint a particular moment that would be useful for us to unplug and heal. Right. So as we're organizing towards the you becoming more free and at peace and. Okay. The other part of your brain, your unconscious, travels back and picks a moment. What moment comes to mind?
[22:47] B: When my parents divorced.
[22:49] A: Uh huh.
[22:50] B: It was really ugly.
[22:52] A: Yeah. So that was an ugly moment.
[22:55] B: Yeah.
[22:55] A: And you were about howled.
[22:59] B: Six.
[23:00] A: Six. What's the experience? Because that probably had more than one experience to it. What's the experience that comes to mind?
[23:09] B: Fear.
[23:10] A: Well, that's the feeling that comes to mind. Right. So what's the experience? You got the experience. Good. So how we unplug something really simple only requires one thing. That's for you to intend to be with me here right now. The reason you want to be here with me, Heather, is that this is the thing that's happening and that isn't. 2. We're working on a goal that we both want for you. 3. Being with me, I'm hoping, is at least a little more fun than that sucky moment. Oh yeah, got it. And if that happened when you were seven, there have been many things later in your Life that you've done that were more enjoyable than that. What's one thing, anytime from when that was over until yesterday that was more.
[23:54] B: Fun than that moment when I took my son to Busch Garden for Christmas.
[23:58] A: You're going to Busch Gardens with your son? That was more fun than that. Good. Something else.
[24:02] B: Going shopping yesterday?
[24:03] A: Yeah, going shopping yesterday. And one other thing.
[24:07] B: Getting sober.
[24:08] A: Yeah, getting sober. All those things happen after that moment. There's a part of the brain, when that moment happened, that froze it. Meaning there's a part of the brain that doesn't know that moment ended. So what's really crazy to consider is we're not troubled by the awful stuff that happened because it happened. We're troubled because when it happened, emotionally, the brain froze it. And where it froze it, that part of the brain doesn't know it ended. I survived it. I made it through it. I'm okay. So where therapy got it wrong is they said you've got to process and get the bad feelings out of you.
[24:52] B: Yeah.
[24:54] A: We want to do the reverse. We want to get the good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know that awful moment ended. We want to unplug the memory so emotionally, your brain is able to experience it as data about something that happened versus happening. Okay, Got it.
[25:15] B: That makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? Yeah.
[25:17] A: Yeah. Right. So as we're organizing towards the future, you. When that one happened, you were seven. Right. And you're gonna intend to be with me as you tell me what happened. My job is to keep you here. So you would come home from school. Right. And it was like, afternoon.
[25:41] B: Yeah.
[25:41] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[25:44] B: My mom and was moving out.
[25:47] A: So mom had been packing stuff up.
[25:49] B: Yeah.
[25:49] A: And, like, you had seen that, like, stuff was in a car in a U Haul, or. Yeah, Right. And that was weird.
[25:55] B: Yeah.
[25:55] A: Right. So you, like, you came in and mom was packing. Right. Then what happened next?
[26:01] B: We. She was so scared of my dad coming home and finding it.
[26:05] A: Right. So she's like, we got to get out of here before he gets home.
[26:07] B: Yeah.
[26:08] A: Right.
[26:08] B: And then we moved in with her.
[26:10] A: She was like, right. So you grabbed all this stuff. She grabbed all this stuff. You got in the vehicle you guys drove.
[26:15] B: And she said, this is my new girlfriend I'm leaving your dad for.
[26:18] A: Right. Good. So. Oh, she was there.
[26:20] B: Yeah.
[26:20] A: By the way, this is the gal that I'm leaving dad for. Right. Good job, good detail. And then you and her and the other gal got in the car and left and drove to that gal's house.
[26:30] B: Yeah.
[26:31] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[26:33] B: My dad got really mad and tried to come find us.
[26:36] A: Right. So dad was angry, called her, tried to figure out where you were. Right. Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[26:45] B: I said, this is your new room. And pretty much my mom said, food for yourself.
[26:52] A: Right. Mom said that to you?
[26:54] B: Yeah.
[26:55] A: She said, here's your new space, and you're gonna need to take care of you.
[26:58] B: Yeah.
[26:58] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[27:01] B: She. She moved in a drug dealer, and they started partying.
[27:05] A: Well, that was later.
[27:06] B: Yeah, that was the same day.
[27:08] A: Same day. All right. So then another guy moved in.
[27:10] B: Yeah.
[27:11] A: With her and the girl.
[27:12] B: Yeah.
[27:13] A: Right. And they started partying. Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[27:16] B: I was alone.
[27:17] A: Right. Well, then what happened?
[27:19] B: I didn't see my dad after that.
[27:21] A: Notice how the movie stops at the shitty spot?
[27:23] B: Yeah.
[27:25] A: Isn't that interesting? Right. But then what happened later is you took your son to Busch Gardens.
[27:31] B: Yeah.
[27:31] A: Right. And then you went shopping.
[27:33] B: Yeah.
[27:33] A: Right. And you got sober.
[27:34] B: Yeah.
[27:34] A: Right. Now, notice as you were describing, what happened there was that discomfort, not because that was such a sucky moment, but because your brain was confusing the memory, thinking it's the sucky moment. Got it?
[27:50] B: Yeah.
[27:50] A: Now, what's crazy about our brain is we only go forward with memories. We never go backwards. But when you go backwards with a memory, it literally unplugs the memory, takes away the charge. So we're gonna go backwards.
[28:03] B: Okay.
[28:04] A: So we've got, you know, getting clean and sober. Yeah, Right. We've got. Going shopping. Yeah, right. We got. Taking your son to Busch Gardens. Right. Then before that, you hadn't seen dad. And then before that, you were by yourself. And before that, they started partying. And then before that, you guys. She'd shown you the room that you were going to be in. Then you guys had gotten over there. Right. Then dad was, like, upset, and then you guys had left. And then she said, here's the gal that I'm moving in with and leaving your father for. Then they had been. Well, you had gotten there, and then they had been packing, and then you had come home from school.
[28:42] B: Yeah.
[28:42] A: And then before that, you'd been at school. And then before that you'd gone to school.
[28:45] B: Yeah.
[28:46] A: Right. As we ran through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it? I know. Isn't that crazy?
[28:54] B: Yeah.
[28:54] A: Right. Because your brain is beginning to experience it as data about something that happened not happening. Third, emotionally, the brain doesn't get logic but it does get patterns of association. And the error is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening have been glued together. So the memory is being experienced as if it's happening. But there are things that you can remember doing today that you know you're not doing right now. For example, putting on your sneakers.
[29:33] B: Yeah.
[29:33] A: You can remember doing it even where you were when you did it. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your sneakers on, and then I went, heather, stop putting on your sneakers. You would look at me and go, I'm not putting on my sneakers. Because you know, there's a big difference between the memory and the experience. Got it?
[29:54] B: Yeah.
[29:55] A: You can remember coming home, mom saying, we're out of here, here's who we're moving in with, and I'm leaving. You can remember them bringing the guy over, and then you can remember all that happening. You can also remember putting on your sneakers.
[30:08] B: Yeah.
[30:08] A: Yeah. So Heather, stop putting on your sneakers. Say, I'm not putting on my sneakers. Well then stop me from putting on my pants. Say you're not putting on your pants. Well then you stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants. Well, stop mom from moving you in with that gal. Say she's not doing that.
[30:24] B: She's not doing that.
[30:24] A: Well then stop them from using there. See, that's not happening. Right. So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. Right. As that starts to get in, what do you notice happening to those feelings?
[30:41] B: They're not so bad.
[30:43] A: Right. Lastly, that earlier you felt like some of that happening was about me. Cuz if I mattered more, or if she loved me more or, or, or then she wouldn't have done that. Got it?
[30:57] B: Yeah.
[30:58] A: But as we're looking at it, clearly mom doing that, moving out, being with that gal, did that have anything to do with you or anything to do with her lack of love for you? No, it had to do with what? Her being a little fucked up then.
[31:15] B: Yeah.
[31:16] A: Right, because mom was a little fucked up then.
[31:18] B: Yeah.
[31:19] A: Follow me with that.
[31:20] B: Yeah.
[31:21] A: You didn't know that, right? When we're seven, we don't really get even. If we get that our parents have stuff going on, we really don't get it in the way we know it now as an adult. Right. You didn't know that mom wasn't well, mom had her own stuff going on. Mom and dad had their own stuff going on. And that none of that had anything to do with you. Or your lovability or heck, even their love for you had everything to do with whatever was going on with them. Yeah, Got it. But you didn't know that then. Right? So I want you to repeat these four words after me. Here we go. It's not about me.
[32:00] B: Me.
[32:00] A: Right. It's not about me.
[32:01] B: It's not about me.
[32:02] A: Right. One more time.
[32:03] B: It's not about me.
[32:04] A: Now close your eyes. Picture that earlier you letting her know that that moment is over. Finished, completed, defeated. It no longer exists. Let her know that that happening had nothing to do with you. It's not about me. Had everything to do with mom not being well. It's not about me. Let her know, by the way, that you didn't need mom to be well in order for you to turn out okay. Right. In order for you to take your son to push gardens, in order for you to get clean and sober. Right. As this starts to get in. What are you noticing now? Yeah. Isn't that a nice feeling? Yeah. Right. So notice what's changing. Notice how that's not making you feel bad like it did. So what we're doing is we're changing the way that that information had gotten coded in your brain, so it's now information about something that happened that wasn't about me. Where before it was being experienced as happening and meaning a lot about me. Got it?
[33:20] B: Yeah.
[33:20] A: Notice how that's changing?
[33:22] B: That's cool.
[33:23] A: Isn't that cool? Right? Right. And that's just a little bit of a sample of what we're doing together. Because what we're doing is we're changing the way that your brain has certain things coded and wired so that you get to feel more the way that you want to feel. Right?
[33:52] B: That's cool.
[33:53] A: Right? Because we could think of it also in a slightly different way that I'm pretty sure. And you can check that your guy who died with an odd isn't wanting you to feel like it was your fault. Right. Like at one level you can realize that he's not like, thinking, gosh, I hope every time she thinks about me, she feels it was her fault.
[34:19] B: No.
[34:19] A: Right. A guy that you care about, that cares about you is not going. You know what? I really hope every time she thinks about me, she's feeling awful.
[34:27] B: Yeah. You wouldn't want that.
[34:29] A: Right? Got it. So we know that at one level, but those moments, again, just like this other one gets stuck. So where they're stuck, that moment then re lives itself or gets re experienced as happening. Right? And it doesn't Matter what I know, where I'm logical, if it's on, where I'm emotional, nothing that I know ever gets in. And the second piece to that one is because it was bad. What we learned when we were little children is good happens when I'm good. Therefore, bad only happens if I was bad or did something wrong. So what gets layered into that moment is, well, yes, that was bad. And so somehow, because it was bad, it had something to do with me, it was somewhat my fault. I should have known better, or I should have been there, or I should have prevented him, or I should have had Narcan, or I should have. Whatever it is, right? There's all sorts of options that I can come up with, right? You know, like come up with all sorts of alternatives to pass shit. You follow me with that?
[35:41] B: Yeah.
[35:42] A: And what we know is that we're wanting you to be free, and so does he. Right? And where we get stuck sometimes, Heather, is that if I'm no longer feeling bad, then it somehow means that they don't mean what they mean to me. Like, I had a girl one time, her grandfather kind of, like, raised her, so he was like her dad. And she was in so much pain over him passing. And I asked her, I said, would it be okay for you to be okay? And she's like, no, no, I'm always going to be hurting. I went, huh? I go, what does that mean, that your grandpa was a sadist? And she's like, what? No, my grandfather never wanted me to be hurting. Interesting. So your grandfather never wanted you to be hurting, yet you're hurting when you think about your grandfather, who never wanted you to be hurting. And your hurting is your proof to the world how much Grandpa means to you. That's why you're still hurting, right? Because if I'm not hurting, then they may not have met what they meant. And he meant everything to her. Right? I go, but your grandfather never wanted you to be hurting. So your grandfather, when you think of him you're hurting, is out of your love for your grandfather. However, it's not serving you or him, meaning you're not better off hurting, and neither is he. Make sense? She's like, whoa, I never thought of it from that lens before. I'm like, well, just try it on for a moment right now, checking in. What are all of the other ways that you can be loving Grandpa? That has nothing to do with your hurting? Because what do we want her to have access to is the experiences that she acquired in being with Grandpa, which the cool Thing about experiences is that you can't ever lose them. You might lose access to them, but you can't actually lose them. On the flip side, you can't lose something that you never had, because if you never acquired it, how could you lose it? So that's where the question of loss goes really weird. If I can't lose those moments that I acquired and I can't lose what I don't yet have, then where's the loss? And that's what I started thinking about. And I went, wait a minute. What if when people's bodies stop working because, you know, we're not our body now, what if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, it's that their bodies stop and they're no longer in need of it, so they exit it, right? Have you ever touched a body that wasn't alive? Notice how it feels different because they weren't in it anymore. We just didn't know it in the moment that who they are wasn't their body to begin with. Who they are is the light at the center, Just like what you became aware of as you're seeing the butterfly garden, right? And the light that is you, it doesn't go anywhere, right? I remember a woman telling me she had it in a really hushed voice. She says, my parents, they're in my closet. Your parents are in your closet? No, no, no. The remains of my parents. And I'm like, but that's not even what remains of your parents. That's what remains of their body. What remains of your parents is in the experience that you acquired in being with them. You can't lose those, because Einstein said that who we are is energy plus matter equals the physical, touchable existence. And what became the second law of thermal dynamics is that energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. So when the body stops working, it's not that they stop, it's that the body stops. They exited. We don't pick them up in the same way we did, but it doesn't mean they're not here. We had the representation of heaven being above the stars and sky, which means far, far, far away. But what if heaven is not so far away? What if it's in a different plane that we don't pick up? With our limited five senses, right? We can see, hear, taste, touch, and smell. But the scope is limited because the dog can smell more things than we can, and the bird can see more things than we can. And you and I can turn the radio on in the car and all of A sudden start listening to music, but the radio waves are right here, right now, and I don't feel any of them. Do you?
[40:31] B: No.
[40:32] A: Right. So that when people's bodies stop, it's not that they stop, it's that their bodies stop. It's always the shock of having known them in their body that's been blocking access. Got it.
[40:46] B: Yeah.
[40:47] A: So how's that moment? Think about how you found out with him? You're aware and what happened. So how did you find out that he OD'd?
[40:57] B: His mom.
[40:58] A: So you're aware when that happens. Where are you?
[41:01] B: I'm a rehab.
[41:02] A: So you're at a rehab place. Right. Like at First Step. Okay, so you're at First Step. Right. And you guys had been using together.
[41:10] B: Yeah.
[41:10] A: Right. And then you got something that had you go to rehab.
[41:13] B: Yeah.
[41:14] A: Right. And then you're there. Right. And then they called First Step, and then you had, like, one of the counselors come to you and say, hey, there's a call for you.
[41:22] B: Yeah.
[41:23] A: And then you went into their office.
[41:24] B: Yeah.
[41:24] A: And sat down. And then they hand you to the phone. And his mom says, he's not with us anymore. Right. He. He's not with us anywhere. Od. Right. Couldn't. Then what happened next?
[41:36] B: I started crying.
[41:37] A: Right, you started crying. Right. And then what happened next?
[41:40] B: I missed him.
[41:41] A: Well, then what happened? Well, what happened next is you probably got off the phone.
[41:44] B: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[41:45] A: Right. And then you probably walk back to wherever you were, and then that part of the moment ended. And then later on, you did something more fun. Like go shopping.
[41:54] B: Yeah.
[41:54] A: Or get clean and sober.
[41:55] B: Yeah.
[41:56] A: Right. Got it. So again, we got getting clean and sober. We got going shopping, and then you were off to the other bar, and then you left the office, and then you were crying. Well, then you'd gotten off the phone, and before that you were crying. Right. And then she had told you, and then you had gotten on the phone with her, and then they had walked you to the office, and then they had told you. And then before that, you were in some sort of group or doing something.
[42:18] B: Yeah.
[42:18] A: Right. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was.
[42:23] B: Was different?
[42:25] A: It's different. Right? You can remember her calling you and telling you that. You can remember putting on your stuff. Sneakers.
[42:30] B: Yeah.
[42:30] A: Yeah. Well, Heather, stop putting on your sneakers. Hey, I'm not putting on my sneakers. Well, stop her from telling you that. Say she's not telling me that. Well, then stop that from happening. Say that's not happening. Well, you stop putting your Hair in a pony. Say, I'm not putting my hair well stop it from happening. What's not happening? So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Right. And as that earlier you had been getting that information, she didn't know what you and I know now that when his body stopped, it doesn't mean that he stopped, it's that his body stopped. And the reason that you haven't been accessing who he is for you isn't because he's not here. Because the place that he's never left is right here. And really proud that you're clean and sober, don't you think?
[43:13] B: Yeah.
[43:13] A: Way excited. Because, like, you get to live a better life. And maybe a little bit in honor of him.
[43:20] B: That's what he wanted.
[43:21] A: You follow me with that? I remember. I remember working with a soldier whose buddy died, and that buddy had had a family and he didn't, and he thought it was really unfair and how come it wasn't me and I was in the same seat, but I just had changed and, like, the whole thing.
[43:35] B: Yeah.
[43:36] A: But as we got things cleared, he went, oh, right. What he wants for me is for me to have a good life. And me living a good life is in honor of who he is, is say, I'm wondering if there's any better way that you can honor him other than you being clean and sober and having a better life. Got it. And that earlier, you, who is getting the call doesn't know that he was never his body in the first place. That's right. And we want access to more of who he is for you, which is in the experiences, which is what you have the time going. So close your eyes again. Picture that earlier. You just after getting that call, let her know, of course, that moment is over, finished. That experience no longer exists. Right. Let her know that he was in his body so that she gets it right. Let her know that who he is is never left you because he's right there at the heart. Right. And that you're living and having a good life is in honor of how much he means to you.
[44:43] B: I'm living, having a good life in honor of what he means to me.
[44:47] A: Right. Right. Let her know about getting clean and sober. Let her know about going shopping. Let her know about working to get reconnected to her boy. Let her know so that she gets it right. As all of this starts to get in again, what do you notice happening in you?
[45:02] B: Coming.
[45:03] A: Yeah. And so as you're calming, you just slightly lower your jaw and you relax. Your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper, and you open up awareness to notice more space. Whether your eyes are opened or closed doesn't matter. Just notice that you're aware of more space. That's right. And as you're aware of more space, check in with your body. How's your body feeling now?
[45:34] B: Not so bad.
[45:35] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[45:36] B: Yeah.
[45:37] A: So we're on our way.
[45:38] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[45:40] A: Right. Because as you think about those two moments that we just did, as you check in thinking about them now, what are you noticing in here?
[45:49] B: We're at peace.
[45:50] A: You are. Right. Connecting to more of who you are. Light and peace. Yeah.
[46:00] B: That's cool.
[46:01] A: Yeah. And then when we get back together, we'll be together for a little bit of a longer period of time so we can get the rest of this stuff cleared up.
[46:08] B: Yay.
[46:09] A: Makes sense.
[46:09] B: I like you.
[46:10] A: Yay. Me too. You did great today.
[46:13] B: Thank you.
[46:14] A: You're welcome. Come with me. We'll go out here.
