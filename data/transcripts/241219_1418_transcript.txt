[00:00] A: So today is the 19th of December. Natalie and Lauren, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you both know that given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, then the recording might be made available and teaching and training other professionals, and I want to make sure that's okay with you. Okay, cool. So what I'm interested in, first, I'm going to give you. I'm going to give you an understanding of why the prior things can continue to haunt us even though they're over. So the conventional wisdom of therapy is that when we're going through a really difficult experience, we're not able to fully express how it was making us feel in that moment. And so the thought process was, is that we repressed it, we pushed it down, we buried it, we locked it behind closed doors, we shoved it in the closet, we put it on the carpet, and. And that therapy is to help us dig up those bad emotions, process them, and get them out.
[01:04] B: Okay.
[01:04] A: That's therapy. We're not gonna do that because, you know, after throwing up, I do feel a little bit better, but I still get triggered by the same stuff. So what if we're not troubled because what we went through was awful?
[01:18] B: Which.
[01:18] A: I know that sounds weird, too.
[01:20] C: Yes.
[01:20] B: Right.
[01:21] A: But what if we're troubled because when we went through it emotionally, part of our brain short circuited? So at that deeper level, not logical level, but emotional level, that part doesn't know whatever I went through ended. I totally do. That part doesn't. So if I broke my arm when I was 11 years old and I were to tell you both about it right now, and I'm as emotional as when it first happened, you're gonna look at me like I'm crazy. This guy arm is all over the place. It's fine. Why is he so upset?
[01:53] B: Right?
[01:54] A: On the flip side, if I told you about what my uncle did to me when I was 11 and I started to get emotional about it, you both would be like, well, yeah, of course. But why? Why does the physical wound heal and the emotional wound doesn't?
[02:11] B: Right.
[02:12] A: We have the saying that time heals all wounds.
[02:15] B: Right.
[02:15] A: That happened 40 years.
[02:16] B: What?
[02:17] A: How am I not. Why am I still. Isn't that weird? So that's why I'm saying the reason that it hasn't healed yet isn't because it can't. It's because part of the brain doesn't know it ended.
[02:30] B: Right?
[02:30] A: So instead of trying to get it out, what we want to do is we want to get the good News in to the part of the brain that doesn't know that it's over. Think of it more like we want to unplug the memory so the brain can actually experience it as data about something that happened versus where it's been stuck inside of me as happening. Does that make sense? Okay, second part to that, we tend to look at life from the lens, that it's those circumstances, that stuff, those things that made me feel the way.
[03:06] B: That I'm feeling, right?
[03:08] A: So when that person did that thing, it made me feel this way. When that person said that stuff, it.
[03:12] B: Did this to me.
[03:13] A: Well, I did that thing, so now I feel that way, right? Like it's the circumstances, situations and things in life that cause feelings. That lens is not wrong. It just gives us very limited power because from that lens we have two choices. Work hard to change it. Why do we work hard to change it? If I can't change it, try to get the hell away from it. Which is pretty much how most of us deal with difficult stuff. But you've already discovered that there's some stuff that I can't change and other shit I can't completely get away from, and then a whole bunch of bad stuff that I can't get that stuff to have not happened.
[03:48] B: Got it?
[03:49] A: Yes. So we need to do something else. That's where I get to come in. Because my job is about adjusting how that back brain, the automatic, unconscious, emotional brain, reacts and responds to the stuff. The current, the past, the future. So a sillier example would be when a lion approaches a zebra, we would all be in agreement that the lion is now making the zebra scared, Right? I don't disagree with that either. But if we looked at it from a different lens, we could say that it's actually when the zebra itself sees senses, feels, smells, thinks lions coming, that it's actually the zebra's brain, not the lion, that's immediately making all of the zebra alert, motivated, stronger. We call that scared. And yes, it runs away. And of course, the brain of the zebra is doing it to the zebra in response to the lion approaching, but it's the zebra's brain that's doing it.
[04:50] B: Make sense?
[04:52] A: So from this a little bit of an unusual lens, we're going to say the same thing, that there's been ways in which your brain has been working that's been causing you to feel bad.
[05:02] B: Right.
[05:03] A: By bad or meaning sometimes that angst, or sometimes the flashback, or sometimes the bad memory of a dream or the.
[05:09] B: Right.
[05:09] A: Your brain might do all of that. Kind of stuff to you in response to stuff current, past, future. But you recognize that way of your brain working has been problematic. That's the issue that's on the table for us to get addressed so that it stops doing that to you. Make sense?
[05:28] C: Yes.
[05:28] A: And your brain. So if we look at it from the lens that your brain makes you feel bad. First question. Do you really think your brain wants you to feel bad? No, it does not want you to feel bad. Do you think it would want you to feel good?
[05:42] C: Yes.
[05:42] A: No. No. See, that's the problem. See what we've learned in working with thousands of people over time. You're a bright gal. I'm a pretty bright guy. But the majority of our brain emotionally works more like the brain of an animal.
[05:58] B: Okay.
[05:59] A: And an animal doesn't have an emotion because the brain of the animal is concerned about the animal's mood or its affect, or how it feels about itself, or its level of self esteem or self worth, or self confidence or self love. It causes emotions for animals for three reasons. Motivate the animal to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. It's literally that simple. So when the squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire, the brain of the squirrel will immediately cause all of the squirrel to experience the pain. Not because it wants the squirrel to hate itself for being a stupid idiot and getting too close to the fire. Now it's marred. All the other squirrels are gonna laugh and I'm never gonna fight a mate, Right? That's not why it's causing the emotion. It's causing the emotion to motivate the animal to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem.
[06:54] B: Right?
[06:55] A: Rabbit sees fox.
[06:56] B: Boom. Fear again.
[06:58] A: Not because it wants rabbit to have a bad day, but to motivate it to run really fast away. So what if all the negative emotions that us human beings experience, the hurt, the anger, the sadness, the grief, the guilt, the shame, the regret, the remorse, the angst, the upsets, the worries, the pains, what if they're also all caused by the part of our brain that works like an animal and for the same purpose in us? To motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. And the major error in our human brain is, is that many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. Have you ever noticed we tend to feel bad about the same kinds of things over and over and over again? Good news. Many of the things that we feel bad about are either A, in time periods that are already finished, or B, in time periods that haven't happened yet. So we don't need to solve the problem. We need to update the timing. Timing is the biggest malfunction in the human brain because we have an additional component to our brain that gives us access to time. That's why, you know, you're sitting here now with me. But you can remember doing something earlier this morning. You can think about going and doing something this weekend. Did you know that no other animal can do that?
[08:20] B: No.
[08:20] A: They don't have future or past. They're always now. Isn't that weird?
[08:25] B: Right?
[08:25] A: So that doesn't become a problem for us human beings when the experiences are positive or even when they're neutral. Because when it's a positive experience or a neutral experience, our brain distinguishes the difference between the memory, the experience, right? An example would be somebody's telling us about a wonderful trip that they had to Key West. And when they were down there, they rode on the little mopeds, they got their picture taken next to the sign that says 90 miles from Cuba. They walked up and down Duval street, they bought some trinkets and souvenirs, they ate blue lobster. They tell us about the experience and they had a great time. But you and I both know that they know the difference between remembering being there and actually being there, right? That's totally clear. The problem is when the experience is negative, right? And it doesn't matter whether it's a big negative or a little negative. It doesn't matter whether it happened a long time ago when I was just a young child or the other day. It doesn't matter whether it was a one time occurrence or multiple occurrences over decades. Any negative experience, weird, bad, sad, awful, scary, confusing, upsetting, horrific, catastrophic, traumatic. Our brain has a tendency to confuse the data and memory, thinking it's the experience. That's why the person has the emotional response. So this guy starts telling us about how 20 years ago when he was in Chicago, he got mugged, right? He gets to the part where the guy's got him by the collar, there's a knife blade at the side of his throat and his face has gone white. His voice is choked up, his arms are trembling and shaking, he's got a tear. We're nice people, we were kindly listening to him. What the heck is happening with him? And what do most people say?
[10:15] B: He's what, reliving it, Right.
[10:21] A: But what's actually happening is part of his brain is confusing the memory, the data, thinking it's the experience. That's why he's having that reaction. We can totally tell it's affecting him as he was talking to us because we saw it all over his body. But it was also affecting him even over the weekend when he was watching his kid play littleweek. It was under the surface, up here at a logical level. He knows even when he's telling us that he's safe, that he survived, that he's okay, that there's no knife. The problem is there's still a part of his brain that doesn't know the awful moment ended. Does that make sense? So that's the first part that keeps all that stuff stuck. Second thing is, when we're little children, we're lied to. Did you know that little kids are lied to all the time by the people that they trust? So you know, parents, society, culture, all lie to little children. You know what the big lie is?
[11:26] D: Santa?
[11:26] A: Well, that's a big lie.
[11:27] C: I was gonna say that.
[11:28] A: Right? Santa is a big lie. Right? Totally big lie, right. But it even is beyond Santa. It's good things happen when you're being good. Because we want our kids to grow up to be good boys and good girls. So we lie. We tell them that the good things happen when they're good. And every TV show, movie, story engineered for children reinforce the same message. Good happens when you're good, right? Once a year, right around this time, somebody comes, drops off, presents because they're good. So all the good things happen because I am good. Which is great for that child if everything in their life is good. Unfortunately it's not. And see the problem or the error isn't that we lied and told kids that life is good. It's that it means that the opposite has to be true too. If the good things happen because I'm good, it means that the bad things only happen because I must have done something wrong. The bad thing happened because I shouldn't have been there. I did something wrong, it was my fault, I should have known better. Like all of that gets stuck in the same way. Does that make sense? So think of like the 6 year old's parents get divorced, Dad's not in the picture anymore, that kid doesn't know it's a mom and dad issue. But dad's gone, kids feeling if I was more lovable, if daddy cared, if I mattered, he would be here. So it feels like dad not being there, something to do with the kids lovability. We both know, all of us know that that's not true. Make sense if the girl who's, you know, 29 goes out on a date with one of her co workers best friends, they had a great time, but it's not kind of her guy kind of guy that she wanted to be with. But you know, he dropped her off and they had a nice conversation. She thought maybe I could be friends with this guy. And before he's leaving he's like I'm so sorry.
[13:14] B: Right.
[13:14] A: They're outside, I need to use the rest, would you mind? And she's not going to be a jerk about it. So yeah, sure, go ahead and use the restroom. Now she had no idea that when he came out of the restroom he was going to force himself upon her and rape her. Which is a horrible, horrible, horrible thing. But see, nobody's shocked when she's blaming herself for being so stupid and careless and putting herself in that awful situation. She definitely should have known better. We're on the outside going, what, you let him use your bathroom? You talking about right? It was your co worker's really good friend like, Right. But because it was bad, notice how what gets tied into it is it feels like it's about me or my fault or on my worth or lovability, that kind of thing. So that's the second thing that keeps all that stuff stuck make sense?
[13:54] C: Yes.
[13:55] A: And then what our brain does is the third thing is that it is on a hyper vigilant super sensitive scanning mode searching for anything that's similar to anything that I went through that was painful. But similar gets read as same. So the most dramatic example is the guy diving on the ground when the firework burst in the air. But it's not that he didn't know he was at a fourth of July party. He's the guy that lit the firework. It's that a different part of his brain confused the sound and thought it was a grenade. That's why he had that reaction. Make sense, right? The guy's making out with the gal. He's totally into her. She's totally into him. She's touching his inner thigh and he does this and he's like what is wrong with me? The girl who I'm into is touching me in a way that should feel good. And I. Yeah, but is there any similarity to what his uncle did to him when he was 11?
[14:47] B: Sure.
[14:47] A: It's a hand on his inner thigh. Yeah, but that was grubby man hand. This is dainty female. It doesn't matter, it's hand.
[14:53] B: Right.
[14:53] A: So similar can get confused as identical and it could Be something that wasn't even a part of the problem.
[15:01] B: Right.
[15:01] A: I remember somebody that I worked with not too long ago, and she got raped by a guy wearing a Taylor Swift shirt.
[15:07] B: Right?
[15:08] A: And you know, again, awful.
[15:10] B: Right?
[15:11] A: And not a good time to not be into Taylor Swift. I mean, she's everywhere and in all things. And gosh, right now, of course, the troubling part of the experience with the guy was not the name on the T shirt. That is not the part of what happened that bothered her. But because they co occurred, it got merged.
[15:28] B: Right.
[15:29] A: So location can do that. Oh, well, I drove by that hotel. That was a reminder of the hotel. Like any of that kind of stuff, our brain confuses. Similar. Same.
[15:38] B: Got it.
[15:39] A: Now, those three pieces have one common denominator, and that is they're all based in distortion. And what that means is if I take my hand and I slam it into the sand and I pick it up, it leaves an imprint of my hand. But we all know in here that the imprint that it left is not the same thing as my hand.
[15:56] B: Right.
[15:57] A: Is the meaning at all what happened? Was she being stupid and careless, or did she let the guy use her bathroom? How different is a firework from a grenade? Really different things.
[16:09] B: Right?
[16:10] A: So that's what we mean. We want to turn the lights on and get the good news in to the parts that don't know certain things have ended. Any questions about that? Okay. So we spoke briefly on the phone, but my opinion, nobody would care about any of the difficult stuff that they've gone through. Nobody would care about it if it wasn't negatively affecting now.
[16:37] B: Right.
[16:38] A: So the reason that we want the effect that that stuff has had gone is because you get that it's been affecting you now. So the question starts to become if that stuff was no longer affecting you and you weren't having those night terrors or those reminders didn't put you into that state and it was no longer causing all that disruption in you. Like, if that's not happening, how would you actually be happier? Happier. Okay. What's it like? How you feel? Happier for you. What's it like? Like, how else would you be?
[17:17] C: I just feel like if that stuff.
[17:19] A: Wasn'T running you, I like.
[17:24] C: I don't know. I'm not having the words come in my mind right now. I just feel like I just. I don't know. I just feel like I won't. I just feel like I'll just be happier. I won't have, like, the. Like, the fear would be gone and I won't have, like, everything won't, like, remind me of all the bad stuff. I just feel like I would be kind of, like, free.
[17:47] A: You'd be kind of like, free, right?
[17:49] B: Yeah.
[17:50] A: Yeah. What's it like when you feel free and happier?
[17:54] C: Yes, exactly.
[17:55] A: Oh, when you're free, you feel happier. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. So, one, we want you to be free.
[18:04] B: Okay.
[18:04] A: I can get behind that. Okay. Two, I'm thinking we want you to be more at peace and okay in you. Three, I'm thinking we probably want you to be a little bit lighter because I might think, and you didn't say it out loud, that there may be a tendency to be down and hard on you about stuff.
[18:22] C: Yeah.
[18:25] A: So we'd like you to lighten up a little bit. Don't you think, so that you're more okay in you.
[18:32] B: Right.
[18:32] A: We do want you to be free from the effect that that stuff has had, so you're more at peace. We also want you distanced from it so that you've got more space to maneuver in the current situation that you're going to be encountering.
[18:47] B: Right.
[18:47] A: Because we're not done with interactions. Am I following you with that? Like, isn't that what, like, we may have court or other stuff going on at some point with that? So given that we're not done with interactions, how do we want you to actually be when you have those interactions?
[19:01] C: I just. I want to be where I'm not phrasing up because that's like, one of the biggest things.
[19:05] A: I just freeze.
[19:06] C: I dissociate. And.
[19:08] A: Yeah, and if you weren't, which is a really good idea in that moment when it was troubling, was to not be in your body and go somewhere else. I mean, that's an adaptive feature. I don't know whether you knew that or not. And I'll give you the. The example. Two of them. So think of predator, prey chasing, Right? Rabbit is running for its life, trying to get away from the fox, right? And it's running and it's running and it's far enough away from the fox, but it's realizing it doesn't see any exit routes. It doesn't see any ways to get away. And so it has the realization in that moment that its death is inevitable. There will be a moment where that rabbit will stop and the body of the rabbit will be completely still. It'll be moments before fox ever pounces on it. And in that moment that the body is completely still, the life force takes rabbit away. So it doesn't have to be in the body to experience that.
[20:02] B: Right.
[20:02] A: What's really common for people who've had violence, abuse, sexual violence, all sorts of other things like that happen to them is that they developed a superpower of not having to be in their body to experience all of it. Most people will remember the first time, maybe not remember all the middle times, maybe remember the end time, but they don't remember all the times because they weren't in their body because there was nothing that they could do to get it to stop. So they got taken away, and then when it was over, they got brought back. You follow me with that? So we like to get it so that you stop freezing. Yeah. So that in those moments, you feel more settled and grounded in you, more solid and secure in you.
[20:44] B: Right.
[20:45] A: So that you have more of your voice when you need it.
[20:50] B: Right.
[20:50] A: And the discernment as to when it makes sense to use it, because we don't want somebody to have their voice all the time. I mean, we want them to have their voice all the time, but we don't necessarily want them to express it all the time because there are certain moments that it might not make sense to do. You follow me with that? So we want the freedom to have it, but we also want the discernment as to where and when we do it. Yes.
[21:12] B: Yeah.
[21:12] A: Got it. Okay, cool. How else?
[21:15] B: Right.
[21:15] A: So, like, we got it that where we're headed is a you who's free. And we know that when you're free, you're happy.
[21:21] C: Yes.
[21:22] B: Right.
[21:22] A: We want you to lighten up on you. We want you to be more at peace. We want the effect that that stuff has had gone in those moments that you're dealing with, current stuff. We want you to feel more distanced from it. We want you to feel much more settled and comfortable in your own skin and that you have access to your voice so that you can use it in the moments that it would make sense to.
[21:46] B: Cool. Okay.
[21:48] A: That's how I'm seeing you when we're done. Okay, Sounds great. Good. Okay. And the coolest part about it is you don't have to see the future you as clearly as I do. Because my question for you, Natalie, isn't how it's going to happen. It's more, would it be okay with you? Yeah. And see, isn't that cool? Because just by describing how we want you to be, and it's okay with you, we're already on the way to it.
[22:15] B: Right.
[22:15] A: Nobody would want to get in their car and Start driving, and then three hours from now, I'm going to tell you where to go. I'll stop.
[22:22] B: Right.
[22:24] A: Instead, we need to know where we're headed and that it's okay now that it's okay and we know where we're headed and we have an understanding of stuff we want to do processes that are designed to put your body into the right states for healing. And the right states for healing are always states of rest. It's. Why, if somebody's got a cold or after surgery or if they've got the flu, what do we want them to do? We want them to rest.
[22:51] B: Right.
[22:52] A: Because that enables the body to do the internal healing. So we have some really cool levers that are designed. Oh, by the way, before I go into that, is there any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know?
[23:07] C: I don't know. I'm trying to remember, like, everything that I told you on the phone.
[23:11] A: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that part.
[23:13] C: But I just. I feel like I. Well, I think I've pretty much expressed everything.
[23:20] A: Yeah, yeah. And there may be things that may tie into stuff that doesn't have anything to do with him. And if those things pop up too, we'll get those cleared as well.
[23:30] B: Right.
[23:30] A: Because, I mean, might as well. I mean, we're here. Got it. So if you put your body into a state of rest, we have really cool levers that neuroscientists discovered by putting an FMRI scan on people's brains. And the first lever is the silliest lever of all. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. So I don't mean like, ah. I mean, just a little bit. When you slightly lower your jaw, it activates a nerve called the vagus nerve. It is a brain nerve, only one cranial nerve that comes out of the brain, and it connects to all the vital organs in our body. And it's very key in putting our body into more of a resting state. Got it. So the first thing you're going to do is you're going to slightly lower your jaw. Drink some water. Yeah, there we go. Good.
[24:23] B: All right.
[24:24] C: This is hard for me to do stuff like this because I'm not sure. Like, laugh.
[24:28] A: Well, laughing will be great. I mean, we're dealing with really heavy, difficult stuff. Don't we want to be laughing? I. I guess I do.
[24:36] C: It's gonna be hard to do that with my jaw when I'm like, laughing.
[24:39] A: Maybe. Although you have no idea what we're actually gonna be doing. You only know one Part Okay. Right. Which you might laugh, which would be fine because we want you to be in a more resourceful state. You know, I deal a lot with stuff that's heavy and I would like to be light about it. Why make it heavier?
[25:00] B: Right.
[25:01] A: And the hard part is the stuff that you already went through. So the easy part is getting the good news in that it ended. Should be a lot easier. Supposed to be.
[25:11] B: Right?
[25:11] A: You already did the hard part. Right. So you slightly lower your jaw. The second lever so perfect. You relax your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. So it's kind of like you relax the back of your tongue and your tongue just rests at the bottom of your mouth.
[25:26] B: Right.
[25:26] A: So it's like this.
[25:29] B: Right.
[25:30] A: The third lever is you breathe. But how you breathe is just a little bit slower and deeper than normal. Then when you exhale, the exhale becomes a little bit longer than the inhale. So you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth and you begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper than normal and then out a little bit longer.
[25:54] B: Right.
[25:55] A: And you'll start to notice that as you're intentionally breathing a little bit slower and deeper on the. You're doing fine. This is so perfect. This has nothing to do with being self conscious. Or does it have everything to do with being self conscious? Isn't that an interesting thing? Isn't that part of what we want to get better too?
[26:15] C: Yes.
[26:15] A: That hard, negative down, critical. And also angst in other situations about what others might be thinking or whether I'm going to do that thing that goes on. That's what's going on right now. Right? Exactly. I know, I know. You know, that's the perfect part.
[26:30] C: You're looking right at me and having to like do all this. It's hard. I'm.
[26:34] D: I'm lowering my tongue as he's saying this.
[26:36] C: So I am right there with you. I will.
[26:39] D: I will be your puppet.
[26:40] A: I will win it. Okay?
[26:42] C: Okay. Okay.
[26:45] A: It's so perfect though. Right?
[26:47] B: Right.
[26:48] A: Cuz this is weird and different and it creates some self consciousness. Cuz like what if I don't do it right?
[26:55] C: I'm not worried about that. Justifying anxiety. It just makes me nervous, I guess when like people are like looking around at me. No, it's fine. It's just.
[27:02] A: I'll do it with my eyes close.
[27:04] C: No, it's fine.
[27:05] D: You're confronting it by itself.
[27:08] A: See, here's the cool.
[27:09] C: And usually when that, when stuff like that happens, I laugh. Which is perfect because I get like nervous.
[27:16] B: Right.
[27:16] A: It's like laughing at a funeral. Not because it's funny, but because I'm really uncomfortable.
[27:21] B: Right.
[27:22] A: I mean, that's why people laugh at funerals. Not because they think the funeral's funny, but they're so freaking uncomfortable that they laugh and then people look, which makes them even more uncomfortable because they just laughed at a funeral.
[27:34] C: Yeah. Makes sense.
[27:37] A: But when you acknowledge it and it's there, then it stops having power over you.
[27:41] C: Okay, I might drink some more water.
[27:49] B: Okay.
[27:50] A: Yeah. And the other part is, the only person that can screw the process up as me.
[27:55] C: Okay, I like that.
[27:56] B: Right.
[27:56] A: You can't possibly do it wrong. You've never done it. So as long as you look over at me and I look like I'm doing fine, we're going to be good. If you look over at me and I don't look like I'm doing well, then you guys can excuse yourselves. Just tell the office stuff. Tony needs to help him in there. I'm pretty sure we're going to be okay.
[28:14] B: Okay.
[28:15] A: Yeah.
[28:15] B: Yeah.
[28:16] A: So you slightly lower your jaw. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, Right? And you begin to breathe just a little bit slower.
[28:26] C: Can I close my eyes?
[28:27] A: I can close my eyes too. We'll both close our eyes, right? And just notice that you can cause your breath to happen in a different way than how you naturally breathe.
[28:39] B: Alright.
[28:40] A: It's a little bit slower in, it's a little bit longer out, and you might even begin to notice something beginning to happen inside.
[28:52] B: Right.
[28:55] A: Just check inside Right. Now, Natalie, how's your body feeling? Like, is it more tense or more calm?
[29:01] C: More calm.
[29:02] A: Isn't that cool?
[29:03] B: Right.
[29:04] A: So the next lever you can open your eyes for this one is when we're highly stressed, anxious, agitated, irritated, uncomfortable, we're in what we call highly elevated beta waves. Beta waves in general are fine because it's what we're in for waking states. So it's good for conversation, focus, communication, arithmetic. But when the beta waves get elevated and run at a much higher hertz, that's where all the anxiety, agitation, irritation, frustration hangs up. Where we all live and what it literally causes is it causes our vision to narrow and tunnel. Have you ever heard that term, tunnel vision?
[29:43] C: Yes.
[29:44] B: Right.
[29:44] A: What we want to do is we want to. And that way if I'm in tunnel vision, right. I don't see things over here. I don't see them until when they're right there, which would make me have more angst.
[29:56] B: Right.
[29:57] A: So we're going to move your brain waves down into what we call alpha waves. So high level alpha, low end of beta alpha waves are correct. Correlated with what surfers call flow or what athletes think of as being in the zone. So think of it as both being aware and alert, yet relaxed at the same time.
[30:20] B: Make sense? Yes.
[30:21] A: And how we're going to do it is we're going to expand awareness so that you notice more with your peripheral vision. So again, you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You breathe a little bit slower and deeper in. That's right, a little bit longer. On the way out, notice that you can look across and see me in my nose. You're gonna stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers. Stay looking at my nose as my fingers move out so that with the sides of your eyes you can pick up out here, my fingers wiggling. Notice as you do this, you're becoming more aware of the space in the room.
[31:02] B: Right.
[31:03] A: Like the space between us, the space towards the side windows and doors.
[31:08] B: Right.
[31:09] A: The space underneath the space that's beyond me, the space behind you, the space above your head. And once again, as you're becoming more aware of the space, check in your body. How's your body feeling now? It is more relaxed. Right. And then have you ever heard the phrase, maybe even said it yourself, I'm under a lot of stress. And in order for somebody to be underneath the stress, where must the stress be? Yes, but we want to think of it literally. So if I go underneath something, where is whatever it is that I went under in relationship to me? Well, if I crawl under the table, where is the top of the table in relationship to me? Above me.
[32:06] B: Right.
[32:07] A: So when somebody says to you, I'm under a lot of stress, where's the stress? Because they're under. I know that sounds crazy to think of, but it's literal in terms of how our back brain hears things. So we know that a solution would be to get out from under it and rise up above it, having a different metaphor, a metaphor that we call a bird's eye view. And what does a bird's eye view mean? I'm above. I'm able to see. Everything is being underneath and below me because I'm above and I'm over, it all make sense. Not just a perched bird, though. Think of a soaring bird that's able to move through the space of the sky in any direction.
[32:52] B: Right.
[32:52] A: In all ways. So you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You breathe intentionally, a little bit slower and deeper in. That's right. A little bit longer on the way out. As you're breathing in this way, you see me in my nose. You see my fingers. My fingers move all the way out. So sides of the eyes pick up the wiggling. You notice more space, the space that's in this room. But you also know that there's space beyond the room and that the space that's beyond the room goes all the way out in every direction.
[33:28] B: Right.
[33:28] A: It's unending towards outer space and beyond. That's how much space there is. Isn't that crazy? So much space and space is the thing that we disappear because we don't ever see it.
[33:38] B: Right.
[33:38] A: But it is the thing that's between us and around us. Isn't that cool? As you're noticing the space for a moment, close your eyes. And then imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof so that you rise way up above it all in the sky. Imagine having this bird's eye view of seeing everything as being underneath and below you, because you are above and over it all. And just like a bird, free to soar and glide through the space of the sky and move in any direction, making these big, wide, arching angles. You turn, you soar, you glide, you fly above. You're free. That's right. When you're ready, bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you. Take a nice slow and deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes.
[34:46] B: Yeah.
[34:47] A: And in those short moments, eyes were closed, what were you noticing within yourself?
[34:53] C: I mean, just calmness.
[34:55] A: A calmness. Isn't that a nice feeling? Yeah. So I'm going to explain to you next. How do we unplug the impact that something has had? It only requires one thing from you. Do you want to know what it is? Okay. You want to intend to emotionally be here with us. The reason that you want to intend to be here with us is that this is what's happening and that shit isn't. Two, are working on the goal that we both want for you.
[35:27] B: Right.
[35:27] A: And three, I'm hoping to be at least a little more enjoyable than sucky moments. Got it. Two, when we go through it, we're gonna go through it really fast. So in a minute or less, and just the facts. So it would go, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened. And it was done. Okay, got it. We're gonna focus on. On a moment Right. Notice how there's more than one moment when we do it. We only focus on one at a time. Make sense?
[36:00] C: Yes.
[36:00] A: Easier to do if you have to deal with ants. You only want one ant to come in at a time, not a thousand. Got it?
[36:08] B: Right.
[36:09] A: And then three. Some of those things have happened at times other than now, which means there have been things you've done after those things that were more enjoyable, where the brain freezes it. It freezes it and doesn't have access to anything you've done later in life that were more enjoyable than it. So we want to get that good news in. Does that make sense?
[36:32] C: Yes.
[36:32] A: Okay. Any other questions?
[36:37] C: No.
[36:37] B: Okay, cool.
[36:38] A: So we're going to do the same thing. You slightly lower your jaw, you relax the back of your tongue. You're doing great. See? It's gotten easier, hasn't it?
[36:47] C: Yes.
[36:48] A: Isn't that cool? See, the coolest part about working with the nervous system is the nervous system learns through recursion. So gliding on the natural tendencies of the nervous system brings in neuroplasticity and recursion. So when you do something more than one time, your brain gets more familiar. It becomes easier and easier to do.
[37:07] B: Right.
[37:08] A: Isn't that cool?
[37:09] B: Right.
[37:10] A: And then it also begins to deepen the mind's responsiveness, because that's what we're really increasing. Is that back brain or your unconscious becoming more responsive to you so that it naturally works in the way that you want it to? I mean, that part of your brain really wants to work in ways that are best for you. It's the thing that's beating your heart and breathing for you. It's the thing that when you're driving in the car and a bug splats the windshield, it's closing your eyes, Right. It's out for what's good for you. The problem is that a complicated machine like our brain has glitches and errors. And if it's got dinged or kicked or punched or dropped or it's not going to work as well until it gets tuned up. Does that make sense?
[37:54] C: Yes.
[37:54] A: Okay, cool. So go ahead and slightly lower your jaw. Relax the back of your tongue.
[38:00] C: Okay.
[38:00] A: Drink water. Water is good. Everybody drink a sip of water. And I'm going to see if I can make this a little bit cooler. Got warm. Oh, there we go. It's always weird because different times of year in this building, things are different. This building has four air conditioners.
[38:21] C: Does it really?
[38:21] A: It's the weirdest thing. One for the back wing, one for the Side wing, maybe two. And then there's one that's the front and this side, I'm like, why is that one do more than the rest of. It's just here.
[38:35] B: Whatever.
[38:35] A: I didn't build the building.
[38:38] D: If they get tinted windows, that will help.
[38:40] A: They are tinted, are they? Oh, yeah. They got tinted way long time ago. So it might not be working as well, but still.
[38:48] C: Can you feel the heat?
[38:49] D: Yeah, but I like it. I think that's in any building, wherever the sun hits in a certain time. Time of the day where it gets more hot.
[38:54] B: Yeah.
[38:55] A: My favorite thing is, as the time goes, this thing opens up only at this time of year where then a beam of light goes across. And if somebody's sitting in that seat, they're like, there's light in my eyes the whole time. So it's funny. Let's say you might want to sit over there, and then you won't have it.
[39:11] B: Yeah.
[39:12] C: Okay.
[39:12] B: Yeah.
[39:13] A: So how's your body doing now?
[39:15] C: Good.
[39:16] A: It is good, isn't it?
[39:17] B: Yeah.
[39:17] A: So you slightly lower your jaw.
[39:20] B: Right.
[39:20] A: You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth.
[39:23] B: Right?
[39:23] A: Because it's silly and fun.
[39:25] B: Right?
[39:26] A: Because we want to be silly and have fun.
[39:29] B: Right.
[39:29] A: Because we're way more fun than that was. And we don't set the bar very high. We don't have to be a lot of fun to be more fun than sick moments. Got it. So with your jaw lowered and you're resting your tongue and you're breathing like you are, notice that you can open up to more space. As you're opening up to more space.
[39:49] B: Right.
[39:50] A: Notice what starts to happen right inside.
[39:54] B: Right?
[39:55] A: Go ahead and close your eyes. And you'll notice that with your eyes closed, you don't see me for Lord, you don't see what's out in front of you, but what you actually see is just the backs of your eyelids.
[40:08] B: Right?
[40:08] A: And when I see the backs of my eyelids, different hues of colors, dark or light.
[40:13] B: Right.
[40:14] A: Go ahead and open your eyes. Notice that again as they're open, you see us. You see what's out in front of you, Right. Close your eyes again and notice that you no longer see what's out in front of you, but you're actually seeing just the backs of your eyelids. And so an interesting or curious question might be, without using your memory or your imagination. Imagination. Natalie, what do you actually see behind you? See, it might surprise you that what you actually see behind you is nothing. You see nothing behind you. And I wonder what it would be like to just For a moment, drift at nothing. Write in no thingness.
[40:58] B: Right.
[40:58] A: Just noticing what you're noticing in nothing on your way to becoming free.
[41:07] B: And.
[41:08] A: Much more okay in you and lighter, bright and clear and distanced. All of this stuff can happen without you having to do anything at all. Because your unconscious has direct access to the control panels of your brain. Knows exactly which buttons to press and knobs to turn and levers to shift and switches to flip to reorganize your brain so that it becomes more optimized to work in ways that are best for you. And all of it gets to happen as you rest. And so when you're ready, you can find your way back out of nothing and into now.
[41:52] B: That's right.
[41:54] A: And then as you are here now, go ahead and take a nice, slow, deep breath in. And then exhale. And when you're ready, you can open your eyes. Yeah. And how's your body feeling now? It is relaxed. And so as your body's feeling relaxed, your unconscious is going to travel back down the timeline. Mind of moments of sucky. Moments of things that happen that we don't like to talk about. Because whenever we do, we feel yucky. It's going to begin to group and categorize those things, and then it's going to narrow and pinpoint and bring a particular time to your awareness for us to unplug and clear. Got it. What particular moment comes to mind? Oh, you got one. Perfect. That one that just came to mind happened how long ago?
[42:46] D: July 2023.
[42:48] C: July 22, I think the one was I I. Yeah, it's twice.
[42:53] A: You got one. Doesn't mean it has to be that one.
[42:56] B: Could be that one.
[42:58] A: But you got a moment that came to mind.
[43:00] B: Right.
[43:00] A: And notice how you're there. I don't want you to be there. I want you to be here. Notice how you thought about it for a moment, and you went there. I want you to be here.
[43:06] B: Hi.
[43:07] A: So. And just check. I watched and I saw that you did. Got it. So whose job is it to keep you here?
[43:17] B: My job.
[43:18] A: Got it. Your job is just to intend to be here.
[43:21] B: Right.
[43:21] A: If I notice you not being here, I'm gonna go. Come here. Be here. Be here with us. Lauren and I are nice people. We're way more enjoyable than that was. Got it. So if that happened In July of 23, there have been many things you've done.
[43:37] C: 22Nd, I think. Yeah.
[43:39] D: Was it the year 23?
[43:43] C: It was July 22, 2023, yeah.
[43:46] A: Okay. So in July of 23, on the 22nd we got the specific date. Good job.
[43:51] B: Right.
[43:53] A: So given that that happened, then there have been many things you've done after that that were more fun than that.
[43:57] C: Oh, yeah.
[43:58] A: What's one thing you've done anytime from when that was over until yesterday that was more fun than that?
[44:03] C: I don't. The first thing that comes in my mind is like, I'm going to Legoland with my kids.
[44:06] B: Yeah.
[44:07] A: Going to Legoland with your kids. Way more enjoyable than that moment.
[44:09] B: Good.
[44:10] A: Something else.
[44:12] C: Just being around my kids, like doing something.
[44:14] A: What?
[44:15] B: Like just.
[44:16] C: I don't know, just everything. Just taking them to the park.
[44:19] A: Yeah. Go to the park.
[44:19] C: Fun things.
[44:20] B: Right.
[44:20] A: What's one other thing that you've done, maybe not have to do with kids after that that was more enjoyable than that?
[44:25] C: I don't really do anything. It's more of like everything. I feel like it's with kids sometimes. Exercise. Not enough.
[44:31] D: You said you like that, that class.
[44:33] C: I do.
[44:33] A: Oh, what class?
[44:34] C: One time, though, I forget what, what is it called?
[44:36] D: Body Combat.
[44:37] C: Combat class.
[44:38] A: No, you went to Body Combat. That was more enjoyable than that moment. That's right. So all of those things happen after that moment. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond that moment. So we have good news to get in.
[44:52] B: Okay, got it.
[44:53] A: So when that moment happened, July 22 of 23, when it happened, you were where?
[44:59] C: Where was I when it happened?
[45:01] A: Yeah.
[45:01] C: At my house.
[45:01] A: So you're at your house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[45:03] C: Nighttime.
[45:04] B: Nighttime.
[45:04] A: And you're where, in the house?
[45:06] C: In the bedroom.
[45:07] A: So you're in the bedroom. Good. And, like, are you sitting on the bed, laying down?
[45:10] B: Standing right here.
[45:14] A: Be here.
[45:14] B: Hi.
[45:14] A: Notice how you're there. Hi. Be here.
[45:15] B: No.
[45:16] A: We're both way more enjoyable here. I promise.
[45:19] C: I meant, like, when it first happened.
[45:21] A: Yeah, that's what we're doing. We're going through the moment.
[45:23] B: Yeah. Right.
[45:24] C: Okay, so I.
[45:25] A: So you're in the bedroom.
[45:27] C: Yes.
[45:27] B: Right.
[45:28] A: Are you on the bed or standing? Standing. Standing.
[45:30] B: Right.
[45:31] A: Standing on the bed.
[45:32] C: Standing by the bed.
[45:33] A: We were jumping. We were playing monkeys on the bed. One fell off and bumped his head.
[45:37] C: No. Standing by the bed.
[45:39] A: So you're standing by the bed.
[45:40] B: Right. Good.
[45:40] A: And then what happened next? Be here.
[45:43] B: Hi.
[45:44] A: Hi. Here.
[45:45] B: Right, Right.
[45:45] A: This is way more fun.
[45:48] B: Right, Right.
[45:50] A: So then what happened next? He might have done what? Or he was there. He came in the room.
[45:53] C: I don't think I'm like, really there. I'm trying not to go there. I think is what it Is. Is that like. It's not.
[45:58] A: I know. That's why I keep pulling you back. I know. That's why I keep pulling you back.
[46:02] B: Right.
[46:03] A: Because you've never not. Not gone there when you thought about it. But you have somebody that wants you here. Why do we want you here, by the way? Do you know? Because this is right and that isn't.
[46:16] C: Yes.
[46:16] A: Two, we got the mutual outcome. Three, I'm more fun. So is Lauren. But we're more fun than that was. And the only reason that you're still bothered by that, truly, is that that part of your brain doesn't know it's over. You survived it. You made it through it, and you're okay. Because there were moments when it was going on, Natalie, that you weren't sure you were going to be okay. Do you follow me with that? There were moments that I wasn't sure I was going to make it through it. What do we know with certainty given that you're sitting here now? Yeah. You did. You made it through it, didn't you? Right. So as it was going on at that earlier, you knew that she was going to make it through and be okay.
[47:00] B: Right.
[47:00] A: She didn't know that she was going to make it through and be okay.
[47:03] B: Right.
[47:04] A: But you do. Wouldn't it be nice for her to know? Yeah, that's what we want to get in. Is that kind of good news? That's why we're going through it.
[47:11] C: Okay.
[47:11] A: Makes sense.
[47:13] B: Yeah.
[47:14] A: So you're in the bedroom. It's nighttime. You're standing next to the bed.
[47:17] B: Right.
[47:17] A: Then what happened next? Did he come into the bedroom?
[47:25] B: No.
[47:25] A: Here.
[47:25] B: Hi.
[47:26] C: I'm sorry.
[47:28] A: Notice how you're going there. Penoki here.
[47:30] B: Hi.
[47:31] C: Okay.
[47:31] B: This is.
[47:31] A: That is okay.
[47:33] B: Right? Right.
[47:35] C: So he was.
[47:39] A: So he might have been yelling.
[47:41] C: He was. He was screaming.
[47:42] B: Yeah.
[47:42] A: So he was screaming as he came into the bedroom or was already in the bedroom.
[47:45] C: It's been a long time since I thought about it all.
[47:47] A: I know. Right. So here's the coolest part. You can make up what you think might have happened because it'll be structurally similar enough to clear. So he came into the room. He's yelling.
[48:00] B: Right.
[48:01] A: That was kind of scary.
[48:02] C: He was drunk.
[48:03] A: He was drunk and yelling. All right, so he's stumbly in yelling.
[48:07] C: Very angry.
[48:09] B: Right.
[48:10] A: Angry. Saying mean things.
[48:11] C: Very forceful.
[48:13] B: Right.
[48:13] A: How you doing right now?
[48:15] C: Okay.
[48:16] B: Hi.
[48:16] A: Come back. Right, Right. Because check. Where are you? I'm here.
[48:20] B: You are. Right.
[48:22] A: Isn't this a comfortable place to be sitting? Yes. Right. With two nice people.
[48:27] B: Right.
[48:28] A: You're not there.
[48:29] C: No.
[48:30] B: Right.
[48:30] A: He's not drunk.
[48:32] C: Not anymore.
[48:33] A: No, not then.
[48:34] B: Now.
[48:35] A: I mean, he was then, but not now.
[48:37] B: Right.
[48:38] A: That was then. This is now.
[48:39] C: Okay.
[48:40] A: You're here. That was then.
[48:43] B: Right. Hi. Right.
[48:45] A: So he's yelling. He's drunk.
[48:46] C: Yes.
[48:46] A: He's saying mean and hurtful things.
[48:48] C: Yes.
[48:48] B: Right.
[48:49] A: And then what happened next?
[48:51] C: He wanted to have sex.
[48:52] B: Right.
[48:52] A: So he wanted to have sex, you know, because he's yelling and drunk, and that's what people would want to do at first.
[48:58] C: I agree.
[48:59] A: You're like, okay, fine, sure. Whatever.
[49:00] C: I knew it would be bad if I did.
[49:02] B: Right.
[49:03] A: It would be easier to get it done with.
[49:04] B: Right.
[49:05] C: But I saw in his eyes that he was going to be really mean and hurtful.
[49:12] B: Right. Good.
[49:13] A: So you're like, I don't want to do this.
[49:16] B: Yeah.
[49:16] A: So I don't want to do this thing. Right.
[49:17] B: Good.
[49:17] A: Then what happened next? Be here. Hi. Notice how you're going there again.
[49:21] C: Hi.
[49:21] A: You're so good. Hi. Now you're getting back here. We're gonna pause as many times as we need to to keep you here.
[49:26] C: Okay?
[49:27] A: Okay. Because the key thing is here, we're getting in really good news. As you intend to be here, what starts to happen is the memory starts to get unplugged. So your brain can experience what happened as data about something that happened versus where it's been in you. Still happening. You're doing great. I'm so proud of you.
[49:49] C: Okay.
[49:52] A: Right. So then you're like, I don't want to.
[49:54] B: Right.
[49:55] A: And then what happened next? He said it didn't matter what you wanted.
[49:59] C: He just kept calling me names.
[50:01] B: Right.
[50:01] A: So he called you mean and hurtful things.
[50:02] B: Right. Good.
[50:03] A: And then what happened next?
[50:04] C: I'm gonna do it.
[50:04] B: Right.
[50:05] C: Do it.
[50:05] A: That's right. So then he grabbed you.
[50:08] B: Right.
[50:08] A: And he might have, like, pulled. Pulled clothes off.
[50:12] C: I remember him pushing me on the bed.
[50:13] A: Right. So he might have pushed you on the bed.
[50:15] C: He started taking the clothes off.
[50:17] B: Right.
[50:17] A: Taking clothes off.
[50:18] B: Right.
[50:18] A: And pushing on the bed.
[50:19] B: Right.
[50:19] A: And then he might have put his penis in your vagina or your butt or your mouth or whatever he did.
[50:25] B: Right.
[50:25] A: Be here. Hi.
[50:26] B: Hi.
[50:26] A: Hi. Notice are you there again?
[50:28] B: No.
[50:28] A: Be here. I want you to be here on my.
[50:33] B: Right. Hi. Hi.
[50:34] C: Hi.
[50:35] B: Hi.
[50:36] C: It's hard for me to talk about those little details, too. It's just. It's.
[50:41] A: This isn't my first rodeo. I've done this a lot.
[50:45] C: I know, but it's just. I don't do this a lot. Talking about it.
[50:49] A: No shit. That's why we're doing it a totally different way than you've ever done it before.
[50:53] C: You're doing awesome.
[50:54] A: You are.
[50:55] B: Right?
[50:56] C: Right now I feel like I'm doing awesome. I feel like I'm getting stuck a lot.
[50:59] D: But you're not.
[51:00] A: You're here again.
[51:01] C: Okay.
[51:02] A: Aren't you?
[51:03] C: Yeah.
[51:03] B: Yeah.
[51:03] A: Check it out. What color couch are we on?
[51:06] C: Red, maroon?
[51:08] B: Maroon. Red. Yeah.
[51:09] A: Like that.
[51:09] B: Right.
[51:10] A: Do you know what the walls are called?
[51:12] C: Beige.
[51:12] B: Yeah.
[51:13] A: You know what color they call that? Sherman Williams.
[51:16] C: I don't know what?
[51:17] A: That's that Way Safari. Because we have a lot of African stuff here, right?
[51:21] B: Yeah.
[51:22] A: We have a whole room in the back that's got African masks all around it, which is really fun. But we figured, you know, when you're going to decorate someplace and you're going to be in it for a period of time, you want art that lasts the test of time. Because 10 years from now, this stuff doesn't look dated. Do you know why? I have the monkeys.
[51:40] C: I really like the monkeys.
[51:41] A: Isn't that one cool? That's my favorite one.
[51:43] C: Like, when I felt nervous. I've been looking at. Is a really cool lamp.
[51:47] A: Isn't it? Such a cool lamp. But the monkeys are here to remind me, you know, when you deal with people. Not my monkey, not my circus.
[51:54] C: I really like it.
[51:57] A: Just keep looking at the monkeys. It's a great anchor.
[52:00] B: Right.
[52:00] A: Because that'll remind you to be here. Because this is where the monkeys are. Yes. They're in this room. Not in your bedroom. You don't actually have this in your bedroom, do you?
[52:07] C: No.
[52:08] A: No.
[52:08] B: Right.
[52:08] C: So it's here.
[52:09] A: It would be really cool.
[52:10] B: Right.
[52:11] A: But you didn't have it in your bedroom back then when he was doing that. No. But you have him here because you're in a different room. That's right. Good job.
[52:18] B: Right.
[52:19] A: So then he had taken clothes off, and then he pushed you down, and then he might have done what? He might have put his penis in different spots.
[52:30] C: Okay.
[52:33] A: Well, he would have done whatever he did.
[52:35] C: Yes.
[52:35] A: Right.
[52:35] C: So I just remember him going like. I remember him, like, pulling. I remember him pushing me on the bed.
[52:41] B: Right.
[52:42] C: I remember him going around.
[52:43] A: That's right.
[52:43] C: On the other side of the bed. And I remember him grabbing my hair.
[52:46] B: Right, right.
[52:47] A: And that hurt.
[52:48] C: Pulling me towards him.
[52:49] B: Right.
[52:50] C: And. And he.
[52:55] B: Right here.
[52:56] A: Hi. All right, check it out. Is he doing that right now?
[53:00] C: No.
[53:00] A: Are you sure?
[53:02] C: No. It really does feel like.
[53:04] A: No, check it out.
[53:05] B: Watch.
[53:05] A: I know.
[53:06] B: Watch.
[53:06] A: That's the coolest part. Check it out right now. Is your hair being pulled? Don't feel it.
[53:13] B: No.
[53:13] A: He's not doing it, is he?
[53:15] B: No.
[53:16] A: Isn't that nice that he's not doing it? You could probably even run a comb through your hair.
[53:22] B: Right.
[53:23] A: You might get snarls every once in a while, but it's not gonna be like that. Right. Isn't it better that you're here?
[53:28] B: Mm. Right. Right.
[53:31] A: So he grabbed you, pulled you by the hair. That hurt. Pulled you close. Then he might have done what?
[53:36] C: He pushed my head towards him.
[53:40] A: And here.
[53:42] C: Hi. These little details are so hard. I know.
[53:48] A: Don't worry about the little details.
[53:49] C: I'm gonna have to say it.
[53:50] B: Watch.
[53:50] A: Don't worry about the little details because.
[53:52] C: I have to, like.
[53:54] A: I don't know whether that's true. What? I don't know whether it's true that you have to say the little details.
[54:01] C: Well, I mean, like, I, I, I'm talking about, like, when I go to, when we go to court, to trial.
[54:07] A: I'm gonna have to, like, say what he did.
[54:09] C: Yes.
[54:09] A: We'd like to actually get you better so that you can say what he did. Okay. But you don't have to say what he did.
[54:15] C: I don't have to say what he did?
[54:16] A: Well, I don't think so. Not always.
[54:18] C: Okay.
[54:19] A: But I think you can think about the stuff that he did do.
[54:21] C: Okay.
[54:22] B: Right.
[54:22] A: And I made it up.
[54:23] B: Right.
[54:24] A: So he might have pulled you close. He might have done stuff with your head. He might have put his body part into different body parts of yours. He might have done that for a period of time.
[54:31] B: Right.
[54:31] A: And then he would have stopped.
[54:32] C: Yes.
[54:33] A: And then he would have taken his penis out. And then he might have gone off to whatever he was doing. And then you might have put clothes on.
[54:40] C: No, there's so much in between there.
[54:44] B: Right.
[54:44] A: So eventually he stopped.
[54:46] C: Eventually. But there's a lot of in between. There's worse stuff in between.
[54:51] A: So what? Then they did the worst stuff in between.
[54:54] B: Right.
[54:54] A: But eventually he stopped. Yeah. And then that was over.
[54:59] B: Right.
[54:59] A: And then later on, you did something more fun.
[55:02] B: Right.
[55:02] A: Like take the kids to Legoland or go to the park or do the combat course.
[55:06] C: Yeah.
[55:07] B: Right. Good. Right.
[55:09] A: So watch. We're gonna go through it backwards.
[55:11] C: Okay.
[55:11] B: Okay.
[55:12] A: And then we're gonna get more details. We're gonna go through it backwards. Because when you go through it backwards, it unplugs the memory and it takes away the charge.
[55:20] C: Okay.
[55:21] B: Right.
[55:22] A: So first we got, you know, doing the compact course, we got taking the kids to the park we got going to Legoland.
[55:29] B: Right.
[55:29] A: And then he had probably left at some point.
[55:31] B: Right.
[55:31] A: And then it had stopped.
[55:33] C: Yeah.
[55:33] B: Right.
[55:33] A: And then there was that bad stuff in between. And then he had stopped. The sexual stuff.
[55:38] B: Right.
[55:38] A: And then he had been doing the sexual stuff. And then he had grabbed your hair and pulled you close, and then he pulled clothes off and then he thrown you on the bed. And then he's like, I'm going to do it anyway. And you're like, yeah, you don't want to. And then you're like, okay, well. And he's like, I wanted to. And then he came in screaming and yelling.
[55:50] C: Yes.
[55:51] A: And then before that, you'd gone in the bedroom.
[55:52] B: Yes.
[55:53] A: And then before that you were doing whatever you're doing. And as I go backwards compared to as you were thinking about it, forward emotionally, how was it? Was it same? Was it more? Was it less?
[56:04] C: Less.
[56:04] A: I know. Isn't that cool? Do you know why it's less?
[56:08] C: I have no idea.
[56:09] A: Do you want to know why?
[56:10] C: Sure.
[56:10] A: Oh, because your brain is beginning to read it as data. Because a memory can't go backwards if it's still happening. So that means it's a memory.
[56:21] B: Right.
[56:22] A: Third, the emotional part of your brain does not get logic, but it does get patterns of association. And the error with that memory is that the experience of it happening and the memory, the data, and they've been glued together, so the memory is living as if it's the experience. So the reason, true reason, that you've been feeling the discomfort is coming from that part of your brain that's trying to motivate you to get him to stop doing that. Hurry. Timing's a little screwed up because he stopped, but it's only causing all this discomfort in you right now, trying to motivate you to get that moment to stop. Good news. It has, right? That's really good news that it has. And that's what we're getting in. So then we go through a little silly game called the I'm not, you're not, it's not process, because you can remember earlier today putting your jeans on.
[57:15] B: Right.
[57:16] A: You even know where you were when you did it? Yeah, but if I said, you remember getting dressed, putting your jeans on, then I went, natalie, stop putting on your jeans. You'd look at me and go, I'm not putting on my jeans. Because you know there's a crystal clear difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually doing it. They're not the same thing. Follow me with that.
[57:39] C: Yes.
[57:39] A: Okay, so here we go. We're gonna play this. You can remember him doing that. Coming in drunk, screaming, yelling, you saying yes, you saying no, him doing it anyway. Doing the sexual stuff. Doing the stuff in the middle. You can remember all that happening. You can also remember putting your jeans on today.
[57:54] C: Yes.
[57:54] A: Natalie, stop putting on your jeans. Say, I am not putting on my jeans.
[57:58] C: I'm not putting my jeans.
[58:00] A: Stop me from putting on my pants. Say you're not putting on your pants. Say that to me. Say you're not putting on your pants. Well, then you stop putting on your shirt. Say I'm not putting on my shirt. Well, then stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you're not putting on your shirt. Well, stop him from screaming and yelling. Say he's not screaming and yelling. We'll stop him from forcing that to happen. Say he's not doing that. We'll stop him from doing that sex stuff. Say he's not doing that. We'll stop him from doing the stuff in the middle. Say he's not doing that.
[58:27] B: Right.
[58:27] A: Say he's not doing that. Well, then you stop putting on your sneakers. Say, I'm not putting on my sneakers.
[58:32] C: I'm not putting my sneakers.
[58:33] A: Will stop me from putting on my sneakers. Say you're not putting on your sneakers. Say that to me.
[58:38] C: You're not.
[58:38] A: Well, then stop him from doing that stuff. Say he's not doing that stuff.
[58:41] B: Say that.
[58:42] C: He's not doing that.
[58:43] A: Well, then stop it from happening. Go. It's not happening.
[58:45] C: It's not happening.
[58:45] A: So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is the thing we want to get in.
[58:51] B: Right?
[58:51] A: As that starts to get in, what are you noticing happening to the feelings?
[58:56] C: I don't know.
[58:57] B: You don't know?
[58:58] A: Oh, Jack. What do you notice right now as you're thinking about it? We still don't like that it happened.
[59:06] C: I. Yeah, I mean, it's still there. I still feel, you know, those feelings.
[59:11] A: Let's just check. Because people live in the world of either I have it or I don't. It's either on or it's off. Just check. Is it same? Is it more, is it less? See, there's two separate parts to this. There's what happened, right? And I never going. I'm never going to like what happened. So that's not where we're going. What I want you to check is, is it causing the same kind of ick inside as you're thinking about it, or is it a little less?
[59:45] C: It still feels the same Same kind of to me.
[59:47] B: Huh?
[59:48] A: How so?
[59:49] C: I'm, like, still thinking about it.
[59:51] A: You are still thinking about it.
[59:53] B: Right.
[59:53] A: And as you're thinking about it, is it making all the ick inside? Oh, it is.
[59:56] B: Right.
[59:57] A: Okay. So how do you actually want to be?
[60:00] C: I don't want to feel that way. I don't want to feel.
[60:03] A: You want to be.
[60:04] B: Right. Free.
[60:05] C: Yes.
[60:06] A: What's it like when you feel free? Happy.
[60:11] B: Yeah.
[60:11] A: You're happier when you're free.
[60:13] B: Right.
[60:14] A: So why. What are we wanting to do to the part of the brain that doesn't know? We want that part of the brain to know that that's not happening.
[60:25] B: Right.
[60:26] A: Who knows better? You right now or the earlier you as it was happening?
[60:32] C: Me.
[60:33] A: Right now you do.
[60:34] B: Right.
[60:34] A: She doesn't know what you know. Do we want to let her know? We want to keep it from her. We want to let her know, don't we? Yes. Yeah. So again, slightly lower your jaw. Relax the back of your tongue as you breathe. A little bit slower and deeper in and a little bit longer on the exhale. As you're breathing in this way, just notice more space around you. As you notice more space around you, bring your awareness down and inside.
[61:05] B: Right.
[61:06] A: Down towards your center. Because I don't know whether you realize it or not, but what if at your center, there's a calm and peaceful, a light and easy flowing energy.
[61:24] B: Right.
[61:27] A: That at all times is. There is. Even if your awareness is far from it. Because the good news that we're interested in getting in is that you survive that moment.
[61:44] B: Right.
[61:48] A: And there's a part of your brain that doesn't fully know yet that you survived and you're okay.
[61:59] B: Right.
[62:01] A: And that's what we want to get in to, that part that doesn't fully know.
[62:10] B: Right.
[62:15] A: And just check inside your body now.
[62:19] B: All right.
[62:19] A: How's your body feeling?
[62:21] B: Calm.
[62:21] A: It is calm. Isn't that interesting? We're talking about stuff that normally makes you feel yucky and your body's calm. It's a little unusual, don't you think?
[62:32] B: Right. So you're in the room.
[62:36] C: I am.
[62:37] A: He comes in.
[62:39] B: He's yelling.
[62:40] A: He's wanting to. You said okay. Then you're, like, looking at him. No, that's not gonna be good. He's like, I don't care. I'm gonna do it anyway.
[62:47] B: Right. Right.
[62:49] A: Throws you on the bed, pulls some clothes, grabs you by the hair. That hurt.
[62:53] B: Pulls you close.
[62:54] C: Yes.
[62:55] A: Does whatever sex stuff that he's doing to you. Puts his penis in different spots or fingers in different spots. So he did all that.
[63:01] B: Right?
[63:01] A: Then he did what? Then he stopped.
[63:03] B: Then he did.
[63:04] A: What was the other stuff that he did?
[63:07] C: He pushed me towards, like, the middle of the bed, and he forced himself on me.
[63:15] B: Right.
[63:17] C: I kept screaming and screaming, stop.
[63:19] B: Right.
[63:20] A: So by him forcing himself on you, he put his penis in your vagina on top of you, or he just was on top of you?
[63:27] C: He kept switching, like, positions. He was, like, behind me, moving me.
[63:33] A: So he was doing it in all different spots?
[63:34] C: Yeah.
[63:35] A: You were saying, no, stop.
[63:36] C: And I kept screaming.
[63:37] B: Yeah.
[63:38] A: Good job with detail.
[63:38] B: Right.
[63:39] C: He kept hitting me.
[63:40] A: Oh, hit you with the fist or a slap?
[63:43] C: No, fist.
[63:43] A: Fist. Right. And that hurt. Hitting me in my face and that hurt.
[63:46] B: Right.
[63:46] A: And you're trying to protect your face. Right? Because then when it happened next.
[63:49] C: My head.
[63:49] B: Yes.
[63:51] A: By the way, check your head out right now. Is it being hit?
[63:54] C: No.
[63:54] B: I know.
[63:55] A: Isn't that cool?
[63:56] B: Right?
[63:56] A: Just.
[63:57] B: Okay.
[63:58] A: Anything feel tender here?
[64:00] B: Right? Notice, Right?
[64:02] A: Yeah. Good job. You're doing great. I'm so proud of you. That's right. And then what happened next?
[64:08] C: He couldn't finish.
[64:09] A: Right. So he got up. Right?
[64:12] B: Right.
[64:12] A: Good job.
[64:12] B: Right.
[64:13] C: And he came back again.
[64:14] A: Yes.
[64:14] C: And he did it again.
[64:15] B: Right.
[64:16] A: And did the penis stuff. Did the hitting stuff.
[64:19] B: Right.
[64:19] A: Couldn't. Then what happened next?
[64:20] C: He just.
[64:21] A: The.
[64:21] C: More like every time, it was just like. It was. It was more like he was more aggressive.
[64:26] A: Right.
[64:26] B: Good job. Right.
[64:27] A: And that would hurt.
[64:28] C: And. And then he couldn't finish.
[64:31] B: Right.
[64:31] C: Got back up.
[64:32] B: Right.
[64:32] A: Went to the bathroom again. Did it again.
[64:36] C: Three times.
[64:39] A: Probably all the alcohol drink.
[64:42] B: Probably.
[64:46] A: Get here again. Just.
[64:49] B: Right.
[64:50] C: Third time was the worst.
[64:51] A: Third time's the charm. Oh, damn it. I thought it was going to be the charm. Oh, it's the third time, right?
[64:56] C: It's the worst.
[64:57] A: Yes, he was.
[64:59] C: My face was all swollen right.
[65:01] A: From him.
[65:02] B: Right.
[65:02] A: Good job.
[65:04] C: And he kept calling me a bitch.
[65:06] A: Right. Good job. Good detail.
[65:07] C: Right, Right, Right.
[65:09] A: Good job, good detail. Oh, like how you made me do this.
[65:12] B: Right?
[65:12] A: Yeah.
[65:13] C: And that's when he just said, that's it.
[65:15] B: Right.
[65:15] C: And he came at me again.
[65:17] B: Right.
[65:18] C: He was really forceful.
[65:21] B: Right.
[65:21] A: And aggressive.
[65:22] B: Right.
[65:22] A: And he did whatever he did to your body.
[65:24] B: Right.
[65:24] A: Good job.
[65:25] C: Screaming.
[65:26] B: Right.
[65:26] A: Good job.
[65:27] B: Right?
[65:27] A: Good job.
[65:27] B: Right?
[65:28] A: Yes. Be here. Hi.
[65:30] B: Hi.
[65:30] A: Just check it again. How's your face feeling?
[65:33] C: Okay.
[65:34] B: Right.
[65:35] A: Check your arm.
[65:36] B: Right.
[65:36] A: Check your leggies. Hey, just notice, you know how you're here, right? Yeah.
[65:41] B: All right.

[68:03] A: Oh, here.
[68:04] B: Hi. Hi. Hi.
[68:07] A: Is that when he stopped?
[68:09] C: He stopped? I don't even really remember.
[68:12] A: Well, he stopped.
[68:13] C: Oh, he stopped. And I remember just like grasping for air.
[68:17] A: And then you could start breathing again.
[68:18] C: It was just like.
[68:19] B: Right.
[68:19] A: And then you were breathing. You actually got air in.
[68:24] B: Right.
[68:25] A: And then that moment was over.
[68:28] B: Right.
[68:30] A: And then did he leave the room? Eventually he kept hitting me. Well, after that moment. Right, so he hit you four more times. Right. Be here.
[68:39] C: My face.
[68:39] B: Right.
[68:40] C: My face.

[68:42] B: Right. And then what happened here?
[68:51] C: He left the room.
[68:53] A: He did. Which was better than when he hitting you.
[68:55] C: Yes.
[68:55] B: Yeah.
[68:56] C: And that's when I, I, I grabbed his phone.
[69:00] A: Yes.
[69:01] C: And I.
[69:07] B: Here.
[69:12] C: I, I grabbed the phone and I went to the bathroom and I, I called nine.
[69:20] B: You did, right?
[69:20] C: Yes. And I turned the faucet on.
[69:23] B: Yes.
[69:23] C: I locked the door. I remember I hear him come in.
[69:26] A: Yes.
[69:26] C: And I panicked.
[69:27] B: Right.
[69:28] C: And so I put it underneath the vanity.
[69:30] B: Yes.
[69:32] C: And he's knocking on the door really hard.
[69:37] B: Yes.
[69:38] A: Good job, Good detail.
[69:39] B: Right.
[69:41] A: Check.
[69:41] B: Right.
[69:42] A: Now, is he knocking on the door? He isn't, is he?
[69:46] C: No.
[69:47] B: No. Right.
[69:48] A: And what happened next?
[69:49] C: I open the door.
[69:50] A: That's right.
[69:51] C: And pretend like, you know, we're good, everything's fine.
[69:54] B: Right? Yeah.
[69:54] A: I look great. I mean, I just looked at myself in the mirror.
[69:57] C: And he walks to the. He walks to the bedroom door.
[70:02] B: Yes.
[70:03] C: And turns around.
[70:04] B: Yes.
[70:05] C: And that's when I noticed that he had a gun in his hand.
[70:11] B: Yeah. Right.
[70:11] A: Good job, Kadito.
[70:12] B: Right, Right.
[70:13] A: And that was scary.
[70:15] B: Right.
[70:15] A: And you're here.
[70:16] B: Hi. Hi.
[70:19] A: You're doing so good.
[70:23] B: Right.
[70:24] A: Then what happened next?
[70:26] C: He raised his hand.
[70:27] B: Yes. Right. And then what happened?
[70:33] C: He said that he was going to kill me.
[70:36] B: Okay. Right.
[70:38] A: Just check. Did he?
[70:40] B: Are you sure?
[70:41] A: How do you know? You are here, aren't you? We like it better when you're here. That's right. That you didn't know.
[70:48] B: Right.
[70:48] A: We're gonna get her to know that you're here now.
[70:51] C: Yes.
[70:52] B: Yeah. Right. Right.
[70:54] A: And then what happened?
[70:55] C: I kept begging him.
[70:56] B: Right?
[70:56] A: Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it.
[70:58] C: I told him that our son is right.
[71:00] B: Right.
[71:00] A: Good job, good detail.
[71:01] B: Right.
[71:01] C: In the living room couch.
[71:03] B: Yes.
[71:03] C: And it's a police. Please.
[71:05] B: Right.
[71:05] C: Just let me go.
[71:06] B: Right.
[71:07] A: And then what happened next?
[71:08] C: The only way I was going to go was in a body bag.
[71:11] B: Right.
[71:11] A: Good job, good detail.
[71:11] B: Right.
[71:12] A: And then what happened?
[71:14] C: He finally put the gun down, which.
[71:16] A: Was better than when he had it at you.
[71:18] C: He still had it in his hand.
[71:19] A: But it was better than when it was pointed at you.
[71:22] C: And he.
[71:22] A: I just check that out for a moment.
[71:24] C: Okay.
[71:24] A: Notice how when the gun went from here to here, it was better. Do you follow me with that? Like, maybe not a ton better, maybe not a ton better, but still a little bit better.
[71:35] B: Right.
[71:36] A: When it was here, then it went to here Better.
[71:38] B: Right.
[71:39] A: Then what happened next?
[71:40] C: He went to the bathroom.
[71:41] B: Right.
[71:42] A: And then what happened?
[71:43] C: I Grabbed my clothes.
[71:45] B: Yes.
[71:45] C: Whatever was in the floor.
[71:47] B: That's right.
[71:47] C: I didn't even think it was even my clothes.
[71:48] B: Right.
[71:49] A: Good job. So you grabbed it. All right.
[71:52] C: I didn't know what to do.
[71:53] A: That's right.
[71:53] C: First thing I could think was to go out the back door.
[71:57] A: That's right. Good job. Good detail.
[71:58] B: Right.
[71:58] C: So I went out the back door.
[71:59] B: Yes.
[72:00] C: Hoping the neighbors would have their dogs out.
[72:02] A: That's right.
[72:02] C: Or something.
[72:03] B: Yeah.
[72:04] C: They did.
[72:05] B: Right.
[72:05] C: So they can, you know, go through the back gate. He has a block.
[72:09] B: Right.
[72:10] C: And I started panicking.
[72:11] B: Right.
[72:12] A: Because be here.
[72:12] B: Hi. Hi.
[72:14] A: Good job.
[72:15] B: Right.
[72:17] C: He has cameras all around the house. And I knew he was going to get alert.
[72:22] B: I know.
[72:23] C: I'm outside.
[72:24] B: Right.
[72:24] C: Not allowed to be outside without him.
[72:26] B: Yeah.
[72:28] C: So I panicked. I remember walking back and forth and stepping on mangles that's fallen from the trees.
[72:35] B: Right.
[72:35] A: Good job.
[72:37] C: And I just. I didn't know what to do. And I scream for the neighbors, and they don't hear me. And he hears me.
[72:44] B: Right.
[72:44] A: She had lots of different thoughts going on. But then what happened?
[72:47] C: I went back in.
[72:48] A: You went back in.
[72:48] B: Right.
[72:49] C: And I. I went through the family room, the kitchen, and I looked to the bedroom.
[72:59] B: Yes.
[72:59] C: And he was at his nightstand.
[73:01] B: Yes.
[73:02] C: And I didn't even see my son. I didn't know. I guess he was with him. I don't know where he was at.
[73:06] A: I don't know where he was.
[73:07] B: Right.
[73:07] A: Then what happened next?
[73:09] C: I ran for the front door.
[73:10] A: That's right.
[73:11] C: And I knew he was going to hear me because we have a child.
[73:14] A: Lock country on the front door, of course.
[73:16] C: So I did very quickly opened it, closed it, and ran to the neighbor's house.
[73:22] B: Right.
[73:22] A: And then that moment was over.
[73:24] B: And they let you in.
[73:26] A: And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to Legoland. Yes.
[73:31] B: Right.
[73:31] A: Or take the kids to the park.
[73:32] C: Yes.
[73:33] B: Right.
[73:33] A: Or do that.
[73:34] C: Yes.
[73:35] B: Class.
[73:36] A: Got it.
[73:37] C: Yes.
[73:37] B: You did great.
[73:38] A: Now notice, as you were telling me about it, there was some discomfort.
[73:41] C: Oh, yes.
[73:42] A: A little bit less because you were intending to be here. Isn't that interesting? So again, when we go backwards, it's all about unplugging it and taking away the charge. So we're gonna go in reverse. You're gonna check to see if I can remember it.
[73:54] B: Right.
[73:55] A: Okay. Because there's a lot there. Let's see if I can remember it.
[73:59] C: Okay.
[74:01] A: So we've got, you know, first is, well, you did the combat class. You got to take the kid to the park. Right. And then you went to Legoland.
[74:09] B: Right.
[74:10] A: And then before that you'd been in the neighbor's house, and then they let.
[74:13] B: You in, and then you ran there, right?
[74:15] A: And then you shut the door, and then you'd open the door, and then you ran to the door, and then you saw that he was by the nightstand. And then you had walked through the living room back. And then you would come back in from being outside, and then you had gone outside, and then you had thought going outside, Right? And then you had walked out of the well. No. Then he had set it down or lowered his arm.
[74:40] B: Right.
[74:41] A: And then he had had it at you. And then he had said he. Then you saw that he'd had a gun.
[74:47] B: Right.
[74:47] A: And then you had come out of the bathroom.
[74:50] B: Right?
[74:50] A: And then he had knocked really hard, and then you had put the faucet on and tried to call 91 1. And then you'd gone grab his phone.
[74:58] B: No.
[74:58] A: Then you had gone in the bathroom. Before that you grabbed his phone.
[75:01] B: Then he had stopped.
[75:03] A: And then there was the three different times that he did the different things.
[75:06] B: Right. Each time.
[75:07] A: The last time it was more severe than the second time. That was more severe than the first time. But lots of punching, lots of stuff that happened there.
[75:14] B: Right.
[75:15] A: And then he had, you know, pulled off clothes. He had thrown you on the bed.
[75:20] B: Right?
[75:21] A: And then he's like, I'm going to. It doesn't matter what you want. Then you're like, no, I don't want to. And then he's. You're like, okay, we can. And then he's like, I really want to. And then he was screaming and yelling at you. And then he had come in the bedroom. And then before that you had gone in the bedroom. And then before that you were doing.
[75:35] B: Whatever you're doing, right?
[75:37] C: Yes.
[75:38] A: So as I ran through it backwards.
[75:40] B: Right.
[75:41] A: Compared to when you were talking about it emotionally, how was it?
[75:45] C: A little hard, but.
[75:47] A: No, just check. I don't know whether that's true. I want you to think as I went through it backwards compared to when you were telling it to. To me.
[75:56] C: Oh, it was a lot better, wasn't it?
[75:58] A: Oh, it was a lot better. I wonder why it's getting a lot better, right? I wonder why it's getting a lot better. Because your brain is beginning to read what happened as data about something that happened. Got it?
[76:19] C: Yes.
[76:20] A: You can remember him doing that. You can remember him punching you. You can remember each time it getting severer and worse. You can remember he had to pee along time out from beating you up. I Gotta go pee again. Okay. Come back. Time in. Hold on. Time out again. I gotta pee again. All right. Time back in. There we go. You also can remember the moment that he stopped, was when you stopped. He stopped. And that you, in that moment, wasn't sure you were going to live. She thought as that was going on and things were starting to get dark, that she wasn't going to survive. What do we know? You did, right? You made it through that.
[77:11] C: Yes.
[77:12] B: Right. Right.
[77:13] A: So you can remember him doing that. You can remember him putting in your chokehold. You can remember things going dark. You can also remember putting on your apple watch. Natalie, stop putting on your apple watch. Say, I'm not putting on my apple watch. We'll stop him from choking you out. Say he's not choking me out. We'll stop him from pointing the gun at you. Say he's not pointing the gun at me. Well, then you stop putting on your shirt. See, I am not putting on my shirt. Well, stop him from hitting you in the face. He is not hitting me in the face. Will you stop putting on your shoes? I'm not putting on my shoes. Well, then stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that. Well, then stop it from happening. Go. That's not happening. So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists.
[77:50] C: It no longer exists.
[77:51] A: Bingo. And again. Just check again. What are you noticing?
[77:55] C: Some calmness.
[77:56] A: I know. Isn't that cool? Notice how you've never felt calm when you've thought about that.
[78:01] B: I know.
[78:01] A: Isn't that weird? Notice how you're feeling more calm now?
[78:05] C: Yes.
[78:06] B: Right.
[78:06] A: There's a lot. There's a couple other pieces to this one that earlier you. And all of that was going on, even though you know him being that way and doing that stuff had nothing to do with you. It didn't feel that way. You follow me with that?
[78:20] C: I think so.
[78:23] A: Give it to a different example.
[78:25] B: Right.
[78:25] A: The guy's 50. And the thing that happened with his uncle, he knows that it wasn't his fault. He knows that he didn't do anything wrong. He knows what uncle did to him. Some of it felt good to him, but not because he want wanted it and not because he's gay. But the body part, touched in that way is designed to feel good. So he knows all of that. Intellectually, he's actually done over years of therapy, the intellectual work of forgiving uncle for what uncle did to him.
[78:48] B: Right.
[78:48] A: You would think the guy would be fine now has time, all that stuff. Why inside does he still feel the.
[78:53] B: Guilt and the shame, the hurt and the pain.
[78:58] A: You would think once he knows better, he should feel different. It doesn't work that way, unfortunately. If it doesn't change at the feeling level, it doesn't matter what we know. It never gets in here. So because of the messaging that it got installed when we were little children, that you back then felt like some of that going on had something to do with you, even though you know it had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with him. Follow me with that.
[79:26] C: Yes.
[79:27] A: Right, So I want you to repeat these four words after me. Here we go. It's. It's not. Not about.
[79:34] B: About me. Right.
[79:35] A: One more time. It's not. It's not about. About me.
[79:40] B: Right?
[79:40] A: One more time. It's not about me.
[79:41] C: It's not about me.
[79:42] A: Now close your eyes. Picture that earlier, you just after it was over. Letting her know that it's over. Finished, completed, defeated. That experience no longer exists. Letting her know that you're okay, that you survived. Right? That you got away. That's right. Letting her know that that happening to you had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with him. It's not about me. Had nothing to do with me. Had everything to do with him being all not about me. So that she gets it. Let her know about going to Legoland.
[80:18] B: Right.
[80:19] A: Or being in the park or even that class.
[80:24] B: Right?
[80:25] A: So that she gets it. As the earlier you is getting it. What do you notice happening to her face? What's happening to her as she's getting that she survived and you're okay.
[80:43] B: Yeah.
[80:44] A: What do you think might happen to her? She's learning from you that she survived and you're okay.
[80:49] C: She feels free.
[80:50] A: She feels free.
[80:51] C: Yay.
[80:52] A: Isn't that a good news thing? Right? And if she's feeling free, check inside you. What are you noticing in you?
[81:02] C: I feel like a lot has been lifted. It doesn't feel as heavy.
[81:08] A: It doesn't feel as heavy.
[81:09] B: Heavy.
[81:10] A: Isn't that cool? Notice how you're feeling lighter. Isn't that interesting?
[81:17] B: Right?
[81:18] A: So we still don't like that that happened. We never will. We're not going for, hey, let's label it one of the top three experiences. No, we're not doing that. Right. But as you're thinking about it now, remembering that it happened, then checking your.
[81:34] B: Body, what do you notice?
[81:38] A: Notice how it's much easier for you to be here because this is what's happening. Did you know that I'm a happening Guy.
[81:51] B: Right.
[81:53] A: You're more. In the present moment, your brain is reading that as data about something that happened versus happening.
[82:01] B: Happening makes sense.
[82:03] C: Yes.
[82:04] A: And you led with the big one.
[82:09] B: Right.
[82:09] A: Wasn't that a big experience with a lot of stuff. We didn't go for a small one first. Do you know what that means about you? Really courageous. Did you know that there's no act of courage that doesn't require one to be vulnerable? That they're not the opposite ends of the spectrum, they're the opposite side of the same coin? You can't be courageous without being vulnerable.
[82:32] B: Right.
[82:33] A: Think of the guy trying to rescue his buddy across the battlefield.
[82:37] B: Right.
[82:37] A: That's a courageous act. But he leaves himself pretty open to getting shot, so he's pretty vulnerable at the same time, don't you think?
[82:45] B: Yeah.
[82:46] A: And you went with the big one. Isn't that cool? Do you know what that means for all the other ones? They get to go faster.
[82:56] B: Right?
[82:56] A: They get to go faster because notice when you're thinking about it, you're not having the same kinds of feelings. I bet when you think about it, it's not even in the same location it used to be. Notice how it's changed locations. Like, even when you go looking for it, it's not in the same spot. That's just indicators that your brain has changed the programming. We're changing the relationship. We don't change the stuff.
[83:22] B: Right.
[83:22] A: But we're changing the relationship to it so that your brain experiences it as data about something that happened versus where it's been stuck as happening. Got it?
[83:35] C: Yes.
[83:36] B: Yeah.
[83:37] A: So then we want to do another part. So I want you to think of a time when you are outdoors in nature and you see something that's just beautiful. Like, the moment you're looking at it, you're like, wow, like, seeing it. What is it that you see?
[83:54] C: I don't know. The beach. I don't know if it's the picture, but the beach.
[83:57] A: Yeah.
[83:57] C: I just. Like the beach is the first.
[83:58] A: Right. And isn't there a moment when you're at the beach and you're seeing the sand and the water in the sky and that you're feeling, like, that sense of awe, wonder, excitement, peace? And some people would say to you, Natalie, that of course, seeing that and being there is going to give you those kinds. Kinds of feelings. But if we looked at it from a different lens, we could say that seeing it and being there drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what if at your center, you always are peaceful and Excited. Kind of like if I'm at the campfire and it's cold, and so I bring my hands down towards the flames and I go, holy cow, this fire is getting hotter. Is the fire getting hotter or am I becoming more aware of the heat because my hands are getting closer to the flames? Got it. So we know that in your life there have been many times where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Times of upset or anger, hurt or guilt, shame or grief. But the way we're going to think about it is no matter where your awareness has been, always at your center. You're peaceful and excited. In the same way. You know that there are three of us in here. How do you know that? Well, your senses bring in data. Your intellect organizes the data. We call that knowledge. Some people call knowledge light. We'll call it light of knowledge. At your center, it's a brighter light. It's light of wisdom. So now we've got knowledge, we've got wisdom. And I work with all sorts of people that all sorts of awful stuff happened to them. I remember one gal, older brother, used to take Matchbox cars, drive them up her leg and park them in her. So she had a lot of ick around all of that, right? We worked together, cleared it all up. Gone. Like the upset, the anger, the hurt, the grief, like, gone. And so I'm asking this question. She's got like this glowing smile. Like, she's, okay. I'm going, okay. So, like, where was it? And she's like, it's gone. I don't feel it. I go, I know. Isn't that cool? She goes, it is. I go, but where was it? And we started thinking. I go, was it at the surface level? And she said, no, it wasn't intellectual. I said, oh, maybe it was hiding in your center. And she's like, really? How could that kind of stuff survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited? And so I asked her again, where was it? And this is what she said. She said it was hiding in the shadows in between the lights. I said, well, what happened? She says, the lights have merged. They're touching. The shadows are gone. I said, whoa, that's powerful. And then we started talking about how people have a tendency to screw up identity all the time. You hear it. People say, I'm anxious, I'm depressed, I'm shy, I'm ocd. They think the way that they feel is who they are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm super upset when I get out and Both of you being nice are asking me, why are you so upset? I say, you'll never believe what the joke did to me. You're like, what did he do? I said, well, the first thing, I go into the dentist office, right? He puts me on this chair. Immediately, my head is moving down, my feet are coming up. That's a pretty uncomfortable position to be in. And you're like, you're at the dentist, right? And then he turns this light on, positions it right in my eyes. I can't see a darn thing. And you're both like, you're at the dentist. Well, then he took this cold instrument and shoved it inside of me. And you're both like, oh, my goodness. You're what? I'm like, my mouth. I'm not the dentist. But see, that's the same thing that I said to that girl with her older brother. I said, when you were little, he really messed with your stuff. And she looked at me with that same glowing smile, and she said, he did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings.
[87:43] B: And then she looked at me and.
[87:44] A: She said, but you know what? I go, what? She says, he never touched me. I go, what? She goes, yeah, he never touched me. He messed with my body. He hurt my feelings, but he never touched me. And I went, but what do you mean by that? And she said, well, religions like to call the light at the center my soul. We've heard that all the time, right? Soul, spirit, essence, right? That I. It's something that I have. And she said, instead of thinking of it as a thing you have, what if we thought of it as you? That you are the light at the center, and that you have things like a nose, flower, fingers and toes, but you're not your nose or your fingers or your toes. Just like you have a body. Your body's totally yours, by the way. But did you know that your body's not you?
[88:44] B: I know. That's weird, though, right?
[88:47] A: And the only reason that I know that our body's not me is that my mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident. And when she visits people, they don't say to her, hey, Susie, I'm glad almost all of you could show up today. She's all there, even if that part of her body's missing. So you have a body. Your body's totally yours. But it isn't actually you. Neuroscience would tell us that if we all came back one year from today. 99.9999% of the subatomic particles that are making us up would no longer be here.
[89:21] B: Right.
[89:21] A: They're all changing. They're not the same. So you have a body, your body's yours, but it isn't actually you. There's no cell right now within your body. That's the same as when that happened back then. They've all been replaced. The cells in your body get replaced millions and millions and millions of times. Your feet alone are longer than they were when you were two.
[89:43] B: Right?
[89:44] A: Yet despite the changes, you were totally you. So if we go, you're not your body, are you? Then your thoughts?
[89:50] B: No.
[89:50] A: Because you're not even the thinker of those thoughts. Your brain is. And your brain isn't you. It's an organ, just like your heart and your lungs. Yours, not you. Okay, so you're not your body, you're not your thoughts. You must be how you feel. Except you feel different ways at different times, so you can't possibly be a feeling.
[90:06] B: Weird, right?
[90:07] A: So if I'm not my thoughts and not my body, I'm not how I feel. I must be what I do. But there's lots of things that you've done through life. And when you stop doing this thing to do this other thing, you didn't stop existing. Existing. Which leads us to a weirder question. Because if you're not your body, and if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not what you do, and if you're not how you feel, then what the heck are you? Weird, right? So that's why we're going to say for our purposes, the who you are is what you became aware of. When you're at the beach, seeing the sand and the ocean and the clouds in the sky. Then in that moment, what was happening is your awareness was being drawn and down in towards what we call my soul. But we're not going to think of it as the thing you have. We're thinking of your fingers as what you have. That the light is you. And did you know something about the light at the center? Did you know that it can't be touched or hurt or harmed? It's absolutely whole and complete. There's nothing missing. Isn't that weird?
[91:10] B: Yeah.
[91:11] A: So notice what happens now as you slightly lower your jaw and you relax the back of your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper.
[91:20] B: And you notice more space, right?
[91:24] A: As you're noticing more and more space and your body is staying calm and you're feeling more settled and she's feeling free. For you to be becoming even more okay in you. Because I don't know whether you fully realize how much things are lightening up yet. Because more has been going on at a deeper level. Kind of like when you plant seedlings in the soil. There's a lot of stuff that goes on below the surface before you ever see any of it manifesting above the ground. A lot of this stuff is going on inside already rewiring faulty programming that's been in your brain so that you get to be more free and more at peace and more present and more.
[92:17] B: Okay, got it.
[92:19] A: And because we're organizing towards this, you, that other part of your brain can travel back again down that timeline of experiences that were negative, whether they be with him or other things. And again, that part of your brain is going to bring another one of those moments to your awareness for us to unplug.
[92:43] B: Right. What moments?
[92:45] A: Starting to come to mind now.
[92:50] C: I'm still thinking of the beach.
[92:52] A: I know you are. Isn't that cool that you're still thinking of the beach? And your unconscious can do the other thing for you because it's the one that's scanning back. Your unconscious, by the way, is a warehouse of everything you've gone through. It knows the good, the bad, the ugly.
[93:12] B: Right.
[93:13] A: It's going to bring another moment to your awareness for us to clear. And you might go, what does this have to do with any of that? But your unconscious knows more than you.
[93:27] B: Right.
[93:28] A: So what's coming to mind?
[93:31] C: Nothing.
[93:32] A: Nothing? Isn't that interesting that nothing's coming to mind? Well, if you think about another thing that happened with him, because that wasn't like the first and only time. No, clearly that was just the worst. I got it. Right. So you did the worst first.
[93:56] B: Right.
[93:57] A: So think of a different time where he did something that wasn't as bad as that one.
[94:04] B: Right.
[94:04] A: And as you're thinking of that time, what are you noticing in you?
[94:09] C: It's. I don't know how to explain it. Like, it's not as. Not as bad as I was thinking with the darker times. It's, I guess, you know, back to more calm, more.
[94:28] A: Notice how you're already more calm even as you're thinking about it. So what would be another time of something that happened with him where, when you've thought about it, there's been, ick, we'll go through another. Do you know why we want to go through another? Because the brain is really great at taking one thing and applying it to others. So, for example, we all learned how to tie a pair of sneakers on one pair of sneakers. We all pretty much learned how to ride a bicycle on one bicycle. But once our brain got it, we didn't have to remember it again. Somebody didn't have to say, oh, you learned on white pair. Let me show you how to do it on a pair. Green, pear. No, no, no. I learned on the white. I can apply it to the green. Do you follow me with that? But the way that the brain generalizes is it's easier to generalize from more than one than just one. Because if I said to you orange, do you know whether I'm thinking about the fruit or the color? But if I said orange, apple, banana, what do you get?
[95:27] C: Fruit.
[95:28] A: Got it. I don't have to list every fruit in the world for you to pick it up. Does that make sense? So what's another moment happened before that one?
[95:41] C: Another moment?
[95:42] B: Yeah.
[95:43] A: That one happened about how long ago?
[95:46] C: Yeah, I'm not really sure exactly how long, but there were other. There were other times that he forced himself on me.
[95:54] A: No. Let's think of a time.
[95:56] C: Okay.
[95:56] B: Right.
[95:57] A: Might have been, like, before then.
[96:00] B: Right.
[96:01] A: And when that one happened, you might have been where.
[96:05] C: I was, you know, at the house.
[96:08] A: Yeah. So you're at the house.
[96:09] B: Right.
[96:09] A: Because you weren't allowed to leave. Oh, you can now. Yes.
[96:13] B: Leave the house.
[96:13] A: You can.
[96:14] B: Right.
[96:14] A: You're here. Holy cow. You left the house. Yes. Just check that out for a moment. How much better it is that you can leave the house. I know. I know how much more free you are already.
[96:25] C: Yes.
[96:25] B: Right.
[96:26] A: You've been living more free. You haven't been emotionally more free.
[96:29] C: Yes.
[96:29] A: We're on our way to getting your living to match your emotions or your emotions to match your living. That would be a better way to say it. Got it.
[96:36] C: Yeah.
[96:36] A: So that you feel free, too. Right. On the way to having a better life for you and your little one.
[96:47] C: Yes.
[96:48] B: Right.
[96:49] A: That's what we're doing.
[96:50] B: Yeah. Good job.
[96:52] A: So that one. You're in the house. Let me guess. You're in the bedroom.
[96:56] C: Yes. It's a different bedroom in the house.
[97:00] B: Oh, good.
[97:00] A: Different bedroom.
[97:01] B: Right.
[97:01] A: We don't want to be in that bedroom.
[97:02] C: It was our bedroom. We had. It's a long story.
[97:05] A: That's right.
[97:06] C: But we. We were in one bedroom, and we moved to the master later on.
[97:10] B: Right.
[97:10] A: So you're in the bedroom.
[97:11] C: Yes.
[97:11] B: Right.
[97:12] A: And, like, you're standing next to the bed.
[97:15] C: I don't remember exactly how it started. It was longer. It was. I don't know probably maybe six months before that.
[97:26] A: Yeah.
[97:26] B: Right.
[97:27] A: So.
[97:27] B: Right.
[97:28] C: So I just remembered him forcing himself on me again.
[97:33] A: So you were in there, and then he wanted to have sex with you, and you didn't really want to have sex. And he's like, it doesn't matter whether you want to or not.
[97:38] C: Yes.
[97:38] A: And I'm gonna do it anyway. And then he got on top of you and he did his penis thing in the different spots.
[97:42] B: Odds.
[97:43] A: And made you do different things.
[97:44] C: He wasn't. It wasn't like he wasn't so violent.
[97:48] A: No, not.
[97:48] C: Not nothing compared to that. Like, I don't. I might have had, like, you know, a few bruises on my arm, but.
[97:54] A: He might have been physical. But he wasn't violent.
[97:56] C: He was a little violent. I mean, he. He held me down. I mean, a lot of that.
[97:59] A: So he held you down and kind.
[98:01] C: Of like slapping me.
[98:02] B: Right, right.
[98:03] A: Because apparently he watched porn and thought that all women. Right. Now, I swear to God, the problem with porn. I mean, there's a lot of problems with porn, but the big problem with porn. Oh, my goodness. Is that if you watch porn, you think all women are into ATMs and facials. And I don't mean the kind that you go to the. To get money out of, and I don't mean the kind that you go to the salon for. Oh, and then the other thing. Oh, everybody's into getting hit or choked out.
[98:24] B: Right.
[98:24] A: Because that's exactly how everybody wants to do it. Come on.
[98:28] C: He did that, too. But it wasn't the chokehold.
[98:32] A: Right? It wasn't the chokehold. The choke yacht. It was more like one of these things.
[98:35] C: Yes.
[98:35] A: Right, Good. And holding you down and forcing him.
[98:38] C: Yes.
[98:38] A: Right, Good. And then he did that for a period of time.
[98:40] C: He did, Right. It only happened one time. It wasn't like the right time. It was like three times.
[98:45] A: He didn't have to pee so much.
[98:49] C: Yeah, exactly.
[98:51] B: Right.
[98:51] A: You didn't pee so much.
[98:52] B: Right.
[98:52] A: Good.
[98:53] B: Right.
[98:53] A: And then eventually he stopped.
[98:55] C: It happened. It was really kind of short.
[98:57] B: Right.
[98:57] C: And I doubt it.
[99:01] B: Right.
[99:01] A: You weren't fighting.
[99:02] C: I was fighting. No, but I don't think I was. I wasn't fighting as hard as I was that night. Because he wasn't as aggressive.
[99:08] A: That's right.
[99:09] C: I mean, he was aggressive, but.
[99:11] B: Right.
[99:11] A: The less you were fighting, the faster it got done. Because when you stopped fighting, the last.
[99:16] B: The.
[99:16] A: In the first one that you said when you stopped fighting, he stopped.
[99:20] C: Even when I stopped fighting, he still kind of wanted to hit me a little bit. So it Was. I mean, he was still doing it, but it wasn't as bad.
[99:28] B: That's right.
[99:28] A: Do you get that when you stopped, it slowed it.
[99:32] C: Yes.
[99:32] A: And then eventually got it to stop. It had some residual. So it didn't stop immediately.
[99:39] B: Right.
[99:40] A: It's like I hit the brakes with the car skid.
[99:42] C: Yes.
[99:43] A: I did hit the brakes, though. Got it.
[99:47] B: Right.
[99:48] A: So it carried on a little bit further. But then you got it to stop.
[99:51] B: Right?
[99:52] A: You got it to stop. Yeah, that's right. You got him to put the gun down. That's right. Oh, we haven't been acknowledging that. We might want to acknowledge that.
[100:00] C: I feel like it's because he was drunk and not completely there, the reason why he put the gun down.
[100:05] A: But. Yeah, well, he was completely there, which is why I picked the gun up in the first place.
[100:12] C: Yeah. I just. I feel like he was in and out a lot. Like, he's just.
[100:15] A: I'm sure he was, like.
[100:16] C: Didn't know where he was at times. Like, he was just. He was very drunk.
[100:20] B: Right, right, right.
[100:23] A: But that other time he stopped and then that was over. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to Legoland with the kids. Yeah, right. Or go to the park. Yes. Or do that class.
[100:32] C: Yes.
[100:32] B: Right.
[100:32] A: So we got doing the class. We got going to the park. We got being at Legoland with the kids. Do they have a favorite Legoland thing? How old are they?
[100:40] C: Five and two.
[100:41] A: Okay. Legoland is the best park to go with little kids. That's what I did with my girls. Best park ever. It's not fat, It's. It's not huge. You can manage it in a day.
[100:52] B: Yes.
[100:53] C: It's not as crowded.
[100:54] A: Not as crowded. You can just go in and ride the merry go round if you need to.
[101:01] B: Yeah, yeah.
[101:03] A: Peppa Pig World.
[101:04] C: Yes.
[101:04] B: Right.
[101:06] A: That's so cool. Yeah.
[101:08] B: Right, Right.
[101:09] A: So we're at Legoland.
[101:10] B: Right.
[101:11] A: Then before that, he had stopped and then he'd had his forceful stuff on you. He'd been a little bit violent. May have been holding you down, may have been whatever. Then he had gotten on top of you and then he.
[101:20] B: You didn't want to.
[101:21] A: And then he's like, I'm gonna do this. And then he wanted to. And then he came into that room, and then you were in that room. Then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. And again, as it goes backwards compared to as you were thinking about it forward, what do you notice?
[101:34] C: It's not as bothering me as much.
[101:37] B: I know.
[101:37] A: Isn't that Cool. Notice even as you were telling us about it forward, it was already less than it normally used to be. Isn't that cool?
[101:44] B: Huh?
[101:45] A: You can remember all that happening?
[101:47] C: Yes.
[101:48] A: You can remember putting your jeans on?
[101:49] C: Yes.
[101:50] A: Stop putting on your jeans. Say, I'm not putting on my jeans. Well, then stop him from doing that. He's not doing that. Say that. We'll stop him from holding you down. Say he's not holding you down. We'll stop him from forcing himself on you. Say he's not forcing himself on me. We'll stop him from choking you out. See, he's not doing that.
[102:04] C: He's not doing that.
[102:05] A: Well, then stop that from happening. It is not happening.
[102:07] C: It's not happening.
[102:08] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[102:10] C: It no longer exists.
[102:11] A: That's right. And again, close your eyes and let that earlier, you know that's over, finished. That no longer exists. That you escape, that you're away, that you're free. Let her know how free you are now to leave the house. Clearly, because you're here.
[102:25] B: Hi. That's right.
[102:26] A: Let her know how free you are to leave the house. That's right. So that she's getting it.
[102:30] B: Right.
[102:31] A: What do you notice happening?
[102:33] C: I just noticing more calmness.
[102:38] A: You are noticing more calm and you're relaxing more, which is really unusual to have happen when you think about those difficult things.
[102:46] C: Yes.
[102:47] A: What do you think that means?
[102:49] C: That my mind, I'm finally, like, letting that go, I guess.
[102:55] A: Like finally realizing that it's letting go of you.
[102:58] C: Okay.
[102:59] A: You've never been holding it. It's had a hold of you. Not because it wanted you to feel bad, but it didn't know it was over. So the coolest part, when your brain gets that it doesn't exist, it stops causing the feelings. It goes, oh, well, never mind. Because it's only been causing the feelings to try to motivate you to get the moment to stop. When it gets that it stopped, it goes, oh, well, in her mind. Sorry.
[103:26] B: Right.
[103:27] A: It's not the craziest thing in the world. But notice what happens as your brain gets that it stopped. You're not feeling it.
[103:36] B: Right.
[103:37] A: We still don't like the experience.
[103:39] B: Right.
[103:39] A: We never will. Got it.
[103:42] C: Yes.
[103:43] A: But we don't have to like it to get free from it.
[103:48] B: Right.
[103:48] A: Check it out.
[103:50] B: Right? Right.
[103:53] A: And it's not even about accepting it. It's just about knowing that it's over, that no longer exists. And we want you to be much more empowered, grounded and settled in you.
[104:08] B: Right.
[104:09] A: So that you're much more comfortable in your own skin.
[104:13] B: Right.
[104:14] A: That at a deeper level because you already knew it up here, you're getting. That's not about me. That's about him not being well.
[104:26] B: Right.
[104:28] A: And then if I ever get in a relationship with another person again, I'm damn well holding the keys. You don't get to do anything to me unless I decide. Because the women who have most successful relationships with men are women who hold the keys. We're not there yet, but that's just something in the background.
[104:49] C: Yeah.
[104:49] A: You follow me with that?
[104:53] B: Yeah.
[104:54] A: And see, your unconscious knows more than you do.
[104:57] B: Right.
[104:57] A: It's going to even travel back because we know that some of the programming that got installed on us happened well before those moments.
[105:07] B: Right.
[105:08] A: That led me to get into a relationship with a person that does that kind of stuff. You follow me with that.
[105:13] B: Right.
[105:14] A: Like, so some of that has had something to do with my own feeling of good enoughness or worth or lovability or whether. Oh, your childhood. So good. And see, what's going to happen is your unconscious is going to travel back down towards your childhood and bring a different moment to mind because it knows where those programs got installed. Yes, definitely. Get another drink of water. So good.
[105:39] C: Can I use the restroom?
[105:40] A: You can, of course. Let's take a break. We'll take a break right now. And we'll also use the. Well. Yeah, you could. Isn't that always a relief? Yeah. Always better if you have to go to the bathroom.
[105:55] B: Yeah.
[105:56] A: So just check in. What are you noticing?
[105:59] C: I mean, I feel good. I mean, I feel like free. I mean, I feel like it's not as heavy like that. I know I'm repeating myself, but I just. I definitely feel lighter. It doesn't feel like it's holding me down.
[106:13] A: Notice how it's not feeling like it's happening anymore.
[106:15] C: Yes.
[106:17] B: Yeah.
[106:17] A: And it's not holding you down. Oh, he's not holding you down.
[106:20] C: That's him.
[106:22] A: That's right.
[106:23] C: That's one thing that would always go like. I would always replay my mind over.
[106:27] A: And over and over.
[106:27] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[106:32] A: And check it out right now, even as you replay it in your mind.
[106:35] C: It still hurts, to be honest.
[106:36] A: But it doesn't. I don't know. I want you to check with that. I don't know if you're actually hurting.
[106:42] C: Maybe it's just.
[106:45] A: So check. See if it's actually causing hurt.
[106:48] C: No, it's not like actually causing.
[106:49] A: It's not causing hurt anymore. We don't like that he did it. We don't like that that happened to me. Got it?
[106:56] C: Yes.
[106:57] A: We can conceive of having been with somebody who didn't treat me like that or do that stuff.
[107:03] B: Right?
[107:04] A: So the lingering piece that may be stuck, and that's why I kind of want to flush that out, is no longer that he did it.
[107:12] B: Right.
[107:12] A: You're not actually troubled right now over what happened. Isn't that crazy? But what might be troubling still is coming from the thought that he shouldn't have done it. Like he shouldn't have treated me like that. He shouldn't have done those things. I shouldn't have been with someone like that or whatever that shouldn't have done it. That only shows up because your intellect can conceive of an alternative outcome to something that's already over.
[107:39] B: Right?
[107:40] A: So a parallel example, but it'll make sense. Sense as we look at it over here. Think of a guy, a year ago, his brother had gone on a motorcycle ride. He'd asked him to go. He didn't go. His brother dies.
[107:54] B: He'S feeling guilty.
[107:55] A: Now he's thinking he's feeling guilty because he should have gone on the ride, right? But he's not actually feeling guilty because he should have gone. He's feeling guilty because intellectually he can conceive of having gone. And if he had, his brother might still be alive and that would be better. So here's where the problem comes in. Your intellectual brain can conceive of all sorts of alternatives to stuff that's already over. Your emotional brain works like an animal's brain. And an animal can only conceive of doing something that it can actually do. Meaning if an animal can't do it, it can't even think of doing it. It's why porcupines aren't trying to build hang gliders to fly, Right? It's why dogs aren't depressed that they can't climb the tree because they're not thinking that they should be able to. Got it. So an animal's brain, this sounds crazy, but an animal's brain lives that if you can think it, that means that you can do it. So basically, his brain is saying, hurry up, go on the motorcycle ride with your brother a year ago, Quick. Now, can he do it?
[109:09] B: No.
[109:10] A: So when our brain gets the first thing that we've just done, which is it no longer exists, or the second thing, there's nothing to be done, it stops causing the feeling. So watch. I'm simply going to say to you, well, then, stop them from being violent with you. Quick. And you're gonna say there's nothing to be done. Say that there's nothing to be done.
[109:32] B: No. Hurry.
[109:33] A: Stop him from being violent with you.
[109:34] B: Quick.
[109:35] A: Say there's nothing to be done. No. Come on, we'll go together. Let's go.
[109:37] B: Hurry.
[109:37] C: Stop him.
[109:37] A: Come on, hurry.
[109:38] C: There's nothing to be done.
[109:39] B: Right?
[109:40] A: Why? Because it no longer exists. And now, as you get it, check in. What do you notice? What are you noticing now? Isn't that interesting?
[109:53] C: I'm noticing that it no longer exists.
[109:56] A: That's right. And how much more free you are.
[110:01] B: Right.
[110:01] A: That it's not hurting. That doesn't mean that if I go to the witness stand and I'm recalling what happened, I'm not going to have sadness for the earlier me for what she went through.
[110:15] B: Right.
[110:16] A: Like so if I work with a survivor of trafficking and they're going to have to testify against their trafficker, I don't want them reliving the moment because they do the thing that you don't want to do, which is freeze. Well, that's not very effective at being able to tell people what happened. Do you follow me with that? But I also don't want to be. Well, you know, smiley as I'm talking about. And then he punched me harder. And then he punched me.
[110:37] B: Right.
[110:37] A: Like that wouldn't work either. Did you follow me with that? So the emotion will be matching what happened while at the same time you're here. Because what you'll be describing is a really sucky thing that happened to you, but you won't be reliving the sucky thing as you describe it. Do you follow me with that? That's how we want it to be. Does that make sense? Yeah. So we're all about you becoming more free, and we want to rewire faulty programming that contributed to getting into relationship with somebody who said you can't leave the house and was violent and was forceful. Got it?
[111:29] C: Yes.
[111:29] B: Yeah.
[111:30] A: So again, you just slightly lower your jaw and you relax your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper. And notice just immediately when that happens, what starts to happen in your body. Isn't it interesting that things begin to settle down a little bit more just by the start of lowering the jaw. Then your breathing naturally becomes a little slower and you open up more awareness and you notice more space. When you notice more space, you're becoming more free to be that much more okay in you. And because that unconscious knows it again, to travel down the timeline, growing you earlier and younger to other moments that it Knows would be useful to bring to your awareness for us to unplug and clear.
[112:24] B: Right.
[112:24] A: Some you might be conscious of, others might be in that background that you're not knowing, that you don't know, that your unconscious knows. That's right. And what moment Natalie's coming to mind now? It's so good. You're so.
[112:42] C: I don't now. I feel like my childhood's coming up.
[112:45] A: It is, isn't it? That's why it's coming up.
[112:47] B: Right.
[112:47] A: And what's a moment of something that happened? You got one. You're how old?
[112:54] C: I would see about 7, 8.
[112:58] A: 7, 8. And again, we're describing one thing that happened. Okay, so, like, you're seven or eight. You're like, where?
[113:03] C: In my house?
[113:04] A: You're at your house? In the bedroom? No, thank goodness it's not in the bedroom. I only sleep on the couch from now on. Because bedrooms are not a good place to be.
[113:15] C: No, the bedroom.
[113:21] B: Right.
[113:22] A: So you're in the house and you're where?
[113:24] C: In the living room?
[113:24] A: In the living room.
[113:25] B: Right?
[113:25] A: Yeah.
[113:26] B: Right.
[113:26] A: And like, are you by the couch or the chair? You're by the sofa. Are you sitting or standing?
[113:31] C: Standing.
[113:31] A: Standing. And then what happened next?
[113:33] C: My stepdad gets very angry.
[113:35] A: So stepdad's mad. You might have done stuff that kids do.
[113:40] C: A lot of times he would just make up stuff.
[113:42] A: Well, you might have been doing stuff.
[113:43] B: That kids do, which are just normal.
[113:46] A: Things that kids do, which has nothing to do with him.
[113:49] C: I think he just wanted. Excuse.
[113:52] A: Well, he got mad to hurt me.
[113:54] B: Right.
[113:54] A: So he got mad at whatever it was that he said that you were doing that he didn't think he should be doing.
[113:58] C: Most of the time he just makes stuff up.
[114:00] A: Right. Whatever it was.
[114:01] B: Right.
[114:01] A: So he was mad, and then he.
[114:02] C: Did what he would always pull his belt out.
[114:05] A: Well, just one time.
[114:06] C: Several times.
[114:07] A: I know we only want to think of it as one time. Good job.
[114:10] B: I know.
[114:10] A: You're doing so good. It's so perfect. So that time he took his belt off, right? As like, he was threatening to be able to hit you with it.
[114:19] C: He told me he was going to hit me.
[114:20] A: Yeah. So he said he was going to hit you.
[114:22] B: Right.
[114:22] A: And then what happened next?
[114:23] C: He hit me.
[114:23] A: And then he. You stood there and he hit you with the bell. Where did he hit you?
[114:28] C: On my butt.
[114:29] A: On your butt? On your back? Right. In your legs. Right. And all that hurt when he was doing it?
[114:33] C: Yes.
[114:33] B: Right.
[114:33] A: But better than your face.
[114:35] B: Right.
[114:36] A: And then what happened next?
[114:38] C: He stopped.
[114:39] A: Right. Which was Better than when he was hitting you.
[114:42] B: Right.
[114:43] A: And what might have happened next?
[114:45] C: That was it.
[114:46] A: Then you went off, you went to your room.
[114:47] B: Right.
[114:47] A: And then that was over. And then later on you did something more fun, like go to Legoland with the kids. Yeah, right. And see Ninjango.
[114:58] B: Right.
[114:59] A: They have that crazy thing, like do this thing, whatever that is.
[115:03] B: Right.
[115:04] A: And you went to the park.
[115:05] C: Yes.
[115:05] A: You have to do that class. So we got doing the class, we got going to the park, we got being at like a language.
[115:10] B: Right.
[115:10] A: Then you're in your room and then he stopped and then he was hitting with the belt at different parts of your body and then he had taken the belt off and then he was mad at you. And then you were doing whatever kids do.
[115:19] B: Right.
[115:20] A: And as we go backwards again compared to forward, what do you notice?
[115:26] C: I guess about the same, but I felt like I've let a lot of it go.
[115:30] A: Isn't that crazy? Notice already how it's less. See? And it's not about letting that go, it's about this last little part that hasn't done, which is the re education. Because again, that earlier you knew that it wasn't about you, but didn't feel that way.
[115:52] B: Make sense?
[115:52] C: Yes.
[115:53] A: Because when we're little we're trained to believe if it's bad, it must be because I've done something even when I know I didn't do anything.
[115:59] B: Right.
[116:00] A: We want to get that news in. So close your eyes and let her know. Close your eyes. Picture the earlier you. Let her know that over, finished, completed, defeated, it no longer exists. Let her know that him acting like that and being that way had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Let her know how free she is now.
[116:27] B: Right.
[116:29] A: To go to Legoland or leave the house. That's right. Let her know that you're okay. Right. And as this starts to get in to that earlier you. What are you noticing now?
[116:44] C: Calmness.
[116:45] A: It is calmness. Right. That was the first part of the programming that started the lens jamming in. Other experiences. But the lens jamming in makes me feel like it's about me and then makes me have a lot more, what we're going to call insecurity inside and a lot more self consciousness. So like I got to be on edge and worried. Walk on eggshells, because I don't want to do anything that upsets over there. But no matter what I do, I can't not walk on eggshells. And there's an upset over there. Don't you follow me with that. So it's of one of those things where I keep trying to do it the right way, and no matter what I do, it's not the right way. And that's because you didn't know when you were a kid that the jukebox was broken.
[117:31] B: Right.
[117:31] A: Jukeboxes back in the day were really cool. They were before iPads.
[117:34] C: Yeah.
[117:34] A: Ipods, all that other kind of fun stuff.
[117:36] B: Right.
[117:36] A: You know, and you could put money in and you could pick different songs from different genres, from different artists, from different things and play them all. Is really cool. You didn't know that the jukebox was broken, only had the one song. So you put in a coin to put in a different button. You'd be like, why is it giving the same song? I know I press different buttons. Let me try again. You're like, what is wrong with me? Why is this thing not working right? It just was broken, Right. You didn't know that he wasn't. Well, right now you're getting it.
[118:03] B: Right.
[118:03] A: Isn't that a good news thing?
[118:06] B: Right.
[118:07] A: Yeah. And again, your brain is going to travel back to another moment.
[118:13] B: Right.
[118:14] A: Notice how they're easier and easier to get through. Kind of picking up speed.
[118:20] B: Right.
[118:21] A: Because we want to generalize it out to things that have structural similarities so we can rewire. So really cool little thing. I don't know whether you know this either, but our brain is not set up like the rest of our body. So if I got gangrene in my pinky, you could cut my pinky finger off. It wouldn't affect the rest of my body.
[118:40] B: Right.
[118:41] A: So that's kind of like a tree, where we can cut off one limb of the tree and the tree still grows. Like, it doesn't kill the tree. The tree, though, is connected through a tap root, meaning it's got a source root that grows into the trunk, into the limbs, into the branches, into the leaves. But it all goes to the original source. Yes. There are other roots that help secure it to the ground. But there's one source root.
[119:04] B: Right?
[119:04] A: So if a tree gets ripped up from the ground, tree's dead. Our brain is rhizomatic. Either of you heard that term before? Rhizomatic. So a rhizome is the other plant in botany. So it would be like mushrooms. It would be like mint leaves. It would be like dandelions. So they don't grow from a single source root. They have multiple multiplicities of Roots that are interconnected through different layers and connections and all that. Our crab grasses in Florida are rhizomatic. You can cut out a square of the crab grass, pick it all up, plant it somewhere, and it'll grow. The originating might go back to the originating source it came from or that it might grow. All right, so there's no one source. It's all connected through multiplicity. So what that means is, as we begin to get a hold of some linchpins of experiences, your brain gets to have widespread activation in rewiring the system, updating to the present moment. Because you're always going to do better when you're now than if you're trapped back there or way out in the future. Got it?
[120:24] B: Yeah.
[120:25] A: So again, as your brain travels back, it's gonna bring another moment to mind.
[120:29] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[120:30] A: This one happened when.
[120:33] C: I guess when I was. I don't know, I. 17.
[120:45] A: Yeah, 17. Right. So you might have been.
[120:47] B: Are.
[120:47] A: You're 17? Are you home?
[120:50] C: I'm home.
[120:51] B: You're home.
[120:51] A: Not in the bedroom?
[120:53] C: No.
[120:54] B: Okay.
[120:54] A: Not in the living room?
[120:55] C: No.
[120:57] A: All right, good. At least we're going to different rooms. Okay, so you're home. You're where in the house? Be here.
[121:06] B: Hi.
[121:08] A: So proud of you. You're doing so good.
[121:14] B: Right.
[121:15] A: So you're in the house?
[121:16] C: Yeah, I'm in the house.
[121:17] A: Daytime or nighttime?
[121:19] C: Afternoon.
[121:21] B: Afternoon. Right.
[121:22] A: And you're doing what?
[121:24] C: I. I don't know.
[121:26] A: I was in the kitchen, bebopping around in the kitchen, doing. Right.
[121:29] B: Good.
[121:29] A: And then what happened next?
[121:32] C: I was living with my boyfriend, right.
[121:34] A: Good job, good detail.
[121:35] C: He was, when I got home from work, very angry.
[121:40] A: Yeah.
[121:40] B: Right.
[121:40] A: So he got home, he's pissed.
[121:42] C: Have a good day. I don't know why.
[121:43] A: Something, you know, whatever. It was usual.
[121:46] B: Right.
[121:46] C: And started to make a drink.
[121:49] B: Right.
[121:50] C: He was just.
[121:52] A: He started to make a drink.
[121:53] C: Yeah.
[121:54] B: Yeah, Right?
[121:54] C: Yeah.
[121:55] A: Cuz I had a bad day, you know? I mean, that's what you do when you have a bad day, a good day, a day that ends in y.
[122:00] C: Always did it as soon as he got home. He drinked and sold. Literally past.
[122:04] A: Oh, good.
[122:05] B: All right.
[122:05] A: Let's not pick a guy like that again.
[122:06] C: Oh, I don't think I ever will.
[122:08] A: Okay, good.
[122:08] C: Yeah, I think I learned my lesson after the last one. I really, really do.
[122:14] A: We just want to make sure it sinks in.
[122:18] B: Right.
[122:19] A: Because the guy's gonna be really lucky if you allow him to spend time with you.
[122:23] C: I don't know if I ever will date again.
[122:25] B: Yeah.
[122:26] C: But I. I do Think I. If I ever do, I will never, ever.
[122:31] A: Well, it has to be that the guy's lucky that you're gonna allow him to spend time with you. That's how it's gotta feel for a woman, right? Because a woman needs a man about as much as a fish needs a bicycle, which is not at all. I mean, the penis wasn't even designed for her pleasure. It was designed to make a baby. She's got a body part totally about.
[122:51] B: Her own pleasure, right?
[122:54] A: So a woman needs a man about as much as a fish needs a bicycle. Bicycle. She doesn't need him to work or make an income.
[123:00] B: She doesn't need him, right?
[123:04] A: So she gets that she's got the goods. And that if he's gonna hang out with her, he's really lucky.
[123:11] B: Right?
[123:11] A: Okay, so he came home, he started pouring a drink, right? Because he was in a shitty mood. But he does that whether he's in a shitty mood or not. So he's pouring a drink, right? And then what happened next?
[123:20] C: He's just yelling and scratching, screaming at me, tell me I'm not doing something right.
[123:25] A: You got to be doing more.
[123:26] B: Right?
[123:26] A: Of course.
[123:26] B: Right.
[123:26] C: It's always my fault.
[123:27] A: Totally your fault, everything.
[123:29] B: Right.
[123:29] A: And you're like, this really sounds like how I grew up. I thought I got away from this.
[123:35] C: It's just. It's always something.
[123:36] A: Something you did that you didn't do, that you should have done, that didn't do. Right. Whatever.
[123:40] C: And then he just starts getting a violent.
[123:42] B: Right.
[123:42] A: So he might be, like, punching you or.
[123:45] C: Yeah, he always would like to hit me anywhere but my face, right?
[123:51] A: Well, no.
[123:52] B: Right.
[123:52] A: I mean, you gotta hide it.
[123:54] C: Sucker punch anywhere.
[123:56] A: So different part where you could cover your body. Right? And so he might have punched you and that hurt.
[124:01] C: Yes.
[124:01] B: Right.
[124:01] A: And then what happened next? Notice how he's not. I know. Isn't that much better that when you're remembering that he punched you then it's not feeling like he's punching you now?
[124:10] C: Yes.
[124:11] A: Isn't that a lot better? Yeah, we like that, too. Good job. I'm so proud of you.
[124:16] B: Right.
[124:16] A: So then he punched you, right? And then what happened next?
[124:19] C: I wanted. I. I didn't remember second. I know. I ran for the bedroom. I ran the bedroom again.
[124:26] A: Damn it. No, I meant. No, not there.
[124:28] C: I don't know. I. I remember locking the door and he just kicked it down.
[124:34] B: Right?
[124:36] C: They were very old doors, so.
[124:41] A: Kicked it down. You're like, oh, all right. That didn't work. Yeah, like, flimsy doors.
[124:46] C: It didn't take much to like, just open.
[124:48] D: He wasn't a black belt.
[124:50] C: No, no, he definitely wasn't.
[124:52] B: Right.
[124:53] C: He kicked the door and he. He grabbed his gun.
[125:01] B: Right.
[125:01] C: And it was. What do you call the gun? That revolver? Yeah. Is that the one that like we. Bullets. And he bit one bullet.
[125:08] A: Oh, good. So we're gonna play a game. We're gonna play Russian roulette. Pretty much ready to go. Right, so he did that.
[125:14] C: He did that.
[125:14] B: Put one bullet in.
[125:15] A: And then did he spin it? Yes. And then did he pull the trigger at you or him?
[125:19] C: He put it to my head.
[125:20] A: Oh, to your head.
[125:21] B: Which hit me.
[125:23] A: Oh, with the gun.
[125:24] C: Yes.
[125:24] A: That hurt.
[125:25] C: And then he pushed it.
[125:26] B: Right.
[125:27] C: And he said, if you ever leave me again.
[125:29] B: Right.
[125:30] C: You're gonna be dead.
[125:32] B: Right.
[125:32] A: Good job. Right, Right.
[125:34] B: Twice.
[125:34] C: You did it twice.
[125:35] B: Right, Good.
[125:36] A: And it didn't go.
[125:37] C: It didn't.
[125:38] A: That better? Yeah.
[125:39] B: Right.
[125:39] A: Oh, and you left it.
[125:42] C: No.
[125:42] A: Well, you did eventually.
[125:44] B: Yeah.
[125:44] A: You're not with him.
[125:45] C: No.
[125:45] B: Right.
[125:45] A: She needs to know that. That's right. She does need to know that. Because you almost got confused. No, no, wait a minute. I did. That's right.
[125:55] C: I didn't leave that day.
[125:57] A: You didn't have to leave that day.
[125:58] C: But I did leave.
[125:59] A: You did leave him.
[126:00] B: That's right.
[126:00] A: You got away.
[126:01] C: I got away.
[126:02] B: Right.
[126:02] A: Cuz after you did that twice, then he put the gun away. Yes.
[126:05] B: Right.
[126:05] A: And then that part was over. And then later on you did something more fun like get away and go to Legoland.
[126:10] C: Yes.
[126:10] B: Right.
[126:10] A: Take that class.
[126:11] C: Yes.
[126:12] B: Right.
[126:13] A: Do something fun with the kids.
[126:15] B: Right.
[126:15] A: So we got doing fun stuff with the kids. We got, you know, taking the class, we got being at Legoland, we going to the park.
[126:20] C: Right.
[126:21] A: And then he put the gun away. And then he did it. And then he did it. And then he said. Then he said, if you ever try to leave, I'll kill you. And then he had put it up to you. Then he put the bullet in and then he had grabbed his gun and then he was. Then he knocked the door down. And then you ran and locked the bedroom door and then you were in the room, then he was hitting you, and then he was screaming and yelling and then he was pouring himself a drink and then he came home in a shitty mood. And then before that you were doing whatever you do in the house, like maybe making a sandwich.
[126:52] C: I feel like I was making a sandwich. I don't know if I was.
[126:55] A: It doesn't matter.
[126:55] C: But I remember, see, this is the coolest part, him throwing A sandwich at the wall.
[126:59] B: Awesome.
[126:59] C: That's why I said a sandwich. Cuz there was something damn baloney that he didn't like. I didn't make it.
[127:05] A: Right.
[127:05] C: I didn't do something.
[127:06] B: Right.
[127:06] C: I don't remember. I just remember the sandwich hitting the wall. So that's why I said make an essay.
[127:09] A: I do that with my sandwiches all the time. Damn you, sandwich. You didn't put mayo on it. Right?
[127:22] B: Right.
[127:22] A: And you can remember him doing that?
[127:23] C: Yeah.
[127:24] B: Right.
[127:24] A: You can remember putting on your shoes. Ally, stop putting on your shoes. Well then stop him from doing that. We'll stop him from snapping. He's not doing that.
[127:34] B: Right.
[127:34] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[127:36] C: It no longer exists.
[127:37] A: Bingo.
[127:37] B: Right?
[127:38] A: And we only got out of where I was living with folks into that relationship.
[127:45] C: They kind of forced it, which I.
[127:46] A: Thought was better than living with them.
[127:48] C: Yeah.
[127:49] A: Until I realized later that it wasn't.
[127:50] B: Yeah.
[127:51] C: That's why I left.
[127:52] A: You did me, didn't you?
[127:52] C: I was so bad I moved in with him.
[127:56] B: Right, Right.
[127:58] A: So we escape, one into the next.
[128:00] C: Exactly.
[128:01] B: Right.
[128:02] A: But that's because we were this far of a vision in front. Not that far. So now we're seeing more. Yeah, we are, aren't we?
[128:12] B: Right.
[128:15] A: Isn't that better? Notice how you're seeing more?
[128:18] C: Yes.
[128:19] B: Yeah.
[128:19] A: And as you're thinking about that moment now, what are you noticing?
[128:23] C: It feels better. I mean, it's being lifted. It feels lighter.
[128:27] A: That's right. One more time. Close your eyes. Picture her and let her know that you got away, that you didn't actually die, that you're here. You get to go to Legoland.
[128:37] B: Mm, that's right.
[128:42] A: Just let her know how resourceful she is, that she got away and how much you value her and getting away and how much more you're becoming worth it to you. Because you're absolutely worth it to the kids. And you get to become worth it to you even more.
[129:08] B: Mm. Right.
[129:13] A: Because the earlier you thought she needed to be worth it to other people. And what she's really learning is that you're worth it to you. You know, the person that matters the most, she didn't need those other people to be well in order for you to turn out okay.
[129:34] B: Right? Right.
[129:40] A: To start to change your life for the better. On your way to becoming more free, becoming more okay in you. And even beginning to lighten up.
[129:54] B: Right.
[129:55] A: And as you're getting all of this and she's learning all of of it, what do you notice now happening inside?
[130:06] C: I feel free from It. I feel.
[130:08] A: You do, don't you?
[130:09] C: Yeah.
[130:10] A: Isn't that cool?
[130:11] C: Yeah.
[130:11] B: Yeah.
[130:14] A: Right.
[130:15] C: Feel like my contact's moving around a little bit.
[130:17] A: But yeah, that happens more so if you astigmatism. So I do. Oh, see, there you go. A hard time with contacts because astigmatisms. Because when I blink things get blurry sometimes.
[130:30] C: Yes, that's how it happens to me all the time.
[130:32] A: The only thing that I was able to solve it with is I had to get a hard contact because it stays. It doesn't move.
[130:39] C: But then I've tried that. But then it gets too dry.
[130:42] A: I don't like hard contacts either.
[130:44] C: And it's so uncomfortable.
[130:46] B: Yeah.
[130:46] A: The hard contacts are better now than they were because they're more porous and. And so they don't get so dry.
[130:52] C: Gave me some new ones a week ago.
[130:53] A: Did he. Hard contacts.
[130:55] C: Harder contacts. And it was just my eyes.
[130:57] B: No.
[130:57] A: Then they're not the same thing.
[130:59] C: Blurry.
[130:59] A: If they're just harder.
[131:00] C: Maybe they're just harder.
[131:01] A: Maybe that's a hard contact. The actual hard. I think it's by a Poseidon is the company that they make them. Those are not a lot of optometrists do hard contacts. There's a few in the area but. And I don't use it often. I use it when I go to do sports because they're all for distance. But in regular day to day life if I have glasses. But I don't.
[131:23] C: I can't see without my vision.
[131:25] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[131:29] A: But I get. Would always float.
[131:33] C: Yeah.
[131:34] A: When you blink.
[131:34] B: Blink.
[131:35] A: Okay, now they're ready. Don't blink. Oh, damn. They went.
[131:38] D: That are your sleeping leg, right?
[131:40] C: Yeah, that was. I didn't want to sit too long.
[131:44] B: Yeah.
[131:44] A: What happens?
[131:45] C: My leg goes to sleep when I Like when I sit like this too long.
[131:48] A: Yeah. Well that would make sense.
[131:50] C: Yeah.
[131:51] A: So you just don't want to sit that long with your legs crossed.
[131:56] C: It's more comfortable.
[131:57] A: But it is.
[131:59] B: Right.
[132:00] A: Well then you have to learn how to do the other way.
[132:01] C: Yeah, you do that. I rotate but then that leg switching back and forth to get braces. Hard braces.
[132:15] B: Yeah. Right.
[132:17] A: So what are you noticing in you right now?
[132:21] C: Feels good.
[132:22] A: It does, doesn't it?
[132:23] B: Yeah. Right, Right.
[132:26] A: Think back about the stuff that happened.
[132:30] B: You know the big thing.
[132:31] C: Yeah.
[132:32] A: You know the three times because he had to pee twice.
[132:34] C: Yeah. Yeah.
[132:39] A: And what do you notice?
[132:43] C: My mind kind of wants to go back to the, you know the choking part a little bit. It didn't feel as heavy as it.
[132:50] A: Did so the part that when he was choking you out and you went black or dark.
[132:56] B: Right.
[132:57] A: You can remember that moment?
[132:58] C: Yes.
[132:59] B: Right.
[132:59] A: Remember being there.
[133:01] B: Right.
[133:01] A: As you're remembering it now, is it more like a movie or a photograph?
[133:06] C: I would say more like a photograph.
[133:08] A: More like a photograph. So what happens if we took the photograph and moved it further away and we put a frame around it and then we shrunk it a little bit and we made it black and white?
[133:18] C: It's like it doesn't exist as much like it's there, but it's not.
[133:21] A: Isn't that interesting that as it moves further away, gets a little bit smaller and you put a frame around it and. And it's black and white. Try to feel troubled by it.
[133:31] C: Can't.
[133:32] A: That's weird. So you can remember that he did it.
[133:36] C: Yeah.
[133:37] A: Right. And notice. And that's one of the ways you're going to notice, by the way, what we've done, that's different. Because what happened with that moment is you started thinking about it and it started to turn on, but then it didn't really turn on.
[133:54] B: Right.
[133:54] A: It was almost like a false start. Like it was a. But then it didn't stay. Isn't that interesting?
[134:00] C: Yes.
[134:01] A: So that's. Because what's been ingrained in the pattern loop is that anytime I think about it, it's as if it's happening. So as your brain is rewiring and that same thing is triggered, but it's not happening. So it goes right away. So silly example, think of, like, you know, that I don't know what show it is, but the show that they have the big boxing glove that comes out and knocks people off, the thing that they're trying to run. You ever seen that show before?
[134:34] C: Like Wipeout or something?
[134:35] A: It could be like Wipeout, but it's like a boxing glove that comes out.
[134:39] B: Right.
[134:39] C: Or is it like the ninja?
[134:40] A: Well, it could be one of those kind of things.
[134:41] C: So I don't really watch it.
[134:43] A: So. So say, like every day you walk by a room at 2 o'clock every day you walk by the same room at 2:00 every day. And as you walk by the room, there's one of those punching things with the boxing glove on. And so it hits you in the arm. Right. So knowing that it's going to hit you in the arm, as you're getting ready to walk by the door, you're kind of tensing up.
[135:07] B: Right.
[135:07] A: So that when it hits you, it doesn't hurt so much.
[135:10] B: All right.
[135:11] A: It's not catching you off guard. It doesn't hurt. Well, then we take that device away. So it's gone. But you didn't know. Well, of course, as you're going to walk by that door, you're going to do the same thing. But when you're not getting hit, it releases.
[135:27] B: Right.
[135:28] A: And then over time, what's going to happen is that will happen less and less and less because your body brain is being retrained to a new normal.
[135:39] B: Right.
[135:39] A: It had been used to and now it's retraining to a new normal. Isn't that interesting?
[135:47] C: Yes.
[135:47] B: Yeah.
[135:48] A: That's why you notice that show up momentarily. But it didn't get as intense. It didn't last as long.
[135:57] B: Right.
[135:59] A: Cool. Can I ask something? I don't know.
[136:02] D: Come on. So we talk a lot.
[136:04] A: Come on. That's so good. I told Natalie I'm not going to.
[136:09] D: Talk, but I just want to help.
[136:10] A: Oh, man. Lauren, come on.
[136:12] D: She has a lot of reminders. And she still lives in the home where all of the these events have happened. And we've talked about making changes with whatever may be in the room. Specific furniture that really kind of re trigger her. Is this kind of this exposure then. Because she's going home to it after today's.
[136:29] A: I would like to be thinking about that right now. What's something in the home that normally when you see it, it makes you.
[136:36] C: Well, I keep removing that stuff. Like the first thing was the red curtains.
[136:40] B: Yeah.
[136:40] C: Because that was every. That was what I kept seeing when it happened. And I had to get rid of it.
[136:45] B: Okay.
[136:45] C: And I got rid of it and put white curtains. Made a huge difference.
[136:49] A: I'm sure it did.
[136:50] C: And then it was the nightstand because that was his side.
[136:53] B: Yes.
[136:54] C: I kept. I just remember seeing that whole. His side most of the time. So I put the nightstand. I'm not using it. And put it in the closet and I move it felt better. And then I received the. What do you call it? I can't think what it's called.
[137:08] A: Headboard.
[137:09] C: Right, Headboard. Sorry. So I covered it with a comforter and you know, just doing little things like that to make it look different. And it's helped. But you know, still the broom, you know.
[137:21] A: So think of watch. I want you to think of it right now because that's what you had been doing when you were still at the effect of what you went through.
[137:29] B: Right.
[137:29] A: So that would be why your brain would confuse anything that's similar and think it's same when trauma gets unplugged. And your brain reads it as data. Similar gets read as similar, but different. Similar. And the parts that weren't part of the problem.
[137:51] B: Right.
[137:52] A: Just like the issue wasn't the name Taylor Swift on the shirt, that is not the part of the experience that was upsetting.
[137:59] B: Right.
[138:00] A: You follow me with that?
[138:01] C: Yes.
[138:05] A: So what I want you to pay attention to is what you notice that's different. So even if you think about being in the house around something that is a reminder of thinking about it right now, what do you notice? I think about the bathroom and being in the bathroom.
[138:26] C: Surprisingly, that hasn't bothered me.
[138:28] A: It's the bathroom. Well, that was because it was a better place to be.
[138:32] C: Maybe it's mostly like, I guess right now is my bed.
[138:37] B: Yeah.
[138:37] C: You know, like, especially his side of the bed.
[138:40] A: Okay, so that's kind of what. So think about that right now.
[138:45] B: Okay.
[138:45] A: Does he have a side of the bed anymore?
[138:51] C: I don't know. Like, when I'm picturing it, I picture him on that bed. So kind of, in a way, I guess.
[138:55] A: Is he there?
[138:56] C: No.
[138:56] A: Oh, he's still living with you? No. Oh, he isn't. So does he have a side of the bed anymore? No, he doesn't have a side of the bed. Oh, you mean the whole bed is yours?
[139:06] C: Yes.
[139:07] A: See, I wonder what it would be like for you to think about that bed. The whole of it is yours. Meaning you can sleep on any side you want. You can even sleep diagonal if you want to.
[139:15] C: It's true. I always stay on my side. Like, I can't.
[139:18] B: You see?
[139:18] C: I wonder what Comfortable on that side.
[139:20] A: And see, I wonder what that would be like if you went diagonal. I know, right?
[139:26] C: Scary.
[139:27] A: Well, what is it? Scary?
[139:29] C: I don't know.
[139:29] A: You don't know right now, do you? No, but check. Think about being in the room.
[139:34] C: Okay.
[139:34] A: And you can remember that at one time he had a side of the bed. But you could change the mattress and reverse it. You could move the bed to a different wall so it's not in the same location.
[139:46] C: Yes.
[139:47] B: Right.
[139:48] A: You could be recognizing that there is no side of the bed that is. Is there?
[139:56] B: No.
[139:57] A: Even if he had slept on that side, he doesn't actually.
[140:00] B: Right.
[140:01] A: He doesn't have a side of the bed, does he?
[140:03] C: No.
[140:04] A: No. You and the kids could lay in the bed.
[140:10] C: I'm sorry, I just. Like, my mind went somewhere else.
[140:12] A: Like, it's beautiful.
[140:13] C: Like you're. You're saying that, and my mind kind of like it. It like separates. It's like I'm picturing Myself in my bed and I'm picturing him in his bed in jail.
[140:27] A: Yeah, right. He's in a bed in jail.
[140:30] C: Yes.
[140:30] A: Yes.
[140:31] C: So I don't. That was just crazy. Like it just like separated.
[140:34] A: It did, didn't it? Yes. Because he's in the bed in jail. Yes, that's right.
[140:40] C: It felt really good.
[140:41] A: I bet it did.
[140:42] D: Should she sleep with a picture of mug shot on his kid?
[140:47] A: No, I can't.
[140:48] C: My phone. And sometimes, like I haven't looked at it in a while, but sometimes I get really angry. I'll look at it and it just lets. Right before kickboxing. Yes. I always picture him, you know, during cake boxing, you know.
[141:01] B: Yeah.
[141:01] C: It's something really empowering about it.
[141:03] A: I just.
[141:04] C: Because I really like to watch.
[141:06] D: I go to that class.
[141:07] A: Yeah. Yeah. So just check it out. Notice that it's separated. Yeah.
[141:11] C: That was a little crazy.
[141:12] A: It is crazy. Right?
[141:14] B: Right.
[141:14] A: Because he doesn't have a side of the bed. That's right. And now as you think of the bed, that it's all yours. Yes, that's right.
[141:25] C: Where is he? He's. He's in jail.
[141:28] A: He is, isn't he?
[141:29] C: Yes.
[141:29] B: Right?
[141:30] A: Yes.
[141:31] C: He has his own bed.
[141:33] B: Right.
[141:33] A: He's got his own bed in jail.
[141:35] C: Yeah.
[141:35] B: Right.
[141:35] C: He's got a share room.
[141:37] A: He probably does.
[141:40] C: Yeah.
[141:40] A: And who knows what that person is doing? Right.
[141:47] B: Right.
[141:48] A: You're free.
[141:48] C: Yes.
[141:49] A: He's in jail. That's pretty different. Yes. Oh, and you can come and go.
[141:55] C: I can come and go.
[141:56] B: Right.
[141:56] A: You can leave the house when you want.
[141:57] C: I have a phone now.
[141:58] A: And you do have a phone now.
[141:59] C: Drive.
[142:00] A: And you can drive.
[142:00] B: Right? Right.
[142:04] A: That's right. You can.
[142:07] C: And go where I want.
[142:08] A: You can, can't you?
[142:09] B: Yes.
[142:09] A: Even to kickboxing? Yes, that's right.
[142:13] D: And in the backyard you can see. Step on mangoes if you want.
[142:16] C: I can wear what I want.
[142:18] A: You can, can't you?
[142:20] B: Right.
[142:21] A: And as you're checking it all out, what are you noticing?
[142:24] C: Freedom.
[142:25] A: You do, don't you?
[142:26] C: Being free.
[142:27] A: Yeah. That's what you're going to realize more and more. The stuff that had been connected because it was structurally similar will be getting disconnected because that wasn't part of the problem.
[142:45] B: Make sense?
[142:45] C: Yes.
[142:47] A: And that's the distinction that starts to happen in your brain because it's no longer active.
[142:53] B: Right.
[142:54] A: When it's active, there's nothing I can tell myself to feel different. So the silly example would be a rabbit is in here looking out the door at a fox. And the rabbit's all Panicky. And we try to convince the rabbit bunny you're safe. You're inside, the fox can't get you. And the rabbit's looking at us, goes, there's a fox. Like, I don't care what you're telling me. There's a fox. Got it. So it doesn't matter what I know until it gets in here. It doesn't change. That's why what you notice that's different is you're feeling different about the stuff.
[143:33] B: Right.
[143:33] A: We don't still like it, but it's not causing all of that disruption in you. It's not making you feel nervous, tense, irritable, agitated. It's not feeling like you're there in it again. It's not doing any of that.
[143:49] B: Right.
[143:50] A: You actually have a whole bed, not just half.
[143:54] C: He might have half or like a smaller.
[143:56] A: He's probably got a twin. You definitely have a much bigger bed. And you have the whole bed now. Yes, that's right. You can even lay sideways if you want. Not just diagonally.
[144:05] C: It feels so big.
[144:06] B: Right.
[144:07] A: You can lay sideways.
[144:08] B: Right.
[144:08] A: That's why if you were hanging out with the kids and you guys all wanted to watch a movie, you could do it in the bed.
[144:13] C: Yes.
[144:13] B: Right.
[144:13] A: You got plenty of space.
[144:14] B: You got.
[144:15] A: The whole bed is yours. Yes. He doesn't actually have a side.
[144:19] C: Where is he? He's a job.
[144:21] A: That's right. Good job.
[144:26] B: Right.
[144:26] A: So what are you noticing? It's.
[144:28] C: It feels good. It just feels like I'm finally separating it. Like that's not there anymore. He's not in the house. He's not making a drink. He's not, you know, he's not in the living room watching tv. He's in jail watching tv.
[144:43] B: He's maybe.
[144:44] C: And yeah, he's probably not making a drink. I don't bet. No, he's there and he doesn't.
[144:51] A: He's in jail and he actually can't get out.
[144:55] B: Right.
[144:55] A: He's got all the doors that lock from the other side. So even if he tries to do what I felt like in the relationship, isn't that cool?
[145:03] B: All right.
[145:03] C: Because I felt like I was locked. I felt like.
[145:05] A: I know. How about now?
[145:07] C: I don't feel like he's. I feel like he doesn't have control over me.
[145:12] A: He doesn't, does he?
[145:13] C: No.
[145:14] B: No.
[145:15] A: Nor does this. That happened in the past, whether it be with him or stepdad or that boyfriend or. Caught it.
[145:28] C: Yeah.
[145:28] B: Yeah.
[145:29] A: Notice how you're getting free.
[145:31] C: Yeah.
[145:31] A: Where's mom in all this?
[145:33] C: My mom was Supporting it. I was running him.
[145:37] A: The stepdad.
[145:38] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[145:40] C: She was mean.
[145:42] A: And that's bio mom.
[145:43] C: Yes.
[145:44] B: Okay.
[145:44] C: Yep.
[145:45] A: So let's think of something with bio mom, because bio mom clearly wasn't well either. Oh. Isn't it weird that you didn't have the most loving people and you can be a loving mom.
[145:54] C: I feel like it's because I have like there were loving people in my. In my life. My grandmother, my. My aunt, my grandfather. There were other people in my life.
[146:04] B: There were.
[146:04] A: Weren't there other people that you got.
[146:07] C: Love from my mom or my dad. You know, wasn't that person.
[146:12] B: Right.
[146:13] A: And you didn't need it from them as primary caregivers in order for you to be it for yours. Got it.
[146:28] C: Yes.
[146:29] A: That's why you got away.
[146:31] C: Yes.
[146:31] B: Right.
[146:32] A: That's why you ran out.
[146:33] C: I ran far. I went from Missouri to Florida. I didn't want to be anywhere near. That's one reason why I came here. Isn't that cool for a new life?
[146:41] A: Good job. Yeah.
[146:44] C: Unfortunately that I met, you know, my ex husband there and then got back into all this.
[146:51] A: But.
[146:53] B: Yeah.
[146:54] C: But it was the best thing I ever did was to leave.
[146:58] A: Yeah.
[147:00] B: Right. All you valuing you. Mm.
[147:05] A: And now you're getting it more. Yes.
[147:08] B: Mm. Right. Right.
[147:12] A: Isn't that cool? So what's a thing that comes up with mom?
[147:17] C: She was.
[147:19] A: We got a moment.
[147:21] C: My moment's coming up. It's just how she used to make fun of me.
[147:24] A: Oh, good. Think of one of them. So you might have been how old? And she might have done what?
[147:29] C: I would have been like eight.
[147:31] B: Yeah.
[147:31] C: And I remember. I don't know why they were going through my room.
[147:36] B: Right.
[147:36] C: And they found a.
[147:37] A: You know, cuz 8 year olds have a lot of.
[147:38] C: To hide diaries.
[147:40] A: No. Like drugs and you know, alcohol.
[147:42] C: They thought I was hiding something.
[147:43] B: Of course.
[147:44] A: That's what eight year olds do. By the way, did you know that.
[147:46] C: Was it eight or she was. I don't think that. No, I was like 10.
[147:52] A: Yeah, same thing. 10 year olds do that a lot too.
[147:55] C: So I was 10 and they thought I was doing something.
[147:59] B: Right.
[148:00] A: So they were in your room looking for whatever it was.
[148:02] C: Yeah, because they. Because they thought I had a boyfriend and they didn't like it.
[148:06] B: Right.
[148:07] C: And I meant like, don't most, you know, kids have a boyfriend? They say that it's a boyfriend, but you know, it's just.
[148:12] B: Right.
[148:13] C: So they got my diary and my. My mom and stepdad used to own several business. We had a pizza restaurant.
[148:21] B: Yeah.
[148:22] C: And I remember they took the diary there.
[148:24] A: To the pizza joint?
[148:25] C: Yes.
[148:25] A: Oh, cool.
[148:26] C: And opened it up and there were people there.
[148:28] A: Oh, beautiful.
[148:29] C: And open it up and read part.
[148:32] B: Right.
[148:33] C: Made fun of me. My mom just make fun of me?
[148:35] A: She might have done what? She might have said what?
[148:39] C: I don't remember exactly, but she just. I just remember her.
[148:43] A: So do you remember her reading it and then like making fun of you about what you wrote?
[148:47] C: Yeah.
[148:47] B: Right.
[148:48] A: Do you remember putting your pants on?
[148:49] C: Yes.
[148:50] A: Well, stop putting on your pants.
[148:51] C: Okay?
[148:52] A: I'm not putting on my pants.
[148:53] B: Right.
[148:53] C: I'm not putting on my pants.
[148:54] A: Well then stop her from making fun of you. Say she's not doing that. She's not doing that, I said. Then where is it? Say it no longer exists. By the way, was that about you or her?
[149:02] C: It was about her.
[149:03] A: Yeah. You didn't know that then?
[149:05] C: No, I didn't.
[149:05] A: You didn't know that mom also wasn't well? You didn't know that you didn't need mom to be well in order for you to become a loving mom.
[149:16] B: Right.
[149:16] A: For yours.
[149:18] B: Right.
[149:18] A: Which is why you got away. Yes, that's right. That's why he's in jail and you're free. Yes, that's right. Better for them.
[149:26] C: Yes.
[149:27] A: That's why you're doing counseling. Yes, that's right. Because you want them to be okay. Yes, that's right. Got it. And as you're becoming more okay, do you know what that does for them? See, as your nervous system inside of you starts to downregulate and you're less on edge and less nervous and less triggery and less. Do you know what that does to them? It also. Well, yeah, but it also turns down your kids dysregulation because 30% of the neurons in our brain are mirror neurons. Got it. So as they experience a mom who's more settled, who's lighter, who's more free and okay, that your state of being with them, they'll also, because of mirror neurons, begin to downregulate and become more okay.
[150:38] B: Right.
[150:39] A: Have you ever had the experience with a little kid falls and the parents reaction is. As the kid like turns around and goes, am I okay or not? And the parents reaction is. And the kid then starts crying like they got up, they were okay until they looked at their parent and went, oh no, I'm not okay to follow me with that.
[150:58] B: Right.
[150:58] A: Or if the kid falls and the parent's like, good job, get up and go. They're like, oh, okay, get up and go. You follow me.
[151:04] C: With that.
[151:05] A: So that's an overt one. All of this stuff that we're doing is in the background. So they're going to be experiencing a mom whose nervous system is down regulated, who's not so on edge all the time with that. Like things are gonna settle down in you. And as they settle down in you, that also assists in settling them down. Makes sense.
[151:36] C: Yes.
[151:37] B: Yeah.
[151:37] A: Good job. Yeah.
[151:41] B: Right?
[151:42] A: Isn't that cool?
[151:43] C: Yes.
[151:45] A: So how'd you pick Florida from Missouri?
[151:48] C: I like.
[151:48] A: You didn't go to Texas?
[151:50] C: I thought about going to Texas because I have family there, but I used to come to Florida as a kid. My mom's sister lives here, so we used to come, you know, when I was like 11, 12. And we go to Disney World.
[152:06] B: Yeah.
[152:07] C: But I used to love the people, beaches, and it's something we don't have in Missouri. You know, something about the beach.
[152:12] A: You do have the Ozarks, though.
[152:14] C: We do.
[152:14] A: And we're closest and that's a crazy show.
[152:16] D: It's so good.
[152:18] C: Yeah, that is a crazy show, too.
[152:20] A: Crazy show.
[152:21] B: It's.
[152:21] C: It is beautiful. Especially the Ozarks. It is very beautiful.
[152:26] B: Not anymore.
[152:27] A: Because it's crazy scary. Don't call a hillbilly a redneck because they'll kill you.
[152:32] C: Ruth is my favorite character. She's so good.
[152:36] A: That's the only thing that I learned from that show. Don't call a hillbilly a redneck because. Yeah. So you picked it because of the beaches?
[152:48] C: Pretty much. Because.
[152:49] B: Yeah.
[152:50] C: I always, like, associate the beach with the calmness and it relaxes me and it's just something that I love water, love swimming, and I just wanted to be somewhere. And I don't like the color cold, so Florida, you know, does have the cold. It just seemed the right fit. I just didn't know where, like, when I first come here, I didn't know where in Florida I wanted.
[153:10] B: Yeah.
[153:10] C: And I. I struggled with that until I met my ex husband and we started to come to Sarasota because I. I moved to Clearwater and then Miami.
[153:21] B: Okay.
[153:22] C: And he was my neighbor.
[153:23] B: Yeah.
[153:23] C: And he had a grandma that lived in Sarasota. So we used to come back and. And that's when I found out that I love it here.
[153:31] B: Yeah.
[153:31] C: It feels like home.
[153:32] B: Yeah.
[153:33] C: Finally found a place that I.
[153:35] A: So good for you.
[153:36] C: I love.
[153:36] B: Yeah.
[153:37] C: And.
[153:39] B: Yeah.
[153:40] A: Isn't that cool?
[153:41] C: Yes.
[153:42] A: Good job.
[153:43] C: So there's some good things that came out of all this, I guess. Yeah. Great refrain, kids and, you know, place that I love.
[153:51] A: So.
[153:52] B: Yeah. Right.
[153:54] A: And you're getting free.
[153:55] C: Yes.
[153:56] A: Mm. Yeah. So as you're checking in with you, what are you noticing?
[154:03] C: Well, I'm noticing that I'm able to. I feel like. What is the word I'm looking for? I don't feel as nervous. Is the word looking for it stress? Like when I first came in here. Feeling more relaxed?
[154:19] A: Not so scary?
[154:20] C: Not exactly.
[154:22] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[154:25] A: You're feeling more okay.
[154:26] C: Yes.
[154:27] A: As you think about the stuff that happened with that ex, with the boyfriend, with stepdad, even with mom, as you think about those things now, what do.
[154:37] C: You notice that is just like a memory?
[154:40] A: It is just like a memory.
[154:42] B: Yeah, right. Isn't that cool?
[154:49] A: So there are four things that people tell me over and over again that they notice. That's better. One is that past stuff that used to really bother them isn't bothering them at all. Two, the intensity in which they used to get distressed is way less. The frequency in which it used to spike is way less. The duration in which it used to last is way less. So instead of feeling like it's the large mountain that they have to overcome to get to the other side, it's like a small speed bump. They're still annoying. Nobody likes to drive over them in parking lots. But you're beyond them pretty quick.
[155:24] C: Yes.
[155:25] B: Yeah.
[155:25] A: That's what you're going to notice. So you're going to notice immediately that stuff isn't going to run the same programming. You might be in different situations. You might try to think about it and be like, huh? It's not doing it. He'll be reminded of it and be like, no, that's not causing that feeling anymore. That's weird. You might notice, like, in a situation that normally was similar, where you'd be. You might be in that situation, be like, I'm not feeling any of that. Or you might go through the whole situation and you might look back and go, hey, normally it would have been all like and I wasn't. Got it. So you're going to notice it in those ways. You're also going to notice it in that we made major changes to the programming and structure of how your brain interacts with the world. But as you move into life, you're going to notice more and more of what's new and different for you. So think of it like two ships set out to sea, unparalleled courses.
[156:26] B: Right.
[156:27] A: If even one of those ships get adjusted by 1 degree at first, it doesn't seem like a lot as they move out in the water, but we know that the Farther they go in the ocean, the more vastly different their courses wind up becoming. Make sense.
[156:44] C: Yes.
[156:45] A: So you are on a different trajectory. There's nothing that you're going to need to remember to do. Okay. There's nothing you're gonna need to remember to do. Because where this stuff changed in you is the same place where you learned how to ride a bicycle. It changed in an embodied way. So that's body memory, not intellectual memory. Intellectual memory would be your times tables, which we all had to learn. But if we don't use them, then we forget them. What is six times seven again? Right, right. So that's a very different kind of learning than once it becomes embodied. Makes sense.
[157:34] C: Yes.
[157:34] A: So it's changed at that deeper, more unconscious level. So you're just going to notice I'm in a situation that normally I might have had had a lot of angst in and I'm not feeling that angst. Or it might turn on and then go quickly away. Like that other thing did when you thought about the choking.
[157:53] B: Right.
[157:54] A: Or you might be in it and go through it and then think back. Normally I would have and I don't. You're going to notice. Oh wow. These things in the house that they're not reading. Is anything that has anything to do with him? That's right. He doesn't actually have a side of the bed.
[158:09] C: No, he doesn't.
[158:10] A: That's right.
[158:10] C: He's a jo.
[158:13] A: It's my whole big king size bed.
[158:16] C: I can jump on it.
[158:18] A: That's right.
[158:21] B: Right.
[158:21] A: Me and the kids can play jumping on the bed.
[158:23] B: Right, Right. Isn't that good news? Yeah.
[158:30] A: So do either of you have any questions for me about what we've done before we wrap up with what we're doing?
[158:38] C: I don't think so.
[158:40] D: I just appreciate you because I think in our work with her son it's been. We've been kind of paused and rerouting to do a lot of skill building and to support both of them, to kind of co regulate because it's been hard. I'm trying to do TF CBT with her and her son.
[158:54] A: What is that?
[158:55] D: The trauma focused cognitive behavior Therapy. So you're doing well?
[158:59] C: It's.
[158:59] D: I just got through the six months month consultation training. So I just want to get it, you know how it is in this field where you just want to complete the whole training and that's part of it is then being able to, if.
[159:10] A: You'Re going to do it, make sure he stays present. Do you notice how many times did I Stop and do whatever I need to do to bring her back here. So do that. But the flip of it is that and therapy says we have to process and feel it.
[159:31] D: Sure.
[159:31] A: And my experience and I work with all sorts of awful stuff from trafficking survivors to military wartime horror to grief shit. There's not many things that I haven't experienced. It's always about keeping them present, bringing them back into now versus letting them go. They can narrate it, they can do that. But if they start going back there, you want to pick up that they're back there.
[160:00] D: Sure.
[160:01] A: And then frame it that just like we did. We. We set the frame up first. You're going to intend to be here as you tell me what happened.
[160:11] D: Sure.
[160:12] A: We would have liked to go through it faster, but the first one, we've gone through all the other ones, by the way, faster. Isn't that interesting?
[160:17] C: Yeah.
[160:18] A: But we came and we came with the big one first.
[160:23] C: Sure.
[160:24] A: Because you've been in therapy and that's the right. Where organically, sometimes in a session like this, what will come up first will be one that isn't as severe as the one that's severe. So that the brain goes, oh, this does work.
[160:38] B: Right.
[160:38] A: Because notice how much easier it was to go through all the other ones. Even as you're telling about it, you're. Yeah, it's kind of like I'm here, I'm doing it. It's not like I'm really feeling much of it at anything.
[160:48] B: Right.
[160:48] A: Like isn't that interesting. Right. So. So we did that big one first, which was fine because I knew what to do with it. But if we can do a smaller one.
[160:56] C: Sure.
[160:56] A: That then reinforces that it's working, that it's working, that it's working, that it's working. And you just want to make sure that the person stays present and doesn't float back into the past.
[161:07] D: Sure. Well, and that's the thing with the TF cbt. You want to do the first one worse than last.
[161:11] B: Yeah.
[161:12] D: Even if they're just drawing it, Even if we're putting words to it at a five year old, age appropriate level with very minimal information. But I think, I guess I'm feeling empowered.
[161:23] A: And the second part to it, Lauren, is you want to make sure that what it's connected to is future better.
[161:30] D: How do you explain to a five year old even though. Because you know how it is, you love your parent unconditionally.
[161:35] A: We went to Lego end.
[161:38] D: Right. But how do you explain to a.
[161:39] A: Five year old so good Cuz he.
[161:42] D: Understands dad's in jail. He understands that our family has changed. He's very avoidant and, and Natalie and I have talked about that.
[161:50] C: It's.
[161:51] D: Doesn't want to touch. It doesn't want to go through it very.
[161:54] A: Do you know why?
[161:55] D: Cuz it's painful.
[161:56] A: No. Second part. It's not just that it's painful who also doesn't want to touch.
[162:01] C: That's.
[162:02] D: That's where I'm very hopeful. I can see mom so much more regulated, so.
[162:05] A: It's so good. It's so perfect.
[162:07] C: Yeah. My son went through abuse too.
[162:10] A: Yeah. So dad did physical stuff to him?
[162:12] C: Yes.
[162:12] B: Yeah.
[162:12] A: Okay.
[162:13] C: He was very abusive too.
[162:14] B: Yeah.
[162:15] A: And so sometimes more forceful spanking, sometimes punching, sometimes yelling.
[162:19] C: It wasn't punching. It was just like. It was like pushing.
[162:23] A: Okay.
[162:24] C: He would throw things at him. He would name call a lot of name calls.
[162:30] B: Right.
[162:31] C: A lot of that. He would always call him a little brat.
[162:34] B: Right.
[162:35] C: You know, things like that. And he would like hold him down. He's like scared to still be kind of held down. Like he would like just hold him down where he couldn't move. And he was just. It was very mean to him.
[162:51] B: Okay.
[162:53] C: And I think that's a lot of it too. It's not just that I don't want to talk about it. It's because I think it brings up bad memories for him too.
[163:01] B: Of course.
[163:02] A: And the single best coping mechanism that human beings discovered when it comes to material that makes me feel bad is to figure out ways to not think about it. That's what we do. Right. So what we want to frame. And that's why we did a whole bunch of frame framing first and psychoeducational first before we ever touched it. So that we then had a. Here's how come it's done, here's where we're headed. And you notice several times I would re put in there. You're only actually troubled right now because that part doesn't know it ended.
[163:47] D: So do you provide psychoeducation about the brain and the memory and how it's been imprinted impacted to a 5 year old? Like do you do work with 5 year olds?
[163:56] A: You can do the same thing. You're gonna use it at developmental ages that they get. So even if we were to.
[164:06] B: Be.
[164:07] A: In play sand, I would actually put an imprint and be like, that's what happened. There's a part that doesn't know that is different than this, that's more concrete for them to. We can get rid of that. That's what's troubling.
[164:30] B: Right.
[164:31] A: So I have a silly pillow that if I've got somebody that you can do that with one of those little microphones. So you just go. And it leaves an imprint.
[164:42] C: Oh, yeah.
[164:43] A: Okay. Right in the imprint. That part doesn't know that yucky thing is over. What we're gonna do is we're gonna get that part to know that it's over. We're going to get it so it's no longer troubling.
[164:57] C: Okay.
[164:58] D: But like you're saying, bring up all the happy memories that have occurred since dad's been incarcerated.
[165:04] B: Right.
[165:05] D: Now, because we have a lot of scoboli.
[165:07] B: Right.
[165:07] A: So all of any. So when trauma stuck, it's frozen and not connected to joy full moments later. So we always want to have an attractor. If you also notice. Where did I put everything? I sometimes snap my fingers. But where did I put the future that I described? Because we were only dealing with what we were dealing with.
[165:32] B: Right.
[165:33] A: To unplug it.
[165:37] D: Sure.
[165:38] A: So it wasn't affecting today.
[165:40] D: Okay.
[165:41] A: So I kept bringing her back. But if you notice, before we dealt with the trauma I identified, how do we want you to be when we're done?
[165:50] D: Sure.
[165:51] B: Right.
[165:52] A: And you said happy.
[165:54] B: Er.
[165:55] A: And I'm like, what is it like for you when you're happy and then you finally got to the word free?
[166:02] B: Right.
[166:03] A: I'd be free.
[166:04] B: Right.
[166:05] A: And when you're free and you're happier, we're also thinking of a you who's lighter and much more at peace, no longer troubled. I'm putting, by the way, locationally, all of the past over there and all of the future how I want them to be up here. I'm doing that because when people visually conceive of a future, they look up into the right. When people are accessing emotion, they look down into the right. Past can be linear. So this is future, this is present. That's past. I can even throw my voice. I used a lot of you're here now with me that happened back then.
[166:56] C: Sure.
[166:57] A: Those are going to be spatial prepositions that are also temporal prepositions because we're taking it to time. Any way that you can separate them. You can even do a silly thing by going, well, you know, think about what happened then as if it's in the iPhone screen. So they're sitting up. They can see it over there. It's small.
[167:22] B: Right.
[167:23] A: You can say that it's in black and white. It's framed. It's happening over there. It's like they're watching it. So that's the tool that we use for police officers that are interviewing trafficking survivors. We have them. If they have to describe what happened to them, we want them to not be in it.
[167:37] B: Right.
[167:38] A: We want them to be an observer. Because watching a traffic accident and being in a traffic accident, you both have emotional reactions because it's traffic accident. But the person who has a more intense emotional reaction is the one in it.
[167:49] C: Sure.
[167:50] A: So if I can watch it, I can make it smaller, I can put it further away. I can give me the position of power because I'm above it. Think of little kid. Authority figure is bigger than me. So now I've changed the reversal. Now I'm bigger than it. It's smaller than me. I become more empowered. We have future things that are, you know, beneficial. We have our connection because we've been doing skill building and I'm getting connected with him and like he likes me and there's all of that. So you've got all of those as a powerful pull draw because you've developed a relationship.
[168:24] B: Right.
[168:25] A: We met the first time doing something that's really difficult the first time. Right. So you've got all of those connections there. What I would say is have future, make sure he's present and do some sort of thing where what we're doing, you're not bothered because it happened. There's a part of you that doesn't know that it ended and that you mom and your sister are okay. There's a part of you that doesn't know about going to Legoland or upcoming Christmas presents or whatever it is that little kids are like, oh my goodness, it's Christmas. Like all of that is going to be in the positive.
[169:09] C: Sure.
[169:10] A: And then it's just about keeping them present as they are remembering what happened. And if mom is there and mom is not getting re triggered by the stuff, then mom's more regulated child will be more regulated.
[169:28] D: Well, we've seen a great increase in that, I would say the last four, five, six sessions.
[169:33] A: Cool.
[169:34] D: He's been doing a lot better.
[169:35] B: Yeah.
[169:36] D: So now I'm like, I think we can go there.
[169:37] C: I think we can go there. Yeah.
[169:38] D: So this is kind of our wanting to get her ready so we could.
[169:41] C: Go there with him.
[169:42] D: Even if it is lowering the bar.
[169:44] A: Because he's five and we want to. We want to make it silly.
[169:47] D: Sure.
[169:48] A: And light, if you notice how much did we laugh.
[169:51] D: Right.
[169:52] C: And that. Sorry, need some water. Feel like I've been talking a lot. I. What was I going to say. I completely forgot what I was going to say.
[170:07] A: Laughing?
[170:08] C: Yes.
[170:09] D: Making it silly and light.
[170:10] C: So I think that'd be really good for Jeffrey because he likes to laugh. I think that would help him kind of like, you know, just break that bear. Like, just kind of. Because he really doesn't like to talk about that stuff and he gets angry, and I think that could help just kind of get him to laugh, you know?
[170:33] B: Right.
[170:34] D: We can be creative.
[170:35] C: We'll.
[170:35] D: We'll think of some ideas. We're always kind of on it to get. We have a good partnership.
[170:39] B: Right.
[170:39] A: You can do it with cars, dolls, toys, other things, you know, this one bigger. This one. Okay. Know what happens when this one's bigger? And what happens if they get further away? What happens if we put that one over there? What happens if you just put it in the garbage? I mean, I did a silly thing with a woman yesterday. She got out of these birds are flying all over, which is her thoughts. I'm like, the birds are flying all over. Grab those birds and get them out of here. And I open the door and I threw them.
[171:04] C: I'm sure they appreciate that. Right?
[171:06] A: Just go there with them. How stupid is that?
[171:08] C: That's great.
[171:09] A: But then she's like, I'm not having those crazy thoughts. And. And the only reason that that ever has occurred is I had a woman one time that had gotten a phone call from a kidnapper who kidnapped her husband. And then husband wound up. She never saw him again, but the kidnapper was calling for ransom, and she never could get the kidnapper's voice out of her head. And I said, I wonder what happens if we move it over there? And she's like, I don't hear it anymore. I don't hear the voice. I don't hear the voice.
[171:36] B: I don't.
[171:37] A: Why did you. What did you just do? How did you do that? But what we know is how our brain codes. Thing is location matter. That's why I said to you notice when you think about those experiences, they're not in the same location they used to be. It's changed the coding. It's changed where the brain has it stored. It's now stored as data about something that happened. And here's the coolest part about that that I didn't tell you. Your brain can't go back to thinking it's happening, just like you can't go back to thinking Santa's real. I mean, it would suck for the kids. I don't know why I didn't bring presents. I thought you were good kids too, huh? That darn Santa Claus.
[172:19] B: Right? Right.
[172:20] A: See, once you know that Santa Claus is real, you can't go back to believing. Once your brain experiences what happened as data, it can't ever go back to thinking it's happening. Isn't that cool?
[172:38] B: Yeah.
[172:39] C: Awesome.
[172:39] A: Yeah.
[172:40] B: Yeah.
[172:41] A: Any other questions? Cool, thank you. And I'd be happy to, you know, consult or any other thing if you get stuck with stuff with the little one. My thing. It does not matter what process somebody uses. I don't care whether they use Systematic desensitization, emdr, brain spotting accelerator. So many different things. The problem in my mind with all of those things is that they're still coming from the therapy model, which is they buried it. And we've got to help them process, get through it and get it out. Sure. Which encourages the person to be in the reliving. And the one thing that you can know, I was very much keen on her not reliving it.
[173:28] C: Right.
[173:28] D: You kept stopping her when she was getting so dysregulated by it and bringing.
[173:32] A: Her back to you.
[173:35] B: Right.
[173:35] A: I was not letting her go more than for a few moments into wherever it was. No, no, no. Be back here.
[173:41] C: Thank you.
[173:42] D: Because I actually came to one of your presentations back in like 2017.
[173:46] B: Yeah. Wow.
[173:47] D: Okay. Suncoast behavior, I'm sure.
[173:49] B: Yeah.
[173:49] D: And it was interesting because it was a lot of what you're sharing today, putting it in practice, where it's like. Like you're saying it's different when your teacher is teaching you something, but you're in the room and really learning where it's going. So I remember you sharing a little bit about how you would go backwards in the brain. But then it was different to be present, to see where that was going.
[174:09] B: Right?
[174:09] A: Yeah. Yeah. And we wanted to do the first run through because there was so much heavy material that we weren't so concerned about all the details.
[174:19] B: Right.
[174:19] A: So notice we went. Okay, well, then that happen.
[174:22] B: Right.
[174:22] A: Then we ran it backwards and it had already taken a little bit of the charge and the heat off of it because this one had a lot of heat to it because it was the closest one in a big freaking one.
[174:33] B: Right.
[174:34] A: Once the heat was taken off of it, then we could go through. And it was easier for you to go through even the difficult details that I don't ever like to think about or talk about.
[174:44] B: Right.
[174:44] A: Like how many times you had to freaking pee.
[174:52] D: Well, and I think Natalie's really good.
[174:55] A: Right.
[174:57] D: She's a good client.
[174:58] A: Notice what changes with that. It's good, though.
[175:01] D: You have to make it, like, funny. You have to bring the humor out.
[175:04] C: Yeah, but.
[175:05] D: And I'm not saying that, like she.
[175:07] C: Would ever get to a place where.
[175:08] D: She would have to be reactivated by it, but I'll say she's a really good client at challenging the anxious, distressing, inaccurate thoughts. So at least here, again, like, if for whatever reason that Shark music is playing or you're feeling uneasy, I think it's gonna be helpful for her to then re. Challenge. He's in jail. This is my bed. You know, this, that, and the other.
[175:28] A: And those are all the cognitive things. But what's really going. And you'll do that, and you go, oh, I was able to talk myself out of it. But the true reason that you were able to quote, unquote, talk yourself out of it is that it's not doing the same thing it did. So your. What we call our practices or rituals or the things that we do to take care, like, they work better, primarily because it's not activating like it did.
[175:56] D: Well, you'll really see it too, because she. She's been putting herself in different organizations that have affiliated affiliations too, when it occurred. I think you'll really be able to tune into your stress response when you're in those environments. Like when you're filling out that paperwork recently.
[176:09] C: Yes.
[176:10] D: You'll really get to know. Okay, I got this.
[176:14] C: Yes, I think so.
[176:15] A: That's what you're gonna notice. Hey, normally I'd be feeling all. And I'm not. That's kind of cool. That's what you're gonna notice. Those are the things that people tell me over and over again.
[176:27] C: That's good.
[176:28] B: Right.
[176:29] A: And it's in different arenas that you might not even think could possibly relate.
[176:33] C: That's. That's really good because, you know, like, the trial, it's gonna be. Well, it's probably gonna be next fall.
[176:40] B: Yeah. And if.
[176:41] A: Whatever that is, we'll have a conversation before that. Okay, you and I can meet again. We can meet again, too. I mean, what I tend to do with people is I do a session like this, and then I like to have them go out and live life for a month and then get back together, you know, because in life, then they got other things that show up, and if there's other things that we didn't get to, we can take care of that, and it goes much faster, so we can do that too.
[177:03] C: Okay.
[177:04] A: Does that make sense?
[177:06] C: Probably in about a month or so, I'm gonna probably be in court again with his parents.
[177:13] A: Yeah.
[177:13] C: So it's gonna be, like, bringing stuff up. Not, you know, like, it would, like. Not like it will be with the. The trial, but that was one thing I was worried about, too, so just seeing them, I guess.
[177:24] B: Yeah.
[177:25] A: Let's get a thing together before that.
[177:28] B: Right.
[177:29] A: So that we can have your nervous system set up to be responsive to how you want to be when you see them. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah, that'd be great.
[177:43] B: Yeah.
[177:43] A: So we can get that in the books.
[177:45] C: Okay.
[177:46] B: Yeah.
[177:47] C: Thank you.
[177:47] B: You're welcome. Yeah.
[177:49] A: This was great. Good job. You did awesome. You're welcome. And you've got a great tool now. You know how to lower your jaw and relax your tongue and breathe.
