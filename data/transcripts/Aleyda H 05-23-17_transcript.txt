[00:00] A: So today is the 23rd of May, Aleyda. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that again, that recording may be available to you, may be made available in training some professionals in how to do this. Want to make sure all of that's okay with you. Okay, good. So what do I need to know to understand what's been going on? What do we actually want to get better for you? And if you're telling me that there's things that have happened, like, past stuff that you don't necessarily always think about, but if you do, there's still yuckiness or you're thinking that maybe that's kind of cast a shadow and also is impacting why you might react, is that also kind of. Okay. All right, so what do I need to know to understand?
[00:43] B: So I get angry easily when things are not done my way.
[00:51] A: Okay.
[00:52] B: And, you know, like, simple stuff. I got something like this small. I'll give you an example. So, you know, so if somebody used my desk the day before and I got to the office and my pen. My favorite pen is missing, then I will get very upset.
[01:14] A: Okay.
[01:15] B: About something like that small. I would get very upset. And so sometimes, if it was any.
[01:24] A: Pen, would it matter?
[01:26] B: No. But I do have a special.
[01:27] A: But it's your favorite pen.
[01:28] B: Yeah.
[01:29] A: Yeah.
[01:29] B: So I.
[01:30] A: So that makes it bigger than little, right? Like, if it was any pen, but if it's like. Like if somebody took my pen, I'd be like, that was my pen.
[01:42] B: Exactly.
[01:42] A: Okay. But you get more. Okay.
[01:45] B: And things are moved because I. I like everything to be. You know, I'm very. I like everything to be said in the same place. And if something has been moved or they change something without letting me know, then, you know, I'll get upset.
[02:04] A: Okay.
[02:05] B: So those type of things actually, you know, it's. It happens before it has. You know, I get angry, and I don't want to be angry around my co workers because it's gonna be like, oh, my gosh, he's just making a big deal out of that pen, you know? And so I want to feel more. I want to be able to actually don't live those little things, ruin the rest of my day, you know? You know, things like that. Because bigger things has been before. I have employees blowing out, telling me that I'm terrible or whatever, and I'm like, okay, I'm not gonna leave this to ruin the rest of my day. I just have to keep going. But actually, it does ruin the rest of My day, because I'm still feeling angry. Why these people talk to me like that. And I. I have done all. Everything good for her, and I've been helping her. And this is the way, you know, she's paying me back. And I try not to. I try to let it go, but it's really hard. It's like still in the back of my head. Even if I try to shake it off and say, okay, that's it, but I'm still thinking about it. And at night when I go to sleep, I start thinking, oh, you know, going back in time, what should I say? Or what should did this to me? You know, and it's just a thing that I just keep building up. Also. I do. I don't know. For some, I. I do lie. You know, I find sometimes it's a. Easier way to. To kind of like make. I don't know how to explain this, but I. I just. So I give you an example. If I think I told you this. When I phone my husband asked, oh, our baby is having. She got a new shoes. And instead of, you know, telling him the truth, I just lie and I say, oh, yeah, somebody gave it to her, or I bought it at Goodwill, you know, instead of telling him, oh yeah, I got this new pair of shoes for her. And so sometimes at work, I do that just to. Not with the employees. But if I had to make a phone call, a very important phone call, and I forget about it just because I have so many things going on that I forget. Instead of saying, oh, shoot, yeah, I forget, but I'm gonna call her right away. You know, I say, oh, yeah, I called her, but she didn't pick up, you know, and so later I'm like, I feel bad because I'm like, oh, man, I didn't call it. Actually, it's my fault. I shouldn't just, you know, tell the truth, but it's just to get things out of the way. And no, I'm not. I'm not able sometimes to. To tell the truth because I don't want people to. To look at me bad and say, oh, my God, you know, especially in my role. I have been a manager for a while now, so sometimes people look at you as a role model and they don't want to have, you know, somebody who sometimes forget very important things as a role model. So that has been my way to.
[05:43] A: Would it be okay if you didn't feel bad?
[05:48] B: No.
[05:49] A: I mean, see, you said that afterwards. I feel bad over having said that because I don't Want to show up looking, like, incompetent.
[05:58] B: Right, Right.
[06:00] A: So is the problem that you feel bad over having lied?
[06:04] B: No, the problem is that I'm lying because.
[06:06] A: Would it be a bad. Would you. Would it be okay if you didn't feel bad about having lied?
[06:13] B: If that would be okay? I don't think it would be okay. I mean, I don't want to feel bad, but I don't. I don't actually want to lie either, you know?
[06:24] A: Well, I. I follow you. I was. What I was trying to identify a little bit. Had to do more with. Is it about the lying, or is it about the feeling bad that I lied, thinking that I shouldn't have? I mean, because the lying was to look good.
[06:44] B: Mm.
[06:47] A: Because you were thinking that if I had said to them, oh, my goodness, I totally blanked out on it, they'd be like, this manager's a freaking incompetent fool, and you don't want them to feel that way about them.
[06:58] B: Yeah, I don't want to feel that way.
[07:00] A: So is the thing about missing something really important, Is that a frequent occurrence?
[07:05] B: No, it's not frequent.
[07:07] A: Yeah, so, like, if you, like, you know, miss something, that wouldn't be being a good role model, you know, like telling. Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much for reminding me.
[07:19] B: Right.
[07:21] A: That wouldn't be being a good role model, which is what you're really. Which is what you're really wanting to do.
[07:30] B: So true. I don't know if I have any issues on focusing on something, because I try to. I try to finish. I try to do multiple tasks at once.
[07:50] A: Okay.
[07:51] B: And sometimes, you know, it's impossible. It's impossible, but I push hard to the point that I'm doing something, and then I'm unfinished that task to start another one. And so I'm all over the place. And it got to the point sometime that I'm like, oh, my God, I have so many things that I, you know, that I didn't. I didn't finish. And so. And I start all over again with the first one that I was doing it and try to finish that up. But then I have a bunch of unfinished tasks that I have to go back and doing one by one. You know what I mean?
[08:32] A: Okay.
[08:33] B: So sometimes I feel like I'm organized.
[08:39] A: As far as particular with where things are located.
[08:43] B: Right, Right. You know, I had this thing before that I used to count. Like, if I was in your room right now, I wouldn't count everything you have here, every single items, the book, this, this, and that. I will have. Oh, okay. Mr. Quintal has a lamp. And this. I will count everything. So in that aspect about, you know, putting stuff in order and folding things and making it everything look nice, I don't have a problem. But as far as professional organizing, like documents or finish something on time and things like that, I find that I have an issue because I have, you know, I can focus sometimes in one thing and get this thing done right now and then move to the next one. That would be like every normal people will do. Right. But I tried to do it all at once and then, you know, I ended up with a bunch of a mess pretty much.
[09:47] A: And then you do go back and do them one by one.
[09:50] B: Yeah. And then it's a waste of time because, you know, I feel like.
[09:54] A: So you actually do go back and do them one by one once you've already started and they're scattered all over the place, but so good.
[10:02] B: And it's like, it's time consuming in my position. It is time consuming.
[10:08] A: Yeah, right.
[10:08] B: Because then, you know, I already waste.
[10:11] A: A bunch of time studying this brain energy consumption. Yeah, right. We do much better when we complete than if it's all left open.
[10:25] B: And I, you know, I realized that. But after, afterwards, after already left all this unfinished us.
[10:35] A: And I'm like, well, let me ask this question. How do you know when to start multiple things? So let's say you started one thing and then is it that an idea comes in, oh, I need to do this. And then you start doing this. And then another idea, oh, I need to do this. And you start doing that. Is that how, like, do they all seem like to be swapped like at head level?
[10:55] B: Sometimes it does.
[10:56] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:58] B: I have, you know, I told my husband this. I was like, you know, sometimes I, you know, I can focus. And he's like, make it, you know, just make a list of everything you have to do during the day and then just throw it up. Okay. Finish this, finish that, like check everything you're done one by one. And I started doing that. But then in my positions, you know, in my last job, I was the operations manager for this cleaning company. So I was, you know, studying, doing my checklist. But then a new hire walk in and I have to do the paperwork with her. So I started doing that other thing. And then my boss called me to, hey, call these people to make this appointment. And I started doing, doing other things. And then, you know, the day just took me through all different tasks that needed to be done. So prioritizing. It's really hard because I want to finish with all my list. But there is other things that it needs to be done before this list. And so sometimes I just, I find that I have a hard time prioritizing, you know, okay, this is how to be first. And it's hard for me to focus on these other things because I want to finish my list. So it's like I don't know how to organize myself better.
[12:32] A: Okay.
[12:33] B: Since this is a new hotel, you want more flow.
[12:37] A: It's going to be able to be doing your list and. And then other things with more ease. Right. And part of it is how it's been. We'll call it represented how it's been organized in your brain. Because it's all kind of like up here, right? And if it's all like in my face and all up here, then it's all like swimming around me all at once. So the perspective change of getting you up above it all so that you can see it down there, it lowering down so that you can see it all down there, the big perspective is going to make it easier to chunk it and sequence it in the order that makes sense for you to get them done. Even as new things come in, it just resequences stuff. Right. But if it's all swimming up here, then it's all like all around me. And then I'm like drawn to one thing. Oh, I forgot about that thing. Oh, I need to do this thing. But again, if we lower all of that down there, you get more up above it, you're going to be able to see it in the bigger piece. So therefore it's going to be much easier to sequence it. Does that make sense? Because I'm understanding that the anxiety stuff, it's almost like it's overwhelming so many different things that I got to be doing. And I'm a task person, so if I've got my own tasks, I want to get those things done. Yet some of these other tasks are also part of what there is for me to do. And maybe some of them need to be done or more pressing or more urgent than what's on my list. Okay. So that's kind of the. The thing we want that to. To get down lower. Are you up above it so that you can see it from that perspective? Makes sense.
[14:19] B: Yeah.
[14:20] A: Versus it all kind of swimming around.
[14:22] B: Yeah.
[14:24] A: Yeah. Okay.
[14:25] B: Yeah.
[14:26] A: Okay.
[14:27] B: And I ended up, you know, I've been having headaches lately every day, and it's just here. And I don't know if that's Part of being, you know, like, stress. Like, right now I know that I have to hire, I have to finish a manager training. And it's a lot. No idea. It's like, it's a new brand, so it's a lot. And it's like. It's very exhausting just to think about everything I have to achieve before June 20, before the opening.
[14:57] A: Right.
[14:58] B: So it's already. Just to think about it. Already feeling like, okay.
[15:04] A: Right. And notice how it's got weight to it. Like it's heavy and it's here, and it kind of feels like it's pressing down. Yeah. So I wonder what would happen if you got out from under it all and you're way up above it. You know, kind of like what happens when a plane takes off and goes up in the air. Right. And it's as it's rising up and you see all that stuff on the ground because you're out from under it all. What happens to the stuff on the ground, by the way, as the plane goes higher and higher and you look.
[15:36] B: Down towards it, you have a better view.
[15:38] A: Well, you certainly have a better view. But what happens to the stuff as the plane rises? Oh, it looks smaller. That's right. And I'm wondering what it would be like to see it down there as smaller so that you can kind of chunk it and sequence it. Chunking meaning grouping it in the grouping that it fits to be in and sequencing it so that it's changed in the order it needs to get done. And so you can't do that when it's all here and it's all above me, because that's how you just described it. And I'll give you another example of what happened earlier as you were talking, but you've described it as all, like, up above, and there's all this stuff, and it's overwhelming and it's all that stuff, and I'm like, underneath it all, and it's like, even just thinking about takes my breath away because it's so, like, weighted and heavy. That's why we want to get the representation of what happens when you're out from under it all and you're way up above it. Right. And as you're way up above it and you look down and you see that it's much smaller. How's your body feeling now? See, that's a good breath. So you notice what just happened. You took a breath, not consciously, but your body went. Right. Because as you get up above it and you see it down there, there's A whole different way of relating to what there is for you to do. You can kind of chunk it into the categories and then sequence it. And that sequencing may adjust depending on what new comes in or what day it is. And that's how we want it to be organized, is that it's down there and you're up above so that you can see it with that perspective. Got it right. And notice how body already feels better. We'll do more with that. The other thing that you were talking about is you had said that whether it be somebody moves something or you're angry because like your desk was a certain way and then it was changed without you knowing, or somebody comes in and says something to you, oh, you're this better and you've done a lot for them. And it all goes in here. And you went literally with your two hands, it went right to there, right. And then you said, and even when I go back at home, I think about past and I kind of build it up. Right. So once it's been built up, what then happens? Do you like then have like a conversation with them? Are you just more short with them or where does then that release effort's been built up? You know, kind of like shaking the bottle. There's going to be some time that it's kind of. So where does that happen? Because you don't want to do it at work.
[18:03] B: No, no, I don't want to do.
[18:04] A: It well, but like you're kind of build it up. So the person said that thing you kind of. Okay, I don't want it to affect my day kind of go through. I can kind of say to myself, well, that's their shit, you know, it's not me, whatever. But at night as you're laying down, you're kind of thinking about it and it's building up. Does that then impact you actually falling asleep? Okay, so then you're kind of like thinking about it. Does it like every stewing on it and it's like there's the anchor.
[18:33] B: Yeah, I think about it during the night I can sleep just going back and actually I go back in time and actually keep, you know.
[18:43] A: Replaying.
[18:44] B: Yeah, replaying it and replaying it. And so with some of, with some of the situation, I. The next day I just, I'm thinking about like, okay, so this is a lesson for me. Next time I should have just tell that employee, you know what, just go calm down. And when you're able to. To talk to me normal, then you can come back and talk. I shouldn't just send her right away. And so from that point, I make sure that if somebody else comment yelling at me or being disrespectful, I just say, you know what? I can have a conversation with you and just turn around, but don't leave them escalate on me because, you know, I can't allow that. If not everybody can come in and tell me whatever they want. So it's actually, I actually learn from that lesson and I make sure that it won't happen again. But to come out to that conclusion, I already spent an entire day angry about it. I couldn't sleep at night. I went angry and my husband came home, my daughter. I wasn't able to share with them or play or, you know, interact with them because I was angry myself about it. And I was feeling. Yeah, it stays.
[20:12] A: Okay, we'd like that to stop so that you can actually have fun with your daughter.
[20:15] B: Yeah.
[20:18] A: We wouldn't want you to have a lot more fun with the things that matter to you.
[20:22] B: I know. I just want to just shake it, shake it off, you know, just like let it go.
[20:26] A: Well, so notice what happened. I want to give you the reference point. When you were talking about it, both your hands went here. Now what's right here? My heart.
[20:36] B: My heart. Yeah.
[20:37] A: So you took it to heart. You took it, in other words, personally. Right. I'm wondering what it would be like if you weren't taking it to heart, how different it would be if you were reading it as info about them and then how much easier it would be. Okay, I get it. You're really upset. Why don't you go calm down and then I'd be happy to talk to you. You can talk to me in a calm voice. You know, cooler heads prevail. Just go calm yourself down. I get there's an upset. Yeah, I got that. Right. But if it wasn't being taken to heart, how much easier is it going to be for you to have access to what you already know now to do in the moment that it's happening? How much easier are you going to have access to that logic? Because the problem is, when it was taken personally, you were thrown into a state of high emotion. What happened to your intellect, low intelligence? You cannot be emotional and logical at the same time. Right. That shuts off that part of the brain. Yeah. And what we also want, if you're not taking it to heart, if you're not taking it so personally that it slides off, versus kind of churning, stewing with it. Yeah. Because that's something that we want to have you be reading those experiences from more of a logical setting, you know, at a higher wisdom setting. Again, having more space. Because I would imagine when the person's yelling at you or saying that stuff, even, no matter where they're standing, the reference point, and this is the words that people use is, they were in my face. Right. And it probably feels like they're that close. Right. And then it's like, ugh. So if we have the rep. Even though you might be on the other side of a desk and they might not be physically that close, it's how our brain has it represented that makes it that much more intense. So we want you to have more spatial distance from it. We want you to have the perspective of being up above so that you can see the situation and the bigger piece at the same time. Because if you're already in operations, what you're really good at is knowing different parts. But you can't know all the different parts. Parts. When they're all up here, you've got to lower them down so that we can see them and then be able to turn kind of like, I'm not a big football fan, but in football, they have an offensive coordinator who calls the plays for the offense, and he's not on the field. He's up in the nosebleed. Why do they put him up there? So he can see the whole field at once. The quarterback can, the head coach on the sideline can, but the guy up above sees all of it at once, knows where people are, knows strategies to implement, to move things. Yeah, but you already get some of that stuff in the world of operations, as operations are knowing how the whole system works and each component, all of them working together. And you need to have one of those up above so that you can see it down below and the big picture of where you're headed so that you know how to move things. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about in terms of the chunking and the sequencing, the reordering of stuff. And we want you to have more flow. Because if I'm also understanding this would be word. You're particular because you said, if it's not done the way that I want it to be done, then I get mad. So you're particular. You have a certain way that you want things done, which is great. However, in getting people to do things, they're not always going to do it exactly the way that you would have. So when is it good enough? Right. Because you have the idea it has to be Perfect. So I'm wondering what it would be like for you to be feeling, you know, that it can be done good enough.
[25:05] B: Yeah, no, it can be done good enough.
[25:10] A: But for you to be. Okay. That it may not be how you would do it. It may not be perfect, but it's good enough. That's right. And be satisfied that it's done good enough, that you were able to get somebody else to do it. Right. So does that thing show up in terms of being particular in how you like things done with what goes on at home, with your daughter, with your husband? Those things, too. So, like, they've got it or he's got it more than her, probably. But, yeah, adjust. Okay.
[25:41] B: She's only two, Right.
[25:43] A: So she's little still. Watch out.
[25:46] B: I know. Yeah. Actually, this. You know, we got arguments about it because, you know, I want. I want him to be able to do the task at home because we share, you know, and so there is some. There is way that he do things different in the way I do. And so there is. You know, we argue about those little.
[26:15] A: Things because he doesn't do it. Like, give me an example of something that he would do that's not the way you would do it.
[26:21] B: So I rinse the dishes before putting in the dishwasher, especially if I'm not gonna run it the same day, because then wasted food is gonna smell. So he just, you know, he just eat and put the plate right in this watch. Without rinsing it with all the food and everything. And I have told him many times that he needs to rinse it before putting it in the dishwasher. And he continues just doing it the way, you know, he just continues doing it his way. And, you know, that's. That's an example of something really small that becomes a big argument sometimes from my part, of course, he just. Just like, you know, I just. Yeah, I forgot that you like that particular way. I'm used to just putting the dishes like that.
[27:13] A: Yeah, yeah. And we go like, you know, good. The good news is, like, the dish is making it to the dishwasher. It could be left on the table. I know. So we get to that kind of thing. Like, at least it's making it to the table.
[27:28] B: But you see.
[27:28] A: I don't know, but I see. Right. That's what I'm saying. And I follow you, and you want to be. But you have a preference that hasn't been conveyed in a way that has him get it and go, oh, that makes sense. Let's do it that way. That for you, you're thinking more steps ahead, that if this dish is rinsed and put in the dishwasher, then yes, it needs to be clean, but it's not going to have stuff on it. So therefore the dishwasher is not going to smell, which is only a momentary smell when you actually open it to put the soap in and then shut it. But you would prefer it to not have that smell, right? Right, exactly. Which is why you rinse the things off, right? Yeah. I remember somebody used to like actually wash the dish before they put it in the dishwasher. What's the point of putting it in the dishwasher? I mean, I get the rinsing, but like, if you're watching the damn thing, why are you even in the dishwasher if you've already done the work on it? But yeah, so that's something that you'd like to have more flexibility, freedom and ease. That you could express your preference and in certain ways have him be more doing preference. But if he doesn't, it doesn't create this. This asshole just is trying to piss me off. He's doing it intentionally to make me mad. I've told him so many times how I want it and he just keeps doing this. This passive aggressive stuff. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So that's a little more flexibility because certain ways are very particular. And in a lot of areas, having stuff organized means that I know where it is, means that I can use it with more ease. Right. So if I know where things are and I've got things filed in my desk and I need certain paperwork, I don't want to just like flip through where the hell it might be. I want to have it organized and labeled. Oh, that's where this paperwork is. Okay, great. There you go. Right. Like that's all fine. You wouldn't want somebody to come in and move that all around or take the things away. Right. So in that way it's useful because it helps in maintaining order. And again, in operations, it's about knowing where things are and how things fit together. Right. I mean, we can't have the front desk going ahead and getting the room and the room hasn't been cleaned. Things need to be interacting with each other, that kind of stuff. So that's just a silly example, but you want to have more flexibility. Okay, what else would be useful for me to know? Because I get the stuff where it's been taken to heart. I get how it builds up. I get that there are times that for you, it's kind of like all swimming around and overwhelming. And we want that all lowered so that you're out from under it and up above it so that you can see the bigger perspective. We want to get it so that things aren't being taken to heart. And we want you to have more ease in moving through things so that upsets don't linger in the way that they happen. So I've got that part so far. What else would be useful for me to know?
[30:55] B: Well, you know, as a child. I'm sorry.
[31:06] A: It's okay. You know, if I was adverse to tears, I'm totally in the wrong profession.
[31:11] B: I know. True.
[31:14] A: So you get more tears than Oprah.
[31:20] B: I have been told many times that I. Well, for you to follow me better. My dad lived when I was two years old. I don't remember much about my childhood. I don't know why, just I give you my sister, who is only two years older than me. She does remember a lot of stuff that I don't. And maybe by then I was already like five or six. And I'm just like, oh, really? We did that. I do remember. Maybe it was something, you know, that I should remember, but I don't. So I don't remember much of my childhood before I was 11 or 12. And I don't know why. I just, you know, I just deleted it or I just don't remember. So I do have some stuff I feel like I do remember from my childhood. Just the worst of all, you know, for example, I remember my mom telling me, oh, yeah, you're a bad. You're. You're a bad child. You just look, you just like your father. You're bad. And I remember, of course, that's something, you know, that I have. I remember that I remember some part of my family making fun of me because I do, as a child, I liked it to make, you know, make jokes. And I would actually do it and make their faces so they will make fun of me. They will call me and say, hey, say that joke. And they will just laugh about it.
[33:11] A: People would be laughing at jokes.
[33:14] B: Yeah, like, you know, some.
[33:17] A: Isn't that what the person who's telling me the joke wants to have happened? It's for them to be laughing, but.
[33:23] B: To the point that they did it on purpose. Yeah, the part. The main purpose is to laugh about it. Right. But some of my family members took it to the point that they were not laughing at the jokes, they were laughing at myself. You know, I don't know how to explain it, but some of them, they were Bullied.
[33:51] A: Notice hot one here again. Yeah, yeah, right.
[33:54] B: So they will say, you know, things like, oh yeah, she doesn't know much. Like, oh yeah, she's special. And I'm like, why they refer to that? What do they even mean? You know? And so like I remember just these things. I remember my grandma punished me because, you know, I didn't do something like a task at home. I remember the housekeeper giving me a garlic, you know, like, how do you call that garlic?
[34:30] A: Garlic clove.
[34:31] B: Garlic clove. He said, yeah, eat this candy. And I eat the garlic, thinking that it was a candy. And she was just laughing so hard, you know, like it was so funny. And so I do remember, which might.
[34:45] A: Be funny, if a kid, you know, thinks that they're eating candy and they're chewing on garlic.
[34:49] B: Right, right.
[34:50] A: But again, notice how it made you feel as if there was something not okay about you.
[34:57] B: Mm, right.
[35:00] A: That's what we want shifted. Yeah, there we go. Because that's right. Because the thing is, think about it in this way. If a kid. Well, silly example, but let's say the 12 or 13 year old has got a tray full of food in the cafeteria, walking to the table and just happens to trip and fall and the food like, and splatters. There were soup. So it went all over the place. That kid is absolutely mortified and horribly embarrassed. Face is probably bright red. We know what all of the other kids in the cafeteria are doing. First they hear the loud noise, then they all turn to look, then they all get there and then they all laugh and the kid is mortified and they're laughing at me. But if we looked at it from an outsider's perspective, perspective as an adult, would it have mattered whether it was that kid or any other kid having that accident? Isn't that what they would have done? So the kids laughing wasn't about the kid, it was about what happened. So in some of these ways, we want that camera lens adjusted outward so that you internally, emotionally experience that stuff as being about them, not meaning anything about you, your worth, your identity, your lovability, whether you're good enough, any of those things. Right. Because that's where it's been running you. And then you went to the. Well, then I need to make sure that I do things always right. Perfect.
[36:44] B: So this, you know, those things really? I don't know. Yeah, this has been me affecting me. And then it was one occasion when my mom. I left, I was already 18 and I lied to her. I told her that I was gonna go to you Know, to a church event. And I actually went to the beach with my friends and she somehow found out and she came, she came and she hit me in front of all my friends. She beat me in front of all of them. And I just remember, well, even as.
[37:32] A: You'Re thinking about it right now, you got a whole thing. Now, I'm going to tell you a little secret about that. You're not actually troubled right now because that was awful. You're troubled only because part of your brain, when it happened, short circuited and doesn't know that moment stopped. That's part of the issue is that there's an aspect of your brain back then that doesn't know that moment stop over, that doesn't know that it stopped, that doesn't know that mom's not doing that now because as you're sitting here with me, is she hitting you? Right. We know that it happened back then and you get that from up here. But at that deeper emotional level, there's a part of your brain that doesn't know we want that unplugged so it no longer bothers you at all. That would be useful. And the bad feelings or the embarrassment or. We want that lifting as well. Yeah, that's right. That's what we want to have. Perfect. Cool. I know how to do that too. Yeah. Yeah. So with those past things.
[38:39] B: Yeah. And yeah, there is a bunch of them.
[38:44] A: So the lying thing that you said earlier, because then you said, well, I lied to my mom. There's two, like, reasons I'm thinking that we're going on why people lie. One is that they don't want to get in trouble and two, they want to look good. So when you reference the thing about, you know, my husband says, oh, wow, look, she's got a new pair of shoes. Yeah. I went to Goodwill and got them. Right. Are you feeling like you're going to get in trouble in that moment? Like he's going to be mad that you spent money on shoes for a two year old that are gonna be in for like five minutes. Is that the fear that he's gonna be like, why are we spending money on this?
[39:23] B: Right, Right.
[39:24] A: Okay. So that's one of the reasons. The other one at work is more the. Oh, yeah, no, I called, but they didn't answer.
[39:31] B: Shit.
[39:31] A: I never called. Okay. Called. No. And that's more to like, look good. Okay. Okay. So we want you to have more freedom there too. Right. And not have that feeling like you're gonna be in trouble because that's, you know, I Mean, why do kids lie? Because they don't want to get in trouble and they want to look good. Those are the two reasons why it happens in the world, anyway. Yeah.
[39:57] B: Yeah. But actually, with my mom, it was more like, if I tell her the truth, you won't be able to go, yeah, if I actually tell her the truth, she'll be like, oh, no, you're not doing that.
[40:07] A: Of course not. Mom is more of those. One of those people in that time that was, you know, ask for forgiveness versus permission. Because if you asked first, then you won't be able to go try to get forgiveness later. Then you've already done it, at least. But mom was pretty pissed, huh? Oh, you went to church, did you? Yeah. Okay, so we'd like to get the effect that that's had cleared. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What else would be useful for me to know?
[40:39] B: I grew up in an environment with everybody, was a single mom, my grandma, my mom, you know, my sister is a single mom. And so they have this. They believe that they better like that than actually having a partner, you know, So I grew up with this statement that, you know, we are. We can. You know, we can do it on our own. We don't need a man, you know? Yeah. I grew up in. In that environment. And so it has been a challenge to. To actually keep my marriage going. Because sometimes I. I do know that I don't want to be a single mom. I know that I don't. And. But also, I don't want, you know, I don't want my marriage to be. I just don't want to have him to have control over the whole thing because sometimes that happen.
[41:53] A: Say more about that.
[41:55] B: Well, he wants to. We just bought a new house, and he. He's mentioning a few times that, oh, yeah, my house. That's how he stayed in my house. My parents bought up this house, and it's my house. And I'm like, no, it's our house. I'm paying the mortgage. You know, we both pay the mortgage. So it's both of our house.
[42:21] A: And so is it in both your names?
[42:23] B: Yeah.
[42:24] A: Okay.
[42:24] B: And we. Yeah, I know. It's just. I don't know why he keeps saying that. But anyways. And sometimes I do have this feeling, or I just. I'm like, oh, maybe I'm just better off being on my own, you know, so I don't have to keep.
[42:46] A: When do you get it, that feeling.
[42:49] B: When we argue and when he disagree about something. And I'm like, I think I have this feeling that you know, maybe I'm just better off being on my own. I have a good job. I can buy my own apartment. Not house that I have now, but maybe a little apartment. I can live with my daughter. I don't need this jackass. You know, this is the feeling I have or this cross my mind thinking, I don't need this jackass, right? You know, why I should have been standing this man? And why should I have to support everything he wants? And I have to. I have to be here. No, I can just be on my own. And then this is just something that I think today, right? Then tomorrow I'm like, no, but I actually like him. I think he's a good guy. And so. But it's already like. I don't know, but it has been there, you know?
[43:49] A: Well, that thought, okay, so sometimes you have the thought when you're in an argument and you're not on the same page, that maybe it'd be easier or better. Then I wouldn't have to worry about, like, this kind of arguing because I don't like this feeling, right? And it's really a thought that's showing up because you don't like how you're feeling, right? Then some time goes on, you go to sleep, other stuff happens, it's the next day. And you have a different perspective on him. He's not such an asshole. I actually like the guy. Maybe he's kind of cute. Okay, We've got a good little girl together. And the mindset's different, right? So you're not having the thought because you actually want to leave him. Think of it in this way. Somebody who has a thought about dying, suicide, they have that thought frequently. Not because they actually want to kill themselves, but because they want to stop feeling bad, and they don't know how to stop feeling bad. And then their brain, which is designed to come up with solutions to problems, goes well with. One of the solutions would be if you were dead, you wouldn't have any of this pain. So that solution comes to mind. And then if it comes to mind and they're thinking, they're never supposed to think that. Then they're feeling. They're really disturbed. Oh, my goodness, I'm really screwed up now because not only am I feeling down, I'm actually thinking about, gosh, if I was dead, I wouldn't be feeling down. Oh, no. Right. So. But it's like if you go to a restaurant that has like a Cheesecake Factory, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 items on it, some of the Items on the menu are going to be things that you're not going to want to order, but they're on the menu anyway. So it's just like an item on the menu. That's what your brain is doing. It's coming up. And because you grew up in a way that, you know what? You don't need a guy. You can make it on your own.
[45:51] B: Mm.
[45:52] A: That's a good place to be. Because in my opinion, the people have the most successful relationships aren't needing each other, they're choosing to be with each other. Despite some of the shit that happens, they're still choosing to be with each other. Not because they need the other person to be okay, but because they're choosing. Right. Yeah.
[46:17] B: So, yeah, I just want to be.
[46:19] A: And as you get that check, what do you notice happen to those feelings about having that kind of thought?
[46:26] B: Well, I just.
[46:27] A: I don't know.
[46:28] B: I don't have to answer that.
[46:30] A: What happened to your body? How's it feeling now, as you just got that right? Because you have been thinking like, the thoughts were coming up because, like, maybe I need to be divorced. But they weren't coming up because you need to be divorced. They were coming up as a solution to getting you out of feeling crappy because you're in an argument. One of the ways to not be in the argument would be to not live together anymore. That's why not. Because you don't actually want to be with him. Because again, when you're in a different state, you're like, oh, no, this is actually what I want. Are there things that he wants? Because you said, I always have to do this stuff that's for him. And I get that it bothers you when he says, it's my house.
[47:12] B: Yeah, it's pissing me off.
[47:14] A: Right.
[47:16] B: Yeah. Well, you know, there is stuff like, for example, my mom is here. She's been here for a few months now. She's staying with my sister. Now it's time for her to stay with me for a few months until she'd go back to Nicaragua. And so he say he doesn't want to be around her. It's like, you know, I just don't feel comfortable. It's annoying having her here. And so I just don't, you know, I just don't want her here. And he actually didn't come last night. He stayed at his parents all night, and then he came just to sleep at night because he didn't want to be around her. And so it's like, those are one of the moments that I'm thinking that I think, okay, so if you don't want to be around my mom, this is my mom. This person is a part of me. Actually hurt my feelings because I feel like if he's not support. If he's not supporting me right now with something like this, what would happen is something. Something big happens, and I will have to have a family member with me just, you know, for help, because I need to help this person at that moment. What will happen? He's not gonna be supporting them. He's just gonna say, I don't want this person in my house. In my house. And you deal with it. He told me, just tell her to leave. And I said, I'm not gonna do that. I'm not gonna tell my mom to leave. Are you insane? This is my mom.
[48:53] A: What is it that he's not liking about your mom?
[48:57] B: He just doesn't want her to be around. He say, I don't understand what you.
[49:00] A: Guys talk about and meaning that you're speaking in Spanish and he doesn't speak Spanish. So he's like, yeah.
[49:10] B: He feel left out in conversations.
[49:13] A: Does mom speak any English?
[49:14] B: No.
[49:15] A: So good. So. So he needs to learn a smidge of Spanish.
[49:23] B: So it's like, you know, and I told you that I see a therapist before I was going to. And so I expressed to her, oh, my mom is coming. My husband is freaking out. He doesn't want her. He. He's been freaking out since I told him that she was coming.
[49:41] A: Yeah.
[49:41] B: Just because, you know, an extra person at the house, he's from another culture, you know, it's completely different. But then I told him, you marry a person from another country with different culture. This for me, it's okay. This for you isn't. So let's meet in the middle. Let's agree to something. And I'm gonna let her to interfere in your routine with Alisa in the morning. I'm gonna let her to stay away from that because. Because this is your routine. This is your one on one moment with the baby. So that's not gonna be interrupted. Tell me, what else do you need? I just don't want her at home. So he was not willing to budge. You know, he was just like, I don't want her. And that's it. Bottom line. I don't want her. But it's not optional. She have to stay with us for a few months, and then she can go back. And so, you know, this thing is actually, you know, it does affect me.
[50:44] A: Oh, yeah. Right.
[50:45] B: Because, you know, I'm thinking, I cannot tell my mom to leave. I can't do that. Even though, you know from the.
[50:53] A: So is there anything other than that she speaks a different language and that in any. It's an additional person in your space, Even if it was his best friend that's there for a week, it's nice when they leave because you have your own space again. Right. So is there other stuff about mom that he doesn't like?
[51:28] B: Not that I know.
[51:30] A: Okay. Like, it's not like he thinks your mom's a jerk or doesn't treat you well, or he's angry at her for some of the things or what's happened in life with her, or.
[51:45] B: I have told him that. I say, you're not giving me a good reason why my mind shouldn't be here because I don't understand the language, and it's just annoying. Having somebody else, an extra person in the house are not a good reason for me to tell my mom. You know what? You're not welcome to my house. Travis can send you. How can I say that? You know, he told me, just go tell her. And he said, if you don't tell her, I will go and tell her. And so, you know, I mean, the middle of that at the moment.
[52:22] A: Yeah.
[52:23] B: And it's.
[52:24] A: It's. Hey, mom, when you come to visit us in the States, you can only stay with sister.
[52:31] B: And so it's. It's very. It's disappointing because this is the person that I'm gonna live the rest of my life with. And if he can't stand my mom in my language, even when he went to my country, he came back and people were asking, oh, how was your trip in Nicaragua? Oh, it was hot. And everybody speak Spanish, and just, you know, I just feel out of place. And I'm like, you know, he was just saying all the negatives about my country. So I'm thinking, you don't like my mom. This is what I'm thinking now, right? You don't like my mom, you don't like my country. You don't like my language. You don't like my country. What the hell are you doing with me? You know, because I'm all that. I'm part of that. I'm not gonna change my culture. I'm not gonna, you know. Yeah, that's something that I will never do.
[53:34] A: Are you gonna teach your daughter Spanish?
[53:36] B: Yeah, I speak in Spanish with her. So, you know, and it's like, I don't understand why he's with Me, because all this stuff are part of me, and I'm not gonna change that. He told me one when we were in an argument. He said, well, if this is your culture, you're in America now. You should change that. And I'm like, I would never do that, not even if I live in Europe.
[54:04] A: Well, it already has changed some.
[54:07] B: Yeah. Yeah, you already have. Yes, I agree with you when you.
[54:12] A: Really think about it. Yeah, it already has changed.
[54:16] B: And I take, you know, I know that I'm married with a person with another culture, and sometime I can't stand his mom, but I'm, you know, I'm there. I go to every single event that she held at her house. And so, you know, it's like, I try to be part of that. There is some stuff that you guys celebrate here that I don't. It doesn't really mean anything for me.
[54:42] A: Right.
[54:42] B: Like that Easter, that's just. Or Thanksgiving, that's a regular day in my country. But I do go to the, you know, celebration, and I enjoy it. So I become part of it. And I. I accepted it. I said, wow, I'm gonna live in America. I have to, you know, I have to do all, you know, some of this thought I had to be part of it because I choose to live here.
[55:08] A: Yeah.
[55:09] B: So, you know, I just want to. I just want to feel. I just want to feel that he comprehend and he actually wants to share my culture and he wants to be part of it. Even if the Spanish thing, it's really bothering me because I had an ex boyfriend that I lived with him for four years. Hungarian. He speaks perfect Spanish. And so married with my husband for almost six years. Zero Spanish. It's like there is no Internet at all. And it's not something that I'm gonna push. You know, if he wants to, he can learn it. He has learned so many things in life that he actually enjoy, but it look like that's not one of his priorities, you know, And I haven't been pushing just like, okay, if you want to learn, good for you. Imagine a bilingual therapist. That's a plus even for your career. It's not even to. It's not even to communicate with me. It's just for your career as well. It's like it doesn't make sense to me, you know, Just don't make sense. So all these things, it's really been affecting me in the past and this recently, it's just been really, really stressful.
[56:44] A: I feel like, you know, you want him to understand how come it's important. And that it's unacceptable to not have mom stay with you for that period of time. Right. And she lives in a completely different country, so she gets this brief window of being with you and then goes elsewhere. Wherever you live in. Access to his mom is pretty easy. Right. You can get there in 10 minutes. Right. So it's very different. Yeah. And you want him to realize that, and he hasn't yet. Yeah. And that's been feeling, like, personal, like, because maybe then he doesn't really want to be with me because all of that is, like, part of me. You. When you get me, you get that too. You don't get me without that. Right. I mean, isn't that kind of where it is?
[58:08] B: But also because when she's not there, everything is okay between us, you know? So I just want her to be flexible, you know, this is just gonna be for two months. I know this is uncomfortable, but I'm gonna do this for you, Alaina, because. Because I love you and I know that your mom is part of you. This is your mom, and you haven't been able to, you know, be with her in 10 years. I do understand that. So I'm gonna be flexible. That's what I want. But he's not flexible in that. But it's just what I say. And this is what make me feel better or comfortable. And this is what I want, no matter who I'm affecting. I don't care if you feel sad and your mom's gonna feel not welcome in my house. I don't care about you guys. It's about how I feel or what is bothering me. That's the way I see it.
[59:04] A: Yeah.
[59:04] B: I'm not saying, you know, this is the way I see it.
[59:07] A: Yeah. Right. So you'd like that to stop. Yeah.
[59:15] B: So. So all I want is just to go home, feel comfortable, feeling like, okay, I'm home. I can relax. I can disconnect from work. I don't want anything that happens today to bother me.
[59:33] A: What does mom do all day?
[59:36] B: She was taking care of a baby. But since she's going back home pretty soon, soon she's not. She's cleaning and cooking dinner for us when we come home. She's doing the laundry. Exactly. Don't you want.
[59:54] A: Can your mom come and stay with me?
[59:56] B: Exactly.
[59:58] A: For a couple months. And I don't have to worry about meals, and I don't have to worry about, you know, whether the laundry is done. And if I need somebody to watch the kid for a little while, there's somebody to watch the kid. Yeah, I got it. Yeah. So it hasn't felt like he's even reached to meet you halfway. Yeah. And kind of just a smidge. Bit of temper tantrum. Well, then I'm not gonna. Huh. Huh.
[60:32] B: Yeah.
[60:35] A: At his parents house until bedtime. And then he comes back home to go to bed. That's like kind of like, you know, little kid temper tantrum.
[60:47] B: I know, that's, that's disappointing.
[60:51] A: Yeah.
[60:51] B: I feel like really, you acting like a two years old. Okay. You know, that's you. But it just disappears. Disappointed.
[60:59] A: Yeah. Right. I mean, he doesn't have to have lots of interaction. He can have some. He can go and watch something himself. He can read. He can do all sorts of different things, be pleasant. Yeah.
[61:12] B: Having my mom there is. So we can just. I even told him that. I said this is. Give us a break. We can lift Alyssa with, with her. Let's go to the movie theater.
[61:23] A: Yeah.
[61:23] B: Let's just take, take this time. Let's enjoy this freedom a little bit to ourselves. You know, this is the way I see it. It's a big help.
[61:33] A: Yeah.
[61:34] B: But. So I just want to, you know, I just want to. Just want to feel comfortable. I just want to. I just want to disconnect from all this stuff that is happening.
[61:48] A: Okay. Okay. And if you are disconnected from all this stuff that's happening, how would you actually be relaxed? Relaxed, huh? What's it like when you're relaxed?
[62:08] B: I feel calm.
[62:10] A: You feel calm.
[62:11] B: Nothing bothers me. I don't have this pain in my chest that is not letting me breathe. I have more energy. I have more appetite and actually enjoy a good meal.
[62:35] A: So. So you're more relaxed and calm and like nothing bothers you. Right. And you got more energy and even more of an appetite to like really enjoy, like really nice things to eat.
[62:50] B: Yeah.
[62:50] A: Yeah, that's right. And that's what you're wanting to experience more and more of. Okay, cool. Any other stuff you think would be useful for me to know?
[63:04] B: I think that's about it.
[63:05] A: Okay. Well, you've done a great job expressing to me what's been going on. And I'm excited that you're here because we're gonna make all sorts of major shifts in getting you to be a lot lighter. Because think about it again, let's get the reference point. What's been going on and feeling that in your chest and it feeling heavy and overwhelmed. It's like all of this stuff is piled. Right. So what is it going to be like when you're out from underneath it all and you're up above it and you're light and relaxed and calm like nothing's bothering you. You got more energy and you got your appetite so that like you're enjoying really yummy things. That's right. And you know what that's like to be feeling that way, because that's where we're headed, is you being free. Got it. So a couple different pieces A we're going to be using changes in how your brain has things structured or represented. And a couple things. As you were talking to me, you may or may not have heard of the term embodied cognition. But what embodied cognition means is that the way that we describe stuff, even how our body moves as we're talking, all of that comes from early sensory motor experiences. So, for example, there's universals of up is good and down is bad because nobody is up and depressed at the same time. Right. So up is a good down is bad. We know that emotion and intensity of it. The bigger and closer it is, the more I feel it, the further away and smaller it is, the less I'm going to feel it. We know that, you know, reference points, people will say things like, I'm under a lot of stress. So if we thought of that in a physical realm, stress would have to be up there and they would be underneath it. Makes sense. So one of the solutions is to get them out from under it and up above it. Because when you're up above it and you're looking down at the stress, you've got a whole different notice the body changes in how I even just in the reference point of that happening. So we're going to be utilizing some of that in making change, changing how your brain has programmed things to be represented to you. Make sense? Second thing that we're going to do with that is we want to change other kinds of structures. So, for example, when it comes to any of those troubling moments of life that you tend to remember more of, by the way, most of us are going to remember negative more intensely than positive. It's part of the biological predetermined negativity bias that we have. It's what keeps us alive. Because the remembering of negative more intensely. If I come encountering anything similar to it, I'm more apt to get away from it faster. In the same way that the rabbit who hears the twig snap and takes off survives the one that hears the twig snap and thought it was friendly Bunny George, that one's dead. Right. So we've got that negativity bias. But the reason again, that those things are still active, even though some of them have been over for a long time, isn't because of how bad they were. It's because when it happened, part of your brain got stuck on. So there's an aspect emotionally that never got the news that it stopped, that it's not happening. Right. And therefore with that activated and on what you know, you can't ever change to how you feel. Right? Because somebody might know that really wasn't about me and wasn't my crap. There was lots of different ways mom could handle whatever. How she handled it was really more about what was going on with mom then. It doesn't feel that way, right. I can get it up here, but it doesn't feel that way inside. That's what we want to get adjusted. We want to unplug those memories so that your brain gets that it's data about something that's happened, not happening. Once it's done, then what you know, we get to translate so that you feel it inside. We want to get it so that at work you've got more flexibility and flow and more space and room in dealing with things so that you're more up above it, that you're more accessing your higher wisdom as you're dealing with employee issues. That if somebody comes in really heated up, that you're able to go, you know, cool heads for veil. I'd be happy to talk to you and you can talk to me in a calm voice and that your calm in your demeanor as it's being said because it's being read as info about some kind of upset that they're having. And heck, their upset might be about something that they heard I said or something that I did, but I'm still learning about their upset. Make sense that way. You've got that up above. We want to get it so that if things aren't done exactly the way you want want them, you've got more ease in it being done. Good enough. Make sense. And that freedom to then say or not those things because sometimes it is in making the best is to own. Ah, geez, you know what? I'm human too. I totally dropped the ball on that one. Right. So we want you to have, I'm going to use the words a lot more freedom to be relaxed and calm, but not to bothers you. So they got more energy. Right. And then we want you to be having a powerful conversation about him getting the importance of having a extended family and in particular one that Lives in different country. Stay and see. It doesn't work. My sister has her there. Like, what? How is that going to, like, show up? Hey, by the way, Mom, Because I'm married to this white dude. He said no. I know we're close to his mom and we go there all the time, but he said no. Like, that doesn't put him in a good light. Right. Nor does it. Then, as you put it, my mom's gonna feel like she's not welcome. And, boy, do I want my mom to feel not welcome in my house. Hello. My mom and I might have our own crap, but I'm wanting her to be welcome in my house. Right. So we want you to be able to have that conversation again in a way that's more directive so that he can also begin to see it from a different point of view because he's locked in his. Right. And that's how it works for people. Very rarely do we see things from different perspectives. It's maybe I can see it from my perspective. I can try to get over there to see it from your perspective, but that's about it. Right. You hear that? The metaphor of, you know, you never know what's going on with another person until you walk in their shoes. Right. So we can try to get over. But we want to have a multitude of points of view to be dealing with this particular situation. Right. Because it's not one that's not ongoing. I mean, predictably, mom, when she comes back again, maybe a year from now or two years or however often she would come, she'll stay with your sister for a chunk of time and she'll stay with you. That's how it would go, right? Yeah. I mean, when you guys went to Nicaragua, did you get a hotel?
[71:20] B: I went to her.
[71:21] A: You did, didn't you? That's right, exactly. So we want that freedom and getting that. It's our, not mine. Because that's where you're coming from, and that's the openness of family. It's our family. Yeah. Right. Okay, cool. So that's where we're headed. Got it. How's your body feeling now, by the way?
[71:54] B: It's really matters.
[71:55] A: It is, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. So we're already making changes. Most of the changes, by the way that happen, happen first at a deeper level. Kind of like if I had a field and we planted all of these seeds in the field and we tend it to the top layer, maybe we got it watered. There's a lot that happens underneath the surface with the seeds. A lot of growing takes place, a lot of rooting takes place, a lot of settling takes place as those seedlings begin to grow, form, developed roots begin to shoot up. So much goes on below the surface before we ever see any of it that interesting. So your body's already responding. Your body, by the way, is the thing that's most closely connected to unconscious processing. That's the whole thing. So that's already begun to make adjustments and changing. You'll be getting it up here too. But, you know, that's as we move forward. So one other little component is as we move, when we start taking things to heart, taking things personally, what that means is one of our brains is being over utilized, therefore two of our brains are being underutilized. So what's really interesting in neuroscience today is that we've actually discovered that we have three brains, a head, a heart and a gut brain. That our gut and our heart are independent brains. 50 million neurons, 400 million neurons, 50 billion. So there's still more up there, but they operate independently. And there's more communication from, from gut to head or from heart to head than from head to heart or head to gut. And they do different things. So our head brain is our creative brain. It's the idea brain, it's the insight brain, right? Our heart brain is our love brain, our connection brain, our interest brain, our passion brain. It's the thing that keeps us going through the long haul of things. It's also, though, something that can be damaged because you hear people have heartbreak or I took it to heart, right? Our gut is not only about strength and courage, because you hear people all the time, that gals got guts, right? Like strength, courage. But it's also about an overall state of well being. Settled, grounded. Like when people are anxious, they tend to think of their stomach as being upset, right? Butterflies churning or there are lots of different metaphors that people use with that. But gut is about overall well being, a sense of calm, deep inside, settled. 95% of the serotonin, which is all about the well being, is developed in the gut. Oxytocin, which is connection, is heart. Dopamine, which is excitement, newness, his head, right? So we want your brains to be more in alignment, so that they're all engaged as you're dealing with what's going on. Because here's how it becomes a problem. Let's say somebody's got a great idea, right? And their heart is really in it, but they're just spinning their wheels, they're not gaining any traction. They're not going anywhere. We know that a gut issue is involved. If somebody's got a great idea and in society, they know they should be doing it. And so they are, but they're just like, you know, it's difficult. They're doing it, but it's like really making a lot of effort. We know that their hearts not being engaged. If somebody's really passionate about something and they're totally into it, doing it, yet it's really bad, but their head's not being engage. Does that make sense? So we want all of those to be engaged as you're dealing with the things that have been problematic. Right. Because unlike how you've been, how are you not good enough when you're being who you really are? That's right. And we want you to be feeling that things are getting done in a way that's good enough, even if it's not exactly how you would do it or perfect that it's okay to be good enough. And some of what's going to happen is certain restrictions that got implanted when you were little are going to get lifted and cleared. Because there are certain ways when you were little that you learned how I had to operate in order to maneuver through that environment, that maybe I don't need to operate that way now, but it's still always on. That would be the lying thing. Because, you know, in that environment, if you were to try to say it up front, you wouldn't be able to do it. So you had to figure out ways to like, well, I'm gonna do this, but then do that. Right, right. And that worked then. Except that one time, but it worked to maneuver through that environment. When you were hearing things about how people were laughing, and it wasn't that they were laughing at the jokes, it felt like they were laughing at you. It would have been fine if they were just laughing at the jokes, felt like it was more than that. Or when that person did the whole garlic clove or. Or those things felt taken to heart. Or when mom said, you're bad just like your dad, or when dad left, even though you know that that's his shit, he didn't feel that way. Right. And that's because. So here's the deal with the troubling stuff. One of the things that happens with troubling stuff is that the brain short circuits so it stays always on. Told you that. Second part, though, not only is it always on, but our brain attaches a meaning to the thing, does it with all things positive or negative. Not a problem. When it's positive, really problematic when it's negative. Because no matter how bad the negative thing was, the meaning that gets attached makes it feel worse. It's because when we're little again, doesn't matter what culture we grow up in, little children are lied to. Even with good parents lie. They lie by reinforcing the notion that if you're good, because we want children to grow up to be good. That if you're a good boy, if you're a good girl, your life will be good and you'll get to live happily ever after. Which is great. It's reinforced by the fairy tales, the movies, the stories, the books, the TV shows, the fables. All of that stuff promotes the same stuff. We swim in it. If you're good, your life will be good. Fine, if everything in life is always good. But unfortunately, we're human. And I've never met a human that hasn't gone through crap. Not one of us. Some people more than others. Some people, it's more intense than others. But we all have crap that's happened. The problem is, if I was trained to believe that good happens when I'm being good, what does that then mean? If something bad happens, it's because I'm bad. So even the 18 month old little boy who's got wheels able to move around now, Mommy knows that when he's quiet, he's doing something he's not supposed to do. She's looking for him frantically in the house. She sees him all the way on the other side. He's in the bathroom. He's got the cupboard underneath the sink open. He's already reached in the can of Comet. It's about to go to his mouth. She sees him. She shrieks. No. Runs over to him, smacks him on the hind, he grabs the common out. Bad boy. Now what is the neurological system of the child learning? I was doing something I wasn't supposed to do. Mommy got mad. Something bad happened to me. Therefore bad things only happen when I'm being bad. It's not true, you know, that as an adult, that bad things happen without us doing anything wrong. But because it happened, it gets stuck. Make sense? Layer that in with. We're also trained to believe because as little children we are the center of the universe. We get our parents to do whatever we want them to do. Baby's crying what do you need? What do you need? What do you need? Right. And then little children are reinforced by being told about how they make us feel. Like my mom. I had to tell her Stop doing this to my kids. Because she would come up to them and she'd go, you make grandma's heart happy, Mom. That's a lot of pressure, right? But we hear it over and over again. You make me so happy. I love you so, so much. I'm so joyful. I am so frustrated. I'm so mad. I'm so angry. Over and over and over again, a child is told that they are the cause of the people around them's emotions. So of course, a little child, you know, not knowing any different, being reinforced, not having the wisdom that we have now, thinking adults know all. If an adult leaves, well, it couldn't have been that that adult had issues with my mom. It had to mean that they must not love me, therefore there must be something wrong with me for them to have not stayed. Even if I know later on that it had nothing to do with me at all, it doesn't feel that way make sense. We want that to get adjusted and clear. Because with those two things on my brain, then on purpose, in a more sensitive way, that's why things come in and it hurts more. That's why things come in and your emotions go more. Because our brain, in a more sensitive and vigilant way, is searching for anything that has even the smallest amount of similarity to anything that was painful. But it confuses similar as saying, I mean, the dramatic example would be the guy who's stuck in traffic. He is. It's gorgeous out though. So he's got his windows down, he's got the radio turned on. He's listening safe, singing along to his favorite song. And you know, five cars up, the tractor trailer starts moving and the whiff of diesel enters his car. He's right back to standing next to the tank trying to drag his buddy who had just gotten shot. What the happened? Well, what happened was the mind confused the similar smell with the problem. Even though the issue when he was in Iraq wasn't the diesel smell, that was not the part of it that was the problem. His body being shot and trying to get him, that was the problem. But because it happened at the same time, the mind confused it. That's why we're on a more sensitive needle. That's why we've got less in the reserves. That's why we're more agitated. It's also why there's been more control on being very particular. Because if things are organized and ordered, then. I know. And we have a problem sometimes with the left hemisphere of our brain wanting things to be certain, to be known except there's a problem in the life we live. No matter how much we want certainty, no matter how much we want to know things, there's always more that's uncertain. There's always more that's not known. No matter how much you know, there's always more that you don't. No, there's always more uncertainty. So we can't always have certainty. For example, right now we can look out and we can kind of predict five minutes from now what the weather's going to be. But if we went five hours, five days, five weeks, five months, five years, the further we are from now, the less predictive accuracy we have. That's the thing with humans. We're nonlinear systems. So we want you to be able to have more flow, to have the wave come in and out so that you've got more ease in dealing with this stuff. Make sense? Okay. Any questions about that part? Okay, so then the next thing is we want to be doing a couple processes that are going to begin to retrain your nervous system to respond to this stuff more in the way that you want it to. Right. So that you're more relaxed and calm, like nothing's bothering you. Got that energy and appetite to really enjoy the things that you like. Right. So what you're going to do is put both feet on the floor. We're going to do a process that activates the stimulation of the vagal nerve. Vagal nerve is just wandering nerve, but very key in bypassing, rerouting the freeze response in the fight flight part. So you just simply slightly lower your jaw about the width of it, just like that. And then rest your tongue in the bottom of your mouth. And then begin to breathe in a way that your exhale becomes. That's right, just a little bit longer than the end. So as you're breathing just like that. That's right. Now begin to notice what happens when you allow your awareness to expand. So continuing to breathe. Notice you can focus on my nose. But then you can also begin to notice more of the space that's in the room, towards the sides of the room. That's right. You can notice more of the space that's up above you. You can notice that there's space behind you, space towards the side, space below. More and more of the space. That's right. And then simply close your eyes and imagine what it would be like if you could float up past the ceiling, past the roof, way up in the sky, and there's a you way up above, like a bird who's able to soar through space. Moving and soaring and gliding and flying in all, always in all directions. Moving, organizing, Gliding, flying. That's right. Big wide turns and curves and arching angles. Soaring way up above, looking down below. That's right. Light and more easy, flowing energy, bringing awareness back down and into your body. When you're ready, take a slow and deep breath in. That's right. And then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. Those short moments that your eyes were closed, what were you noticing within you?
[88:42] B: I was more calm.
[88:43] A: You're more calm, Right. And how's your body feeling now? Yeah, it is, isn't it? So it got calm and relaxed. Next, I'd like you to think of that moment with mom that happened when you were 18. And as you think about it, you're going to go through that moment while being here with me emotionally more fun than that moment was. Second thing. Because that moment stand alone and not connected to anything else. We want to connect that moment to something that you've done after that that was more enjoyable than that moment. So what's something. Anytime from when mom did that until yesterday, that was more enjoyable than that moment.
[89:26] B: More enjoyable?
[89:27] A: Yeah.
[89:32] B: Believe it or not.
[89:35] A: Oh, there's been lots of more enjoyable experiences. Having your little one go, mommy. Right. That's more enjoyable, isn't it? Yeah. Good. Something else that's more enjoyable than that moment. Getting your new job, is that more enjoyable? Right? Yeah. Something else that was more enjoyable than that moment. Yeah. When you got married, that was way more enjoyable. So we've got getting married, we've got here and your little daughter, same mom. We've got getting that, all of those things more enjoyable than that moment. There's an aspect of your brain that doesn't know about your daughter, about getting married, about getting that job, which would be good news for that part of your brain to be getting, don't you think? Yeah. So you're 18. Ish. When it happened. When it happened, you were where? Were you at the beach or were you somewhere else?
[90:27] B: I was at my friend's house.
[90:30] A: So you had already come back from the beach and you were at your friend's house. Good.
[90:35] B: We were out on the beach. My friends had a house on the beach.
[90:40] A: Okay, so you're at your friend's house that was at the beach. Good. And then mom came to the door.
[90:47] B: I was outside.
[90:48] A: So you're outside. Good job. Right. So you're outside like in the front or in the back?
[90:52] B: In the front.
[90:52] A: In the front. Good. And you saw her. Right. And then she pulled up in the car and then she stopped it. And then she got out of the car. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[91:01] B: Then she walked into the house. So she walked size and she just started hitting.
[91:07] A: So she walked in the house because you had already gone inside.
[91:10] B: No, I was outside. So she get off the car, me being outside. So I went and meet her, like, what are you doing here?
[91:16] A: Yeah, good job. So you went up to give her a hug or meet her. Right. And then what happened next? She started hitting you like slaps or slap. Like your face. Slap your face again. Yelling a little bit. Yeah, right. Maybe pulled your hair.
[91:30] B: She would just hit. She just hit me and I would just cover.
[91:33] A: And then you were covering. Right. And then what happened next?
[91:36] B: And then after that, we went to. I get in the car.
[91:39] A: Then she said, you're coming with me. Right. You get in the car. Right. And then what happened? And then you drove back home and then you got out of the car and then what happened next?
[91:46] B: I went to my room and I just laid down and I was crying.
[91:50] A: And that particular time ended. And then later on, you got married.
[91:55] B: Yeah.
[91:55] A: And you had your daughter, you got the new job. Right. Good. So we got getting the new job. Now, notice, as you were telling me at this time, it was much easier because you were intending to be here and your brain was beginning to read that it's data. So the second thing is to flatten it all out, we run it backwards, because when we do, it unplugs the memory and takes away the charge. So going backwards, we've got getting your job, having your daughter, getting married, and then leaving your room and then crying in your room, and then going to your room and then getting home and then getting in the car with mom, and then her slapping at you, and then you walking towards her, and then her pulling up and then you going to the beach, and then you telling her, hey, I'm going to this church thing. And then before that, your friends were planning on what to do. And then before that you were doing whatever. Good. Now, again, as we went through it backwards compared to forward, notice how it was even less. Right. Third piece. You can remember Mom D that. But the emotional brain works with patterns of association, meaning you can remember putting your watch on earlier today. But if I said to you, elada, stop putting on your watch, you'd say to me, I'm not putting on my watch. Because you know that there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually doing it. So remember getting dressed Putting your watch on. Stop putting on your watch. Say I'm not putting on my watch. Watch.
[93:20] B: Say that.
[93:22] A: Well, then stop putting on your necklaces. Say I'm not putting on my necklaces. Well, stop putting in your earrings. Say I'm not putting in my earrings. Will stop me from putting on my watch. So you're not putting on your watch. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. So you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then stop mom from slapping you. Say mom's not slapping me. Well, stop her from yelling at you. Say she's not yelling. Well, then stop her from doing that. Say she's not doing it. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. That's right. Third piece. Mom acting that way had to do with whatever was going on with her. Because there's a multitude of different ways that that situation could have been handled. But mom acting that way had to do with what was going on with mom back then. It felt like it had everything to do with me. But as we're looking at it, clearly. Did it have anything to do with you? Yeah, you might have exacerbated, but mom choosing or having that way come to mind for her to do that had to do with what was going on with her. Not you.
[94:19] B: Not me.
[94:20] A: Right. Which you know now. So now close your eyes. Think back to the younger you who's realizing it's over, finished, completed. It no longer exists. That mom being that way had everything to do with Mom. It's not about me. Let her know about getting married, having her daughter getting that job. Let her know. And what do you notice happened to the younger you's face? What's happening now? Notice how you're not hurting.
[94:56] B: Yeah.
[94:57] A: Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Right.
[95:02] B: I don't feel sad anymore about it.
[95:04] A: And you don't feel sad anymore about it. That's right. Yeah. Your brain wasn't ever wanting you to feel sad about, was causing you to feel sad about it because it was trying to motivate you to stop it. When it realizes it stopped, it went, oh, all right. Never mind. Because there was no purpose for it. So we got that piece. Now travel back to the moment of that person. I don't know whether it was a relative or housekeeper who said, here, would you like the candy? Go ahead and pop this one in your mouth and give it a chew. You can remember that happening. And you can remember her laughing as she, like, handed it to you and you doing it and you, like, chewing it up. Right. You can remember how Old you were, would that happen? You can remember her laughing. You can remember putting your shirt on. Stop putting on your shirt.
[95:59] B: Say I'm not putting on my shirt.
[96:01] A: Well then stop her from doing that. Say she's not doing that. Well then stop me from putting on my shirt. Well then stop her from laughing. She's not laughing. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Right. And her laughing, did it have anything to do with you? Because if it was you or any other kid that age in her doing that, isn't that what she would have done? Yeah, that's right. And again, close your eyes and let that younger, you know, it's not about me, had nothing to do with me. Wouldn't it matter whether it was me or anybody else in that situation? So that she gets it. Let her know then you know about getting married and having a baby. Let her know about getting their job. Right. And you can open your eyes and again, what do you notice now? You can remember. Yeah. What's happening now?
[96:56] B: It doesn't matter.
[96:58] A: Right. It's not about you. Right. And you can even think back to the time you might have been what was like four when mom said like you're bad and you're just like your father. You can remember her saying that. Right. Where were you? What was happening? What happened then?
[97:12] B: Well, she always say that.
[97:14] A: Oh good. So we'll think of one time that she did. And you might have been how old?
[97:19] B: 11.
[97:19] A: 11, right. And you might have been doing what?
[97:23] B: Well, I didn't perform the task that she wanted me to do.
[97:27] A: So she had asked you to do something, you did it, but like you're 11, so you did it like an 11 year old would do it. Which certainly wouldn't have been how a mom would have done it, but it would have been how 11 year old would have done it. It's kind of like if I, you know, ask my 4 year old to go clean the bathroom, it's probably not going to be done to the standard that I would want to clean. Nor would I suggest giving my keys when we go to the amusement park to the four year old to hold or my wallet because if I do either of those two things, the likelihood of us being able to get home or have any money, it's pretty low thinking she's the one to manage it. This is really important. You keep the keys. Where'd the keys go? Oh, good. Awesome. Right? So you did it. Then mom like yelled and she might have said, you're bad, you're just like your dad. Or you're lazy or you're good for nothing. You can remember her doing that. Right? Now, what might have happened next.
[98:28] B: After that? What happened? I cried.
[98:31] A: Right. And then what might happen?
[98:32] B: And I felt, you know.
[98:33] A: Well, but then what might have happened? You cried. And then did you go to your room? And then that particular moment ended. And then later on you did something more fun.
[98:42] B: Yeah.
[98:43] A: Right. Like get married and have a baby. Right.
[98:47] B: She goes, mommy.
[98:48] A: Right? Right. And getting your job. So you can remember mom saying that. You can remember washing your hair. Stop washing your hair. Well, stop putting on your shoes. Stop me from putting on my shoes. We'll stop mom from saying that.
[99:03] B: She's not saying.
[99:04] A: So then where is it? Say no longer exists. Right. And her saying that, did it have anything to do with you? Right. Had everything to do with what was going on with mom and being a single mom trying to manage things. And she had more than one kid, Right? Yeah. Right. And what's happening now?
[99:27] B: I don't feel responsible for how she felt. You don't feel responsible for how she felt.
[99:32] A: That's right. That's right. And I'm wondering what it would be like or what it's going to be like for you to not be feeling responsible for how he feels.
[99:45] B: Light.
[99:46] A: You feel more light. That's a good breath. That's right. That's right. Because it's not about how he feels about whether mom stays or not. It's not about whether he likes it or not. This comes with the package. It's not about whether you like it. It comes with the package. Right. You know, turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and gravy is not my favorite thing. But it comes with the package of me deciding to live in the States and marry a guy from the States. Hello. Yeah. Right, Right. So we're gonna get that to be even lighter. So then we want to go back to. You can remember. Dad might have left it, too. And again, do you have, like, any connections with him now?
[100:52] B: I do.
[100:53] A: You do? Was he somebody who was available and engaged when you were a kid? So you didn't, like, kind of, like, go to him, see him, do things on weekends, other stuff like that?
[101:06] B: No, the first time I met him, like, because I didn't remember anything about him.
[101:11] A: Yeah, right.
[101:12] B: Of course.
[101:12] A: Well, why would you? You're two.
[101:14] B: Right. So the first time I saw him was when I was 15 years old.
[101:19] A: Okay.
[101:19] B: I came to the United States. That was the first time.
[101:22] A: And he moved to the States. Got it. Okay.
[101:26] B: So I met him and since then he's. He doesn't have any. He doesn't want to commit or he doesn't have any engagement with us at all. So we see. I talk to him once in a while.
[101:43] A: Yeah.
[101:44] B: So that's pretty much it.
[101:45] A: So here's the interesting thing. Him not being engaged, does that have anything to do with you or your sister?
[101:57] B: That's his problem.
[101:58] A: Well, it has to do with him. Right. Second thing, when we're very little. Little, little, little, little. Because now that you have a two year old. Right. As we get older, we become more independent. Independent just simply means I can do more on my own. I don't need your help as much. But when we're really little, we can't move without the assistance of somebody else. We can't move our fingers because we don't even know that they're attached to us. Right. It starts to develop conscious awareness. We start to develop awareness of whether I'm going to hold on or let go. Right. Little kids don't have any. It just goes. There's no like holding it and letting it. We develop those kinds of skills. Right. Early, early, early on. We can't change ourselves, feed ourselves, bathe ourselves. We are completely dependent on those around us to take care of us. Which leads us to the model of we need them to be there in order for us to turn out okay. We need them to be well in order for us to turn out okay. But from this vantage point where you're here now, did you need him involved in order for you to turn out way better than okay? That's right. That's right. And learn a very powerful lesson, that you don't need a man to be okay. That's right. Which is where we really want you to be coming from all the time. That you don't need the man. It's nice to have a partner, have somebody else, that's. But that you don't need it. Right. I mean, if you had to, you could get your daughter wherever she needed to go and manage that stuff and do your work. That's right. You can, can't you? Right. So you didn't actually need him to be around in order to be okay. In order to turn out okay. In order to realize that you get to choose Right. And that you've got the goods. See, there's a very big difference between men and women. And the difference is men, heterosexual men are attracted and turned on by women. Women are beautiful, sensual, provocative, shapely, they smell good, their body moves in different ways. They've had different parts. Men get turned on by women. Women don't get turned on by men. We're not might be that they like what the guy looks like, but that's always secondary. Women get turned on by being a flir to tease what high school boys complain about. Oh, come here. No, no, no. Like, it's a. It's a give and take of that flirty thing. So, like, I've got the keys, you've got the goods. And not, like, in a power control way, but, like, you know, there's certain ways that I want to be treated.
[105:10] B: Right.
[105:11] A: That's right. So that you can have access to the goods. Because as I'm being treated in certain ways, it makes me like you more, which makes me want to be, you know, more intimate with you. Right. I'm not really feeling like I want to be all too intimate when, like, you're, like, coming home late at night because you don't want to, like, see my mom.
[105:35] B: Right.
[105:41] A: So we want to do two things. Close your eyes. Think back to the younger you, way back then, letting her know that her dad doing that had nothing to do with. With you and everything to do with what was going on with him, that it wouldn't have mattered who was born to that dad at that time. That's what he would have done. So that the younger you gets it. Second, let her know that she didn't even need him to be around in order for her to turn out way better than okay and have already installed that she doesn't need a guy in order for life to work so that she gets it, that she's got everything she needs to be okay. And as that younger you realizes that now, grow her up all the way up to the adult you are now. That's right. Take a big, deep breath. Breath in. And then exhale. And open your eyes. There we go. What's happening now? Yeah, because you, too, had a song, and I think it actually came from a poem where in the middle of the song, they say a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle, which is not at all. That's right. Yeah. So it's never that I need him. I'm still choosing. Right. And there are certain ways. So it's not that a woman needs a man to take care of her, but sometimes as a woman, it feels really good to feel taken care of by your man and see what you're really wanting to let him know is that you're gonna feel really good about him taking care of you. And one of the ways that he takes care of you is to be okay with your mom being here for a period of time. That's right. See, I don't think he's realized in any way, shape or form that that's part of you feeling him taken care of by him and not that you need him to take care of you. It's like if you go to the grocery store, you can carry the bags out yourself. You don't need him to carry them. If you go shopping, you can carry your bags. But it's nice if you go shopping with him for him to carry the bags. That's right, that's right. Yeah, right. You don't need him to carry your daughter to wherever you need to go, but it's nice sometimes to have him carry her. That's right. That's right. And see, I don't think that he's realized that it's about you feeling taken care of. Which is why he does the thing that he may not really want to do. Because you know, in this, lots of people are going to be like, you know what? I wouldn't really want to have my mother in law who I can't really communicate well with because I don't speak her language, living with me. Right, but you made the choice to marry somebody from a different culture who in that culture it would be extremely offensive and very, very damaging and hurtful to say, sorry, mom, you're not welcome in my house. Clicking on Accentu. Excuse the language, but it's like completely off the table. Right. See, I don't think he realizes that how much you're interested in like things working really well and you feeling taken care of. And that's about being a man. And you want him to be a man.
[109:38] B: Right?
[109:39] A: That's right. And step up. Because being a man means you step up even at times that you don't want to. Because that's where the worry went for you is, well, shit, if he can't step up to this, what if I really, really need him?
[109:55] B: Exactly.
[109:56] A: So it's really about you calling him to be a man and stepping up so that you feel really taken care of. Cuz that's what you want for your daughter, right? To feel really taken care of by her dad. So what's happening now?
[110:22] B: I don't know, I just, I feel.
[110:30] A: Yeah. So what's the thing that just came to mind? Cause you had a whole picture, whole movie that went there, see where you.
[110:44] B: I just feel like I haven't been taken care of from him.
[110:50] A: Well, he hasn't known that he hasn't been. See, the difference is that it hasn't been conveyed. So he doesn't know where you've been coming from is that, you know, he's just kind of, like, not doing this thing because he doesn't want to do this thing. Thing. He doesn't get the significance of it. And how much hotter is Nicaragua than, you know, Florida?
[111:38] B: Only different is that, you know, the houses, they don't have a central.
[111:44] A: That's the.
[111:45] B: That's the only difference.
[111:46] A: But the same level of heart, right?
[111:48] B: It's the same.
[111:50] A: It's hot here. It's sticky here. Be here in August, you're gonna be hot and sticky. And then in certain buildings, I would imagine, they do have ac.
[112:00] B: Oh, yeah.
[112:00] A: And in other buildings, they don't have it.
[112:02] B: Right.
[112:05] A: It's just how it goes. Right. Yeah. So what we want to do is we want. Want you to be conveying to him in a way that's uplifting because you really want him to stand up and be the man that, you know, he is so that you get to feel really taken care of. Right. See, he hasn't been realizing. He's been thinking, well, why would we have to have her stay? Hey, she's been at your sister's. Why can't she stay at your sister's longer? Like, as the children. That's what happens. We split it.
[112:49] B: Right.
[112:50] A: Right. That's what comes along with. And I'm wondering what it would be like if you actually like it. You know, maybe even. Maybe possibly enjoy her being here, taking the benefits of it, maybe even learning a little bit of, like, how to communicate with each other, which are more than just words. Right?
[113:35] B: Yeah, that would be nice if you can actually enjoy it.
[113:38] A: Well, wouldn't that be the whole purpose? I mean, it wouldn't work if he was the whole time, because then you're just really, like, uncomfortable. Mom's uncomfortable, you're uncomfortable, he's uncomfortable. Dog. Like, the whole thing's uncomfortable.
[113:54] B: Right.
[113:55] A: So he's got to be okay with it and be okay.
[113:59] B: Yeah.
[114:00] A: With her there. Right? Yeah. And it's about him having the perspective of understanding the bigger picture, because, again, he's swimming in it. So watch. If that stuff all lowers down and you're way up above kind of having that perspective, to see that in the bigger picture. That's how we want him to be as well. Make sense?
[114:40] B: So what can I do for her for him to be able to understand or see the bigger picture?
[114:49] A: Yeah. So what you want to be doing is in a Conversation with him, let him know how important it is, how much it matters, how you'll feel really taken care of. How you get that it's an intelligence inconvenience for him. And you get that it's got to be uncomfortable to be in your own home with somebody that you can't speak the same language with and acknowledge all of that. And despite all of that, that's what I'm wanting. Like, I get it. I get the uncomfortableness. I get how you wouldn't want that. I totally can honor that about it. I can see from your point of view that it's not ideal. It's not what you wanted, it's not what you would want so that you can reach over to be understanding where he's coming from. And in knowing all of that and how uncomfortable it is for you, you is still my request. This is what I'm really wanting. This is what. And for you to be like, good with it. So it's not good enough for you to just like, oh, she's there. And you ignore you be like pouty faced. I could do that because like that's, you know, us and that's what it's about. You know, when we signed up to be married, I'm not all crazy. I don't make us go and stay in Nicaragua for months at a time, but I might want to, but I get it. That doesn't work for us. So we don't do that. I mean, do you go every year? No. You don't even go every year. Right, Right. I don't even get to go over here. That it's really important to me. And it's not just important to me that she's here. It's important to me that you're good with her being here, that you're supportive of her being here. That's really important to me. And I'm asking that even though I realize that it's really uncomfortable and it's not what you want. Right. I'm asking it even though I know it's really uncomfortable for you and it's not what you want. But I'm also thinking like, I'm worth it because that comes with me. I'm worth it. And I'm thinking that you think I'm worth it too, or you wouldn't have married me. So you want to acknowledge his discomfort in it. And even though he's got all that discomfort, I'm still asking it because it's really important to me. And I know that I'm important to You. And then put in the what if and what if it could be way better than you ever thought it could be. I mean, he hasn't really set the bar very high, so to get it past the low bar, that he has to be better than he thinks to be that hard. Right. I mean, what if he said to you, okay, so I don't want you to speak Spanish to our daughter anymore. What if he says that?
[119:32] B: I think that will be the. The end of our bridge.
[119:37] A: See? Right. Why? Cuz that comes along with you. Right?
[119:47] B: Yeah. That's part of me.
[119:49] A: That's right. You're not going to have your daughter grow up and not know how to speak Spanish.
[120:01] B: Yeah. It's not even negotiable.
[120:03] A: That's right. Same thing with mom. And so you get it's a big ask, but I'm worth it. I really am worth it. And we're worth it. And it could actually be better than you ever thought it could be. We actually could get, like, you know, some time to, like. Like, you and I hang out as adults.
[120:30] B: Right.
[120:31] A: Oh, why we actually got married in the first place because we actually like, like each other and we could actually have time to, like, be with each other. Right. Because his mom might do whatever she does with. With her daughter. But, you know, it's nice to have somebody there.
[120:44] B: Mm.
[120:45] A: Right?
[120:48] B: Yeah. It feels nice coming home and.
[120:51] A: And food's ready and it's yummy. That's right.
[120:54] B: Exactly. It's like that take a big load out of your shoulder.
[121:00] A: Right, Right.
[121:02] B: I enjoy that. You know, he's. It's an unfortunate that he's not being part of that.
[121:09] A: Well, the problem again, right. He doesn't get the context. See, he's actually thinking it's optional.
[121:23] B: True.
[121:24] A: Got it. So with him thinking it's optional, he's acting as if you would. You can change that. But is it optional for you to, you know, stop speaking Spanish to your daughter? Sorry. I know it, but I'm gonna end it at my generation, you don't get to know any of it. So when you go see people, you won't be able to talk to them. That'd be great. Because that's like, you know, that is off the table. It's not an option for you to stop. You're going to. And even if he told you not to, you'd do it at times that he wasn't around. I mean, that's what I mean. Right. See, when he realizes that it's not optional, that it comes with the package, then he stops Trying to buck the system. Right. People go along with things that are not that optional. If somebody thinks it's optional, well then we can make a different decision about it. I don't know why we have to do this, but it's not like you get to go. You know, I think we're gonna have Thanksgiving on, you know, two Fridays from the real date.
[122:55] B: Right.
[122:58] A: Sonoma. Go. By the way, I've decided that we're not going to do Christmas this year because that's not what I grew up with or whatever. It doesn't matter, you know, I mean, because it's the merging. Right. And you're worth it. Yeah. So I'm wondering what it would be like to be really feeling like you're worth it and that it could be way better and he could actually have a good time. Cuz it's not like he's got a mother in law that's going to be telling him what to do. And even if she is, he doesn't understand any of it.
[123:56] B: No, it's just not really.
[123:57] A: She's not like that. Right.
[123:59] B: She's actually not like the real Spanish mom that you would think of.
[124:04] A: Yeah, right.
[124:05] B: It's just completely, completely different.
[124:08] A: Right.
[124:09] B: So it could be worse.
[124:13] A: That's right. Yeah. So what's happening now as you think about all that?
[124:22] B: I feel, I feel excited about having this conversation with him.
[124:29] A: Right. Because he's been coming from that it's optional.
[124:38] B: But also I kind of, I know him. So I know that he's gonna, he's gonna respond to me. What about me? What about how I feeling?
[124:51] A: That's why you want to lead with. So I'm understanding and I want to make sure I get it right. And I get how uncomfortable it is for you to be in your own home with a stranger that you don't share common language with. That's going to be living in your space. It's uncomfortable, it's not what you want, not what you would ideally have. You could have it another way. You'd have a mother in law suite where she's living next door and has her own thing and then could come over. But like we still have your own space. Face. Whatever. I get that that's not what you would be wanting and it is what we got because that's what you got when you married me. And I'm sorry you didn't know that up front. I just assumed that that was a no brainer course because in my world that's how it goes. So I didn't even think that it would be a problem, but, like, that's what comes along with me. It's totally worth it. And I'll feel really taken care of. And you know what it's like when I feel really good and I feel really, like, taken care of by you and I really, like, want to, like, be with you. How much better is it for you? Yeah. Right. Because that's what you want to do. Does that make sense? Yeah. Cool. So I want you to check something. I'd like you to think back about somebody coming in and just, like, giving you a piece of their mind, like, really pissed off. Like, what are you noticing?
[126:55] B: I'm calm.
[126:56] A: You are, aren't you?
[126:57] B: Yeah.
[126:58] A: Right. Like nothing's bothering you because you're relaxed. That's right. And you might say to them, hey, you know what? You probably don't want to be saying all this right now, so go ahead and calm down. And I'd be happy to talk to you when you can talk to me in a calm voice. But notice how it's not hitting here.
[127:16] B: So I'm not taking it personally.
[127:18] A: That's right. That's right. Isn't that a good news thing? And him not wanting your mom there isn't personal either. You're learning about, like, his own discomfort. Right. I mean, we wouldn't want him to be, like, really sad as she's leaving, going, oh, my God, now I'm gonna have to do all these things myself. Can't you stay for another week? Right, right, right, right. Cause it could be better than he ever thought. What if it is? How cool would that be? Right? Yeah. So notice how things are already lighter. Yeah. So I'd like you to check. Now think about, you know, you've had a busy day. There's been a lot going on. You get home, right? And you go to put something in the dishwasher again. What do you notice? How are you feeling?
[128:46] B: Calm.
[128:47] A: You are? Yeah. Notice how you're a little more easy going. Right. Because things don't have to be so particular in order for. For you to be okay. And think about the people laughing who laughed not really at the jokes you were telling, but at you telling the jokes because they thought it was cute and funny that this little kid is like, you know, got these funny knock knock jokes or whatever kind of jokes because they think it's cute. Right. So they're laughing, they think it's cute. Little kids, like, making people laugh. Right. And see what was going on back then is you thought that they were laughing at you because it Meant like there was something wrong with you. But as you're thinking about it now, were they laughing because there was something wrong with you or did they think it was cute?
[129:51] B: I think I was saying a joke.
[129:53] A: Right? Exactly. You were saying a joke. What little kid comes up with, like, jokes to say? Right. And as you're getting that again, thinking back about that stuff, how does it feel now?
[130:13] B: I feel calm.
[130:15] A: You do, don't you? Yeah. Not a good news thing. That's right. Yeah. There we go. That was a good breath. Yeah. All right. Notice how things are already changing. Yeah. What's happening now?
[130:45] B: I feel lighter.
[130:46] A: You do feel lighter.
[130:47] B: I don't feel pressure on my chest.
[130:50] A: Yeah, right. That's right. And then think about things that work. Is it a good idea to leave your favorite pen out, Brolin? Not if you wanted to stay. None of you want to have it again. If it's your favorite, you might want to keep it with you. Right. Because I don't give my keys to my 4 year old because they might get lost. Right. Yeah. So then let's think about the last little piece, which has to do with you being up above that stuff. And it's already dropped down below. So that as it's down here and you're seeing what there is to do. Right. Because you already have the. You already have a way of systemizing things. You can have a list, you can do other things, but in operations, you have to have a big picture of how all things work. But you also have to have the ability to dive in to a particular component. Make sense. So think of it in that way. In operations, you're always looking at both at the bigger picture, but then knowing about each component and being able to dive in. That's right. What's happening now?
[132:49] B: I have a better view.
[132:51] A: You do have a better view. Yeah. And with those things down there and you being up above and being able to dive in, it's always about chunking. So here's the things that there are to do. I'm seeing them down there. There are things to do. Okay. Given that, what is. And here's the word, what is the thing that makes sense for me to do first? So whenever you're looking at all this stuff, right. The question goes back to from up above, knowing all of that to sequence it, because now it's been chunked. These are the things that there are to do. What is the thing that makes sense for me to do first? And do that one. Because once you do that one, it'll then lead. What's the thing that makes sense to do next. And what if some new thing comes in that might resequence? That's right. But see, being up above it and being knowing what needs to get accomplished down there, being up above, seeing it down there, what needs to be done first. And then I go and I do that, still knowing all the other stuff. But new stuff might come in and then just get resequenced. It might be put at the end if it's something that can be put on the back burner, or it might get resequenced up front because that's something that needs to get done first. But that it's the up above, seeing it down below, knowing how it's sequenced and doing one. The problem is when we take too big of a chunk too much, or when we go too far down the road that we lose our freedom and flexibility. So here's the interesting last analogy. I once took a flight from Arizona to Atlanta, and I'm not a person who knows much about planes. Somebody asked me, so the percentage of time that the nose of the plane is pointed to Atlanta, what percentage of time do you think from Arizona to Atlanta is the nose of the plane pointed to Atlanta? And I'm thinking 70, 80% of the time. How else is it going to get there? And the person said to me, no, it's 2% of the time. 2% of the time. How does it ever get to Atlanta? Well, what happens is a plane is dealing with another nonlinear system, the weather. And it's constantly making micro adjustments along the way towards wherever it's headed. Very rarely is it pointed to Atlanta as it's making the micro adjustments along the way to get to Atlanta. The time that it's pointed most to Atlanta is as the plane is headed down to land on the Runway. That's when it's narrowed down. So when we have an idea of how we want something done, that's the end. We want to have a wide angle in reaching it, not a straight line. Because for human beings, the fastest way from point A to point B is not a straight line. We want to stay closer to now because that's where more predictive accuracy is. The farther we go in the future, the less predictive accuracy, the closer to now, more predictive accuracy. Five minutes from now, we know the weather. Five hours from now, it's going to be a little less predictable. Makes sense. So you look at, okay, here's what's going on. Here's what I know from the day before. And I've got on my list here what I know is going on from what I've learned. And coming in, it's all out there. Realizing that there may be new things as I'm working throughout the day that come in, but I've got that map. Okay. What is the thing that makes sense for me to do first? And I start that if new things come in, they might resequence. But once I get done with that, then I'm gonna know what's the next one. Right. And that way you're taking small steps. And one of the things that happens when we take small steps is that somewhere along the way there's a leap. We don't know where that's going to happen. But somewhere along the way, whenever we take small steps, there's a leap that happens. Changes because it's a nonlinear system. So as you be now up above, seeing that stuff down below, looking at what needs to get done, knowing what's going on. Okay. What needs to be done now starting that, doing that, coming back up, looking. Okay, is there new stuff? Great. If there is, it gets resequenced. If not, what's next? What do I need to be doing now? And that will keep things a lot more ordered. And you can use all the strategies that you already have in operations to make that work. Because operations is about seeing the big picture and knowing the small pieces and how those pieces interact with each other. That's why I need a little bit of staff in each area to be able to have the hotel run. Okay. We've hired all of the front desk staff. Do we have any housekeeping? No, but we got front desk. Well, how's that gonna help us? Right. Well, I got that one done. Well, we kind of need it. Right? Exactly. Anybody doing maintenance? No, it's brand new building. We don't need maintenance, do we? Right. Yeah. That was new building. No, there's never anything. Right. So you already have then the strategy. That's right. So what's happening now? As we think about laying it out in that way.
[139:07] B: It feels more organized.
[139:11] A: Yeah.
[139:11] B: I know now that I can start what might make sense.
[139:15] A: Yeah.
[139:16] B: But then if other things comes out, I can take care of it.
[139:20] A: That's right.
[139:20] B: And. And continue.
[139:22] A: That's right. That's right. Yeah.
[139:28] B: I feel less worried about.
[139:32] A: That's right. Because you're out from under it. You're up above it now. Yeah. Right. And there is more room. Right. And ease to deal with it. Yeah, yeah, you do, don't you? Because we know what happens when you're calm and you're relaxed, like nothing bothers you. Then you have that energy and even a real appetite. Right. And we wouldn't want you to be energetic and having that appetite, you know, to be in connection with your husband. Because it leaves more time for you to be connecting with him having her here. Yeah, that's right. And you're working.
[140:37] B: It.
