[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 13th of January, Alison. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that Victoria is here. Observing, given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative. It might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:16] B: Yes.
[00:17] A: Cool. So first, I'm really curious. How did our last session leave you? What have you noticed for yourself beneficially? How have things been?
[00:29] B: Well, after, I didn't really understand what happened, but, like, I felt better.
[00:38] A: You did, didn't.
[00:39] B: Yeah, like, I felt lighter and. Well, because after I left her, Aaron was actually at the house.
[00:45] A: Oh, fun.
[00:46] B: She kind of checked in with me and I was like, I don't know what just happened to me, but it's good.
[00:51] A: It's good.
[00:51] B: And then I try to think back on the memory, and it was different sometimes, somehow.
[00:56] A: What was different?
[00:57] B: Well, I can't really remember how it was initially. Like, it just feels different. And I feel like it's kind of like the perspective shifted.
[01:06] A: Cool.
[01:06] B: And it's just different somehow.
[01:11] A: Yeah.
[01:12] B: Yeah.
[01:12] A: It doesn't make you feel yucky anymore? No.
[01:14] B: Like, I can see. Like. Like, it's just. It changed somehow. It's still the same, but it's still all.
[01:21] A: All of it is still what happened.
[01:22] B: Yes. But it's just different.
[01:24] A: It is, isn't it? Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[01:26] B: Yeah.
[01:27] A: Yeah. Very exciting. Right? Right. Because your brain, for the first time, got to experience that stuff as data about something that happened because where it had been lodged and coded is happening. That's why anytime you thought about it or were reminded of it, it still. Cause that. Okay, so that's really great about that. What else have you noticed for yourself in terms of interactions and other things like that? I know that there was a concern because you'd been in what I would consider more fight, flight, reactionary mode. You had a moment to pause in that moment to pause. It felt like things were starting, but then it was like, stuff that I didn't want to have to talk about. Like, so how have things been for you within all of that?
[02:17] B: Well, okay, so since then, I feel like I have opened up a lot more. Definitely. Like, I feel like I'm probably a completely different person right now than I was the last time I was here.
[02:29] A: Isn't that cool? Good job. Yay. Good for you.
[02:31] B: I mean, I still.
[02:32] A: Like, what's different? How so?
[02:34] B: Well, like, probably back then I was still really closed off and, like, not talking or like, even really able to hold Conversations and stuff like that. But I think I talked to you about that. Like.
[02:49] A: Yeah.
[02:50] B: To be able to.
[02:51] A: Yeah.
[02:51] B: But I feel like I've opened up a lot more and been able to, like, trust more and just be able to, like, interact and connect.
[03:00] A: Trust more in you.
[03:01] B: In myself and other people. Yes.
[03:04] A: Better to trust in you.
[03:05] B: Yes. In that. Yes.
[03:08] A: That you can discern stuff.
[03:09] B: Yes.
[03:10] A: Yeah.
[03:10] B: And, like, ask questions. Questions and choices and things like that.
[03:15] A: Okay. So that's way better. Yes. Awesome. Well, that's exciting.
[03:18] B: Yes.
[03:19] A: What else have you noticed?
[03:23] B: I've been working through a lot of. All the old stuff is coming up. So, like, there's a lot.
[03:38] A: So we want to get the impact that. The old stuff.
[03:41] B: Yes. I mean, I have some things that are, like, currently happening.
[03:44] A: Sure.
[03:45] B: I kind of am, like, like, stressed out about.
[03:49] A: Okay.
[03:50] B: And then also. Yes. Like, I'm having, like, dreams and stuff like that that are not good, like, and they're not really nightlife.
[03:58] A: Well, then they're not really dreams. I mean, dreams should be, like, aspirational.
[04:01] B: Yes.
[04:02] A: And I'm having these dreams of, like, not those.
[04:04] B: And I get asked, like, are you having nightmares? And in my mind, it's like, no, I'm not having nightmares. I'm not being, like, chased around with, like, you know, like a serial killer or something like that. But it's like, I dream about, like, working, you know, like, going and. Well, first. Okay. When I first got. I didn't really dream before, but when I got to assessment, I would wake up in the middle of the night and, like, crack, cry and be, like, very emotional.
[04:32] A: Sure.
[04:33] B: And then I saw this doctor, and then he prescribed me this, like, very. He says, like, very, like, minimal sleeping aid. I take a night. So I sleep through the night now. But now, like, when I first got. I started taking it when I got to the residential. So first, like, like every single night, my dreams were, like, my trafficker, like, trying to, like, persuade me to, like.
[05:00] A: Get back into life. Yeah.
[05:02] B: Or just be with him. I was with him for a really long time.
[05:04] A: Like, we were Right. And have, like, kids with him. Right.
[05:06] B: Yes.
[05:06] A: Yeah. So. Okay.
[05:07] B: Yeah.
[05:08] A: So just like, babe, it'll be great again.
[05:10] B: Yeah, something like that. And I was always, like, trying to get away from him, and just, like, he was always just popping up everywhere and trying to, like, you know. And then now I'm having more dreams about, like, when I was working and, like, going to work and, like, being in clubs and, like.
[05:25] A: Oh, that kind of work.
[05:26] B: Yes.
[05:26] A: Sorry, not the 9 to 5 job. No, different Kind of work. Yeah.
[05:30] B: Sorry. Going to work and being in clubs and, like, you know, like, doing, like, dates and stuff.
[05:40] A: And as you've been thinking about those things, what's been going on in here?
[05:43] B: Well, the thing is, I don't think about that at all. I mean, I do.
[05:48] A: So at night, when you're dreaming.
[05:51] B: Yeah. But during the day, I'm not really thinking.
[05:53] A: Of course. But at night, when you're dreaming.
[05:55] B: Yes.
[05:57] A: Right. Is it you looking at you like you're watching you on a video screen, or is it you through your own eyes?
[06:05] B: I feel like whenever I have the perspective of seeing myself, it's like the back of me.
[06:09] A: Okay.
[06:10] B: And like. Yeah. Like, I'm.
[06:12] A: So you kind of see you from behind.
[06:14] B: Yeah.
[06:15] A: You know, the third person. Okay.
[06:17] B: Yeah.
[06:18] A: And that's when it's happening in the dreams, because you're kind of seeing you from behind. Like, kind of seeing the. You doing those different activities that you were doing when you were working.
[06:28] B: Yes. Yes.
[06:29] A: Got it. Okay. Does that. Do you wake up with discomfort or. How do you know that you've had that dream?
[06:35] B: I just remember it when I wake up.
[06:37] A: Oh, fun. Okay, cool. So I wake up in the morning and remember. Oh, I was thinking about the time that I was doing this thing with that. Yeah.
[06:43] B: And it might have been something that necessarily happened.
[06:45] A: Okay.
[06:45] B: You know, like. Well, maybe I did. I don't remember. There was a lot going on. I don't know. But, yeah, like, I'll just wake up. I get to sleep through the night now.
[06:56] A: Yeah.
[06:57] B: But when I wake up, it's like, that wasn't. You know, like, that's what I dreamt about. And then I just try to go about my day. And then I'm also dreaming about something else that Aaron said I should talk to you about. But it's like something else that. And she said that you would understand if I told you this. Like, it's separate. Like, I need to keep it separate from all the yucky stuff because it's like a hurt. But it's like a precious hurt. It's not like a yucky, gross hurt.
[07:26] A: So what about it? Okay, so one's a precious hurt.
[07:29] B: Yeah. Like, it's. It's different. And, like, I don't really know how to explain it. I just started talking to her about this.
[07:37] A: It. It's something that hurts.
[07:39] B: Yes.
[07:40] A: When you think about it, there's an emotional charge.
[07:42] B: Yes.
[07:43] A: But it doesn't fit in the same category as the awful things that happen to you.
[07:48] B: Yes.
[07:49] A: Okay. But it still has an Emotional effect.
[07:52] B: Yes.
[07:53] A: And we want the effect that it's had lifted so you're more. Okay. And at peace with both. Okay. I can get behind doing that. Okay, cool.
[08:05] B: So, I don't know. In my mind, it's just, like, separate. Like, I keep it.
[08:09] A: Well, they're not the same thing.
[08:10] B: Yeah.
[08:11] A: And they weren't about the same stuff.
[08:12] B: Yes. But I don't know how to explain it.
[08:14] A: That's why it's separate.
[08:15] B: Yeah. So, my son, is this the precious one?
[08:21] A: Yes. Oh, I know. You're going to tell me about it right now and be emotional.
[08:24] B: Okay.
[08:24] A: Why would we want to do that first?
[08:28] B: Okay.
[08:29] A: Right. Because you're emotional, not because it happened. I know that sounds weird again. No, no. I am emotional because it happened. But remember, the reason that we stay troubled by experiences that happened isn't because they happened, but because emotionally, our brain doesn't know that it's not happening. Got it. So before we talk about that, we want to know. Well, like, if that thing was no longer causing all of this stuff in you, like, how would you actually be happy? You'd be, like, happy. What's it like when you feel happy? Would you be happy about the thing?
[09:08] B: About the thing that happened?
[09:10] A: Yeah. No, you wouldn't be happy. So happy isn't the right emotion. Right. If it was no longer bothering you, it's not like, oh, I'd be happy. Then. Like, how would you actually be.
[09:18] B: Peaceful.
[09:19] A: Yeah.
[09:20] B: Peaceful.
[09:21] A: So, again, just check inside. What's it like inside of you when you feel peaceful?
[09:28] B: Like, free.
[09:29] A: Yeah. So let's think of where we're headed, is a you who's more peaceful and free. Got it. And then all we want to do is get your body into the right state. Right. And you know that the right state is that state of rest. That's where you slightly lower your jaw. Right. And then you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Right. And then you breathe just like you are. A little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out. And so you notice immediately what's starting to happen with how your body's feeling now as you're breathing in this slower, deeper, longer way. Right. Allison, how's your body feeling now?
[10:17] B: More relaxed.
[10:19] A: It is feeling more relaxed. Isn't that a good news thing? Okay, so to take a piece. We want to get that thing cleared. We've got other stuff that you've gone through that sometimes ruminates at night or I have thoughts about or dreams about what have you that I remember we want the impact that that's gone. What about in today? Like current, other stuff? That's. What else do we want to get back better.
[10:42] B: Okay, so what's going on now?
[10:45] A: Yeah, yeah, cuz I got that. I know what to do about those things. We got those earmarks. We're going to get that better.
[10:51] B: So you just want me to tell you like the scenario?
[10:55] A: Yeah. Like what do we want to do now?
[10:57] B: Like, of what's. What I'm stressed out about.
[11:00] A: Yeah, like what's currently happening. That's challenging for you. Okay, sorry.
[11:04] B: I mean, there's a lot of different things. Last though, I had like this thing where. Okay, so like my. I have like some legal issues and I had to make a decision about, like, what I'm gonna do. And that was really hard for me because I'm not used to making decisions.
[11:29] A: Okay, did you make the decision?
[11:30] B: I made the decision.
[11:31] A: What did you decide to do?
[11:33] B: I decided to take a plea deal.
[11:35] A: Okay.
[11:35] B: And. But I don't know what's gonna happen.
[11:38] A: Yeah, like.
[11:41] B: Like the least thing that could happen is that I would get like probation. And then the worst thing. Well, the worst thing that could happen is like, probably like maybe a year or so in prison, but possibly like, not. Probably not a probable thing. But the judge can, like, you know.
[12:04] A: Judge could do what he does.
[12:05] B: Yeah, yeah. So.
[12:07] A: Okay, so you made that decision. Yes. So then am I following you? That we want you to be at peace with the decision you made?
[12:15] B: Yes.
[12:16] A: So that like, you're good with it and what?
[12:20] B: Yes, because.
[12:21] A: Okay, cool. I can get behind that.
[12:22] B: Okay. I could have went to trial, but I didn't because I. If I would have lost the trial, then it would have been like way longer in prison and I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I made that decision and I lost. And then my children, you know, I'd be away from them for a long time.
[12:44] A: Yeah.
[12:45] B: And so I took the plea deal.
[12:48] A: Yeah. Yeah. So. So in that regard, we want you to be okay with what you decided to do and at peace with it because based on the information that you had, you did the thing at that time that you thought would be best to do. And we want you to be at peace with that inside of you. Okay, cool. I can get behind doing that too. Cool. So that's been a major stressor that had been going on.
[13:14] B: Yes.
[13:14] A: Now I've made that decision. We want to make sure that you feel that. That's right.
[13:18] B: Yes. Because I want to be able to like, finish the program and stuff like that. And if, you know, if I got sentenced to prison, then they would take me out of the program. I wouldn't be able to.
[13:28] A: Yeah. So again, with the information, you did what you thought was best, and we want you to be good with that. Cool. Okay. What else?
[13:37] B: Well, I found out that my daughter. My daughter has been, like, going through emotionally since, like, for the past few months, and she was, like, hurting herself, and she's not anymore. But I feel responsible for that because I'm not with her and I can't protect her, and I feel really bad about that. And she's at the age that I was when everything started going bad for me, and I. I'm just scared about that.
[14:19] A: Okay. So I want to make sure that I'm following you. You found out some trouble and stuff that your daughter's been doing. She stopped, which is great, but that she had been doing. And then you felt, like, personally responsible, because if I was there, maybe I could have prevented it. And then it reminded you of, well, shit, this is the time that went downhill for me. Oh, no. And you've got, like, some concerns about her, well, being and wanting her to be okay.
[14:44] B: Yeah.
[14:45] A: And you're here, so there's not a lot of full interaction. Yeah. So again, you're getting yourself well and doing the steps and taking the actions of healing is all about being more available.
[15:02] B: Yeah.
[15:03] A: Yeah. Right. So we want that, like, kind of set in stone for you so that, like, you're real solid with this is what's up for me. Makes sense.
[15:14] B: Yeah.
[15:14] A: Okay. But it makes sense to have some concerns.
[15:18] B: And then I keep having, like, heart palpitations.
[15:22] A: What does that mean?
[15:23] B: Like, my heart, like, beats out of my chest.
[15:25] A: Okay. That's fun, right? Is that when you're running? No, that's when it happens a lot. I mean, if I have to sprint for a little bit and all of a sudden I stop, like, this thing is just going a mile a minute.
[15:35] B: Yeah.
[15:35] A: Maybe I'm not in good shape, but it's something.
[15:38] B: But it just happens, like. Yeah.
[15:41] A: So where might you be when it happens?
[15:43] B: I don't. I mean, just randomly it happens.
[15:46] A: Yeah.
[15:46] B: Even when I'm just.
[15:48] A: What might be going on when it happens? What might you be thinking, saying to yourself, Seeing in your mind's eye, hearing, feeling?
[15:54] B: Well, it's actually, oddly enough. Well, it's when I have anxiety sometimes, but then sometimes, too. It's just like, when I'm not doing anything and, like, my body is, you know, like, I'm just watching tv for like a. Like, I notice if I watch, if I sit for too long and I'm not, like, moving around and doing stuff, like, my heart will start palpitating.
[16:15] A: It'll start beating faster.
[16:16] B: Yeah.
[16:16] A: Then what happens?
[16:17] B: Then I try to figure out a way to make it stop doing that.
[16:21] A: Do you get up?
[16:22] B: Yep, I'll get up. Sometimes I'll, like, wander around and then, well, I try to, like, do the. The ice or the feet in the pool or breathing. Like, I'm trying these different things. Talking that those things can help.
[16:38] A: Yeah.
[16:39] B: Yeah.
[16:39] A: Okay. Well, how do you know when to do it? Like, can you do it now?
[16:43] B: Do it?
[16:43] A: Yeah. Like, think about whatever you need to think about or any of the stuff and kind of feel that heart palpitation.
[16:48] B: It's happening now.
[16:49] A: It's happening now. Yeah. Right. So just notice the sensations for a moment.
[16:52] B: Okay.
[16:53] A: Right. Get curious about them. Because there's a thing about sensations. I don't know whether you know this, that sensations are always moving, meaning they're always changing. So just notice the sensations you're noticing and notice how it's changing. Right. And what do you notice about how it's changing?
[17:14] B: I mean, I can feel my heart beating hard and fast and I feel like. My back feels, like, tight now.
[17:21] A: You notice?
[17:22] B: Real tight.
[17:22] A: And shoulders. Right.
[17:24] B: Yeah.
[17:24] A: Notice the sensations, Notice how it's changing. Right. Sensations are a wave, so just notice how they're changing and go, hmm. I wonder how the sensations are changing this time. Because part of what happens when we get this is we go down the track. Right. So there's whatever's going on. Oh, no. And now I'm gone. We never have the embodied experience of the feelings changing. Do you follow me with that? Like, we're never really consciously aware when it changes. We know it does because I don't always have it.
[18:05] B: Yes.
[18:06] A: But I'm not consciously aware of it. Maybe I got myself distracted, I'm doing something else, and then I realize it's not there anymore. Yes, Right. That kind of thing. So what we want to be doing with this so it stops running that program is be aware of how it's changing in the moment that it's changing and not go down the track. So we just pay attention to the sensations, and we have a multitude of ways that we can pay attention to sensation. We can pay attention to the sensation by going, hmm, we can notice the sensations and we can make our eyes really big. We can notice the sensations. We can lower our jaw all the way. Right. That'll encourage a deep breath. In or a yawn, we can notice the sensations. We can do a physiological sigh which is a deep breath in and then on the top of that breath, it's another breath. So it goes like this. Any one of those ways are processes that start to down regulate nervous system. So think of when we get triggered. We go down dorsal branch. Any of those processes, we're going to run through them all, start moving your body back to ventral branch. Because the vagus nerve only has two sides that it goes.
[19:26] B: So that's the good one.
[19:27] A: Yeah, that's when I'm more alert and aware but relaxed. It's when I'm more present, that's when I'm more mindful and I'm wide open. All of those things. Right. So again, what do you notice about what's happening here now?
[19:43] B: My heart is not beating as hard.
[19:45] A: It isn't as beating as hard. Right, right. So again, do whatever you need to do, think about whatever you need to think about and get the heart to be faster. You know how it happens when it starts being quicker? Right. You might be somewhere where it doesn't. All of a sudden it's starting to be quicker.
[19:59] B: Yeah.
[19:59] A: Now you're noticing that it's beating quicker and it's like I don't really like that it's beating for. What does that mean? Maybe I should get up, maybe I should distract myself. But just notice that it's beating quicker and then get curious about how you can notice it changing. And as you're curious, do the first run of curiosity with your eyes. Big go. How's it changing? And get kind of curious about how you're noticing it change. And what do you notice about how it's changing?
[20:25] B: Slowing down.
[20:26] A: Oh, now it's slowing down. That's right, it's slowing down. And as it's slowing down, what do you notice about it?
[20:36] B: I might not feel as tight.
[20:38] A: Oh, right. And then you're looser. Right. Same thing. You want to be thinking about whatever you need to think about to get it going. Because you know there might be those times where all of a sudden it starts happening and then you notice it and you can kind of feel it. It's kind of going. It might be quicker or it's thumper. You got it. Like when it does that. Right. Feel the feelings. Right. As you're noticing the sensations. Again, get curious about it. As you get curious about them. This time, drop your jaw all the way and know that when you do that, eventually it'll cause you to take a deep. That's Right. Breath in or yawn. And what do you notice happening to those sensations? Oh, it slows down again. That's right. Because we're beginning to change the relationship to the sensations. Right. Because part of what's been going on is that you've been thinking, I shouldn't be having it. And then when I have it because I'm thinking I shouldn't be having it makes it worse. Right. I had a girl that was on the phone with me the other day, and one of the things that had happened to her is like, her mom had cancer and urinary cancer and died. And they didn't know. Of course, that was an early time when they didn't do, like, medical checks very often. There was no, you know, wellness checks or anything like that. But she had a lot of anxiety and she went to the doctor. Doctor like, oh, you look great. And then they called up and they go, your blood work shows that you must have a uti. She's like, that's weird. I don't have any symptoms. And then of course, she had the thought, oh, no, what if this is bladder cancer? Like, my mom had blander cancer. And so she started typing Google and she was thinking that she shouldn't have that thought. Like, that's. But wouldn't that be normal for somebody whose mom had had bladder cancer and died? For if she is being told by the doctor that she has a UTI but she doesn't have any symptoms, like, oh, no, could it be? Isn't that normal? Right. Like, it would make sense that she would have that kind of thought about it, but it would be worse if then when she was having that thought, she was thinking that she shouldn't be having that thought because, oh, no, now my anxiety's got a hold of me and I'm thinking all these. You follow me with that. So same kind of thing is happening here when you've been thinking that I shouldn't be having it and then me having it makes it feel worse. Got it. So again, do whatever you need to do. Think about whatever you need to think about to get it to move fast. Right. And you know how it happens when it moves fast and you get a little bit of nervous anxiousness going on and you can notice it feeding quicker. Right. You can feel it. And then you get curious about it, and then you take that deep breath in the physiological side and then at the top and then a long exhale. And what do you notice happen to it?
[23:16] B: That it's normal.
[23:17] A: That is normal now. Right? Right. Because we're transforming the relationship to the sensations. So I'm not so troubled that I have sensations. That's right. Because it's in my awareness of it that I notice it, that has it happen more. Right. The more I bring my awareness to something, the more I'm gonna notice it. Make sense?
[23:49] B: Yeah.
[23:49] A: I'm driving down the road and I got a new car because I didn't see him on the road. Now that I'm in one, I see him all over the place. Were they not there before? Did everybody just buy the car that I got or. Oh, right. It's in my awareness. When it's in my awareness, my brain brings more of it to my attention. Got it. So we're all about settling and quieting and calming down the nervous system so that you feel much more settled and okay and comfortable in your own skin. We want emotionally, mind and body to be reading all of the past stuff as data about something that happened, not happening. And we want you uptime and clear and outwardly focused so that you're interacting with stuff, not thinking much about you. Got it. Because inside of you, you're connected to more of who you are. Peace filled, whole. Got it.
[24:52] B: Yes.
[24:52] A: That's where we're headed. Cool. Okay. Any other stuff that comes to mind?
[25:03] B: I guess just going through, thinking about old things or like, you know, processing all the things.
[25:13] A: We want you free.
[25:15] B: So I was in, you know, the relationship was like almost 18 years, so.
[25:20] A: Or the guy that did the trafficking.
[25:22] B: Yeah.
[25:23] A: And three kids.
[25:24] B: Four.
[25:24] A: Four kids. That's a lot of kids.
[25:27] B: There were five.
[25:28] A: There were five. Oh, there's that too. That's the other thing that we want to get cleared up. Oh, because that's heavy too.
[25:34] B: Yes. That's the one that I want to keep separate.
[25:36] A: Oh, that's the heavy thing. That's separate. That isn't the same as all the other.
[25:40] B: No.
[25:40] A: But still heavy.
[25:42] B: Yes.
[25:42] A: And we want to be at peace with it.
[25:44] B: Yes.
[25:44] A: Okay.
[25:46] B: So just like thinking about. We're trying to. Okay. First of all, I noticed it's a lot like I just noticed like thinking back, like.
[25:55] A: Right. Trying to remember just for a moment.
[25:57] B: Yes.
[25:57] A: Instead of having them all right there, what if you put them all out here? Okay. Kind of just see them all down there.
[26:03] B: Okay.
[26:04] A: And kind of see you up above so you can see more of it. Because when it's here, it's all like kajungle. Right. What happens is you get more distance from it and it's out here in more space.
[26:13] B: Okay.
[26:13] A: Just notice what happens inside of you as you see it over here with more space, what do you notice?
[26:19] B: It's not as heavy. I don't know. Like, it.
[26:26] A: Yeah.
[26:26] B: All the time seems like it was, like, smushed into this.
[26:29] A: Right. So notice when it's down there and it's spread out.
[26:33] B: But. So when I think about, like, just not anything necessarily even, like.
[26:41] A: Well, I don't know.
[26:42] B: I guess the whole time is not great, but just, like, it's.
[26:46] A: I don't remember things correctly, maybe the whole time. So the frame was awful. Not every moment within that frame was awful, but because the frame was awful, the whole thing was awful. Do you follow me with that? Yes. Right. Like, it's not that every act was an awful act, but if it's coming from the cut. Right. That's what makes it awful.
[27:12] B: So I just feel like I remember things. Like, we'll be talking about stuff or like someone asking a question about something that happened, and automatically my response will be something. And then I'll be thinking later. And it's like, is that actually, like, what happened? You know what I mean? But, like, I don't. Like, some of the things. I don't think I remember them.
[27:33] A: You think some of the memories you have might be somewhat distorted.
[27:36] B: Yes.
[27:37] A: So not fully accurate.
[27:38] B: Yes.
[27:39] A: Yeah.
[27:40] B: And I don't.
[27:41] A: Do you know that that's how memory works?
[27:43] B: Okay.
[27:45] A: Right. Why two people who watch the same crime can describe the thief completely differently.
[27:52] B: Yes.
[27:53] A: But, like, okay, like, so that's normal, first of all.
[27:56] B: But thinking like, oh, wasn't like, this situation. It was not fine. But thinking deeper into it, like, oh, wow, there's a lot there that I didn't realize or see.
[28:12] A: Yeah.
[28:13] B: When I was in the moment, I guess.
[28:15] A: Yeah.
[28:15] B: Versus now in hindsight.
[28:18] A: Yeah. There's a lot more that you know now that you didn't know as it was happening then. So you're more enlightened about it, which is great. We want you to be emotionally free from it. Right. Because. Yeah. And it doesn't matter so much, the getting all the details of what happened correct. Because we were changing the framing, and the framing is what has it coded as on. And we want to change it so that it's coded as data off. Make sense.
[28:59] B: Yes. And then just in looking back at those times and, like, now seeing, like, what happened to me, like, it was wrong and, like, I was abused and treated bad, but there was a time where I loved him. And, like, I can't think about that. Like, I can't believe almost that there was a time That I felt like that because, like, by the end, like, I wanted to get away.
[29:35] A: Oh.
[29:36] B: You know.
[29:36] A: Okay.
[29:37] B: Like, it wasn't like the whole. It was like an evolution in the relationship.
[29:40] A: Right. He wasn't as awful right up front as he was at the end.
[29:44] B: Yes.
[29:45] A: You probably wouldn't mistake that.
[29:47] B: Well, I didn't.
[29:49] A: If he was awful right up. As awful as he was.
[29:52] B: Yeah.
[29:52] A: Yeah. Like.
[29:57] B: Yes.
[29:58] A: Right. It progressively got worse. So bad that it changed him for you as somebody that you cared about and loved and wanted to be with. To somebody I couldn't get fast enough away from.
[30:11] B: Yes.
[30:13] A: Yeah. So as you say all of that, what about that has conflict for you?
[30:19] B: Well, just like, kind of being able to admit to myself and feel. I mean, I know I'm not gonna feel love for him because I don't have that anymore, but, like, there was a time that I did and I would do anything for him.
[30:32] A: Yeah.
[30:33] B: You know, like, tattooed his name on my body like he owned me. You know, like all those things. And then by the end, like, I just wanted to get away so bad for, like, years and I couldn't. And, you know, my children and all that stuff. So it's just, like a different frame. I don't really know how to explain it, but it's just looking back on the beginning part because, you know, like, just trying to process everything that happened.
[31:02] A: Yeah.
[31:02] B: And just. I don't really know how to explain it. Like, just being able to admit to myself or accept the fact that I loved him and cared for him. And then now, like, I don't want to ever.
[31:18] A: Yes.
[31:19] B: See him again.
[31:20] A: So I follow you with that. Right. So there was a time when you didn't know some of what you know now. So you didn't know that he was a trafficker. You didn't know that he was using persuasion, coercion, power and influence, manipulation, gaslighting. You didn't know he was using any of those tools. Tools on you. You thought it was genuine and authentic because it was genuine and authentic. Do you follow me with that?
[31:55] B: Yes.
[31:57] A: You didn't know that there was the other stuff and what it was going to lead to. Or.
[32:02] B: Or.
[32:03] A: Or. Right. So you just didn't know that. We want you to be more at peace during the time that you just didn't know. Right. Right. Because that's what we mean by not every act he did was an unloving act. There were times that he might have been nice or sweet or felt like he was caring or took care of me or it might have Been a lot of those kinds of things. Right. But if it's coming from the frame of, I'm your trafficker, I own you, and I control you, not quite the same thing. Make sense.
[32:44] B: Yes.
[32:45] A: But as the person in it, you're gonna feel those moments as that's a loving act. Makes sense. Because in the moment, it's a loving act, but it's from.
[32:56] B: Yes.
[32:57] A: Do you get it?
[32:57] B: It was a different reality. Like it was with different rules, different words. Good was bad and bad was good and bad. Something like that.
[33:07] A: Yeah. Yeah. You didn't have a lot of autonomy, the ability to do or choose. Make sense? Yes. Yeah. So we want you to be one. Getting cleared up. Whatever was going on in me, even prior to him, that led me to get connected to a guy like that. Right. So clearly there's some earlier wounding that leads my picker to pick that kind of guy for me.
[33:41] B: Yes.
[33:43] A: So we want to get that healed. Right. And then we want to see him for what it really was. Makes sense.
[33:52] B: Yes.
[33:53] A: And that's trafficking. That's what it was. That's where the manipulation, the coercion, the psychological warfare, all of that stuff that you didn't know. So that you're crystal clear now. Right. And what's crystal clear in you already is, I don't want to have anything to do with him.
[34:10] B: Yes.
[34:11] A: And I may have to have some interactions because we have children together.
[34:15] B: I guess that would be realistic, because in my mind, I just want to be like, he's cut off. Yeah.
[34:22] A: Right.
[34:23] B: I mean, if he goes to prison, then maybe I could just cut him.
[34:27] A: Off for a period of time.
[34:30] B: I don't know.
[34:31] A: Right, you don't know. Got it. So because we don't know, we can't, like, cut it off like gangrene or discarded it. We don't have a. We have to interact with it, maybe. And if we do, don't we want to be set up to interact with it in the way that's best for you, that supports you and what's best for you and your kids?
[34:55] B: Yes. And that's the thing. So in saying all that, another thing I've been having a problem with is just like you said, like, the frame is bad, but then, like, my kids are in the frame because, you know, they were. They're his children and my children, and. But they're good. You know what I mean? Like, they're. But they're. You know, to me, it's still. I don't know. And that's something, I guess I'm Struggling.
[35:22] A: That's what I mean, dealing with that time frame.
[35:23] B: They're good. And then also something I've been struggling with is. Okay, so he had a stroke, like, four years ago, and, like, I cared for him and, like. Yeah.
[35:36] A: You feel bad about having done that?
[35:39] B: No, I mean, I feel like that's what I. You know, I mean, I feel. I don't feel okay as, like, a human being and, like, caring for a person that had a stroke, like, I feel like that was the. The right thing to do.
[35:50] A: Yeah.
[35:51] B: But then, like, he had, like, his whole half of his body was, like, affected. And then, like, once he recovered, he could, you know, talk. And, you know, he still has, like, some trouble, but, like, he would, like. I don't know, I thought he would change or something, and he didn't. He got meaner. And, like, I just feel. I don't feel bad about taking care of him because I feel like that, you know, like, as a human being.
[36:20] A: That'S what there was for you.
[36:21] B: That's the right thing to do. But, like. And I still couldn't have left because even though physically, he was, like, out of it for that time. Like, I don't know what he's capable of, you know, but I feel like at that I have conflicting feelings about it, obviously. Like, I feel like that could. That was, like, my window opportunity, I guess. But then I was also, like, I couldn't leave still. So I'm just conflicted about that.
[36:47] A: Yeah. Again. So if we got it so that you're no longer conflicted. Right. That you're at peace with what you did, because at the time that you did what you did, that's what made sense for you to do. And we really want you to be at peace with that, because in life, it's not about making the right decisions. It's about making the decision decision. Right. Makes sense. So let's get you to be at peace with it.
[37:18] B: Okay.
[37:19] A: And okay with what you did, then. Yeah. Cool. Anything else? You've done great so far, Allison. I'm super excited.
[37:34] B: I think that was, for the most part, part. The things that I had on my mind for today.
[37:40] A: Yeah. Okay.
[37:42] B: And, well, there's one more thing.
[37:44] A: Oh, good.
[37:46] B: But I'm not 100% sure about this, and I never really talked about it before.
[37:49] A: Okay.
[37:50] B: So I have, like, this memory of, like, being in preschool, and I'm not.
[37:56] A: Really sure what happened, but something happened.
[37:58] B: Something I think happened.
[37:59] A: Yeah. And so there's still stuff with that.
[38:02] B: Yeah.
[38:02] A: Yeah. That fits into that category.
[38:04] B: Okay.
[38:05] A: Of stuff that's over. That although it's over, it's underneath the surface affecting you again, not every moment of every minute of every hour, every day, but, you know, it's. It's there.
[38:15] B: Yeah.
[38:15] A: We want it going so that you're at peace.
[38:18] B: Yeah.
[38:19] A: Present free. Clear. That you've got a lot more space and there's a lot more space with all that stuff.
[38:26] B: Yeah.
[38:27] A: So it's easier for you to move and maneuver with it. It. Right. And that you're being guided inside by a wisdom to do naturally the things that are in your and your kids best interest. And that's what guides interactions with him if you have to have them. Okay, got it.
[38:48] B: Yes.
[38:48] A: So that you're distant and wise and clear. Right. All those strings and cords of manipulation and coercion, they've all been cut.
[38:59] B: Yes.
[38:59] A: So they're gone.
[39:00] B: Yes.
[39:00] A: They have no impact on you at all.
[39:03] B: Yes.
[39:03] A: Right. Because you can't see him the same way you did before you knew.
[39:07] B: Yes.
[39:08] A: Right. Like, I've got this other gal that I've been working with and she's had a trafficker that groomed her since she was 14 and all the way along and the one thing that he didn't do is have her go out and have sex with other people. But, you know, to the point that she thought they were going to get married and she was in love with him. Like he flipped the whole thing. Like from 14. At 19, she's thinking and it's finally 32 and she's getting all the cords that he had wrapped around her that you couldn't escape before because you didn't know you were in jail. You didn't know you were in that kind of prison. You didn't know that you were bound. Same thing for her. She couldn't get away. Not because she didn't want to get away, because it was tied together. Makes sense.
[39:51] B: Yes.
[39:52] A: All of that stuff is we just want you to be at peace, ease and free. Yeah. Cool. So go ahead and put both feet on the floor. Slightly lower your jaw. Right. Relax your tongue. Begin to breathe a little bit slower and deeper. Right. And exhale longer. As you're breathing in this way, notice that you can see my nose and you can see my fingers. Stay looking at my nose as my fingers go out. And notice with the sides of your eyes that you can pick up the wiggling as you're doing that. At the same time, notice more space towards the side windows and doors. Sense the space between us and the space behind you. Notice what you're noticing as you're paying attention to me, you weren't noticing your right pinky toe, but you could now. But then you weren't noticing your left ear. And of course, you can now also notice your right index finger, which you weren't before. But see, every time your awareness switches, it goes, that's what I'm consciously aware of. Everything else is unconscious. This is what I'm consciously aware of. Everything else is unconscious. So there's more going on inside of you that's not conscious than conscious. That's right. You can bring your awareness down towards your hands and fingers and you can check, I wonder which one of my hands in a voluntary way is going to lift up. Maybe the hand that will lift up will be the right one that might be the one that's left, or the left one might be the one that's right for you. But either way, just begin to notice the small little vibrational movement happening within the fingers of that hand. Right as it's beginning to lift. That's right. In a different way as you're noticing the sensations happening. That's right. As the hands are lifting in a different way than how you would on purpose live. See, in a voluntary way, I can slightly lift my hand so that as I am lifting my left hand, you hardly even notice that it's lifting up. Right. What happens with you as you're noticing your right hand has already begun lifting up in a different way than how you would on purpose decide to lift that hand or fingers. It's cool to notice that you're aware of movement that's not conscious as it's lifting up. Right. And each time you notice the movement as the hands and fingers lift up, that's not on purpose movement. You think the word yes because when you think the word yes. That's right. As you're noticing movement that's not on purpose. It's you, Alison, responding. That's right. To your unconscious responding to you organizing towards the future. You, who's at peace and light and clear and free and present, has distance, sees it clearly for what it was. Now, knowing what it was, it's completely done. Can't ever go back. Not once I know what it really was. That's right. Because all of that is your beginning to value you even more. That's right. Taking care of you because your worth is to you. And your unconscious knows how much you're worth it to you. That's right. So all of this is happening inside of you. That's right. Noticing that change doesn't require effort on the outside, just space on the inside so that you're unconscious does it for you as you rest. Right. And then once again, just take another deep breath in, exhale and close your eyes. Right. And as your eyes are closed, they're resting closed. As they rest, you rest aware of your breath, the sounds. My voice. That's right. That's right. That hand can just. That's right. Drop back down. Right. So that you're much more centered and grounded and connected at a deep level to who you are, what you became aware of as you see the butterfly. That calm and peaceful light and easy flowing energy, the light at the center that is you that can't get touched and is already full, whole, peaceful, complete inside. And then whenever you're ready, staying in this nice, calm and peaceful resting place, begin to find your way back up and up and up and up. And then when you're ready, big breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. And how's your body feeling now?
[46:31] B: Relaxed.
[46:31] A: It is relaxed. And so as your body's relaxed, your unconscious is going to scan. And we know the ones that you've already brought up today. It may pick one of those, it may pick a different one, but it knows which ones would be useful to bring to your awareness. So what moment comes to mind now?
[46:47] B: My son.
[46:48] A: Your son. That. The. The. The. The fifth. Okay, cool. So when you think about that now, the feelings are feelings of. What is it? Hurt, sadness. Grief. Guilt. Shame. Regret. Remorse. Anger. Combination.
[47:05] B: Sadness.
[47:07] A: Sadness. Okay. So would it be okay for you to feel okay even though what happened wasn't okay? Right. And part of the sadness is coming from the thought that it shouldn't have happened. Does that make sense? Yeah. So get back here. Notice how you're there. Hi. Right. So do you have any understanding or knowing of what happens when people's bodies stop working? Anything that provides any kind of relief around death, lost time. Oh, where's that? Right. Really far away above the stars and sky. Not close. So I wonder if we could maybe get a different way of thinking about that for a moment. So first thing I'd like you to consider is if we were to do a science experiment with a young child, and we take a glass of ice and we put it out on the patio, and an hour goes by, and he looks and he goes, oh, my goodness, somebody stole the ice and replaced it with water, we would all giggle to ourselves and say, nobody stole the ice. It melted, went from solid to liquid. But the molecule of H2O is identically the same as it was when it was the solid piece of ice. Our view of it's changed. Kid understands, he gets it. We leave the glass of water out there. Week goes by, kid comes back, there's no water. He goes, somebody drank it. Somebody stole it, it's gone. We go, no, it's not gone. Evaporated. Because what does that mean? I go, it went from liquid to gas molecule H2O, totally the same. How we pick it up has changed. And the kid looks confused and he goes, but if I don't see it, how can I feel it? We say, because, like, you know, you're here in Florida, you can feel it. It's all around. We put in the desert of Arizona. We go to, you know. You don't feel any of it here, do you? And we bring them back to Florida and we show. See, feel it. We show them the rain clouds, we capture the water we put in the freezer. It's all the same thing. Got it? So when the body stop, what if the person doesn't stop? It's at their bodies stop. Einstein said, who we are is energy plus matter. It equals the physical existence, Right? And see, what's happening right now is you're there and I want you here, right? You're troubled by what happened. And you've been thinking you're troubled by what happened because it happened. But what if you're not troubled because it happened? What if there's a part of it that's remaining troubling because your brain doesn't know that that moment's not happening? Now got it? Yeah. So that moment happened. When it happened, you're where?
[49:59] B: Where was I?
[50:00] A: Yeah.
[50:01] B: At my house.
[50:02] A: So you're at your house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[50:05] B: Daytime.
[50:05] A: And you're be here. Hi. You're where in the house?
[50:09] B: In my room.
[50:10] A: So you're in your room. Right. And, like, are you sitting or standing?
[50:14] B: I was standing.
[50:15] A: You were standing in the room, like, by the closet or the bed or the bathroom.
[50:18] B: Putting away clothes.
[50:19] A: Yeah. So you're putting away clothes. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[50:22] B: I didn't know where he was.
[50:24] A: You didn't know where who was?
[50:25] B: My son.
[50:26] A: Right. So you didn't know where your son was. So you were like, at home. Right. You weren't sure where he was. You were putting clothes away. Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[50:33] B: I was looking for him.
[50:34] A: Right. So you went looking. You involved others to look. Right. And be a mirror. Do you know what a mirror is? Not a guy in the you. Not that Amir. I want you to be a mirror.
[50:55] B: Okay?
[50:58] A: So if you're going to be my mirror, what would you have to do right now if I was going to be your mirror? Oh, Jesus. Holy. If my mirror ever did that, that would freak. Oh, my goodness. What are you doing to me? Allison? That is a scary mirror. Good. Notice how you're here. I like it way better when you're here. Right. Good job. Now you're here. Hi. Hi. Much better. Right, Right. So you involved other people, looking at them. What happened next?
[51:35] B: You look out the window.
[51:37] A: Right. You look out the window. Right. Good. Then what happened? You saw him. Where? So you saw him in the pool and you ran out there. Right. And then did you dive in or somebody dive in? I did. You dived in and you went and grabbed him. Right. And then you brought him up to the top and put him on the side.
[51:50] B: He was on the top. He was floating.
[51:52] A: He was floating. Right. So you grabbed and pulled him off out of the water. Right. Then what happened next?
[51:57] B: I brought him inside.
[51:59] A: Right.
[52:00] B: We called 91 1.
[52:01] A: Right. Good job. You called 91 1. Right. Good.
[52:03] B: They don't know how to do sea.
[52:05] A: Right. Good job. Good detail.
[52:06] B: Right, Right.
[52:08] A: And then what happened next? Cuz he didn't feel the same, did he? No. Right. And then what happened next?
[52:14] B: The fire department came.
[52:17] A: Yes.
[52:17] B: And they tried to help.
[52:18] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. And they tried to do resuscitation. They couldn't.
[52:23] B: And I was in the ambulance and they were in the back. The police came.
[52:26] A: All right, good job. Good detail. Right. And what happened next?
[52:29] B: I got in the ambulance. I was sitting in the ambulance. They were in the back.
[52:32] A: Yes.
[52:33] B: Then we left to the hospital.
[52:34] A: Then you went to the hospital. Right. And then at the hospital they pronounced the baby dead. Right. And then you guys like said your last things and I picked him up.
[52:42] B: And he made a sound because of the.
[52:44] A: Right. Because he made a sound because of the water or whatever. Right. Good. And that was weird. Freaky. But he didn't feel the same still. Right. And then what happened next?
[52:52] B: The police were there.
[52:53] A: Right.
[52:54] B: And they drove me home.
[52:55] A: Then they drove you home. And then that moment was over. Well, yeah.
[52:59] B: Yes, that would.
[52:59] A: I mean, that moment was over. Right. And then later on you did something at least a little more enjoyable.
[53:06] B: Yes.
[53:06] A: Where I get out of jail or see a butterfly. Right. Or hang out with other kids. Right, right. Okay, good. So we went through it the first time. And you're intending to be here, so it's a little bit Less now we want to go backwards. Remember what backwards does? Yeah, it unplugs the memory, takes away the charge. So, yeah, getting out of jail, we got hanging out with other kids. We got, you know, seeing a butterfly. Right. And then before that, you were back home, and then the police drove you there, and then you got in the cop car to drive you there, and then you would hear the noise, and then you had picked him up, and then they had pronounced him dead. And then you guys had gotten to the hospital, then you rode in the ambulance, and you were sitting in the back of the ambulance, and then they put him in the ambulance, and then the firefighters are trying to resuscitate. And then they had gotten there, and then you guys had called 911, and then you had brought him in, right? He saw that he was blue, and then you had got him out of the pool, and then you dove into the pool, and then you saw him in the pool, and then you were looking with other people, and then you realized that you hadn't seen him. And then you started putting clothes away, and then you went to the bedroom, and before that, you might have been doing laundry. Right. As we go through it backwards again, compared to forward, emotionally, how was it? Was it same? Was it more? Was it less us?
[54:20] B: It was just like.
[54:22] A: It was just organized. It was organized, Right. So, second part, your pain that you're experiencing right now is totally coming out of your love for him. If you follow me with that. Right? So where people get stuck with this sometimes, and I wonder if this is what's going on with you for a moment, is if I'm no longer hurting, somehow it means that they don't matter what they mean to me. Right. Like, if my hurt is totally proof positive to the world of how much I love him. So if I'm no longer hurting, does that mean that he doesn't matter? Like, he matters to me? You follow me with that? Your love is coming out in pain. So let's just check. Is he better off knowing that every time you think about him, you're hurting?
[55:10] B: No way. I feel like it's my fault.
[55:13] A: I got that. That's the second part. Right. Got it. So the first thing is he's not wanting you to be hurt. What's his name?
[55:21] B: Jackson.
[55:22] A: Jackson. Jackson's been, by the way, doing better with this than you have for a while, Right. He's been doing better with this for a while because he has a deeper level understanding that you haven't gotten yet. That although none of us like what happened that couldn't have not happened. Then, like, he's crystal clear, he's at peace. He wants you to know that he's no longer hurting. Right. There's a part of your brain that's been stuck with having seen him in blue and all that doesn't know he's no longer hurting. Right. Your pain has been proof positive of how much he means, but it's not serving you or him. He's not better off with you hurting, and you're not better off hurting. Got it. The third thing that's been going on is that you are really down and mad at yourself for what happened, because you've been thinking, she should have known. That shouldn't have happened. So watch. If right now we could float back along the timeline prior to that ever happening and that you had known when she went in to do laundry that Jackson would wander and fall into the pool and die. If that you back then had known that that's what was gonna happen.
[56:50] B: But I knew something bad was gonna happen.
[56:52] A: You didn't know that was gonna happen. You weren't thinking, oh, okay, so when I go and do laundry, I'm gonna lose a kid? No. Right. Just check that out for a second. Right. You had no idea that you didn't know that that was gonna happen? Not with any. That wasn't even a thought that that would happen.
[57:08] B: No.
[57:09] A: Right.
[57:10] B: I just knew something bad was gonna happen.
[57:11] A: You didn't know it was that you might have had some inclination, because I'm in a difficult situation, that bad things are gonna go on. Got it. But if we were to float back along the timeline prior to that ever happening and that you had known that that's what was going to happen when you went into full clothes, would you have gone into full clothes?
[57:30] B: No.
[57:31] A: Got it. Right. You can't have regret and remorse or guilt and shame about something you didn't know was going to happen. And so the second thing we're going to get cleared up is that you've been beating up the earlier you, thinking, she should have known. She should have prevented it. But if that earlier you had known, she wouldn't have gone into the room to do the laundry. So she just didn't know. She didn't know. And I'm wondering what it would be like for you to lighten up on the earlier you, because she just didn't know. Right.
[58:08] B: He wasn't there. He was out of town. And then when he came back, he wasn't there for me. And I don't know why I expected him to be there for me.
[58:22] A: He wasn't there when it happened. And then he wasn't emotionally there for you.
[58:26] B: No.
[58:30] A: Yeah. And again, all that. So that's an extra thing. Yeah. Yeah. So notice what's happening. Now we got an additional piece of information. You can remember that happening with Jackson. You can remember wondering where he was, seeing him in the pool, diving in, grabbing him, trying to. You can remember all that happening. You can also remember putting on your sneakers. Right? So, Allison, stop putting on your sneakers. Say, I'm not putting on my sneakers, will stop me from putting on my sneakers.
[59:04] B: You're not putting on your sneakers.
[59:05] A: Well, then you stop putting on your pants. Well, stop me from putting on my pants.
[59:09] B: You're not putting on your pants.
[59:10] A: We'll stop him from falling in the pool. So he's not falling in the pool. Well, then stop that from happening. Say that's not happening.
[59:15] B: That's not happening.
[59:16] A: Right. Well, then you stop holding him and seeing him blue. Say, I'm not holding him and seeing him blue.
[59:19] B: I'm not holding him.
[59:20] A: Well, then stop putting on your watch.
[59:22] B: How about putting on.
[59:23] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Will you stop putting on your necklace? Well, then stop that from happening.
[59:28] B: I can't stop that from happening.
[59:30] A: Well, stop it from happening. It's not happening.
[59:32] B: It's not happening.
[59:33] A: Right. You don't have to stop it from happening. Why? Because it's not happening. Say that it's not happening. So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists.
[59:40] B: It no longer exists.
[59:42] A: Right. Now, the last little part is that earlier, you also. You can conceive of an alternative outcome to something that's already over. But the problem is, you haven't been feeling him with you since that happened. You haven't been feeling Jackson with you. So if the ice changes to water, that changes to gas, and it's all the same thing. And you and I talked about how who you really are is the light at the center, which religions like to call my soul. Right? And the light that is you is like the energy. Einstein said energy plus matter equals physical, touchable existence. And then what became the second law of thermal dynamics is energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. So what you didn't know then is that when the body stops working, it's not that they stop working, it's that their body stops working because they're no longer in need of it. They exit it. We don't pick them up the same way we did, but it doesn't mean they're not here. Right. Think of our five senses are limited in what we can know and perceive. Right. I can go out to the car and turn the radio on and music will start coming out. But the radio wave didn't magically appear there when I turned the radio on. It's here right now. Do you feel them? No. So what we know is that there are things that are outside of what our five senses can interact with that we know is here. Right. So we think of heaven as a place far, far away, above the stars and sky. We have things like the woman who told me that her parents are in her closet. Like your parents are in your closet. No, no, no. What remains of my parents, I go, that's not even what remains of your parents.
[62:02] B: That's what I have.
[62:03] A: That's the remains of their body.
[62:05] B: I had a box in my closet with him.
[62:08] A: Yeah. Well, not him. Well, no, no, because he wasn't there. See, you didn't know when you were holding him that he wasn't in his body anymore, that he had exited it. That's why it didn't feel the same.
[62:24] B: I could tell it was.
[62:25] A: Yeah, right. But you didn't know that he's still here. He's just not in his body.
[62:31] B: Not that.
[62:32] A: Right. And the shock of knowing him in his body, plus all the grief and guilt has been blocking access to connecting with him. See, Jackson wants you to know that he's been doing a lot better than you have with this for a long time. He's been at peace. He's okay. He's not angry at you, he's not blaming you, he's not hurting. He's not blue. He's crystal clear. Although none of us like that. It happened. It couldn't have not happened. So all of that is installed for him. He's really wanting you to be okay. Right? So what are all of the other ways you can be loving him that have nothing to do with your hurting?
[63:23] B: By remembering him.
[63:24] A: Huh? What's silly things that he does, how.
[63:30] B: Old he was about to be eight months.
[63:33] A: Huh? Right. Right. Got it. So think of him some of a giggle or a. Right. And see, you haven't been accessing him. Right. And that's because the last little part to this is remember our brain will make us feel bad to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. And that the solution is the brain recognizing either a, it no longer exists, or the second one, there's nothing to be done. Because here's where it's off intellectually, up here Alison, you can conceive of having paid more attention and knew where he was and knew that he didn't get out to the pool, right? You can conceive of that having never happened. Make sense? So it's the same thing. Think of this guy. A year ago, his brother had gone on a motorcycle ride. He didn't go. His brother dies. He's got a tremendous amount of gift, guilt. And he's thinking he's feeling guilty because he should have gone on the ride, but he's not. He's actually feeling guilty because up here, he can intellectually conceive of having gone on the ride. And if he had, his brother might still be alive. That would be a hell of a lot better. And so, because his intellect can think it, his emotional brain, which works like an animal, right? Animals can't think of doing things that they can't do. That's why porcupines aren't trying to build hang gliders to fly. Or dogs don't get depressed that they. They can't climb the trees, right? The animal brain lives that. If I can think it, that means I can do it. Got it. So what's happening to this guy intellectually? He's conceived of having gone on the motorcycle ride with his brother a year ago. Quick. That's what his brain is saying to him. Hurry. Go on the motorcycle ride a year ago. What are you waiting for? Can he do it? Got it. So when our brain gets either a. That the experience no longer exists or that there's nothing to be done, it stops causing the feeling. So I'm simply going to say to you, well, then, stop. How long ago did that happen now?
[65:56] B: Seven years.
[65:56] A: Seven. I'm going to simply say to you, well, then stop, Jackson, from doing that seven years ago, quick. And you say, there's nothing to be done. Say that there's nothing to be done. No. Hurry. What are you waiting for? Stop. From doing that seven years ago, Quick.
[66:07] B: There's nothing.
[66:08] A: No, come on, we'll go together. Come on, let's go. Say there's nothing to be done.
[66:13] B: There's nothing to be done.
[66:14] A: Why? Because that no longer exists. Right? And what we want you to do is we want you to become more connected to who he is. Because, check it out. Your love for him is as strong now, Allison, as it's always ever been. It hasn't diminished even a bit. And he fully feels it. His love for you is as strong as it's always ever been. The difference is you haven't been feeling it. And not because it's not here. But because the shock of having known him the way you did has been blocking access to, connecting to more of who Jackson is for you in an ongoing way. Right. Because Jackson is really interested in you, lightening up on you. Right? Right. So you can remember that happening. Realizing I haven't heard him, wondering where he is, getting everybody looking, seeing the body out in the. Right? Right. You can remember all that happening. You can remember putting on your socks. Stop putting on your striped socks. Say, I'm not putting on my striped socks.
[67:38] B: Putting on my striped socks.
[67:39] A: Well, then stop that from happening. See, that's not happening.
[67:42] B: That's not happening.
[67:43] A: So then where is it? See, it no longer exists.
[67:45] B: It no longer exists.
[67:46] A: That's right. And see, because you haven't been connecting him, I want you to, in your mind's eye, see you and him in an image together. So in your mind's eye, just imagine you and him together well before any of that happened. Right. Could be a time that you're holding him or he's on your lap, or any moment that you're able to see a picture of the two of you in your mind's eye. Right. As you see it in your mind's eye, what happens is a polishing of the connection to the essence of who he is, which was never his body in the first place. That's right. And that guy that you had been with couldn't help, not then, based on what was going on with him with that. Right. He was also troubled, so he just left. Right. And when he left, who were we? Learning about.
[69:22] B: Him.
[69:23] A: Yeah. Right. Is that the kind of man that you want to be with?
[69:27] B: No.
[69:28] A: Aren't we glad we're not with him now? Like, hello. Right. So again, close your eyes. Picture that earlier, you letting her know that's over, finished. The experience no longer exists. None of us like that it happened. Letting her know that Jackson's okay, he's no longer hurting, he's been doing way better and is interested in your becoming okay. Because you want your life to really work for you in honor of who he is. Because that's the best way to honor who he is for you, is to have a life that really works. That's right. Let that earlier you know that that guy that she had done with leaving had nothing to do with you, but everything to do with him. Him not being well, his own weaknesses, his own right. Had nothing to do with you. Right. As the earlier you is getting it. Allison, what do you notice happening now? You feel lighter, right? Right. Because we're also lightening up on that earlier you. She just didn't know. I. That he was gonna get out there, do that. She just didn't know. Right. So that you begin to lighten up on the earlier you who just didn't know. Right. There we go. Yeah. And again, what do you start noticing in you now?
[71:49] B: Your chest feels lighter.
[71:50] A: It does. Yeah. And notice how you're becoming more okay. Never okay that it happened. Got it. But more okay. Cuz you just didn't know. Right, Right. And as you're getting it again, what do you notice?
[72:28] B: It's just not as heavy. It's like not as intense.
[72:31] A: Yeah, right. It's not heavy. It's not as intense. It's lighting up. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. Right. So that life gets to work better for you, for Jackson. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah. What else do you notice as you think about it? Any other stuff as you're thinking about it now that's got tinges of.
[73:14] B: Well, after that I had my two other children, my younger ones. And I have like his kids that I was like raising basically because he was always gone. They were all there. And then after that happened, I couldn't stay at the house. So I took my two kids and like ever since then, I mean I. We were still okay since seven years ago. That's when I feel like like was the turning point for whenever I started.
[73:49] A: Like waking up, having the realization that I'm in a trafficking arrangement. Huh.
[73:57] B: And then I was like feeling like I had to protect my children. I had two at the time. And then after Jackson died, then I had two more. And then ever since then it was like the state of being like actively in my mind trying to like escape, like, you know, like obsessing about it like every day.
[74:24] A: Yeah.
[74:25] B: Like looking up on Zillow, like houses.
[74:29] A: In Alaska, like thinking about ways to get away.
[74:31] B: Yes. Like every, you know, like from that point on.
[74:35] A: Yeah. And I wonder what would happen if that part got to realize you got away. Away. See, that was a really good breath. Oh, that was so good. Right. Cuz it just got it, didn't it? You actually got away, didn't you? Me playing for a period of time. But you got away, right?
[74:53] B: I couldn't do it by myself.
[74:55] A: No. Right, right. You figured out a way to get assistance. How'd you do it?
[75:06] B: Well, I didn't. They.
[75:09] A: Oh, you didn't.
[75:09] B: I mean, the police came.
[75:11] A: They did, didn't they? Right. Because I got arrested. You Did. Didn't you? Mm. And you'd done that before, but you hadn't gotten arrested?
[75:23] B: No. Well, it was a good thing. I got arrested, he got arrested. I went to jail. And then the federal or the state prosecutor, I talked to her, and she linked me up with Misty.
[75:39] A: That's right. So who did it? You got arrested, and then you told somebody what had been going on. You hadn't done that up until that point. Do you get that?
[75:58] B: Yeah.
[75:59] A: And by telling somebody about what was going on, they got you connected to other people who've had similar ish experiences or worked with people who have had similar ish experiences and knew what to do. Isn't that a good news thing?
[76:22] B: And I'm getting help.
[76:23] A: You are, aren't you? You're doing it. Hmm. I wonder what it would be like, Allison, to start to feel really good about. You got yourself away because you told. Right. Which was the only way that you could get away is by taking the darkness into the light and exposing it. The girl that I was telling you, I am the first person she ever told any of that ST stuff, too, which is the key thing that has enabled her to also get away, to escape, to no longer be trapped or bound or. Right. You might want to start to feel pretty good about that, you know? Right. With all the decisions that you're making now. Right. Right. And how you're getting better. Mm. Right. Because you got it to stop. Right. And you're getting yourself well so that you can be available for your kids.
[77:40] B: And they won't have to go through.
[77:41] A: In a way that you haven't ever been able to be available for them. That's right. Got it. Good job. Super proud of you. Really? I am. That's freaking amazing.
[77:56] B: Thank you.
[77:58] A: Yeah. Yeah. So notice as you're thinking about it, we still don't like what happened, but notice what's happening in you. What do you notice?
[78:12] B: It feels better.
[78:13] A: Yeah. What's still lingering? What's the part that's still not quite okay to be okay?
[78:21] B: I just still feel like it's my fault. Everything has just always been my fault.
[78:28] A: Oh, well, that's great reasoning then. That's great reasoning. I just think it's my fault because, you know, everything's been my fault. Okay, great. Awesome. Cool. Well, they definitely put it on this one too. Right. Because I'm sure it was a really quiet household with, like, nothing going on, you know, easy to manage in particular, you know, much easier when he's not there. Still a lot going on. A lot of moving Parts.
[79:07] B: Yeah.
[79:08] A: Right, right, right. So you still think it was your fault? How so?
[79:17] B: I mean, from the very beginning, I mean, I went with him. Like, I. I don't know. I mean, it makes no sense to say it out loud.
[79:33] A: That's so awesome. I'm glad it's not making any sense out loud. Just keep it in your head then. That's where it makes sense.
[79:44] B: No, no, I mean. Okay, so like when I met him here, I mean, I mean, it was all lies?
[79:58] A: Yes. When you met him.
[79:59] B: Yes. It was all lies.
[80:01] A: You didn't know that though?
[80:02] B: Yeah, I didn't know that. But then like, I, I mean, I can't even say because. Okay, like when I went with him and then I started working, how old were you? I met him when I was 18 and I was like before my birthday and then I turned 18 and then. Yeah. And.
[80:24] A: And you didn't have any, you know, early family.
[80:26] B: No, I mean, you literally picked me up from my parents house. Like I never been on my own before.
[80:33] A: Right.
[80:37] B: And that's something else that I notice.
[80:39] A: Yeah.
[80:39] B: I feel like sometimes like I'm still like that age or something, you know.
[80:49] A: Sometimes we regress. Sometimes you feel coping mechanisms bring you back to when you were 19.
[80:57] B: Okay.
[80:58] A: Right.
[80:58] B: Yeah. I didn't know what you're saying. I didn't know that was like. Because I feel like that like a, like a child, you know, like. But I didn't know if that was because like Randolph asking permission and things for the past 18 years, you know, like being taken care of and like managed and you know, like a child basically. But then also, you know, being a mom. So it's like split. I don't know. It's.
[81:23] A: I don't know. Yeah.
[81:25] B: Does that make sense?
[81:27] A: Yeah. Well, that's why it was challenging.
[81:29] B: Yeah.
[81:30] A: For you to make decision because you weren't one that was given lots of options of decisions. You were being more told. Right.
[81:39] B: Yeah.
[81:40] A: But you made this decision to tell that person who then got you. You made the decision to go to assessment and then residential.
[81:53] B: Yes.
[81:54] A: You've made all those decisions.
[81:55] B: Yes.
[81:56] A: And to go for what you're going for versus a full out trial.
[82:02] B: Yes.
[82:03] A: Right.
[82:04] B: I guess it's just the terminology of like choosing up. Like you've heard that before. Choosing up.
[82:13] A: Choosing up. I, I heard choosy moms choose Jif.
[82:19] B: And so I just like, I feel like that was like I was told that I chose, but then like, if I think about it, I really didn't choose because I was lied to or you didn't choose. No. But then I was told that I chose.
[82:34] A: By whom?
[82:35] B: By him.
[82:36] A: Oh, well, of course.
[82:38] B: I mean, but definitely believe him. Like it was my choice. And then.
[82:44] A: Yes, that's what it is when you're trafficked. See, when you're trafficked, they use psychological manipulation, gaslighting, coercion to make you think that you're in cahoots with them and that you're the one choosing to do these things.
[83:07] B: And like I understand that as like a concept.
[83:11] A: Right.
[83:12] B: To make myself believe it and stop like punishing myself for it is what I'm struggling.
[83:18] A: So. Good. So part of that has to do with. So let's think of it in this way. When you got together with him, him, you didn't know what he was saying were lies. You didn't know any of that?
[83:32] B: No.
[83:33] A: Right. You now do know, but you didn't know that then. And so you were already hooked before you could choose. So like the other girl, the relationship with the guy started before she was the age of consent. So of course when she's 19, she's thinking, I'm choosing him. Because every 19 year old girl wants a guy who's 35 years older than them.
[84:09] B: No, no, I know, but I'm thinking in my mind like, yeah, he was older than me. He was 13 years old.
[84:17] A: Right?
[84:18] B: Yes.
[84:19] A: Which is a bigger difference because it's at the earlier end of things. Right. Not as big of a difference when I'm, you know, 33 and he's. Yeah, 51.
[84:33] B: Yeah.
[84:33] A: Different big difference when like I'm 18, he's. Yes, got it. So you were already hooked and already taken, so to speak, before you ever knew. That's why it was really hard to ever get away.
[84:58] B: And the other thing is that I have a problem with. So like I said, there was like an evolution of the relationship. So in the beginning, met him, I only worked for like five years. And in that time period was like when the majority of like the physical and sexual abuse was happening along with obviously mental and emotional abuse. And then like the problem I have is that after that I didn't work and he wasn't as abusive, maybe physically because I had the children and that it's like, well, it wasn't as bad. But like at that point I feel like I was already, like he had already achieved his goal of like programming me how he wanted me.
[85:54] A: Yeah.
[85:56] B: And so, but I still, and I get that, okay, logically speaking, that I still am like punishing myself. I don't know, like it wasn't as.
[86:09] A: Bad punishing yourself for, like, I guess, still staying. Like, still staying. Got it. But perfect.
[86:17] B: Again, logically speaking, I know that I couldn't leave. I mean, I could. Other people did.
[86:21] A: Well, actually, no, I'm gonna give you the secret. So the. One of the major things that this other gal really, really, really gets upset about is that how come I didn't leave earlier. She's got this whole thing, I'm 32, I want to have a baby, but now I'm gonna be over the hill, I gotta get through this. And how am I ever gonna find a guy after all this? And you know, it can go a mile a minute. Right. But one of the things, she gets mad at her earlier self for having not left because she could have left when she was 19 or she needed to leave when she was 25. Right. When she didn't leave when. Do you follow me with that? That's kind of what you're doing. But if we look at the situation, it was. Whatever it was to begin with, and then it moved into that five year period of time, and then it was less. So I wasn't having to go, you know, have my body get used by men that I don't know. Yes, he was still abusive. Yes, I had to do whatever he wanted me to do sexually or, or, or. But that, that was a lot better than me being farmed out to different people. I was yucky. I mean, not with every person. Maybe some people I've connected better with, but lots of them was gross. No, you followed me with that.
[87:32] B: Yeah.
[87:33] A: Like, there's people that are really, really gross at it, and then there are people that are, okay, I can manage. But like, yeah, the whole thing is off.
[87:39] B: And. But I mean, in the. I don't know, like, I don't know how I. I don't know. I mean, in those five years, like, I worked every single day basically, like, right. At least 12 hours a day. Like, I had to. And then two. It's not like he was standing over me every day, like, you know.
[88:00] A: No, but you were in cahoots with him then. And I, like, do you know what that word means?
[88:05] B: In cahoots? Like, I was like, you guys were.
[88:09] A: Partners, like Bonnie and Clyde. You're a team. Your role, his role.
[88:14] B: That makes me feel, like, gross. Okay, but I mean, I know, but.
[88:19] A: It'S like, let's just be real. I know.
[88:21] B: You're right, you're right. I have to say that you're right. But I can't admit that to myself.
[88:26] A: That's why I'm having. That's what.
[88:27] B: I'm having a problem. Why wouldn't that time period. In that time period, being able to admit to myself that at that time, yes, we were like that, and I loved him, like, was, like, addicted to him or obsessed with him or whatever that was. And then, yes, I went to work every day and I sold my body and I went by myself. Like, I was on autopilot. It's not like he was holding a gun to my head and making me, you know, go to a date, come home. You know, like, back and forth. Like, I was going to the club. I was going into the club, and I was working, and then making the money and then, you know, doing the.
[89:07] A: Things to make more money.
[89:10] B: Yes.
[89:11] A: Right.
[89:11] B: But that's what I'm having a problem with, is, like, being able to be okay with.
[89:20] A: That's what you did.
[89:21] B: I mean, not be okay with it, but, like, I don't know. Like, I guess I've been trying to convince myself that that didn't happen. I don't know.
[89:31] A: Like, would it be better to just be okay with that? That's what happened then.
[89:35] B: I mean, I don't know if I want to be okay with it. Like, that I'm okay that it happened.
[89:39] A: You're not okay that it happened, but.
[89:41] B: The, like, the feeling like I'm feeling now, and, like.
[89:45] A: Yeah. So this is the question, right? The question is, would it be okay for you to be okay now, even though what you were doing back then wasn't okay?
[89:59] B: Yes.
[90:00] A: You couldn't push the butt. So.
[90:02] B: Perfect.
[90:05] A: Right? This is great, Allison. You're doing awesome. Great. Right.
[90:11] B: Punish myself for that because it was so bad.
[90:14] A: Yeah. So. So right.
[90:17] B: It was bad. I thought it was okay.
[90:20] A: You've been beating yourself up now over what you did during that time, so would it be okay for you to lighten up on the earlier you?
[90:33] B: I mean, yes, but I feel like.
[90:37] A: If you were to lighten up on the earlier you. What about that wouldn't be okay?
[90:44] B: Cause I feel like she was bad.
[90:47] A: The earlier you was bad, and, like.
[90:50] B: She deserves to be punished.
[90:52] A: Oh, and so we should cause some atonement. Have you ever seen the Da Vinci Code movie with Tom Cruise? There was a white albino guy who used to hit himself with a mallet.
[91:07] B: Yes, I saw that part.
[91:08] A: He was atoning for his sins. This is what we're wanting you to do. She was bad. Let me atone.
[91:15] B: Well, I felt like that's way enough of Jackson.
[91:18] A: I don't get to feel oh, right. I don't get to feel okay because I was bad. And because I was bad, that's what led to what happened with Jackson. Ah, okay. So God is somehow punishing you or universe or some extra thing, or you are just punishing you. Yeah. Okay, so let's just check, right? What would happen if you were to lighten up on the earlier you. As that was happening, when it was going on, were you thinking you were being bad?
[92:07] B: I mean, it depends on what park. I would. I would go to work and I thought that I was doing something good because that's what he wanted me to do. And I would do everything he wanted and fulfill whatever, you know, request he made. And then I still would be punished by him. Like, no matter what I did, I never knew if I was going to be punished or not.
[92:36] A: Right.
[92:37] B: And he would.
[92:42] A: So. Hasn't she been punished enough? Not yet. You need to punish her a little more. He didn't give you enough. We got to do more from you.
[92:54] B: I don't know.
[92:55] A: You don't know, do you? Just check it out. Has. Has she gotten enough punishment? She's doing everything that she's thinking she's needing to do. And no matter what she does, sometimes he's an ass.
[93:09] B: It's more than that.
[93:10] A: Of course it is. But see, we haven't gone through any of the moments, which is what we want to go through so that we can get them unplugged. You follow me with that? But the first thing that we want to get to before we unplug. Would it be okay for you to feel okay, even though what was going on then and what you did wasn't okay?
[93:31] B: I don't know. Because it affected other people too.
[93:35] A: If you're okay, does it make what happened okay?
[93:40] B: No.
[93:41] A: No. It doesn't mean what happened was okay. Do we do our best parenting when we feel guilty?
[93:52] B: No, but it's. Then maybe I don't deserve any of this.
[93:57] A: Good. That is 100% true. Did you know that? 100%. Did you know that people in life do not get what they deserve? I mean, we have this whole thing that you get what you deserve, but you don't actually get what you deserve. There's kids that are born with a hundred million dollar trust fund. What did they do to do that? There are kids who were born with, you know, cleft palates. What did they do to deserve that? Right. So does life and health, Right? Does life and health have anything to do with whether we deserve it or not?
[94:29] B: No.
[94:30] A: No. Right. We could say, all kids deserve. All kids deserve to be loved. All kids deserve to be one. Healthy. Even the ones that are getting abused, even the ones that are born with congenital heart issues, they deserve to be healthy. They deserve to be loved. Well, if it doesn't have anything to do with health or love, whether you deserve it or not, whether you get it, then it has nothing to do with anything. You get what you get, regardless of whether you deserved it or not. You didn't do anything to deserve that to happen at Jackson either. To Jackson, it wasn't like this deserving thing. Oh, because you were being bad. Here's the bad thing that happens to you, right? That you was stuck in a really difficult situation with an older man that used manipulative tactics to cause her to be in cahoots and do these things that she wouldn't normally want to do, but did anyway to try to please and found herself, even when she was doing all this stuff, sometimes not pleasing to him. So he would be abusive, physical, verbal, what have you. Right. That you, back then was just trying to survive. She didn't even know back then that she was in a trafficking relationship. She didn't even know back then that he's a trafficker. That's how much of psychological coercion, manipulation and influence was happening on her. Do you follow me with that?
[96:18] B: Yes.
[96:21] A: Right. So you were caught in a web that led you to do the things that you did, that made you feel like I decided to do the things you couldn't not do those things based in the web, it's kind of like the kid gets brought two outfits and you go, which one do you want to wear? And the kid picks and feels like I chose. No, he didn't. I gave him two outfits I was okay with him wearing. Who chose? I did. Got it. Right. So you becoming okay and more at peace with what you did doesn't excuse or make any of what you did okay. But you're better off because people don't perform better with guilt. I don't. The football playoffs. Right. I don't want the guy who's kicking the game winner to be feeling really guilty about having missed the chippy shot at halftime. I don't think that's a good strategy for him to make the next one. Right. The basketball player misses a shot. I don't want him to be feeling guilty. Oh, you better not pass to me ever again. I'm a horrible shooter. Shit, man. That's not going to be a good way to play. Yeah. So what's happening Now.
[97:43] B: I'm just thinking.
[97:44] A: That as you're thinking, would it be okay for you to be okay?
[97:49] B: I mean, it would if I was gonna have like a future.
[97:52] A: Oh.
[97:53] B: If I was gonna have my kids.
[97:56] A: So it's only.
[97:57] B: I know that I just deserve to be.
[98:00] A: It's only okay for you to be okay right now if you can have your kids later. Let me say that again.
[98:08] B: I know, I know. Because it's okay.
[98:14] A: So you're so mean.
[98:18] B: Me just having a life by myself, like, I just feel like I'm not like, worthy enough or valuable enough, like, to say to.
[98:30] A: Myself, oh, wouldn't that be the first place to start? I wonder what it would be like to be more valuable to you because you're definitely worth it to them.
[98:39] B: They're the only good thing though.
[98:41] A: So isn't it weird in my life, isn't it weird that they're worth it to you and you're worth it to them, but you're not thinking you're worth it to you, but. But they, you are totally worth it to them. Weird. I'm wondering how much better off they'd be if you were worth it to you too. Right? Isn't that why you're here?
[99:12] B: Yes.
[99:13] A: Isn't that why you're getting help? Isn't that why you're doing the work?
[99:16] B: Yes.
[99:17] A: Even though it's uncomfortable. Uh huh. So maybe it does have to do with a little bit of you being worth it to you. Right. So that we're giving ourselves the best chance to have what we want. It's the same thing the woman would say to me, well, if I can't have a child, then maybe I shouldn't do any of it at all. Right? Right. Because we're forgetting the first part. Hey, the really cool part is you escaped a fucking trafficking situation that you didn't know you were in for a really long time. Let's first get the win. Fucking celebrate just a little bit about the win before we get freaked out whether I'll have a baby or not. Like, same thing. Let's like, at least, you know, celebrate a little bit of the win before we freak out whether I'm going to have my kids or not. Like, I got myself out of it. I spoke about it. I got myself away. I'm in a program that's helping. I'm learning a lot more. I'm getting trauma healed. Okay. Like, maybe we should take some of the wins, throw it all away if I can't have that one thing. Okay. Yeah, we're not there. Yet to that one thing, we need to do these steps before we can even get to that step.
[100:45] B: But if I.
[100:46] A: This is the problem I have. This is the same problem she has. Not uncommon. It's really similar for trafficking survivors to have this thing going on. Particular ones that have been in it for a long time. Like hers was 18 years. How long was yours? Yeah, right.
[101:03] B: But if I have hope and then.
[101:05] A: Oh, I don't like hope. Hope is sucky. I'm not going for hope. I don't want you to have hope either.
[101:10] B: If I let myself have hope now.
[101:12] A: I don't want you to have hope.
[101:14] B: Something bad happens, like in this choice that I made this week. Okay. So I finally let myself have hope. Right. In this program, I've been opening up. I've been actually connecting with other human beings.
[101:27] A: Are you really, like, looking for hope?
[101:30] B: Yes. Because what is the point of doing any of this if there is no hope?
[101:35] A: Because what is the point of doing any of this?
[101:39] B: Otherwise I should just be punishing myself.
[101:42] A: What is the meaning of life? What is the point of all of this? Why are we here? We can ask in an esoteric way. Why are you here? Who are you really? Why are you here?
[101:59] B: I know, it's silly.
[102:00] A: I know, right? No, but you're in the same thing. If I can't have this thing that I really want to have, if I'm not gonna have, then there's no reason for me to do anything. I should just be down on me.
[102:10] B: Yes.
[102:11] A: And beat myself up more.
[102:12] B: Yes. Because, wait, that would prove. That would prove that I don't deserve it.
[102:17] A: You don't deserve it.
[102:19] B: We already.
[102:19] A: Listen, get rid of whether you deserve it or not. You don't.
[102:24] B: I'm trying to explain why. So wait, wait, wait.
[102:32] A: Backtrack. Take it back.
[102:34] B: I finally was like, all right, I'm gonna have hope. Okay. I'm gonna, like, what do I have to lose at this point? I'm gonna, like, actually connect with other human beings and I'm going to say my feelings and I'm going to have.
[102:45] A: A better life for me.
[102:46] B: Yes, but.
[102:47] A: And the people that matter to me.
[102:49] B: Yes. But then I had to make this decision and.
[102:54] A: Which you went with that shrunk the possible worst case scenario. Yes. Right. I mean, when you look at why you made the decision you made, is that. That decision, even though I'll probably have something, it shrinks the possibility of worst case scenario, where this one, if it doesn't go right. Worst case scenario is. I don't. I'll be for too long.
[103:15] B: Yes.
[103:15] A: This one. Worst case scenario, not. That's why you did it.
[103:18] B: Yeah.
[103:18] A: That makes sense, doesn't it?
[103:19] B: Yes.
[103:20] A: Don't you want to feel good about that?
[103:21] B: Yes.
[103:23] A: Because isn't that in alignment with what you want?
[103:25] B: Yes, it is. But I want to be able to finish this program.
[103:29] A: Right. So do they want you to be finishing this program?
[103:32] B: I want to go to prison.
[103:33] A: Right. They want you to be finishing this program too, because it's good for you. Right. And they want to be seeing how much you're changing. Right. Because that then determines what they do. Right. Because if they're not seeing that you've changed at all and you're not different than you were.
[103:59] B: Well, this is for something different. That it's not that situation. It's a whole thing. So that would be a different. Like why I. What I told the prosecutor and everything.
[104:13] A: Yeah.
[104:14] B: That is a different case.
[104:15] A: Huh?
[104:16] B: He did something else and it's a different case. It's not related to trafficking or anything like that.
[104:23] A: Right.
[104:24] B: But I've been. I. I became involved in it because.
[104:26] A: Of course, you were with him and so cahoots.
[104:33] B: Yes.
[104:34] A: Right.
[104:35] B: And so that's. It's different. So it's unrelated. And that's why I didn't go to trial, because I didn't know. Even though, like my lawyer, everyone is like, you were a victim, you know, like the intent or whatever. You. You didn't have that because you didn't know anything that was happening or you were being coerced or whatever. But.
[105:05] A: I don't know.
[105:06] B: Anyway, that would be like a jury situation. I took the plea even though technically I wasn't, you know, didn't have the intent or whatever.
[105:19] A: You made the decision that you made because it shrunk the risk.
[105:31] B: Yes.
[105:31] A: That's why you took the plea, because you want to have the opportunity to be with your kids sooner. It may just become probation and no jail time at all. We don't know. Yes, right. We don't know how it's going to unfold yet, but we do know based on how much your kids matter to you. When left with the decision wide open, where it could be a bunch of years or minimum, maximum a year. I'm gonna pick that one. Right. I get that. They're also different charges. Yeah, got it. And we're all right demonstrating that you weren't because you chose to be in cahoots. You were in cahoots because of the psychological manipulation that had you believe things make sense. And of course, you wouldn't have Left after a lot of the sex stuff that you had to do stopped happening. Because dealing with him, maybe yelly screaming at me, or maybe physical, or me having to do stuff with him is way easier than me working every day. Follow me with that. Right. Even though you were becoming more and more clear what was going on with you, with him. Make sense? Yeah. So going back to the last part, you being okay. I got it. That I'm doing it because I have hope that I can be more present in my kid's life. But you're also doing it not just for the hope to be more present in your kid's life. You actually want to be. Well, you want to be functioning in a way that's really good for your kids. That's why you're doing all the work. And that's why as we check in, you're becoming more okay now. Doesn't mean any of the other stuff is okay, but you get to be okay. Even though that wasn't because that's better for you and them, it gives you the best shot. Which is the same reason why you made the decision about the plea.
[108:11] B: Yes.
[108:12] A: Because it shrinks. Worst case scenario. Got it?
[108:18] B: Yes.
[108:18] A: Yeah. And is all of that settling in? Slightly. Lower your jaw. Right. Relax your tongue and breathe a little slower and deeper in and a little bit longer on the exhale. Right. Notice that you're aware of more space and how your body's becoming more settled and calm. As your body's becoming more settled and calm, the unconscious part again will go back down that timeline of moments, those yucky things that we don't like to think about, and kind of bring the one that it thinks would be best to clear now. Okay, good. That one happened when? About how long ago?
[109:06] B: Probably like 2008.
[109:09] A: Yeah.
[109:09] B: 2009.
[109:10] A: Right. And you're where and what happened?
[109:14] B: I was in 3. Texas Y. In my apartment.
[109:18] A: Yeah.
[109:19] B: And it was after work.
[109:21] A: Right. Good job. So you've already been at the club, working. Come back to the apartment. Right. Good. Then what happened?
[109:29] B: I made all the money.
[109:31] A: Supposed to that day.
[109:33] B: Yes.
[109:33] A: Cuz he had an idea that you were going to make this much every day.
[109:36] B: Yes.
[109:36] A: It's a weekend is a Monday. Mondays are slow, Tuesdays are.
[109:39] B: No, it didn't matter.
[109:40] A: Every day was the same amount. Yeah.
[109:48] B: And then like even if you make more, it's like it doesn't count.
[109:51] A: Doesn't roll over. Doesn't roll over. I don't get extra bonus.
[109:53] B: No, you still got to go.
[109:56] A: Crap. It's the days off. It's Bonus. No junk. Nope. Come on, I made my quote. I get to stop early, right? Nope. No. Damn it. No.
[110:06] B: All the way till.
[110:08] A: Right. So you made all that you made?
[110:10] B: Yeah. And so.
[110:12] A: So he came over.
[110:13] B: Well, he was there.
[110:14] A: Oh, he's at the apartment, right? Yes.
[110:17] B: And. All right.
[110:20] A: He wanted the money.
[110:21] B: Yeah, well, that was. That's already done.
[110:24] A: Came in, gave him the money.
[110:25] B: Yeah, that's done.
[110:25] A: Counted it.
[110:27] B: No. Well, yes, I had to count it and like place it all. Like all the bills have to be facing the same way.
[110:34] A: Right.
[110:34] B: In order.
[110:35] A: Good idea. That he's a CD.
[110:39] B: Okay.
[110:40] A: No. Do not have the 10 reversed. No, look this way. It's a thing.
[110:44] B: It's a thing for real.
[110:46] A: I get it. I like all my bills to face the same way too.
[110:50] B: Okay. So even though I did all the things. Right.
[110:55] A: Yeah. So you're there. You give him money. Count it out. It's all there. He should be happy.
[111:01] B: He's. Yeah.
[111:02] A: So he's not.
[111:05] B: He had like this giant dildo.
[111:10] A: Oh, a giant one.
[111:12] B: Not humanly, like possible.
[111:15] A: Right.
[111:16] B: And comically. Yes. And so he would.
[111:22] A: So then he was mad, so he took that out. He's like, you're getting dildo treatment today.
[111:27] B: Yes.
[111:28] A: Cuz you haven't had enough. Stuffed in places.
[111:31] B: What he said.
[111:31] A: That's right. Something like that. Good job.
[111:33] B: Yes.
[111:34] A: Right.
[111:34] B: It's a pun. Punish.
[111:35] A: Right.
[111:36] B: Punishing me.
[111:37] A: That's right.
[111:38] B: And so he.
[111:40] A: He takes that, he puts it in different spots.
[111:43] B: Yes. And I can't make any noise.
[111:45] A: Right.
[111:46] B: If I make a noise, it's like harder and longer.
[111:50] A: Right.
[111:51] B: Goes on for a long time.
[111:52] A: Right. So he does that for a period of time in your body, in different spots. Right. And then what happened next?
[111:55] B: And then after a long time, I'm on the floor.
[111:59] A: Right.
[112:00] B: And then he has sex with me.
[112:02] A: Right. And then he has sex with your body. Right. Then what happened next?
[112:05] B: Then he finishes.
[112:06] A: Right.
[112:07] B: And then he stands up.
[112:09] A: Yes. Right.
[112:09] B: And he stands over me.
[112:10] A: Right.
[112:11] B: And he pees on me.
[112:13] A: Good job. Right. And then what happened next? That was gross. Right. Then what happened?
[112:17] B: Then you left.
[112:17] A: Well, then he left. Then you got up, took a shower. Right. Which was way better than when he was doing that. Yeah. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[112:26] B: Yeah.
[112:27] A: Like, you know, get out of jail.
[112:28] B: Yeah.
[112:29] A: Or go to the assessment house. Right. Or make connections with folks. Right. Or have something yummy to eat.
[112:36] B: Yeah.
[112:37] A: Right. So we got having something yummy. You got making connections. Right. Going to the assessment officer. Getting at a jail. Right. Then you you know, got cleaned and then you went in the shower and then he left and then he had peed and then he had gotten up and then he had finished and then he had had sex with your body and then he had stopped with the long dildo and then he had done the long dildo and then you had. He had. You had counted out the money and then you'd gotten back home and then you had been working.
[113:02] B: Yes.
[113:03] A: Right?
[113:03] B: Yeah.
[113:04] A: And as we go backwards, right, compared to forward, what do you notice?
[113:10] B: It's just like a sequence of events.
[113:12] A: It is like you can remember him doing all that.
[113:14] B: Yeah.
[113:15] A: You can remember putting on your striped socks.
[113:17] B: Yeah.
[113:17] A: He'll stop putting on your striped socks.
[113:19] B: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[113:20] A: He'll stop him from doing that. I can't stop him from having the right. He's not doing that. Right. So where is no longer exists. Right.
[113:31] B: So what happens if it happened like more than once?
[113:33] A: It did happen more than once.
[113:35] B: Once.
[113:35] A: I know, just check. What do you notice happening knowing that it happened more than once? As we're clearing one, what do you think your brain starts to do?
[113:47] B: Pull them all together?
[113:48] A: It does. Cuz it's realizing. Wait a minute. That's data about something that happened.
[113:53] B: Okay.
[113:55] A: Cuz you can remember another time that he did it. He might have put it in different body parts that might have hurt more. But I can't say anything. Right. Well, this is fun. Let me go to work and then let me get. Damn, this is great.
[114:13] B: Yeah.
[114:14] A: I mean, convincing me that I totally love this guy. Do you know what the response is in trafficking that they call it. That they've now coined what it's called Fawn.
[114:22] B: Yeah, Aaron said you heard that before.
[114:24] A: So we have fight flight, freeze.
[114:26] B: She said that I fawn.
[114:28] A: Right. There's Fawn and fold. Fold is at the end when I'm done and dead. But fawn is. I've got to be in love with the person who's doing all this to survive it. Because I try to make it as less and less. Less. Right. I try to sneak a little money on the side over there so that if I don't catch enough that I have some to put in the reserve and say, see, I did it this time. Come on, it's a Thursday. Nobody's out on Thursdays. Come on. You know it's two for Tuesday, so they don't. You don't get paid as much.
[115:07] B: So ask something though. Wait, hold on.
[115:10] A: You're doing great. No, just check what's. What's happening in you.
[115:13] B: Just check I'm okay. Wait, let me just ask you something. So question.
[115:19] A: Yeah.
[115:19] B: So, like, the obsession that I had with him, like, a part not or a part of the fawning and survival, then all like, did I also do this stuff to try to convince myself that I loved him more? Like, you know what I mean? Like, no, I love him. I'm doing this all of to make myself feel better.
[115:46] A: But all of that. It's all part of the psychological manipulation is getting you to be doing all of that stuff. Thinking it's on purpose because I want to.
[116:02] B: Okay.
[116:04] A: Wasn't on purpose because I wanted to. I couldn't not. I was stuck in a thing that had me right. That's the problem. I didn't know I was trapped in a cycle that was forcing me to do these kinds of things. I had it that this is, like, my role and this is what we do. This is our team. This is our partnership. This is our cahoots. I'm making all the money, but he's getting all the glory. The hell? Another like, I remember a traffic. Or one time a guy like analytics raped her, and his trafficker beat the shit out of him afterwards, and he's like, I did that because I love you. She's like, oh, he loves me. You didn't do that because he loved her. That's not why he did that. If the guy slashed his tires, you'd do the same thing. You fuck with my property, I'm going to hurt you. That's why he did it because he loved her. Make sense? You didn't know that you were in a property game because when you voluntarily decided to get his tattoo on you, it wasn't because you're like, you know what? To prove how much I love this guy, I'm gonna tattoo his name on me. That sounds like a sound and rational decision.
[117:15] B: I did it. Like, I have a bunch of tattoos on his name.
[117:18] A: Of course you do. Right, Right. Because.
[117:23] B: Why did I do that?
[117:24] A: Because.
[117:24] B: Stupid.
[117:25] A: No, I'm just like, the why you did it is because you didn't know you were in a trafficking relationship. That's why you didn't know that you were in that. So it was a show of my love for you. Do you follow me with that? And at different times, it was in different ways of showing my love and my allegiance to you. Right. We pledge allegiance to the flag. Right? That's my allegiance. Do you follow me with that? Like, that's what I mean by in cahoots. Like, you promised Your allegiance to him because you didn't know that you were in a trafficking situation. Make sense? This is what we're doing to make ends meet. This is what we're doing to survive. We're in this thing together, and I'm getting shitty roll, but we're in this thing together. Why do I elevate that? It's crap. Had a crappy day, and now you're doing this. Jesus.
[118:45] B: And then I had to go to work the next day.
[118:47] A: Then I got to work the next.
[118:48] B: Day, like, all totally sore.
[118:50] A: Yeah. That's not fun.
[118:51] B: No, it wasn't. It hurt.
[118:52] A: Right. Only blow jobs today. I'm not doing nothing else. Jesus. You don't know what he did to me last night. Not worth it. So just chat. What are you noticing now? Even as you're thinking about it? Right. Is it. Right.
[119:24] B: It's not as bad.
[119:26] A: Yeah. Is it hurting right now? You. As you're thinking about it, is it hurting? No. No. Right. Notice how you're becoming more. Okay. Right. And then let's flip it around. Right. Can you imagine being him?
[119:47] B: No.
[119:47] A: And what comes to mind to do to the person that you're with that you have children with is to farm them out to other men for money.
[119:55] B: Well, I didn't have children with him then, but.
[119:57] A: I know. But eventually. This is a guy who's, like, thinking of relationship with you. Relationship goals.
[120:04] B: Yeah.
[120:06] A: That I'm farming her out for money.
[120:08] B: Yeah.
[120:08] A: And then every once in a while, I'm doing awful stuff that hurts her more.
[120:13] B: Yeah.
[120:13] A: To dominate and control.
[120:16] B: Yeah.
[120:18] A: And then after that, I have sex with her body and then pee on her. You imagine that that's what comes to mind to do. Wow. She's totally into that. Like, I mean, there are people that are into urophilia. I get it. But come on. Like, that's what occurs to do.
[120:34] B: Yeah.
[120:35] A: Like, how fucked up is that guy?
[120:37] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[120:40] A: But that's the thing that comes to mind to do with somebody that I'm. You know.
[120:46] B: Yeah.
[120:47] A: Got it. Right. So, again, notice those things with him. What do you notice now? And we know that it happened more than once.
[120:59] B: I mean, it makes more sense.
[121:01] A: And there might have been another time that we didn't even talk about. And if you think about that one now, what do you notice? That's right.
[121:08] B: It's all together.
[121:11] A: It is. It's all data. Right. You're getting free. Mm. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. Yeah. Because again, checking in. You. What are you noticing?
[121:30] B: As I feel lighter and I Don't feel as tense.
[121:33] A: Yeah. Things are lightening up. So again, notice what happens as your breathing slows down and expands. Your jaw slightly lowers. Notice what's happening in your body. And again, another moment, it might even take you. Well before you ever met him. Yeah. What's coming to mind now?
[122:01] B: I just, I feel like dates. Like doing dates?
[122:07] A: Uh huh. GFE dates?
[122:09] B: No, no.
[122:13] A: Well, no, but like not those kind of dates.
[122:16] B: No.
[122:17] A: Well like, like dates like.
[122:19] B: No, no, no. I've never been on an actual date before in real life.
[122:23] A: I never been on a real date, apparently. Might have all been the gfd.
[122:27] B: Like. Okay.
[122:29] A: Yes.
[122:30] B: Dates with customers, let's say. And then like that. Okay. Remember how. All right, the dreams. So the dreams that I have are like doing, working, doing dates, whatever. But like in normal life I never think about that.
[122:48] A: Of course not.
[122:49] B: Okay, but now like talking about this and like you're like, think about this. I'm associate. Like I'm. It's making me think of too, like before I met him.
[122:58] A: Oh good.
[122:58] B: And just doing the things like it's remind. Like they're reminding.
[123:04] A: Oh good. Right. They're structurally similar. That's what we want to go to is those things that are structurally similar.
[123:09] B: Okay. Yes.
[123:10] A: That happened even before him.
[123:11] B: Yes.
[123:12] A: Right. Gotcha.
[123:13] B: All right.
[123:13] A: Yes. You did it. You're there.
[123:14] B: Yeah. But there's like they all kind of run together. I mean there's a few that are like.
[123:21] A: Well, let's just think of a time. And even if we make it up.
[123:24] B: Okay.
[123:25] A: That it's one time, even if some of them run together, it's still the context. All right, so you might have been how old? What might have happened?
[123:31] B: I was probably like 13 or 14.
[123:34] A: 13 or 14, right. Good. And you might have been where?
[123:36] B: I was at the mall.
[123:37] A: You're at the mall, right? With friends, with girlfriends.
[123:39] B: Yep.
[123:40] A: Right. You guys are walking around the mall and they're Spencers.
[123:43] B: Yes, there is. Yeah.
[123:46] A: Everybody's got a girl Spencer's, right?
[123:50] B: Yep. Posters.
[123:52] A: Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
[123:54] B: Okay. Yeah. And then there were these guys.
[123:56] A: There were guys at the mall. Right. And they were older.
[123:59] B: Clearly they were older.
[124:00] A: Right.
[124:01] B: They had a car and we went with them.
[124:03] A: So you and your girlfriends got in the car with them.
[124:05] B: Yep.
[124:06] A: And they drove you.
[124:07] B: I have no idea.
[124:08] A: To wherever they were going.
[124:09] B: Somewhere. Yeah, somewhere. And they wouldn't let us leave.
[124:13] A: Right. So they drove you to a place until you guys got there.
[124:16] B: Yeah. Like a house or something.
[124:17] A: A house, right. And then you went in.
[124:19] B: Yep.
[124:19] A: Right.
[124:20] B: And they went and let us leave.
[124:21] A: And then you wanted to go.
[124:22] B: They were like, yeah, we wanted to leave.
[124:24] A: Like, this isn't fun. Yeah, we want to leave. They're like, you can't leave.
[124:27] B: Yeah. And then we couldn't leave until they were, like, satisfied sexually.
[124:33] A: Right. So you can't leave. We need to. You're gonna do these things to us.
[124:37] B: Yes. And my other friends, they had never, like, done that before.
[124:42] A: Right.
[124:43] B: That I had.
[124:44] A: So they hadn't done anything that you had. So you're like, okay, well, if it gets us out of here, I'll do it.
[124:49] B: Yes.
[124:49] A: Right. And they sat and watched, and you did the things. Or I mean.
[124:53] B: I mean, they were.
[124:54] A: They might not have watched, but yeah.
[124:55] B: And I did the things.
[124:56] A: You did the things with the boys.
[124:57] B: Yes.
[124:57] A: Right. And then the boys. That was over.
[124:59] B: Y.
[125:00] A: Right. And some of them might have done stuff with your vagina, some might have been with your mouth, some might have been other stuff. Right. And then that finished.
[125:06] B: Yes.
[125:07] A: Right. And then you guys got back in the car.
[125:10] B: Yep.
[125:10] A: And they drove you to the mall.
[125:11] B: Yep. And that was it.
[125:14] A: And that was over.
[125:15] B: Yep.
[125:15] A: Right. So notice what's happening as you're telling me that how much more okay, you are. Isn't that interesting? Like, that one didn't create any already because your brain is getting it. That is data. Because you can remember that happening.
[125:30] B: Yeah.
[125:30] A: Right. You can remember putting on your sneaks. Well, stop putting on your sneaks. Well, then stop doing that. Say I'm not doing that. We'll stop them from having you do that. Say they're not having me do that. We'll stop it from happening. It's not happening. Where is it? Say it doesn't exist.
[125:44] B: It doesn't exist.
[125:45] A: Bingo. And again, just check. What do you notice?
[125:49] B: Feels lighter.
[125:50] A: It does feel lighter, right? Yeah. And what even takes you earlier than then?
[126:01] B: I had an abortion. My first abortion.
[126:05] A: You were how old?
[126:06] B: Like 13.
[126:07] A: 13, right. And there had been a guy that you had intentionally had sex with or had sex with you. It was unintentional, or at least not. Not on your purpose.
[126:19] B: Well, the first time I ever had. Well, okay, so I was, like 12 or 13 years time I had sex. He was, like, in my grade, but a little bit older.
[126:28] A: Right.
[126:29] B: And the first time I ever had sex with him and, like, in my whole life.
[126:35] A: Yeah.
[126:35] B: That's my virginity.
[126:36] A: Yes.
[126:40] B: Okay. We had. I stayed home from school.
[126:43] A: Right.
[126:43] B: We had sex.
[126:44] A: Yes.
[126:45] B: He said, split it, hit it, and quit it. And then he left.
[126:49] A: Split it, hit it, and quit it. That guy is a rhymer, man. I'm gonna hook him up with Snoop.
[126:59] B: Yup. But. But I mean, he left, but then, like, we continue to be in a relationship.
[127:05] A: Sure. No, we continue to have sex.
[127:08] B: Yeah.
[127:08] A: Right.
[127:08] B: Yes, that.
[127:09] A: That was his relationship. We're gonna have sex when we see each other.
[127:12] B: Yes.
[127:12] A: Yeah.
[127:13] B: And like, he was also like. I mean, for this age, it sounds like crazy, but he was like, controlling and abusive and, like, physically abusive too.
[127:23] A: And. Right.
[127:24] B: I mean.
[127:25] A: Right.
[127:25] B: But that age, you would not think.
[127:27] A: Right.
[127:27] B: That was a thing.
[127:29] A: Yes, well, it was.
[127:30] B: Yes.
[127:31] A: Right.
[127:32] B: And then there was also someone else after him.
[127:36] A: Well, at the same time as him.
[127:38] B: Yeah.
[127:38] A: Yeah.
[127:39] B: And he was like the only boy in my entire life that was ever, like, kind. Yes.
[127:51] A: Yeah.
[127:52] B: And I still dream about him sometimes. And yeah, he was the only boy. Way in my life that was ever like, kind to me.
[128:00] A: Yeah. But it was also having sex with you.
[128:03] B: Yes.
[128:03] A: But at least he was kind.
[128:05] B: Yes, yes, yes. So, yep.
[128:12] A: I was like the personality. Well, at least he is definitely verbally abusive. But he doesn't hit me yet, so that's better.
[128:17] B: Well, he did sometimes, right? No, no, the nice one. Yeah. No, he didn't hit me.
[128:23] A: Right.
[128:23] B: Yeah, he was nice.
[128:23] A: He's nice. You know, at least not hitting me, you know, doesn't always call me a. So that's better.
[128:31] B: And so crazy. It's so.
[128:36] A: Right.
[128:37] B: So I start, like, messing up in life and I went to juvie.
[128:44] A: Yeah.
[128:45] B: Because I was doing dumb things.
[128:48] A: Yeah.
[128:49] B: And they gave me a pregnancy test.
[128:52] A: And you learned that you were pregnant.
[128:53] B: Yeah.
[128:54] A: Right.
[128:54] B: In juvie, like 13 years old.
[128:57] A: Right.
[128:58] B: Yeah. So they told my mom.
[129:02] A: Right. And mom said, you can't have it.
[129:04] B: Yeah.
[129:04] A: Right. And then you had to have an abortion. Right?
[129:09] B: Yeah.
[129:10] A: And then they went and did that.
[129:11] B: Yeah.
[129:12] A: And then that was over.
[129:13] B: Yeah.
[129:13] A: Right. And then later on, you did something to work on.
[129:15] B: Yeah.
[129:16] A: Like hang out with, you know, your kids. The two littles.
[129:21] B: I had more abortions.
[129:23] A: Yeah, right. Well, wouldn't that make sense?
[129:28] B: Not really.
[129:29] A: It doesn't. I mean, I just Checking your history. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of great guys that treated me really well.
[129:41] B: Two of them were with my traffic.
[129:44] A: Right. Also because he told me not I couldn't have him.
[129:47] B: Yeah.
[129:47] A: Right. So do you get the, The. The. The thing that was going on with all of them? I mean, maybe the early one probably wouldn't have been a great time to have it.
[129:57] B: Yeah, I. I understand. I understand that. I still feel bad about it and I never. I just got it done and then that was It Like, I never.
[130:05] A: So would it be okay for you to feel okay?
[130:11] B: Yes.
[130:12] A: If you're okay, does it mean what happened was okay?
[130:15] B: No.
[130:15] A: Right. You get to be okay even though it wasn't. Right. Back then, you couldn't. Not based on who was told, whether that be your mom or.
[130:32] B: I mean, I was 13, like.
[130:33] A: Right, we get that.
[130:35] B: Yeah.
[130:36] A: Right, Right. And we also get that there's not. There probably wasn't really good education in your household about, you know, sex and contraception and, you know, woman, her rules, her body. Not pretty sure none of those things were being constructed. Right. And there was probably other shit happening in your household or outside of your household with growing up stuff.
[131:08] B: Yeah.
[131:09] A: That we didn't have the healthiest people around you.
[131:13] B: I don't know. I mean, up in, like, I don't. My parents never talk to me about these things. I don't. I mean.
[131:25] A: Right. But we already know that. You know that there was an experience. You're not sure what the experience was. You know, something happened. Preschool age.
[131:35] B: Yes. So just my memory of that.
[131:40] A: Yeah.
[131:40] B: Is.
[131:41] A: Yeah.
[131:42] B: Like.
[131:42] A: Yeah, sure. What was that?
[131:44] B: I was in preschool and I just remember the lady, Miss Sandy. Every time I, like, I don't even know, like, she would make me wear, like. Like, I don't know if it's because I, like, wet myself or something, but she made me wear, like, boy clothes. I feel like, you know, like humiliated by that. I can still, like, remember that. But then, like, I remember one time being with a boy, like, inside. I think it was like recess or not recess or whatever.
[132:26] A: Whatever it was where everybody's outside, everyone's.
[132:27] B: Outside, and me and the boy were inside.
[132:30] A: Yeah.
[132:30] B: And she made us kiss. And that's, like, all I remember.
[132:34] A: Right, right again. An adult, somebody who's in a position of authority, somebody who's older, telling you what to do and you having to comply. Do you follow me with that? It's part of where the grooming is. Part of what the grooming was when you were 12, 13, I had to comply with what the older person told me to do. Right. And I learned that if I complied, I got through it faster. Right. Less pain happened if I just complied.
[133:19] B: Yeah.
[133:20] A: Got it. That's why it was so crazy when I'm with the trafficker and I'm doing everything that I'm supposed to do to comply, and I'm still getting. Right. Because you did everything to comply, to shrink. Right. Makes sense.
[133:37] B: Yes.
[133:38] A: Yeah. So just check in, think about that stuff. Because you can remember doing that. You can Remember that stuff happening, all of it. Whether it be the stuff in preschool or the thing that happened with the boy when you're like, you know, 12, 13, right? And the one nice guy who's at least kind. Right. Close your eyes, think back to the earlier you, and let her know those moments are over. Finished, completed, defeated. They no longer exist. Let her know that that happening wasn't about you. That's right. Let her know about grooming that you didn't know then, but you do know now and that those weren't her decision because of the grooming. She had to do what the person in authority said to do, and she couldn't not. That's right. And see, this is what's changing. And it started really small, that change. And you started recognizing, hey, this isn't the right guy. I gotta figure out a way to get away. And then when the opportunity presented itself, you shared, right. And got yourself away and open up an opportunity for you to change your life for the better, to heal, to become the mom you want to be for your little ones. Right. That's what you're doing now. That's right. Healing from the inside out as the earlier you is getting it. What do you notice happening to her face?
[136:01] B: She's not crying anymore.
[136:02] A: She isn't crying anymore. Right. What else are you noticing?
[136:14] B: There's no pain on her face.
[136:16] A: That's right. She's not hurting. Isn't that a good news thing? Right. She's healing. You're healing. Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Right. And then whenever you're ready, you can open your eyes. And what are you noticing now?
[137:01] B: I feel tingly.
[137:04] A: You feel tingly. Isn't that cool? Mm. Right. Right. So if we think of you didn't know this. So even prior to meeting your trafficker, you had been being groomed by not being able to have a voice, by having to do and be complicit with what authority figures would say. Make sense?
[137:39] B: Yes.
[137:40] A: Right. What you also didn't know is that when a girl gets sexualized earlier than she's supposed to be, she's okay having sex like a man. And how men have sex is that they can have sex and then be done. What was it that he said? Hit it, split it, hit it and quit it. No girl on her own says, all right, let me hit it. Right. That's just not the way that got it. That what we're engineering, and we're not all the way there yet because we have time that you're worth it to you and that it's my choice, my decision, my body. Did you know that women are supposed to be the regulators in a relationship? They're the ones to determine the where, the when, the with whom, the how often, the how much not him. That women actually work in the world where sometimes they want to and sometimes they don't. Where guys live in the world that they always want to. And that's where it's a problem. Because a guy always wants to and she doesn't always want to. She wants to when she wants to, but doesn't when she doesn't. But the problem is if he forces her to have to, then she's got no freedom. Right? We want you to have freedom. Right? That's right. And becoming more okay in you and lightening up. Right? So again, thinking about the stuff that you did when he was trafficking you, the intense part during that five years where sometimes some of the things you did weren't good, some might have been downright bad or illegal or. Right. But you weren't doing them because you were interested in doing bad, illegal things. Right? You were doing it because you were being trafficked. And it just had you believe that I'm in this, doing this because I want to be doing it.
[139:58] B: But what about after that? What about after, like when I wasn't like. Like after I wasn't working anymore, I was still in the relationship.
[140:09] A: You were.
[140:10] B: I was.
[140:13] A: You were in the relationship still, right? And he did all the same things. I mean, he even might get out the big dildo sometimes. He did that, didn't he? Even after you stopped working some. Right? Because that was his perversion, weird shit that he was into whatever, you know, got it. You, because of everything that happened, you didn't know you were in a jail that you couldn't escape even if you wanted to. That's why you couldn't leave on your own. You couldn't leave until it got exposed as trafficking. When that woman came into my office and she started sharing with me, I didn't lead. Oh, yeah, you know, you've been groomed in traffic, you know, trafficking relationship. I didn't lead with that because she wouldn't have been able to go there with that. But now we're leading with it. Now we know, right? Because we had to expose it. She. I was the first person she told anything to. Once it gets exposed, it loses some of its power, right? Then she becomes bigger than it as she gains her own strength, right? And once it's shared and out of the open and people know and Then she's got support structures around her like you are. Can't go back the other way. Can't go back into that. Like knowing what I know, what it was. I can't. So now I've burned the bridges. There's no return after that life. Right now I'm dealing with, what does this life look like?
[141:55] B: Yeah, right.
[141:56] A: And that's what you're doing, which is great that you've got bumpers around you. That's why you're in preparation. Make sense?
[142:03] B: Yes.
[142:04] A: So that all these things are in for forwarding what you're up to. Isn't that a good news thing?
[142:11] B: Yes.
[142:12] A: Yeah, Right. So it's the same stuff that's going on. You didn't know that you were groomed before you ever met him to be complicit or to just do what the quote unquote authority your boy wants. And that's what it was for. Use my body for what you want it for, Period. Not about me. Yeah, right. Any trick that you were turning, any work that you were doing wasn't about your orgasms.
[142:51] B: No, absolutely not.
[142:53] A: You didn't even want to have one if you were with that one. Do you get it? See? It's so perfect. Right? That makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? Right. Right. So again, what happens when you lighten up on the earlier you that she didn't know, and she didn't know that she was groomed and she didn't know that she was into trafficking. And then when it finally got better, and it wasn't as bad as that, that was way better than the biggest thing that this girl says. 14 to 32. Why couldn't I have left earlier? Not everything he did was awful. He would buy presents, he would be nice, he'd take her places, he'd do trips. He. Weird, right? Not everything was awful. But the highest way of addiction is what we call intermittent reinforcement. It's what we use for gambling. I don't win every time, but I might win. And I win just enough that it keeps me going. Same thing. Intermittent reinforcer. Right. There's conditioning where I ring the bell and the dog salivates and I pair those two things together. If we're playing intermittent, like I throw dice and I don't know whether I'm gonna win or not, but I win sometimes. Then that hooks my brain into it being the highest form of reinforcement because I'm not getting it every time. Where I can get bored. I never get it, which means I don't want to do it. Anymore. I get it every once in a while and it keeps me hooked on it. Okay, that makes sense.
[144:52] B: Yes. Cuz then by like the seven years when Jackson then I didn't want, you know, that I was done.
[144:59] A: Right.
[145:00] B: And I wasn't seeking that anymore.
[145:02] A: Right.
[145:03] B: I mean, I was seeking to please him, to avoid conflict, that's all. And punishment. But I was no longer seeking his. His affection.
[145:11] A: Right. You were done with him, but you couldn't get away, so you. You had to fawn more to again mitigate, shrink damage, hurt, pain. Right. He's going to lose it. I'm going to do stuff to get it so that it's not so bad if he loses it.
[145:29] B: Yeah.
[145:31] A: Got it. And that was easier to deal with than having to do the other stuff and deal with that. Yeah, Right. But by that time, when I might have had the space and ability to leave, or when he had had his stroke and was dependent on me, I was already trained, I was already programmed. So if I was programmed to take care of him and now he's really disabled, I can't possibly leave because I was programmed to take care of him. I had hope. That's why we want to get rid of hope, because it's powerlessness. I had hope that by taking care of him and nurturing him back to health that he'd be a nicer, decenter guy. And he wasn't. Son of a bitch, right? Like son of a bitch. I did all. I was hopeful. Right? We don't want to be hope filled. What we want is we want to have intention of where we're going and that you're doing the right steps and the right actions. Right. You're doing the right steps and right actions that lead to the outcome you want. That's why you made the decision you made to. Even if I get some form of punishment, which I could have gotten away with no punishment at all if I'd won, I'm gonna take the thing that shrinks the possibility of jail time. Right. My kids are important to me and I want to be present for them. And I want me to be okay as I'm present for them. Which is what you're doing now. Right? Because notice how much more clear you are now. As you think about the stuff that we talked about. What do you notice about it now?
[147:26] B: It is clear. And it's not all like segmented, right then it feels smaller.
[147:37] A: It does, doesn't it? Isn't that cool? Because you're bigger than it now. I mean, you are the authority on you Mm. That's right. You're the authority on this. That's right. And what we know about authority is that you listen to authority. She might be nicer to you. Yeah, Got it.
[148:04] B: Mm.
[148:05] A: You're doing great. Yeah. Yeah. And then you're just gonna notice. Right. Because as that stuff gets cleared. Right. Because what you had been reminded of was what I did when I was, like, 13, where I just did what the guy wanted me to do. And then later, even before I met the guy, because that's what those things were. Then when I met the guy, it was just, oh, well, this is what the guy wants me to do. I do the thing that the guy wants me to do. Again, you didn't know that you were groomed. Make sense? So, of course, it wouldn't feel like this was any different than anything else, because that's all I'd known. This is what boyfriends do, or this is what you do to have a boyfriend. I've got these things, and boyfriend like these things. So this is what I like. So I get to have boyfriend. Right, Right. We didn't get the education that I trained the dude. How he treating me, because if he wants any of this and he's treating me like that, he don't get any of this. And see, that wasn't what was.
[149:12] B: Yeah. It was just. Yeah.
[149:15] A: You get all of this regardless of what you do.
[149:17] B: Yeah.
[149:21] A: You follow me for that? Now, that's different.
[149:24] B: Yeah.
[149:25] A: Right, Right. That also starts to heal the picker, what you're finding yourself attracting and attracted to now. What's happening now?
[149:40] B: I kind of figured I'd just be alone forever.
[149:42] A: Oh, well. Yeah. If I'm going to pick those kind of guys, better to not be with anybody and celibate. Uhhuh. Right? Yeah. Not doing that either. I've had enough of that for a lifetime.
[149:54] B: Yeah.
[149:58] A: Right. But as you're healing, it's healing in all sorts of different ways. Again, not now. Right. We've got plenty of time. And you did great today.
[150:10] B: Thank you.
[150:11] A: Yeah. Right. Because as you check in and you think about Jackson and you think about the different things, and all I keep thinking about is, like, a clown that blows up big, like, balloon animals. And that's the big dildo. See it? Like a balloon animal floating around all over the place. And I hear the sound in the background as he's doing it. I don't know. That's just my mind. But see, notice how it's not making you feel bad?
[150:47] B: No. I mean, it's. It's just crazy.
[150:50] A: Isn't that great? Yeah. Right. And as we get in the last part, which you got in the last time we saw each other, although all of that stuff happened to your body, there's no part of your body now that's the same as when any of that stuff is happening. So the coolest part to remember is that he never touched you. Even though he messed with your stuff, he never got you. Right. Right. So one more time. Big, nice breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Eyes rest. Closed you rest. As eyes rest and you rest, things just integrate inside at deeper and deeper levels. Your unconscious is rewiring, recoding brain neural networks. That's right. So that it's becoming more optimized to support you and what you're up to and where you're headed more and more. Okay. Lighter, at peace, free, clear. Connecting to other others. Being worth it to you. That's right. Isn't that a good used thing? That's right. And so as all of it gets in at deeper and deeper levels, you don't have to do anything. Because I'm not sure where you're going to be when you realize how much you've changed. I'm not sure what situation is going to be happening where you're like, hey, wait a minute. I used to. I'm not. Huh? I don't know how. How you're going to notice. Wow. That was a nice, peaceful rest. But I do know your unconscious knows more than you and how to heal and is doing all of that now, even more as you rest. So it's even easier for you to move through the day, becoming more of who you are, lighter, clearer, peaceful, and free. Present to what's possible for you. Because you're not going for hope. We're going for what's possible. There we go. And then. Whenever you ready. One more breath in. And eyes are open. Cool. Great job today, Allison.
[153:19] B: Thank you.
[153:19] A: You're welcome. Do you have any questions for me before we stop? For now.
[153:25] B: What was it called again?
[153:27] A: Intermittent Intermittent Reinforcer.
[153:30] B: Intermittent reinforcer.
[153:32] A: Yeah, it's the same reinforcement that's used for gambling. That's what was going on. And that's the strongest reinforcer. Locks me in. And if I didn't know I was groomed and thought all of that was normal and natural, I didn't know. And before I knew it, I was already in it. And then I couldn't get out of it until I exposed it. Now I'm out of it. And now I'm doing the healing. I'm gonna get eventually my kids all out of it. Right. Good job.
[154:07] B: Thank you.
[154:08] A: You're welcome. And then we'll get back together again.
[154:12] B: Okay.
[154:12] A: Yeah. Probably not in, like, two months, but probably, like in a month. Got it.
[154:17] B: Got it.
[154:17] A: Cool. Bean. Okay, he can stop with that.
