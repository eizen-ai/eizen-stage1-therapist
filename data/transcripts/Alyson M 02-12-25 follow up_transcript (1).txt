[00:00] A: All right, so Today is the 12th. 12th of February, Alison. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:15] B: Yes.
[00:16] A: Cool. So first, give me an update on how our last session left you.
[00:21] B: It actually left me. I mean. Okay. So for like a few days, maybe a week, it was kind of rough because I think I was, like, processing, you know? And then things have been good. Yeah. I've noticed I don't have as many nightmares.
[00:38] A: Okay, that's good.
[00:39] B: My heart palpitations have decreased.
[00:42] A: Okay.
[00:45] B: And I just feel, like, lighter somehow. Like, I just. I feel like I'm more and able to be, you know, figuring I was, you know, figuring out who I am and, like, I can look in the mirror for longer and stuff like that.
[00:58] A: Isn't that cool?
[00:59] B: Yeah.
[01:00] A: How neat. Yay. I'm so glad. Yeah. Yeah. And when you think about that stuff and what he had done in the whole aspect of psychological. Like that.
[01:12] B: Yeah.
[01:12] A: Even the weird stuff that he did with the big. Right when you think. Right.
[01:17] B: I've thought a couple times about you, like, oh, my God. Yeah. Yeah. It's not as, like, you know, intense or whatever.
[01:30] A: Yeah. It doesn't have the same hold or charge. It doesn't do the same thing. I still don't like that he did it. Never will.
[01:38] B: And then what you told me about, like, I can be okay. That doesn't make it happen.
[01:44] A: That's right.
[01:45] B: Okay.
[01:46] A: I can be okay.
[01:48] B: It doesn't mean that what happened was okay.
[01:51] A: That's right. Right. You get to be okay even though that wasn't.
[01:54] B: Yeah.
[01:55] A: Right. Yeah. And that's becoming more and more okay with you because for a period of time where it was stuck is if I'm okay. Excuses. And I can't excuse. So how could I ever get to be okay? Do you follow me with that? That's one of the conflicts. Like, if I'm okay, then.
[02:14] B: Yeah. Like, I can't be okay because it wasn't okay. How can I go on, basically.
[02:19] A: Right. Right. And now we're getting to the point, well, that wasn't okay. Get to be okay, even though that wasn't okay. Because me being okay doesn't mean that that was okay. Yes. I get to be okay. Despite the up shit that was happening then. Yeah. And even the stuff as you were thinking, because one of the things that you had mentioned was kind of being a little down on you, that how come I didn't leave earlier? Right. What do you notice with that now, even?
[02:49] B: Well, I still am kind of gripping onto that because I feel like that gives me some kind of control, I guess. But, like, lately I've been kind of. So I went to court and made the plea and everything.
[03:07] A: Right. You had come to see me right after you had decided that I'm gonna go ahead and not roll the dice. I'm gonna go ahead and take this because I want to shrink the potential of how long I would have to be away from my kids. Right. And that makes a lot of sense. So cool.
[03:26] B: But, like, then going there and making the plea, it just brought up a lot of stuff. Like, for me, I mean, obviously, it's a scary situation, but aside from all the legal stuff, it just was, like, kind of like the last opportunity for him to step in and, like, say, oh, no, it wasn't her, it was me. And that didn't happen, and I didn't expect it.
[03:46] A: Surprise. Such a shock. Wow.
[03:48] B: Gosh.
[03:49] A: You know, we really would have thought, like, after all this stuff that he would have really, like.
[03:53] B: Yeah. So I wasn't expecting that, but it was just, like, finalized, you know?
[03:59] A: Yeah.
[03:59] B: And so it was just like the. And then also, the thinking back, has almost been a year. Well, since that started, it's been a year.
[04:07] A: Yeah.
[04:07] B: And then it was like, just this. Like, I just feel dumb because when that happened, like, we got arrested, and then they released us, and then, like, we get. You know, it's like, well, I'm gonna hire a lawyer because I'm gonna take the blame. So you don't need a lawyer.
[04:23] A: That's what he said.
[04:24] B: Yeah, that's what he's telling me.
[04:25] A: Okay.
[04:25] B: Made sense.
[04:26] A: Of course. Dude's gonna take care of me, right? Yeah. Yeah.
[04:29] B: Because why would I need a lawyer?
[04:31] A: I didn't do anything.
[04:33] B: So anyways, just all these things, I'm like, I was just so stupid.
[04:37] A: Like, you just didn't know.
[04:39] B: But even at that point, when I'm like, you know, at the end, I was, like, trying to get away. Like, I didn't like him. I still somehow I believed him. So anyways, that, you know, is just the realization that, like, he never protected me. I was always protecting myself, basically, and God was protecting me. And then I talked to Aaron on Friday, and we were kind of discussing what I came here to talk to you about, about this interview that I.
[05:05] A: Have to do with.
[05:08] B: Okay. So. Because I made a plea.
[05:12] A: Okay. Before you go to that. Yes, because we'll get to that.
[05:15] B: Okay.
[05:15] A: I just want to recap one of the things that you had shared, because I think it's really, really powerful.
[05:21] B: Okay.
[05:21] A: And that you got distinctions where I used to think that he took care of me.
[05:28] B: Yes.
[05:28] A: And now I got that he didn't. Yes, I was. And grace of God and. And. And. But, like, it was never him.
[05:37] B: Yes.
[05:39] A: That's a really useful distinction. Second, the only way that you were able to get out is when you spoke and you brought it into the light.
[05:52] B: Yes.
[05:53] A: So I told you about the other girl. That that's the only way that she got out. She also was down on herself about having not gotten out sooner. How come I didn't leave when I was 19? How come I didn't leave when I was 27? How come I didn't. How come when I found this thing and got the realization, how come I stayed for another, like. And the realization is, I was still locked in it because I never spoke it. Because it's the secret. It's the core. It's a manipulation. It's the gas, it's the. All that.
[06:25] B: Yeah.
[06:26] A: As soon as I spoke it, it brought it into light. And the more and more that it's in the light, the more and more I see it clearly for what it actually was.
[06:34] B: Yes.
[06:35] A: Right.
[06:37] B: It's just. That's where I'm at. And it's hard to, like, it's starting to connect more. Like, I've talked to Aaron about, like, the emotional and the logical. Like, logically, I understand a lot of things, but emotionally. But now it's starting to connect more.
[06:53] A: It is.
[06:54] B: And that's. It's hard. Yes, it is.
[06:56] A: Cool.
[06:57] B: Cause I know the truth. But just processing it and realizing, like, on a logical level, I realized this was not normal or, like, whatever. But now that I'm feeling the things and, like, realizing, wow, it was so much worse than I thought it was because I was. I go, you know, to feel that panic. You know, sometimes I've been having these, like, just overwhelming, like, panics, you know? And then my thought is just, like, I don't want to go back there. You know what I mean?
[07:28] A: That's just him.
[07:29] B: I, like. Yeah. To go back to that feeling and go back, like, revisiting that. Because last week, I was kind of like. I took the week off, basically. I was, like. In the other stuff, I was, like, ignoring my feelings. I didn't really realize I was doing it, though, until I was taken by the little emergency meds, like, all week there, it's nothing, you know, and I'm bopping along, like, doing crafts and whatever. And then one of the advocates asked me, like, what's wrong? And as soon as I open my mouth, I just started crying. And then I talked to Aaron and we had a conversation about. I was like, what am I going to tell these people when I have this interview? Because I tell them, like, my life story, basically, and then things pertaining to the crime. And then I'm like, what do I say? Because I'm trying to figure out now, like, what happened? You know what I mean? And then I'm like, what do I say? Like, I was trafficked for five years. And then what. What was that? You know? And then she brought to my attention that basically, I mean, I was trafficked the entire time, like, you know, as far as being under, you know, and that, for some reason, is really hard for me to, like, accept.
[08:42] A: Is it?
[08:42] B: Not accept? Not accept. Let me. So I don't know why.
[08:48] A: It's like, what about Earth shattered? What about. That's troubling?
[08:52] B: I don't know. It's. It's validating because it makes me feel like, okay, I wasn't just crazy to think, like, this is. This was so messed up. And, like, it's not like, oh, I just chose to stay. And all the things that, you know, I was so.
[09:09] A: You couldn't believe. It's not that you chose to stay. There was no way to leave because you didn't know you were in an invisible cell. That makes sense.
[09:21] B: Yes.
[09:23] A: So I can't leave. And anytime there was thoughts to do it, I couldn't go through with it because I was doing it by myself. I couldn't get out of it because I needed somebody to open up the cage first. I needed to let somebody know that I'm in the cage. And then as soon as I let them know they can open, then I can get out. But you couldn't get out. Does that make sense?
[09:44] B: Yes.
[09:45] A: And what about that? It's now a longer period of time than what you had been thinking. Right. What about that is troubling you now?
[09:59] B: I don't really know. It's. I guess.
[10:01] A: Is it troubling?
[10:02] B: It is.
[10:03] A: How do you know it's troubling then?
[10:05] B: Because when I found out, it was like my brain was split. Splitting. Like, I don't even know. Like, my brain was like, no. Like, this information, like, it just. I don't know, ever since I found out, like, it's just affecting me, like, randomly. I'll Just start crying. Like it's just coming out. And. Yeah, so. But this is what's troubling me. Okay. So the feeling that I get, it's like intense. It's like this panic, like, and that's when I was thinking, I don't want to go back there. And I'm assuming my brain means, like, that's just the state I was literally living in for all of these years. And that's scary because I at the time did not know that I was living in.
[10:47] A: That's right. You didn't know. You just didn't know. Right. It's not like it turned it on all at once. Right. Have you ever heard the analogy of you can't put a lobster in a boiling pot of water because it will jump out, but you can put a lobster in regular temperature, room temperature water and turn it on so that it slowly gets warmer and warmer and warmer and warmer and warmer and lobster does nothing. That's what it was like. Do you follow me with that? Like, so you didn't know you were in it? Yeah, it's hard to get out of it if I don't know that I'm in it.
[11:27] B: Yes.
[11:28] A: Yeah. And I didn't know I was at that level.
[11:33] B: Yes.
[11:33] A: Right. And so if I'm following you, anytime I have that feeling in me that is a reminder of what it was like back then. I get really distressed.
[11:46] B: Yes.
[11:47] A: Okay, so we. One thing, we'd like to get it so that when that's happening, you're not so distressed.
[11:55] B: Yes.
[11:55] A: And then turn down.
[11:57] B: Yes.
[11:57] A: So that we can change the relationship to it.
[12:00] B: Yes.
[12:01] A: Okay, cool. And then the second thing is you're going to be talking.
[12:04] B: Yes.
[12:05] A: So say more about. About that. Be useful for me to know.
[12:09] B: Well, okay, so from what I understand, I'm basically telling them her. My entire life story and then the things pertaining to the crime and then she is going to make a recommendation to the judge based off of our interview as to what my punishment should be at my sentencing hearing.
[12:31] A: Okay.
[12:32] B: So. Yeah.
[12:33] A: Okay.
[12:34] B: And I just am like, you know, scared knowing that and like trying to articulate, like, what exactly happened and how to like verbalize, you know what I mean? Like, I don't, like, I'm still trying to figure out exactly what happened, you know, like I was there obviously, and. But what I thought.
[12:56] A: What are you still trying to figure out? Does it pertain to, quote unquote, the crime? No. Because the crime thing has to do with their thinking that you and him were out to get girls.
[13:09] B: No, this is a different crime. This is that. That whole situation. That situation you're so good at. I have. That's the state attorney. That's the state case. Okay, so the state case. That's fine. The state attorney, she's the one that linked me up with Misty. She's like, all for me being in Sala and stuff like that. This is a federal case in which we were charged with wire fraud.
[13:37] A: Wire fraud. Okay.
[13:38] B: So all that stuff that's like, you know, I have made an agreement with them, like, I'm cooperating and if I have to testify against him, like, I will and things like that. So that's. The state case is settled. It's just this now the federal case that is. It's wire wrong. So that's what we have to.
[14:02] A: And what happened?
[14:03] B: Well, okay, so it was with the PPP loans.
[14:10] A: Okay. Okay.
[14:11] B: So he had just had a stroke. This is. That happened. Let's just call it 2020.
[14:19] A: Yeah.
[14:20] B: So when he had a stroke, the things that were happening at that time in my life were. He had a stroke. I was literally to my end of the rope with him. Like, I wanted to leave.
[14:32] A: Yes.
[14:32] B: Literally the night. Okay. Anyways, I was. Yeah.
[14:36] A: How you doing right now?
[14:37] B: I'm doing great. Okay. So. And then I had like, all my kids at that time. I had also. I told you about Michael and Alyssa. They're like in their teens at this time.
[14:49] A: Right.
[14:50] B: His older son, Messiah, who was like 20 something. And then I had like Jessie, Jordan and Jada had just been born. She was like, not walking yet. Crawling age. So that's. And I'm also like breastfeeding her and everything. So that was my life. Then he had a stroke.
[15:04] A: Okay.
[15:04] B: Then he's in the hospital for like a month. And we talked about that, how I went to go take care of him and whatever for some reason and.
[15:14] A: Cause that's what you would do.
[15:16] B: Yes.
[15:17] A: When you didn't know that you were in a trafficking relationship.
[15:20] B: Yes.
[15:21] A: Because that's a category of it form.
[15:28] B: Oh, yes. Yeah.
[15:30] A: So I would. Yes, got it. So then just like I would do for. If it wasn't a trafficking relationship and it was somebody that I care about that I was together with.
[15:41] B: It's just. I. I get that.
[15:45] A: Just for a moment. Just check that out for a moment. Like, duh. If it was somebody that was actually not doing what, like my grandma. Right.
[15:54] B: Or my mom.
[15:55] A: Yeah, that's right.
[15:56] B: But it's just. Okay, that's so. You know, it's really hard for me.
[16:00] A: Though, to somehow let's check it out. I don't know whether it's gonna be hard or not. What if it doesn't have to be, Allison? But it is.
[16:09] B: I can't, like, thinking back to whenever I, like, cared about him.
[16:14] A: Yeah.
[16:15] B: Well, okay, so apparently I cared about him throughout the entire time.
[16:19] A: Of course you did. That's fine.
[16:21] B: But at the very beginning, when I was, like, obsessed. I mean, I guess I was always obsessed. I don't really know.
[16:27] A: I don't know whether it was obsessed or.
[16:29] B: You know what I mean, you know, like, infatuated. I don't know. Like.
[16:37] A: Sure.
[16:38] B: At the beginning, it was just different than the end. Yes. I just feel like it was different.
[16:43] A: Right. The beginning started, and then things progressively got worse. And then I finally had the realization, and then I saw him for who he is.
[16:54] B: Yeah.
[16:55] A: I didn't know that up front.
[16:56] B: Yeah.
[16:57] A: I didn't know that going ahead of time that it was going to lead to all that.
[17:00] B: Yeah.
[17:01] A: If I had known it going ahead of time, I wouldn't have had any interaction with the guy at all.
[17:04] B: Yeah.
[17:06] A: But I didn't know that then. Right. I didn't know that he was doing any of that. So I didn't know that I was in a. That he was grooming me, that I was in a trafficking relationship, that he was using persuasion and influence and control and psychological manipulation and other kinds of tactics. I fell in line because it was constant. This. And I've been on this thing for a long time, which why I don't even. Like, if I get a little bit of it. Right. That put me in a state of fawn, which is part of the fight Flight. Freeze, Fawn. So of course I would be. And then it was the intermittent reinforcer, remember where I don't get nice stuff all the time, but every once in a while I do, which keeps me coming back to it. Right. If I won every time, I would stop doing it. If I lost every time, I wouldn't do it anymore. But if every once in a while I get a cookie, then it's the strongest type of. That's what got you looped into the whole thing. Right. So as you hear this now. Right. What do you notice in here?
[18:22] B: I get it. I'm like the logical.
[18:25] A: What do you notice?
[18:26] B: It makes sense.
[18:27] A: That's what I'm saying.
[18:27] B: What do I notice in here?
[18:29] A: Yeah. Feeling.
[18:31] B: My heart's beating fast. I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
[18:33] A: Oh. Oh, well, they'd be here. Hi. Hi. Because how do you actually want to.
[18:38] B: Be not like that.
[18:40] A: And if you're not like that, how would you actually be comfortable? Yeah. What's it like when you feel comfortable in you?
[18:47] B: It's nice.
[18:48] A: It is. So let's think of a you who's much more comfortable in you.
[18:51] B: Okay.
[18:52] A: Then all you want to do is those sensations. Why we're doing this thing is it's taking you down the dorsal branch of the vagus nerve. Right. When you're down the dorsal branch of the vagus nerve. I don't have resources. Self talk is all about how shitty I am and I'm not good and all that kind of crap. And it feels like I'm gonna feel this way forever. Like that's dorsal branch of the vagus nerve. What happens is that cue, right. I start, I go down the track that froze. So now we want to bring our awareness into the sensations.
[19:23] B: Okay.
[19:24] A: So that you just notice not the situation, just the sensations. And begin to pay attention to how the sensations are subtly. Chang.
[19:31] B: Mm.
[19:32] A: Even if they're not changing in the way you want them to, yet just notice how those sensations are changing. And what do you notice happening as the sensations are changing now?
[19:45] B: I mean, my heart's still palpitating.
[19:48] A: Well, you notice feeling.
[19:52] B: Like, I don't know, I'm.
[19:55] A: So you're noticing a subtle change. That's all we want to pay attention because we never have the conscious awareness of the feelings changing.
[20:04] B: Okay.
[20:05] A: So how we begin to do that is you start to notice the sensations without doing anything with them. But notice how they're changing because they're like a wave. They're always moving. They can't stay the same. We add curiosity. Like we get a little curious about how it's changing and we can even use the sound of curiosity. We go. And you're right. I'm wondering how the sensations. Heart. What am I noticing now? And what do you notice now it's changing?
[20:42] B: I don't know. My heart is just beating and I. Okay, so I started to feel. It is beating.
[20:46] A: That's.
[20:46] B: Yes, it is beating. We're harder than normal. And I start to feel like panic. And then I feel like I need to do something.
[20:53] A: Yes, that's what you've been doing.
[20:55] B: Yes.
[20:55] A: Right. But what do you start noticing changing as you're noticing the sensations changing? Right. Even if it's subtle, that it's lessening. Oh, it's lessening.
[21:09] B: Yes.
[21:10] A: Right. As you're getting curious about it, it's lessening. Then you can do a lever, a brain lever.
[21:15] B: Oh, okay.
[21:16] A: Right. A brain lever might Be something as simple as I slightly lower my jaw and I relax my tongue and I breathe a little bit slower and deeper and I exhale a little bit longer. And see, that's a physiological lever that starts to put my body more into a state of rest. And what do you start noticing about the sensations that you're noticing in your chest?
[21:43] B: It's slowing down more.
[21:44] A: And now they're slowing down more. Isn't that interesting? That's right. And so we're interested in a you who's comfortable in you as you're reciting and recalling historical information about stuff that happened. Make sense, because that's how we want you to be when you're sharing it. We don't want you to be in it, but we want you to be describing it as historical information about something that happened. To the best of my recollection. Right. Because there was a lot happening. Right. 2020 hit. We had this world phenomenon of a pandemic coming and everybody getting freaked out because nobody knew what the hell that meant. Seeing another country. How lots of people are dying. Holy shit, is it going to kill us all? You had a baby with three other little ones, plus three other older ones. And the guy that you were with that you care about because you were in that thing of. Right. Fawn had a stroke and so you were taking care of all of this and him.
[23:00] B: Yes.
[23:00] A: Yeah. A lot happening.
[23:02] B: Yes.
[23:03] A: Yeah. And he was in the hospital for like a month.
[23:05] B: Yes.
[23:05] A: Yeah, yeah. And as we just went through that right now, what do you notice?
[23:11] B: My heart's beating faster.
[23:13] A: Yeah. So watch. You're doing it. Great. So now we turned it on again. So now we want to get curious about the sensations. You want to slightly lower your jaw and breathe a little bit slower. You want to expand awareness so that you notice more space in the room. So, like, opening up your eyes to see it with your peripheral vision, the wiggling. Right. Because you're becoming more aware of space. You can do a physiological sigh. That's a fun one. It's a deep breath in and then at the top of the inhale, a quick breath in. So it's like this. Okay, so try that. Do it one more time. Right. And what are you noticing happening with the sensations?
[24:08] B: It's lessening.
[24:10] A: It is lessening. Where the physiological side comes from is, have you ever seen or been hysterically crying?
[24:17] B: Yes.
[24:17] A: And somebody's like. And then they go, yeah, right. Their body does it. Not they. Their body does it because their body's settling them down. So we know that you do that four times.
[24:31] B: Mm.
[24:32] A: It'll cause the body to settle down, and then about 20 seconds later, the heart rate comes back down. Isn't that interesting? So, yeah, so we're thinking of it. Right. And, you know, I mean, it was 20, 20ish. You had a newborn who still wasn't walking. You were still breastfeeding. Right. You had little ones, then older ones. The pandemic coming. Right. Whatever else was happening that he was taking care of. Because you were doing all the other shit.
[25:02] B: Yes.
[25:03] A: And then he had a stroke.
[25:04] B: Yes.
[25:05] A: Right. Then you were tending to helping him, seeing him in the hospital multiple times as he was there and dragging the kids back and forth and doing all the other shit that somebody who cares about somebody would do.
[25:18] B: Yes. Yes.
[25:23] A: Right. So we know at least, Allison, that that part's intact.
[25:26] B: Okay.
[25:27] A: Meaning that you have the ability to care and do caring things. Right. You just didn't know that you were in a groomed loop and it was funny. Got it.
[25:43] B: Yes.
[25:44] A: What do you notice? Is it there again? Notice the heart, right?
[25:49] B: Yes.
[25:50] A: Do the physiological side. Go do it again. One more. And then last one. Notice what starts to happen in your body. And then notice 20 seconds later, you'll start noticing Europe. What do you notice happening there?
[26:27] B: Well, I started thinking about something else.
[26:30] A: You. You did? You're fine. You started thinking about something else?
[26:34] B: Yes. Well, something that's stressful. It's associated with it, but yes.
[26:38] A: What was the thing that you were thinking about? Was it a thing that happened?
[26:42] B: Yes.
[26:42] A: Oh, that's not happening now? Yes. Oh, so we want to get good news in, do we not? Because you get it, right? That the only reason that we stay troubled by awful shit that's happened isn't because it happened. You know that, right? I know. That's weird, right? We're not troubled by the awful shit that happened because it happened. We're troubled because emotionally, our brain doesn't know it's not happening right now. So we've got good news to get in that that's not happening. Because there's a part of your brain that's making you feel the discomfort, not because that was awful, but because it's thinking it's happening. It's confusing. The thought about it, thinking it's the experience. Right. Is that experience happening now?
[27:32] B: No.
[27:33] A: No. I'm here. Hi. Right. You're here. I'm here. We're happening. That isn't right. Right. So you want to be here as you go through what happened then? Because this is. That isn't.
[27:46] B: Yes.
[27:47] A: Right. So first, before you do that one more time, slightly lower your jaw, relax your tongue, and breathe a little bit slower and deeper. Right? Yeah. Just notice what starts to happen as you're breathing in this way. And you can see more space. You know, the space goes beyond the room, right? Like, all the way out. In every direction, there's space. As you start noticing space again, check inside your body. How's your body feeling now?
[28:20] B: Calmer.
[28:22] A: Yeah. Body's feeling calmer because you're getting back to being here, not there. That happened when? How long ago?
[28:32] B: Like five years?
[28:33] A: Yeah, like five years ago. You're aware. And what happened?
[28:37] B: What was that?
[28:38] A: The thing that you were troubled about that popped to your mind?
[28:41] B: Oh, yeah.
[28:41] A: That one happened when?
[28:42] B: Five years ago.
[28:43] A: And you were where?
[28:44] B: Where was I?
[28:45] A: Yeah. When it happened.
[28:47] B: Tampa.
[28:47] A: Tampa. Are you in Tampa? No. You're not, are you? No. It doesn't even look like the same location, does it?
[28:53] B: No.
[28:53] A: No, because you're here, and that's data. Right. So you're in Tampa. It was at daytime or nighttime?
[29:01] B: Daytime. Well, yeah, let's go with daytime.
[29:09] A: Daytime into night time. Just daytime.
[29:11] B: Daytime. I'm just.
[29:13] A: Okay. So you got the time?
[29:15] B: Yes.
[29:15] A: Yeah. Be here, though.
[29:16] B: All right.
[29:17] A: Not there. Here. Okay. Hi.
[29:18] B: Yes.
[29:19] A: Hi. It's nice to see you.
[29:21] B: Yes.
[29:21] A: Right. And we're here because we want you free.
[29:24] B: Yes.
[29:24] A: Which you want, too.
[29:26] B: Yes.
[29:27] A: That's why you're here. Right. Because we want you to be free. Yes, that's right. Which happens more when you're here. Yes, it does, doesn't it? That's right. In lots of ways. Some you're aware of, some you're not. But you definitely know you feel better when you leave.
[29:43] B: Yes.
[29:43] A: Isn't that cool? Yes, that's right. Because you're here. Hi. So that was then you were in Tampa. Then what happened? You're inside, outside.
[29:52] B: Outside, outside.
[29:53] A: Right. And then what happened?
[29:56] B: Okay, so I'm think. Okay, so all of this is. All right. So we were leaving the house.
[30:03] A: Yes.
[30:05] B: Michael, me, Jada.
[30:08] A: Yeah.
[30:09] B: And they were going to. Okay, okay. They were going to somewhere, wherever.
[30:16] A: Yeah.
[30:16] B: Okay. And like the gym or something.
[30:19] A: Yeah.
[30:20] B: And then. So as we're leaving, like, I saw this car. I'm like. That looks like, you know, like an undercover or something.
[30:28] A: Right. Good job. Right.
[30:30] B: And so Alyssa and the. The. My. Jesse and Jordan were all home. And so we left anyways. Like, okay, so CPS comes to the house.
[30:40] A: Yes.
[30:41] B: And so I think we had dropped Michael off, and then he. He.
[30:52] A: How you doing right now?
[30:55] B: He.
[30:57] A: He isn't it so good when you come back. Yes, it is, isn't it?
[31:02] B: So he made me drop him off and then I went back to the house with Jada by myself.
[31:08] A: Yes.
[31:09] B: To face this person.
[31:10] A: Right. And CBS was there.
[31:11] B: Yes.
[31:12] A: Right.
[31:12] B: And he was not there.
[31:13] A: Right.
[31:14] B: And you went in. Yes.
[31:15] A: They're like, how come you left your kids?
[31:18] B: Well, they're. Okay.
[31:20] A: So we've heard complaints about or whatever.
[31:22] B: No. Well, yes, they. So no. They're wondering if we were trafficking.
[31:31] A: Yeah.
[31:32] B: Michael and Alyssa.
[31:33] A: Right.
[31:34] B: Because someone had made a claim.
[31:37] A: Yes.
[31:38] B: That things happened.
[31:40] A: Yes.
[31:40] B: And then I had to deal with that all by myself.
[31:43] A: Right. So you're there. So they're like, we think this happened.
[31:46] B: Yes. And so this though. Okay. Happened when he was in the hospital. The person that was working for him at the time, she, you know, went and told the police.
[32:08] A: Yes.
[32:08] B: And then this happened as a result of that. And all this other, you know, like the other things that have come to light and like.
[32:25] A: How you doing right now?
[32:28] B: So that's the timeline of like when the wire fraud was committed. And it's like tied into this person, which I feel like really bad that all these things happen, you know, now that I know what reality is, I guess. Yeah, whatever. This person was hurt, you know, and.
[32:54] A: That wasn't the person that worked for him. That was somebody else.
[32:56] B: That was the person that worked for him and then.
[33:00] A: And that's who the wired fraud was with.
[33:02] B: No, no, no, no, no.
[33:03] A: This.
[33:03] B: All these things were happening at once. So when he went into the hospital.
[33:06] A: Yeah.
[33:06] B: This person was working for him. And it was like this triangle. She ended up leaving.
[33:14] A: Yeah.
[33:15] B: Like when he had gotten out.
[33:16] A: Right. And then she told police about that.
[33:21] B: Yes.
[33:21] A: Which got CPS to go investigate because. To whether you were trafficking kids or not. Yes.
[33:26] B: Which clearly that was not happening.
[33:28] A: Right.
[33:28] B: Like, you know, that was not happening and. But it was very scary. It made me think about, you know, the whole Jackson situation. Cuz CPS was involved then too. Because it was an accident and everything.
[33:45] A: Right.
[33:45] B: But this was, you know, that like, were you. And then, you know, him. That's just another time where he. I had to deal with that by myself.
[33:54] A: Right.
[33:54] B: And then it was like I was totally. It was okay. I don't know how to explain it.
[33:59] A: So you're doing a good job.
[34:01] B: So scared. You know, this is like where all the shame and all this stuff and the secrets and the whatever and then what's gonna happen to me? What's gonna happen to my kids? The wire fraud happened around the same Time. And this is like, what I'm gonna be talking to this person about. You know what I mean? And that's scary.
[34:24] A: Yeah.
[34:25] B: Yeah.
[34:26] A: Hi. And how do we want you to be? Because we get it. That even thinking about talking about all that stuff and how that was really troubling at that time for you. And there's still some of the shame around that.
[34:41] B: Yeah.
[34:42] A: And anger towards him.
[34:45] B: Yes.
[34:46] A: For having not been, like, the man.
[34:48] B: Yes.
[34:49] A: Right. Right. So question goes back to how do you actually want to be.
[35:01] B: Okay? I want to be.
[35:03] A: You want to be okay because you being okay now doesn't mean any of it was okay.
[35:08] B: Yeah.
[35:09] A: Got it. Right. And you weren't trafficking your kids.
[35:13] B: No.
[35:14] A: Right. You might have been trafficked yourself. You follow me with that?
[35:23] B: Yes.
[35:23] A: You were doing it to your kids.
[35:25] B: No, I would never do it.
[35:26] A: Right. You weren't going, well, instead of me, go with them. Do you get, like, the immediacy of the reaction that you just had?
[35:36] B: Yeah.
[35:37] A: Like, no. Got that. Notice how different that is. Right. So we want you to be more okay knowing that you being okay doesn't mean what happened then was okay. Right. We want you to be more at peace. That, although none of us like that that happened then, that couldn't have not happened then. That makes sense based on the constraints and what was going on then and the stuff in you and the stuff in him and with all the factors the way they were. That's what led that thing to go down. Exactly the way it went down.
[36:19] B: Yes.
[36:19] A: Right. It couldn't have happened any other way, even though we don't like that it happened that way. Does that make sense?
[36:25] B: Yes. Yes.
[36:26] A: That's the part that we want you to be more settled and grounded in. Make sense? So let's think of the you who's much more settled and grounded. Right. Who's much more comfortable in her own skin and is sharing a historical story about shit that happened. Make sense? Yeah. And as she's sharing it, she's just giving information. Right. Because that's what they're asking her for, is the information, what she recalls about what was going on then. Right. Makes sense.
[37:08] B: Yes.
[37:08] A: Yeah. And so as we think of this, you being more okay in. You just check in. Would that be okay?
[37:16] B: Yes.
[37:17] A: Yeah. And with it, okay, we've got a green light again. So again, you just slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue, breathe like you already are. A little slower and deeper in. A little bit longer on the way out. Right. Notice that your awareness can only be on a small amount of information at A time. It's like a flashlight in a dark room. You can definitely see what you're shining the light on, but everything else is in the dark. And of course, you can move the flashlight to a different location in the room, and you'll see whatever's shining in the light, but everything else is in the dark. And see, your unconscious knows how to heal you, right? What's starting to happen now?
[38:03] B: Tears.
[38:04] A: I know, but just check. Are they tears of sadness or are they tears of relief?
[38:10] B: Relief.
[38:10] A: They are, aren't they? Isn't that a cool thing? Right? Because you know that your unconscious knows how to heal and is really interested in working in ways that are best, that are supportive. Right. And they're simply asking you, to the best of your recollection, tell them your account of what happened and what was happening. Right. Knowing that they also know about the other stuff in the world, what grooming is, what trafficking is, how that looks, how people can look like they're in it together when they're not actually in it together. That makes sense.
[38:53] B: Yes.
[38:54] A: Yeah. Yeah. So again, as you're breathing a little bit slower and deeper than normal, as you're exhaling a little bit longer, notice that you can see my nose and my fingers. They go all the way out. Stay looking at my nose, but with the sides of your eyes, pick up the wiggling. Notice when you do this, Allison, that what begins happening in here just by opening up and noticing more space. So that's a really key thing because whenever I go to a presentation or I'm doing a training in front of a group of people, I want to be in peripheral vision. Make sense. So even when I'm doing work, I want to see you, but I want to see the space around you, right? And notice how you're seeing more of the space here. And each time you are your body settling down even more. Right. As we're organizing towards the you becoming more. Okay, Right. Go ahead and take another deep breath in. And then this time, as you exhale, close your eyes. And notice that with your eyes closed, your eyes can rest. And that as your eyes are resting closed, you can also rest, aware of your breath and my voice, the background sounds, even how it feels to be seated in the way you are noticing all of this. At the same time, your unconscious is organizing and responding towards a you who's much more okay in you and at peace, knowing that everything that has couldn't have not. And although she doesn't like it, she's at peace in knowing how different she is. Now on the way to even more brighter and better, still more is happening inside as you rest. So that whenever you're ready, you can once again find your way back up to open your eyes. And what moment just came to mind?
[41:31] B: It's all the other stuff too, that I did.
[41:35] A: I know. That's why I just said what moment of that. All that. You're so good.
[41:39] B: There's a lot of stuff.
[41:41] A: I know. So let's think of a thing that you did that you felt bad that you've done.
[41:47] B: Like when other people came to work.
[41:50] A: Yeah. So let's think of a particular time so this might have happened how long ago and be here. Hi.
[41:56] B: I don't know, like.
[41:57] A: Well, it doesn't matter. When.
[41:59] B: 14 years ago.
[42:00] A: Yeah. Right. So you want to be here with me. Right. And we're going back to this. Would it be okay for you to be okay even if there was a bunch of fucked up shit you did that wasn't okay?
[42:11] B: I don't know.
[42:12] A: Oh, good.
[42:12] B: Right.
[42:15] A: So let me, let me ask you it in a different way. If you are a football fan and your team is getting ready to kick a game winning field goal to win the super bowl, is it a good strategy for the field goal kicker to be feeling horribly guilty about all of the times that he messed up? No. The misses, even the extra points that he's missed. Other times, an argument that he had with it, is that going to help him do better?
[42:44] B: No.
[42:45] A: No, it isn't.
[42:45] B: But he's not. He's not a terrible person.
[42:52] A: Oh. Oh.
[42:53] B: So.
[42:53] A: Oh. We're just thinking that I'm a terrible person because I did terrible things. Could it be possible that a terrible person can be doing good things and a good person can be doing terrible things? I don't know. You don't. What if a really good person has to like shoot people? That's a terrible thing. But they're a really good person. See, we get into all these moral dilemmas.
[43:20] B: Yeah.
[43:20] A: Right. Where we think life is set up as people do things because they're either good or bad. Right. What I would like you to begin to consider is you didn't set yourself up for this. You got born into a certain thing. You had different experience happen along the way that got you trapped into a situation that normalized everything that you were doing.
[43:43] B: But I was thinking about that after I left here. Okay, but like, how is it not my fault that. Okay, arguably when I was a teenager and I was in all these situations and then that normalized, like when I met Him. And it was like, oh, this is. Okay. How. Like, how is that not.
[44:06] A: Like, how is that not my fault?
[44:08] B: Yes. Like, you know, like, I shouldn't have been. You know.
[44:15] A: I don't know. You think you shouldn't have been.
[44:19] B: Yes.
[44:20] A: Right, right. And what I'm saying is, you couldn't have not been then. You can now, but we can't get you to have not done any of the things that you did then.
[44:35] B: Yes, I understand that.
[44:37] A: Right, but. And you're not troubled because you did those things.
[44:40] B: So why am I troubled?
[44:41] A: You're troubled because you can conceive of having not done those things.
[44:48] B: I don't know.
[44:50] A: If I hadn't done those things, then maybe I'd be a better person.
[44:53] B: Yes.
[44:53] A: Do you follow me with that?
[44:54] B: Yeah.
[44:55] A: So the weirdest thing to consider, Allison, you're not troubled because of the things you've done. You're troubled because you can conceive of having not done those things.
[45:04] B: Yes.
[45:05] A: And you've been thinking, if I hadn't done those things, that would be better, because those things that I've done make me feel like I am.
[45:12] B: Like, who does something like that?
[45:14] A: Right. That I. That's my identity.
[45:15] B: Yes.
[45:16] A: That's who I am. So earlier, I worked with a woman, and her trafficker had convinced her and told her that this is what's had you survive awful experiences, that you're a. And that, you know, sometimes whores get beaten, and sometimes whores get raped. And she thought, because she believed him, hated herself. Right. That's what she was saying. I hated myself. But she was believing that that's how she survived was by believing that she was a whore. And that's just shit that happens to horse. And I go, that isn't actually what happened. She goes, what? I go, well, the thing that had you survive is your ability to dissociate so that you didn't have to be in your body when all the fucked up shit was happening. And that didn't come from him. That came inside of you. Second, you've been confusing your behavior, what you've done, thoughts, feelings, actions. You've been confusing all of that as if it's part of your identity, as if it's part of who you are. So you've been identifying yourself because I do those things, that means that's who I am. Do you follow me with that? But what if you're not what you do? What if that's just stuff you've done and that's not your identity? Right. If I introduce myself and I'm Dr. Q. No, that's not who I am. That's my name. Well, if I say, well, I'm a therapist. No, that's not who I am. That's what I do. Right. Like the who are you? Question can go in lots of ways. Right. But what happened is she was over identifying those behaviors as if it's part of who she is. Make sense. So if a woman walks in the door and she says, hi, my name is Sally, I'm five foot two and I'm shy. If Sally is thinking about her shyness in the same way she relates to her height, can she change it?
[47:20] B: No.
[47:21] A: No. But is her shyness the same thing as her height?
[47:25] B: No.
[47:26] A: No. It definitely affects how she feels. Probably thinks and acts, but it's not part of who she is. So the thing that you've been doing is that because I did bad things, that means I'm a bad person. That's who I am. You've been confusing the bad things you've done as if it's part of my identity, who I am. Makes sense.
[47:47] B: Yes.
[47:47] A: But you weren't ever that. That was just shit that you were doing when you were in the cage.
[47:56] B: I was.
[47:57] A: Do you follow me with that?
[47:59] B: Yes.
[48:00] A: Like you weren't under your own volition or whatever the words are that they call it. You were in the trance. Make sense.
[48:12] B: Yes.
[48:13] A: Where there was happening drug, other, like, I mean, all sorts of stuff was going on at different times.
[48:20] B: Yes.
[48:21] A: You follow me with that. And so that's what's been going on is twofold. One, you've been confusing those actions as if it's my identity. Right. I had another guy who did a home invasion, tied up parents in front of their kids, beat the parents in front of the kids, and he felt horrible about himself. He's like, I am a piece of. Yeah, well, I mean, is that going to help him do better in life? Atoning for his sins, like. No. Right. Him being okay doesn't mean any of the fucked up shit that he did was okay. But he's going to be a better citizen without having all that guilt and grief. Does that make sense? He's going to be a better person because he's not constantly in that state of. So you can conceive of having not done it thinking that it would have been better now if you hadn't. You also have been confusing what you did as if it's part of my identity.
[49:22] B: Well, there's two things.
[49:24] A: Now we got it right.
[49:25] B: Yes.
[49:26] A: Now you're getting there. Good now we get these things cleared up.
[49:28] B: Well, one of the problems I have is that, yes, I follow you. And then part of the reason why I feel like I can't conceive not doing the things, though. And those things all had to happen for me to be here because of my children. Like, if I would have never went with him, then I wouldn't have my children, which is like. But then I also wouldn't have been with him.
[49:52] A: Right.
[49:53] B: You know what I mean? But my chill. I have my children, though.
[49:55] A: Yeah. Right.
[49:57] B: So that's number one. And then number two, I'm just, like, realizing. And then, like, this week, we have this thing called Ending the game.
[50:09] A: Yeah.
[50:09] B: Have you heard of it?
[50:10] A: Yeah.
[50:11] B: And it was talking about, like, the names. And like, I. My name. Like, okay, so my name was changed to his name. And then, like, when I was working, like, I.
[50:27] A: Your name was changed to his name?
[50:29] B: Yes, legally, my name. My last name.
[50:33] A: Oh, your last name. Okay. My never.
[50:36] B: Yeah.
[50:36] A: I'm thinking, yes, Bruce. I was Bruce on the street. Like, what? Really?
[50:40] B: Like, that's what.
[50:41] A: No.
[50:41] B: Yes. Yes, though. Yes. No, wait, hold on.
[50:46] A: His last. No, no.
[50:47] B: Yes.
[50:47] A: Yes. No, you're right.
[50:48] B: But I'm talking about something else right now. So my last name is his first name.
[50:53] A: Got it.
[50:54] B: Which totally makes sense. Yes. When I was working, he had me working under his pimp name.
[51:04] A: Yeah. Right.
[51:06] B: And so, like, I was that possession. And like. Like, yeah, like, I was. I don't want to say I was him. I don't know. I don't know.
[51:20] A: But yes, you were being called by his name.
[51:23] B: Yes. And, you know, it's all over me. Yes.
[51:28] A: It's all over you.
[51:29] B: Yeah.
[51:30] A: Right? You got tattoos of his name. Yeah. That's fun.
[51:33] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[51:36] A: Okay.
[51:37] B: A bunch of them. It's not funny. I just.
[51:40] A: Stop.
[51:41] B: It's not.
[51:42] A: No.
[51:43] B: There's so many. It's like, what is wrong with me? Or what was wrong with me? Like, yeah, there's a bunch of them.
[51:51] A: Yeah.
[51:51] B: Like, I'm ruined.
[51:53] A: I don't know about that.
[51:54] B: Yes.
[51:54] A: I don't know whether you're ruined. I think you're an amazing. I do. I think you're amazing. I do. I am so proud of the amount of change you've done in a really, really short period of time. Right from when you first came in to where you are now. Right where I finally had a chance to pause and reflect. I'm not in states of high emotion all the time, although I might pop in every once in a while, but I'm not in it non stop. Right. You ask. Why would I do. High emotion is low intelligence.
[52:34] B: But like, come on.
[52:36] A: But it's also like, I am for you and I prove it by. Makes sense. And on his world, you didn't know at the time that on his world, that was tattooing his property. Makes sense.
[52:57] B: Yes.
[52:57] A: That's why they put the, you know, thing in the cow.
[53:00] B: Yes.
[53:01] A: Right. Or because, you know, that's my cow.
[53:04] B: Yes, yes.
[53:10] A: Yes. Yeah.
[53:11] B: Yeah.
[53:12] A: But it's like, right?
[53:13] B: It's a lot.
[53:15] A: I bet it's a lot. I bet it was now, like.
[53:20] B: Yeah, I want to, like, get a skin transplant. Like, I can't do that, though.
[53:25] A: Well, I mean, there might be things that can get done at some point.
[53:28] B: Yeah.
[53:29] A: Around all of that.
[53:30] B: Yeah.
[53:31] A: Right.
[53:31] B: I mean, okay. Yes. Yes.
[53:37] A: I mean, is at least a cool name.
[53:39] B: It's like a bunch of them. There was a bunch of different names. Like.
[53:42] A: Oh, he had a bunch of different names.
[53:43] B: Yeah. Cool.
[53:44] A: So you just. You just have a bunch of different.
[53:46] B: Yes.
[53:47] A: Names on your pod.
[53:48] B: Literally.
[53:48] A: That's so awesome.
[53:50] B: Yes. It's so funny.
[53:52] A: It's so stupid. You could just put a whole bunch of other names on now.
[53:55] B: No.
[53:59] A: I just got a whole bunch of. Just different names. All sorts of names.
[54:03] B: It makes no sense. I. It makes no sense.
[54:07] A: Yeah. Yeah. You were pretty screwed up then, weren't you?
[54:11] B: Yes.
[54:11] A: Yeah. I notice you're not so screwed up now.
[54:17] B: No. But now it's like, it's scary to think that I was that messed up.
[54:23] A: But the first step is to get really excited.
[54:25] B: Okay.
[54:28] A: That I'm not that anymore.
[54:29] B: Yes.
[54:29] A: No, Definitely stuck in that.
[54:31] B: Yes.
[54:31] A: And that. That was never me. That was just stuff that did and happened to me.
[54:35] B: But it's like, especially with the tattoos, it's, you know, it's. They're still there. Like, it's. I got. I was convinced.
[54:52] A: You were.
[54:52] B: That when. When I was with him.
[54:59] A: Yeah.
[54:59] B: Okay. He was married and, like, that's what I met his younger kids and it was like my job to, like. Like, he pulled me into that family.
[55:11] A: Yeah.
[55:12] B: And like, I was convinced that, like, that was my family.
[55:17] A: Yeah.
[55:17] B: And I got like, their names tattooed on me. Like, even.
[55:23] A: Her, which is like his wife. Yes. Yeah.
[55:27] B: Who does that? Who does that?
[55:30] A: I don't know. Somebody who's really wanting family, but somebody.
[55:34] B: Who is like, what is wrong with you?
[55:36] A: Who really wanted.
[55:37] B: And then she ended up leaving.
[55:40] A: Unfortunately. She didn't take the tattoo with her.
[55:42] B: No, she didn't. Like, who does that?
[55:50] A: Yeah. Well, right. Somebody who is really wanting family. And wanting to show how much family matters because, you know, I mean, you had a really good family growing up.
[56:01] B: I mean, I. I did. I was, you know, me and my parents. I thought it was normal. Like, my parents are normal. I don't know.
[56:18] A: There wasn't always normal stuff happening growing up.
[56:21] B: I don't know. I felt like it was normal.
[56:24] A: Yes. You didn't know any different. Right. You don't know any different when you're growing up in the household that you're growing up in, because you're not growing up in somebody else's household. So, of course, mine seems normal. What if it's not normal? Right. There's. There is stuff that was going on. Right. As we put it, that led you to be in a position that groomed him, taking you make sense. That was all growing up still. That's just normal.
[57:07] B: Yeah.
[57:08] A: Okay, let's get off that for a moment. But again, if we think of you being more. Okay. Is the stuff that you're upset that you did, the tattoos?
[57:21] B: No. Yes. That's part of it. That was just me being dumb. But, like, that's me.
[57:26] A: Okay.
[57:27] B: I ruined my body. Okay. That's me, though. I'm, you know, I'm allowed to punish myself. Myself. And like, you know, but like, the.
[57:33] A: Catholic Church believes in atonement as well.
[57:37] B: The other people that were hurt.
[57:40] A: Yeah.
[57:41] B: That I now, because at the time, I'm thinking, just like me, they are here by choice. It's a choice.
[57:47] A: Everyone's right.
[57:49] B: Made this choice. We're all here.
[57:51] A: Right.
[57:51] B: Everyone needs to do what they're supposed to do.
[57:54] A: That's right.
[57:54] B: Because we all made the choice to be here.
[57:56] A: Right.
[57:56] B: And so we need to do what.
[57:58] A: We'Re supposed to do. That's right. And you helped enforce people doing what they were supposed to do.
[58:03] B: I mean, kind of. Yes.
[58:05] A: Right. Because of your position.
[58:08] B: Kind of.
[58:08] A: Yes.
[58:09] B: Yes.
[58:10] A: Right.
[58:10] B: Yes, I did.
[58:11] A: Right. Did you get that?
[58:12] B: Yes, I did it.
[58:13] A: Yeah. Because of the role that you were playing. Yes. Right. Did you know that they've done a study where they take a group of college kids and they make some of them prisoners and some of them prison guards?
[58:29] B: Yes.
[58:30] A: And it doesn't matter who's in which spot.
[58:33] B: Oh, I don't know about that one. Is that the one when, like, one person really is in on it and they start treating the prisoners really bad and then all the people start doing it, too?
[58:42] A: Yeah. Like group mob mentality. All sorts of things that. When you're in a position of authority. You follow? Right.
[58:51] B: Or like the Buzzer one Yeah, right.
[58:53] A: They do that with, like, you know, people who fell in line with Hitler and other things.
[58:58] B: Okay, but I know about that. Right. I've heard about this. But. But I knew about it then.
[59:04] A: I don't think you did.
[59:06] B: I mean, I used to be fascinated by, like, forensic psychology.
[59:10] A: I know.
[59:11] B: How did I not know that I was with, like, a psychopath.
[59:15] A: The only way that it works, right? The only way that it works is that you don't know that you're in it.
[59:22] B: But, like, I'm gonna say, like, I used to, like, research.
[59:27] A: It was fascinating to me.
[59:29] B: Like, the Mafia and like, all these other. It was fascinating to me. Like.
[59:33] A: Sure it was.
[59:33] B: And then I'm just, like, with a person that is, like, all these personality traits that are like a psychopath or sociopath or whatever you want to call it. Like, what is that? I should have known.
[59:52] A: Not if I get into it without knowing and then I don't see it until I'm already in.
[59:58] B: Okay.
[60:00] A: Which is the thing that happened.
[60:02] B: Okay.
[60:03] A: Right. That. That's because I came from a lot of other stuff, and so my lens was here.
[60:08] B: Yes.
[60:09] A: So I didn't see anything until it was. Then I was already in.
[60:13] B: Yes.
[60:15] A: Makes sense.
[60:15] B: That makes sense. Yes.
[60:16] A: So again, you did the. You can conceive of having not done it.
[60:23] B: Yes.
[60:23] A: So your brain is trying to motivate you to get you to stop doing it.
[60:28] B: Okay. Oh, that makes sense.
[60:30] A: It just doesn't know that you've stopped doing it.
[60:33] B: Okay.
[60:34] A: Right. So stop hurting those people. Well, I'm not hurting those people. Right, well, stop making them get in line and do what they're supposed to. I'm not making them get in line into it. They're supposed to. Well, then stop that from happening. See, that's not happening.
[60:49] B: That's not happening.
[60:49] A: Yeah. So then where is it? Satan no longer exists.
[60:52] B: It no longer exists. But what if these people are, like, I know for sure. There's a person who, like, after all of this whole situation, she has aids, like.
[61:11] A: Yes. Right.
[61:12] B: And other people that are clearly, like, affected by it, like their families.
[61:18] A: Yeah. That's not what you set out for.
[61:21] B: No, no.
[61:23] A: Do you follow me with that? You didn't go, all right, we'll go do that thing and get connected with that guy that's got this. And then. That's not what. No, I didn't make sense. So you were complicit, but you were complicit because of what they used to call Stockholm syndrome. You heard that term before?
[61:44] B: Yes, I have.
[61:45] A: Right. That's what they used to call it, but it's being at the effect of. It's trauma bonding.
[61:56] B: Okay.
[61:57] A: And that's what led you to do the things that you did that you're not happy about having done.
[62:04] B: Okay, what next? Hold on. All right, so let's set that aside. The sex trafficking section. All right, let's. Okay, you're right. What about all this stuff and just the. What do we call this? Normal trafficking? Like, what is this section?
[62:23] A: What do you mean? Stealing? Robbing?
[62:25] B: Yeah, basically. I mean. Well, no, but, like. Okay, like, false documentation. What? Like, I don't even know. Like, what do you call it? Photoshopping stuff. Documents filling out forms. Like.
[62:56] A: Like fraud stuff?
[62:57] B: Yes. Fraud.
[62:58] A: Yeah.
[62:59] B: Tax evasion. I owe the IRS so much money. He filed taxes under my thing or something. I owe them, like, a lot. Like.
[63:13] A: Right. You didn't know, did you?
[63:14] B: I did not know. I did not know.
[63:17] A: Right, you didn't know. Right. And you were complicit.
[63:22] B: Yes. Well, okay.
[63:24] A: Yes, because of Fawn.
[63:26] B: Okay, but say and. And sorry. And I should know this from my packets. And I don't know, like, I did all those other things, and then at the time, you know, he wasn't as violent in those times, so it was like, you know, like I told you, like, in the first five years, it was. That was more of, like, the training experience, I guess. And then after Training Day. Yes, training day for 365 days for five years. And then after that, then what is that? Like, what is that? Like, I still did the things. It's not like I was happy about it, or I was like, hey, I have an idea. Let's do this. But, like, if he told me to do something, I did it.
[64:24] A: Correct. You get it?
[64:25] B: Yes, I do get it.
[64:26] A: That's what I mean by. You were complicit. Yes, because you had no ability to not. You weren't coming up with the ideas.
[64:35] B: But what if I did come up with an idea?
[64:37] A: Of course you would. Every once in a while. Duh.
[64:42] B: Oh, my gosh.
[64:43] A: Okay, yes, because you're in cahoots with the guy.
[64:47] B: Okay.
[64:48] A: But not because you're going, hey, this is. I'm in the city. Of course.
[64:52] B: But, like, this is what makes me feel like everything is my fault and I'm a terrible person and like, everyone. Because even though all this stuff happened, it's gonna be, oh, Austin did this one thing and actually is all her fault, and she doesn't deserve any of this. Let's just send her to prison and Then she never gets to see her kids again, and she never gets to heal. She just gets to be like, good.
[65:11] A: Thing we took the plea.
[65:13] B: Well, no, I mean, there's more stuff out there. Who knows if they're not gonna ever come back for the other stuff.
[65:18] A: Yeah. So if you're in a situation and that's the stuff that you're doing, of course those things come to mind to do. Why wouldn't it? Cause I'm around it. Right. And it was really normalized.
[65:39] B: It was normal the world.
[65:42] A: You thought your childhood was fucking normal? What the fuck? Of course you would think this is normal. You've been. Yes. Totally hypnotized and totally the whole thing. Right.
[65:57] B: But that's, like, so good, Allison.
[66:00] A: It's so good. Right?
[66:03] B: But then that's what makes me feel so messed up right now, because it's like, what was going on. Like, how. How do I make sense of all of this now? It's very overwhelming.
[66:15] A: Well, the how you make sense of it now is I'm gaining space and distance.
[66:20] B: Okay.
[66:21] A: I didn't know that I was a puppet being puppeteered. So you didn't know that you had strings on you that were moving your arms and moving your mouth and that? Do you get it?
[66:36] B: I. Yes, I do.
[66:38] A: So, of course, to be pleasing to the person who's the puppet master, if I came up with an idea and it worked. But to get it.
[66:56] B: Yes, I get it in this instance. So let's go fast forward to, like, the wire fraud.
[67:00] A: Yeah.
[67:02] B: Like, at this point, though, I'm, like, done. Like, I. Yeah.
[67:06] A: You don't want to do it anymore?
[67:06] B: I don't want to do it. And I knew. I'm like, this is not a good idea. Like, clearly, like, you know, and of course, he told me, like, well, first of all, the first round, I didn't even know he did it. One of his friends came to him, was like, I can. And he's like, yeah, right.
[67:29] A: Get money from the government for ppp.
[67:31] B: Yeah, yeah. And then so. But he had, like, all these businesses. Businesses that he has been operating. And so it's like, in my mind, I could justify.
[67:45] A: Of course.
[67:46] B: Right, well, he has businesses. How do I know?
[67:50] A: Right?
[67:51] B: Except for they just, like, literally made one up and put it in my name. Like, literally just made it up. And again, could be justified as, oh, I was on one of his businesses. And then we got the money. So it was like, I was told, well, why would they give us the money if.
[68:08] A: Right. Do you see how they use that?
[68:10] B: Yeah.
[68:11] A: Backwards logic.
[68:12] B: Yes. Well, why?
[68:13] A: If it wasn't legit, they wouldn't have given it to you.
[68:15] B: Exactly. And then I got forgiven.
[68:17] A: Like, if the glove don't fit, you must have quit.
[68:19] B: And then it was forgiven. And then it was like, okay. And then it was like, oh, no, we need to apply for round two. And I did not want to do that.
[68:28] A: Right.
[68:29] B: I did not want to do that.
[68:30] A: Right.
[68:31] B: And then he kept getting on me about it, and like, he was just gonna do it himself.
[68:36] A: Right.
[68:37] B: And then I did it.
[68:39] A: Right. To get it.
[68:40] B: Yeah, I got it.
[68:41] A: What are you doing right now?
[68:43] B: Better than I was, to be completely honest. Literally. I mean. Yes.
[68:51] A: Right.
[68:52] B: I mean, and ask me how much of that money I saw. I mean, you know, it's not like it was like, oh, and I'm gonna go on a shopping spree like this. I felt like at least if I did it, at least I knew. At least I would know, I guess have a little bit more control over than him going like, I don't know what he's done with my name.
[69:15] A: Right.
[69:15] B: That's why he changed it. So I. I mean, I'm guessing that's why. Realizing now. So he. Because he switches his name around. So are you. He could just be like, oh, that's my wife. And, like, do stuff with my name.
[69:27] A: Right.
[69:28] B: You know?
[69:30] A: You get it?
[69:31] B: Yes, I get it.
[69:35] A: Right. And then you had never gotten it before, not because you're not smart and not because you didn't want to get it, but you didn't know you're the lobster in the boiling water. It didn't start off boiling.
[69:58] B: And then I figured always, like, if something did happen, and I was told if something ever happened, oh, he's like, gonna be the man. Like, he's brave. He's, you know, like, I am just the nanny. Like, I haven't done anything, you know, like, he is the person.
[70:20] A: I'll take the fall.
[70:22] B: Yes. But it also, in my mind, I'm not doing what he is doing.
[70:27] A: Right.
[70:27] B: Like, when all. When we got arrested on the state charges and they're telling me these things and talking about me in court, I'm like, who are they talking about? Like, I did not do these things.
[70:35] A: Like, to get it.
[70:37] B: Sorry.
[70:38] A: You get it?
[70:39] B: Yes.
[70:39] A: You didn't do those things. Right, Right. So just checking you right now. What are you noticing?
[70:52] B: It's scary that I did things that I didn't do. You know what I mean?
[70:57] A: So I want you to get this. It used to be the question, what's wrong with You. That's how people used to look at everything. And then as we educated people about trauma and all the effects of stuff, the new thing that we say is what happened to you. You. So because of what happened to you in the five years of boot camp, you didn't have a strong voice, you couldn't speak up. You had to do what he wanted, whether you wanted to or not. Sometimes you might preempt him, but you couldn't not do it. And that's why the hugest thing is when all things came out, you started exposing it. And that was the thing that let you free. That's the thing that got you free, is you exposed it right in that pool. And you want to start to feel really good about that. Right? Right. Because we're clear, you couldn't have not done those things then based on all the factors that were swirling around your life at that time. We don't have to like it that you did to get it that you couldn't have not. Right.
[72:26] B: I didn't like doing it, of course. Any of it.
[72:29] A: Right.
[72:30] B: Beginning to end.
[72:32] A: Right. And notice even as you're talking about it now, what are you noticing in you? You feel later, you do feel lighter. Your body's more. Okay.
[72:42] B: I'm glad I finally talked about it because I never ever have. And that is like terrible. That was just terrifying. I don't like hiding things.
[72:53] A: You can remember having done all that stuff, right?
[72:55] B: Yes.
[72:56] A: You can remember putting your sneaks on.
[72:57] B: Yes.
[72:58] A: Well, Allison, stop putting in your sneakers. Well, then stop doing that stuff.
[73:01] B: I'm not doing that. Right.
[73:03] A: You're not doing that stuff? Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[73:06] B: It no longer exists.
[73:07] A: That's right. That's right. Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Right. And what do you notice as you're thinking about? You still thinking we're a bad person? I mean, are we beginning to get that? You know, sometimes good people do bad shit because they're fucked up at the time. Right.
[73:44] B: I. I don't know what to think.
[73:46] A: You were in a screwed up situation that had you think the things that you were doing was normal.
[73:52] B: And like, it was my only choice.
[73:54] A: There was no choice, but it was normal.
[73:56] B: Yeah.
[73:56] A: Just like your childhood, totally normal.
[74:01] B: Yes. Yes.
[74:07] A: Totally. No bad things ever. Just everything's fine. You wear the LEGO computer, everything is awesome.
[74:18] B: Yes.
[74:21] A: Right. Notice how much more okay you are.
[74:25] B: Yes.
[74:25] A: Yeah. And that a good news thing. So when you share that's what they're asking and you have a broad context, there Are all those years that led to. And then there were the years that I had had little children and then had another one. And then there was the stroke. And then there was. And then it was the pandemic. And then everybody was. If you had businesses, you'd get money to keep your business. Like, oh, yeah, get it. He's got businesses. Okay. We do it. And they wanted to do it again. It seems a little shady. I think the other one wasn't shady, but I didn't know. This one seems really, really shady. Got it.
[75:09] B: Yeah.
[75:10] A: Yeah. Right. So it wasn't doing it out of your own volition. It was doing it out of. You were in a state of coercion. You just didn't know. That's what happens when there's that trauma bond and that trafficking. Can you. That's what's getting unplugged.
[75:34] B: Can you explain that to me? Like, what is trafficking? Like, what is. Like, sex trafficking seems straightforward, you know?
[75:46] A: Yeah.
[75:47] B: Like, what is trafficking?
[75:49] A: Same kind of thing. It's the controlling another person and making money off of it.
[75:55] B: Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah.
[76:02] A: And that's what was going on.
[76:03] B: Yeah.
[76:06] A: You were just playing your role.
[76:08] B: Yeah.
[76:08] A: You didn't know. You thought everybody was in it because they chose to be in it. Like, I chose to be in it. I didn't know. I didn't choose to be in it.
[76:14] B: Yes. Yeah, no. Yeah, totally.
[76:17] A: I mean, even so then I'd be like, yeah, no, you gotta get your shit done. Like, you gotta clean the toilets. You're trying to clean the door. Get fucking toilet clean.
[76:25] B: Yes.
[76:26] A: You followed me with that. Yeah. No, I mean, do your part. Yes, yeah, yeah. And you had helped enforce people doing their part.
[76:37] B: Yeah.
[76:38] A: But you were complicit because you didn't know.
[76:45] B: Yeah.
[76:46] A: Right. And that's more clear now.
[76:49] B: And I was under the impression I didn't. I mean, I don't know what happened with him and the other people, but I never imagined it would be like it was with me. But I don't know if it was.
[76:59] A: Right. Who knows? You have no idea.
[77:04] B: Like, I. I mean, and I thought I was, like, helping them.
[77:10] A: Right, right.
[77:12] B: To deal with him.
[77:13] A: Right. You were trying to mitigate so that he didn't get violent with them.
[77:18] B: But that just sounds like an excuse.
[77:20] A: I don't know whether it is, because.
[77:23] B: I really don't want to hurt people.
[77:25] A: But wasn't that part of it?
[77:27] B: Hurting people?
[77:28] A: No. You wanting to not hurt people is part of your directing them to do the shit.
[77:33] B: That's true.
[77:34] A: Because your Wrath wasn't as bad as his. Heck, you got wrath whether you came home with enough or not. Sometimes. What the fuck? I mean, right? Like, if we think about it, I got it all. All right, let's do this up weird shit again. What? I thought I had to do the fucked up virtue if I didn't meet quota. Yes, yes. Right.
[78:00] B: And that's. I guess that's part of it too is I'm afraid that when I start talking, it's just gonna sound like, oh, this girl is just blaming him for everything.
[78:10] A: Like, I didn't hear that.
[78:12] B: You didn't hear it? This.
[78:16] A: I didn't hear you as you were telling me about it.
[78:19] B: Okay.
[78:20] A: I didn't hear you blaming him. Oh, nothing of what you said was blaming him.
[78:27] B: Okay. Cuz if I don't take full responsibility for things, it makes me feel like I'm blaming somebody.
[78:34] A: You. But you did take full responsibility. I'm the one that was making sure they got their shit done. That's taking on responsibility. You're the one that did that. You were under a faulty impression. Some of it was making sure that they didn't hear the wrath. Some of it was to make it easier. So you also don't hear the wrath. And like, do you follow me with that?
[79:03] B: Yes, I do.
[79:04] A: Right. So that's not blaming him. There's nothing in that that's blaming him. It's. You were doing what you're doing to survive and make it through it.
[79:15] B: And with the money, like it was his money. Like in my. I didn't even realize that concept of how weird that or messed up or whatever. Like, if I'm getting money from them to give to him.
[79:29] A: Right.
[79:30] B: It's his money.
[79:31] A: Right. Weird, right?
[79:33] B: Like while they have it, just like while I had it, even if it's in. So if I am with someone and they have money in their pocket, that's his money, I have to get that money and give it to him.
[79:45] A: I know, is that weird?
[79:46] B: Yes, but do you. Like, I just took that thought for granted.
[79:50] A: Of course.
[79:51] B: Like, so if I'm getting money from somebody to give to him, it's his.
[79:55] A: Because that's what he trained you.
[79:56] B: Yes, but it's not like I'm giving it to him. Like I am some. I never ever thought of myself as like on some pedestal or something. I have some special job. If anything, I thought that I had like the worst job.
[80:10] A: Right.
[80:10] B: Even though it might seem like there's some hierarchy or something. I was like the bot on the bottom of the shoe. You know what I mean?
[80:18] A: I get that.
[80:19] B: So I'm not thinking, oh, like, I'm better than somebody. I have some. But, like, when they were talking about it, like, with the charges and stuff like that. Before I spoke to her. Yeah, that's what it sounds like. Like I'm helping run the show or something.
[80:35] A: No, it was all. You were getting money for him.
[80:38] B: Yes, I wasn't.
[80:40] A: It was never our money. No, it was his money. No. Yes. You get that?
[80:44] B: Yes, I do get that.
[80:46] A: And you're being really clear.
[80:49] B: Like, he was from day one to 2007. Whatever. To March 24, 2024, or to March 14. Excuse me. He was my pen.
[81:02] A: Right.
[81:03] B: Like, I never thought of it. Like, right. This husband. Whatever he was trying to. After he had the stroke, all of a sudden. Oh, that's my. My wife. Like, really. No, I never thought of it like that.
[81:14] A: No, of course not.
[81:15] B: The entire time, he was my pet. Like, even when I wasn't.
[81:19] A: Right.
[81:20] B: You know, doing dates or whatever.
[81:22] A: Right. Which would explain why you got tattooed lots of different names.
[81:26] B: Yes.
[81:27] A: Do you get that?
[81:28] B: I do get it. I'm just mad at myself for doing it.
[81:30] A: Oh, well, now I have to look at him. Well, let's get you lightened up about that so that they're not so mad at you.
[81:36] B: How are we gonna do that?
[81:39] A: You're mad at you because you can conceive of having not done it.
[81:43] B: Yes, but it's like something I have to look at. It's not like the other stuff where I would just be like.
[81:48] A: But you're mad at you because you can conceive of having not done it, but based in the role that you were in and that he was your pimp, you couldn't have not done that then. And the anger when you see it is your emotional brain trying to motivate you to get. Get you to stop doing it. So if I were to simply say, stop getting that tattoo on your back, you'd say, I'm not getting the tattoo on my back or on my arm or wherever the hell they are.
[82:17] B: They're everywhere.
[82:18] A: Well, in different places.
[82:19] B: Yes.
[82:19] A: Like, think of one place. My feet stop getting that tattoo. Hurry. I can't say I'm not getting that.
[82:26] B: I'm not getting that tattoo.
[82:27] A: Right. No, stop her from doing that. Say, she's not doing that.
[82:30] B: She's not doing that.
[82:30] A: No. Hurry. Stop her. Quick. Come on, we'll go stop her. Come on, let's go. Oh, well. Get Morgan. Come on. We'll try fast. What do you notice happening.
[82:42] B: It's not that serious anymore.
[82:45] A: It's not so serious anymore. Right. We want the whole thing to lighten up. And we want them to lighten up. Right? So that you get to become more okay in you. We're not there yet. No, Cotton, but we're on our way.
[83:01] B: Yeah.
[83:02] A: I mean, think about it. We've only gotten together for what, one, like, five hours maybe? We've gotten pretty far, don't you think?
[83:16] B: Yeah, we have.
[83:19] A: So we're on our way to getting you to be more okay and comfortable in your own skin, regardless of what names are on your body.
[83:27] B: Mm.
[83:27] A: Okay. That's where we're headed. We're just not there yet. Got it?
[83:31] B: Yes.
[83:31] A: And that's what we want, is you to be more okay.
[83:35] B: Yes.
[83:38] A: Cool. You did great today.
[83:39] B: Thank you.
[83:40] A: You're welcome. Come with me.
