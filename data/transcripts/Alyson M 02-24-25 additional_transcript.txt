[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 24th of February, Alison. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:15] B: Yes.
[00:16] A: Cool. So first, how did our last session leave you? What have you been noticing for yourself? How have things been?
[00:24] B: Well, I think that things went well. Like, you know, I felt a lot, you know, better going into the interview and like I completed it successfully. I mean, it was really hard. Like I had to go into depth about like my tattoos.
[00:42] A: Oh, wow. All the different names that he called himself.
[00:47] B: Yes. Which was like kind of hard to explain to the person.
[00:51] A: Not just to me, myself and I. Like, we're talking like multitudes.
[00:54] B: Yeah. She was like, who are these people? I'm like, same person and then same person.
[01:03] C: Right.
[01:03] B: Different aliases.
[01:05] C: Yeah.
[01:06] B: And I mean, I had to like talk about everything from like the preschool thing to everything. And so that was kind of hard.
[01:14] A: And then after that it was kind of hard.
[01:16] B: But I mean, it was very hard.
[01:18] A: It was. But it was different hard.
[01:21] B: Yes.
[01:22] A: Right. Notice how a lot of it, you weren't reliving it.
[01:26] B: Yes. I was just like explaining.
[01:28] A: You were describing difficult experiences that you have gone through.
[01:32] B: Yeah.
[01:32] A: And things that have happened to you. That happened to you. That happened to you. That happened to you. That led you to be in the place you were.
[01:40] B: Yes.
[01:41] A: Got it.
[01:42] B: That makes sense.
[01:43] A: But you weren't reliving it.
[01:44] B: No.
[01:45] A: Isn't that cool?
[01:46] B: Yes.
[01:47] A: Notice how different that is.
[01:48] B: Yeah.
[01:50] A: So cool.
[01:51] B: So this is the question I have, alright, so like the past week I've been like, wow, you know, I haven't really had any breakdowns in the past. Well, I stopped being able to sleep through the night, so I started taking my as needed meds every single night so I could sleep.
[02:09] A: That was while you were priming for saying that?
[02:12] B: No. Well, earlier this month that happened. And then after I saw Aaron and. And we talked about the whole revelation of the 17 year thing.
[02:22] A: What's that mean?
[02:23] B: Whenever I talk, whenever I talk to her. Before I came to you last time, I was like, wow, I didn't know I was trafficked for 17 years.
[02:31] A: Oh, the whole time?
[02:32] B: Yeah. That was like this like huge thing for me, you know?
[02:39] A: Is it so huge anymore?
[02:41] B: I don't know. That's what I was gonna ask you.
[02:43] A: You don't know, do you? Isn't that weird? Yeah. I mean, you would kind of think that you would know if it was still a huge thing.
[02:48] B: Well, that.
[02:49] A: So maybe the fact that you don't know whether it's still a huge thing might not mean it's a huge thing. Right.
[02:53] B: So that's what I'm wondering. So since I had the interview. Yeah. I've been like. Everything's kind of like. I haven't had a lot of breakdowns, but then, like, coming into. Going to the office today, I'm, like, tearing up and, like, having a lot of anxiety, and I'm like, is it actually okay, or was I, like, dissociating or. I don't know what's going on? So I don't know.
[03:14] A: Say more. As you were, knowing that you were coming here.
[03:17] B: Yeah. And just, like, talking about things, you know, because, like, I haven't, like, this past week, I haven't, you know, like, had any major in that goal. Breakdowns.
[03:28] A: Yeah.
[03:29] C: Right.
[03:30] B: Yeah.
[03:30] A: That's how much you're getting better.
[03:33] B: Okay. That's good. I didn't know. I mean, it's strange.
[03:37] A: It is. It's really different for you.
[03:39] B: Yeah.
[03:40] C: Right.
[03:41] A: But that's part of where you're becoming more okay in you.
[03:45] B: Okay.
[03:45] A: And for a lot of time, it hasn't been okay, A, to be you and B, to be in you. Do you follow me with that?
[03:55] B: Yes. Yeah.
[03:57] A: Like that.
[03:59] C: Right.
[03:59] A: It's. Why the first time when you got to Sayla, and all of a sudden there was a moment where I didn't have to be on high alert all the time. All of a sudden I had time, and then I was flooded with shit that I've done a good job trying to avoid because all of a sudden there was space and it filled it.
[04:20] C: Right.
[04:21] A: That was like the first time we ever got together. And then the subsequent stuff has been all about, A, seeing clearly, because I've got distance from it, both in a physical way and in an emotional way, what it actually was and what was going on then. And even beyond that, what was happening earlier in my life that left me vulnerable to a situation like that. Do you follow me with that? And so a lot of different pieces of the puzzle, which isolated, started to form together. And seeing it more clearly for what it was.
[05:04] B: Yes.
[05:05] A: Yeah. And unplugging the emotion attached to those moments.
[05:12] B: Yes.
[05:13] C: Right.
[05:13] A: So that we can actually laugh about the big pink whatever thing. Right. But I did it. I came back with the way you wanted. What the hell? We only had to do that when I did. Come on, man. Voila.
[05:29] C: Right.
[05:29] A: That wasn't something that you could Laugh about.
[05:31] B: No, absolutely not.
[05:37] A: And that's how much it's no longer affecting you.
[05:40] B: Okay.
[05:41] C: Right.
[05:42] A: That's how much more free you are from the effect this stuff has had.
[05:48] C: Right.
[05:49] A: It's why you were able to recount and talk about really uncomfortable things. And a lot of it that led to all of.
[06:03] C: Right.
[06:04] A: But you noticed when you were doing it, you were present as you were recalling historical information. There might have been moments where I might have flirted with it, but I was much better at being back here.
[06:22] C: Right.
[06:22] A: And that was just one more way of your unconscious letting you know how much you've changed. Because if we hadn't done any of this stuff, there's no way you would have done that.
[06:33] B: Yeah.
[06:35] A: You follow me?
[06:37] B: Yeah.
[06:38] A: Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah. So then what kind of shows up for today?
[06:48] B: Well, I just had some questions. Okay. So you know how we've talked about, like, I was a different person. I was in a different. Like, my brain was different or whatever. So question. But how, like, relating to my children and, like. Like, I homeschooled them and, like, I was able to do stuff like I went to school and stuff like that.
[07:17] A: Yeah.
[07:18] B: But how was I able to do that?
[07:20] A: Isn't that cool? Like, how really resourceful you are that despite all of that other stuff ongoingly happening all around you and to you, you were able to do those other things.
[07:36] B: Okay. Because in my mind, I am like, is that amazing? Able to do those things? So it really wasn't, you know, not.
[07:44] A: Bad or something, Remember.
[07:47] C: Right.
[07:47] A: They were in for you. Different locations, different compartments, different rooms. Yes, that makes sense. So in this room, we're doing these things, and this is what does. And I'm doing this thing. Those other things are happening, but I'm doing.
[08:08] C: Right.
[08:09] A: Those were the arenas that you felt you also had more say and that. That was really up to you.
[08:18] C: Right.
[08:18] A: It wasn't like he's saying, you got a homeschool. You decided that.
[08:27] C: Right.
[08:27] A: And that had you be engaged and had you have some other forms of purpose and passion, because the other was not purposeful or passion.
[08:37] B: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[08:41] C: Right.
[08:42] A: And that was also when it transitioned to it being different, but same. Still under the web of control, but different because I'm not the one going to the club every night because I'm doing this other thing.
[08:54] B: Yeah.
[08:55] A: Does that make sense?
[08:56] B: Yes.
[08:57] A: But still under the control that you didn't know you were under the control because for the longest time you're like, I didn't last that long. Oh, it Was the whole time. Son of a. Kill it all. No way, man.
[09:12] B: Yeah, because, like, I was talking to Deb about, like. Like the role of a bottom or whatever and.
[09:21] C: Right.
[09:23] B: I never. I didn't realize that that was like, a thing, like the whole, you know.
[09:29] C: Sure.
[09:30] B: Time. Like, I thought that after that five years was up, like, I was out of that.
[09:33] C: Yeah.
[09:34] B: I didn't realize.
[09:35] C: Yeah, right.
[09:37] A: You know, it was still part of the same thing. Transactionary, controlled. It was different. That daily thing wasn't happening as often, but I was still part of the same machinery because I was telling the other people to.
[09:55] C: Right.
[09:55] A: And not because I thought I was better than them, but because we all know that it's better when we don't want to upset him. Even when he planned out a stroke. My goodness. I know. The guy had so much power that even when he had a stroke and was left debilitated and couldn't do for himself, he had us there doing for him.
[10:19] C: Right, Right.
[10:21] A: Because in you, that was a loving act to do to somebody that you were tricked into thinking you were in love with. That crazy. Not because you don't know how to love or be loving. Not that if it's with somebody that's, like, nice to you and good with you and all that stuff, you wouldn't want to be that way with them. Do you follow me with that? Like, that's exactly how do you want somebody to be. You just didn't know what it was. Does that make sense?
[10:54] B: Yes.
[10:54] A: Yeah. Now that you see it clearly, what do you notice?
[11:02] B: I just have, like, a different feeling about it.
[11:05] A: You do, don't you?
[11:06] B: I don't really know what it is. It's just like. I guess it's a sense of, like. I felt like I was accepting it, you know, from the last time I talked to you. And then I talked to Aaron about it again. And then I felt like I was kind of going. Like. I felt like if I kept talking about it, it would change, you know? It's not gonna change. It's the past. But. Yeah, it's like I feel. I don't know how to explain it. Like, I am accepting it, I guess.
[11:40] A: Your relationship with. It's changed. Before, it was something that was active and hurting. Now it's been unplugged and it's no longer hurting.
[11:58] B: Yeah. Like, it feels like it's the past now.
[12:00] A: It's.
[12:01] C: Yeah.
[12:01] A: You get that? It's a data point information about a up thing that happened to me back then. Glad I already finished that one. Good thing. That one's over now. Awesome. That makes me happier. That's better for me.
[12:21] C: Yeah. Right.
[12:23] A: Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah. You're lightening up on you. Yeah.
[12:33] C: Right.
[12:33] A: It's not doing the same thing that it did.
[12:36] B: No.
[12:37] C: Yeah.
[12:38] A: It's not feeling like it means anything about your worth or lovability.
[12:46] B: I feel. I mean, I definitely feel like I've been, like, able to open up more to other people and just, like, without having to question everything I say and do and, you know.
[12:57] A: Oh, you've been finding yourself more present.
[13:00] B: Yes.
[13:01] A: In the conversations. Isn't that cool?
[13:03] B: Yes.
[13:04] C: Huh.
[13:05] A: That's a nice feeling.
[13:07] B: Yes.
[13:07] A: Good job. Oh, that's awesome. Good for you.
[13:10] B: Yeah. I haven't been going, like, back to that, like, time, I guess I just. That was scary for me when I started feeling. I. I'm pretty sure from the last time I was here, I talked to you about it. Like, we're. I don't know, I just had, like, this panic and I had these feelings, and I felt like I was going back then, and I didn't want to go to that. And it was just scary for me to have those feelings because, like, clearly I had that fear then, and I didn't know, like, to that extreme that that was happening right at the time.
[13:51] C: Right, right.
[13:54] A: So the sensations were familiar.
[13:57] B: Yes.
[13:58] C: Right.
[13:59] A: And the concern was, because I'm having the sensations, that means I'm gonna be back in that.
[14:04] B: Yes. And when I was there, I must have been really scared. And I knew that, like, thinking back and remembering those times, I knew I was scared, but, like, having those sensations where it's like, I'm shaking and I'm, you know, like, terrified. Just those. Those things tell me that that was real.
[14:26] C: You know what I mean?
[14:27] B: Back then, it was like, it's not just, I'm not overreacting in my mind about the situation or, like, it's proof to me that it was a real thing and it was scary.
[14:38] A: It was.
[14:39] C: Right.
[14:39] A: And that's what activated Fawn, which is to avoid as much as I can and getting hurt and being affectionate and loving towards person that I'm scared about getting hurt from. That's what it does.
[15:02] B: Okay.
[15:03] A: Yeah. That's the way that that mechanism runs. That's all survival.
[15:09] C: Right.
[15:10] A: And so your ability, we call it disassociate, we could call it compartmentalize. That's been part of the superpower to make it through awful things was to be out of my body, to be able to put things back so I could, like, Focus on doing homeschooling with the kids. I could be doing my own schooling too.
[15:34] C: Right.
[15:34] A: I was able to kind of focus that. That's a superpower. Right. And we're harnessing it so it's intentional and on purpose.
[15:49] C: All right.
[15:49] A: I used to do that with running. I go out for a jog. First seven minutes of the jog, maybe not. Maybe first four to five minutes of the jog. My internal dialogue is, I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. I hate this. I don't want to. This is stupid. I'm tired. I'm hurting. My knee hurts, my leg hurts, my back hurts, my hip hurts. I don't want to do this. It's hot, it's cold, it's. And then after the first five minutes or so, then it would click off. I'd be out, my body would run.
[16:21] C: Right.
[16:22] A: So being able to do something like that on purpose and intentional is useful.
[16:27] C: Right.
[16:27] A: So it's a superpower that you can become hyper focused on whatever it is that you're doing.
[16:35] B: Okay.
[16:36] C: Right.
[16:37] B: So there's, like, a healthy way to do it, basically.
[16:38] A: Yeah. So in anything that you're interested in learning, you can be all about it. It, drink it, sleep it, should it, consume it, be consumed by it.
[16:46] B: Okay.
[16:47] A: And that's a superpower.
[16:48] B: Okay.
[16:51] C: Yeah.
[16:51] A: And it's about being able to zoom in and zoom out. So I can be all about it while I'm in that, and then I can be on to other things.
[17:01] C: Yeah.
[17:02] A: So that's cool. Okay. So how was it, given that you had to talk about all the different names? Cause that's something that we. How was it talking about all the different names?
[17:13] B: I didn't like it. I don't. It's still, as we talked about before, that is really hard for me to get my mind around. Yeah, I think I kind of. It dawned upon me, I guess, like, with the fawn thing, what if you.
[17:30] A: Didn'T have to get your mind around it?
[17:32] B: Because I just hate it so much and, like, it doesn't matter. Even if I was like, oh, what.
[17:37] A: If what didn't matter actually didn't matter?
[17:39] B: It did. Well, okay. I did tell myself that it didn't matter.
[17:42] A: I know, but you can't tell yourself things because then you don't believe them. And it doesn't mean anything because anybody does.
[17:48] B: That's true.
[17:49] A: That's how it works. So I try to tell myself stuff. It doesn't work that way.
[17:53] B: Well, I try to pretend like it didn't matter, but then it's like it's my body.
[17:58] A: But that's what you were just pretending that it didn't matter. That doesn't mean that it didn't matter.
[18:03] C: Right.
[18:05] B: So it does matter, or it doesn't matter.
[18:07] A: Isn't that interesting? You're not sure, are you? Maybe it's both and the better of the combination.
[18:17] C: Right?
[18:18] B: I don't know.
[18:19] C: You don't know, do you?
[18:20] A: But how's your body feeling?
[18:24] B: Tense.
[18:25] A: Oh, it's tense. That's right. Because we want to be intentional about getting this thing shifted. Because would it be okay? Like, it's the one thing that's still stuck and I can't get my head around, like, how I would allow all these different names to get tattooed on me. That's the same guy. So have you ever heard this phrase before? Everybody's behavior makes sense to them or they wouldn't do it?
[19:03] B: No, I haven't heard of it.
[19:04] A: So we can understand other people's behavior based on everybody's behavior makes sense to them or they wouldn't do it. So in order for you to have done that, the multitudes of different times that you did. Got it. You were doing it because at that time, it made sense for you to do it. Make sense.
[19:34] B: Yeah, it did at the time.
[19:35] A: It totally. That's right. It did, at the time, make total sense to do it. Yeah, that's right.
[19:43] C: Mm.
[19:45] A: That's right. It did make total sense to do it.
[19:48] C: Right.
[19:49] A: But now you're looking back at that, you. Right, thinking she should have known better, thinking she shouldn't have done that even.
[20:03] B: I mean, It's. It's like 11. 12 tattoos. Like. Yeah, one is like, okay, 11 or 12.
[20:11] A: Or is it. Which one is it? All right, it's 17.
[20:19] B: Wait, hold on.
[20:21] C: Yeah.
[20:29] B: It'S 11.
[20:30] A: There we go.
[20:30] C: Right?
[20:31] A: It's 11. See, I didn't get number 12. How cool is that? I could have got 12. I only got 11. I haven't been considering that.
[20:41] B: Who does that? Like, why it's so excessive?
[20:45] A: So check it out. What do you think must have been going on in that earlier, you back then, for that to have been the thing that makes sense for her to do.
[21:10] B: I guess. Please him, I guess. Prove something to him. I mean, I legitimately thought, like, it was forever, right.
[21:23] A: Please prove that he's mine or I'm his.
[21:28] B: He was not mine.
[21:31] A: Oh. Oh, isn't that interesting? Did she know that then?
[21:36] B: No. Well, I don't know.
[21:39] C: You don't know. Do you see?
[21:42] A: We know it from here that I'm yours. But she wasn't thinking that then. I'm proving I'm in this.
[22:09] C: Right.
[22:09] A: She wasn't thinking, oh, it means that he owns me. I'm property of his. Like, he signed his name on the mortgage. Do you follow me with that? Like that? You back then, when she was doing that wasn't going, oh, it's another way to reinforce, oh, he owns me for this, and he owns me for this. Like, that was not. Nah. Do you follow me with that? That's not what was going on then. What was going on then? She's proving that, like, I'm here for the long haul. I'm in this thing.
[22:46] C: I'm not going anywhere. Right.
[22:50] A: You matter to me. That's what was going on then. Do you follow me with that? And at that time, she didn't have a lot of other ways that she could think of that would show him that he matters, that I'm in it for the long haul. That, like, do you follow me with that?
[23:16] C: Right.
[23:17] A: So as you're getting this now, what do you notice?
[23:27] B: Um, I mean, it makes sense.
[23:33] A: It does start to make sense. And then we think of you being more okay in you, even though you did it because we can't get you to have not done it. So we could go, I can't be okay in me because I did it.
[23:48] C: Oh, oh, fuck.
[23:50] A: Okay. But we can't get you to have not done it. Would it be okay to be okay in you even if we can't get you to have not done it? Yeah.
[24:02] B: I think it's also, I guess, my mind frame at the time. Like, it's hard for me now, knowing what I know, to look back at that time and be like, how I must have felt about him versus now.
[24:19] A: Yeah. It's hard for you to get to what was going on with her for her to be having that kind of thought process.
[24:32] C: Right.
[24:33] A: And even before that, what must have gone on for her in her life that primed her to connect with a guy like that. That make sense?
[24:49] C: Yeah.
[24:51] A: And as you're thinking about all of that, where are you feeling the discomfort?
[24:58] B: My stomach. My back.
[25:00] C: Yeah.
[25:00] B: My shoulders.
[25:01] A: So what we want to do is just notice the sensations. Not the situation, just the sensation. Stomach, back, shoulders. Just notice how the sensations are changing. Get curious about it.
[25:23] C: All right.
[25:23] A: As you get curious about it, you can open your eyes big and bring in your frontal cortex. Because for all mammals, when they're learning new information, their eyes get big.
[25:37] C: Right.
[25:38] A: As you're curious, what do you notice happening at the sensation in your stomach, your back, your shoulders?
[25:45] B: It's going away.
[25:47] A: How so?
[25:49] B: It's just disappearing.
[25:52] A: Yeah, it's just like disappearing. Isn't that interesting?
[25:56] C: Right, Right.
[25:58] A: So we can think about it and know the different places that the 11 ones are. Any repeating names or. We get 11 different names.
[26:08] B: No, they're repeating so.
[26:12] A: Because we go, Jesus Christ. We didn't realize that that was a multiple personality disorder. I guess we get so now.
[26:27] C: Yeah.
[26:28] A: So think about that again. Get the feelings right. Notice the sensations. Get curious about the sensations.
[26:37] C: Right.
[26:37] A: Make your eyes big. Bring your frontal cortex. Stop holding your breath.
[26:44] B: I'm trying not to cry.
[26:46] C: I know.
[26:46] A: It's so good when people try not to cry. They hold their breath.
[26:50] B: Really?
[26:51] C: Yeah.
[26:52] A: And what has people stop crying is they breathe.
[26:56] B: That doesn't work for me.
[26:58] A: I think it does, because. Did you start crying? No. You started breathing. Okay, that's right, because I said, stop holding your breath.
[27:08] C: Right.
[27:08] A: And then you started breathing. Because we want you to be here. And so is there an aspect that you're mad at the earlier you.
[27:19] B: I mean. Yeah, like, I'm mad at her, I guess, for feeling that way about him and, like, being.
[27:31] A: Here's the funny part. You haven't been including yet.
[27:34] B: I. What?
[27:35] A: Here's the funny part that you haven't been including yet. You haven't been including how she must have been feeling about herself that you're not feeling anymore. So just check that out for a second, Allison. Just check that out. So you keep having it focused on what must have been going on with him, but what must have been going on in her and how she was feeling about herself then and how she felt about her own worth or lovability or value or. And just check how different it is right now than it was then for her. That's pretty different, isn't it?
[28:33] C: Right.
[28:34] A: Because if I said, hey, well, you know, I mean, we've done great work. Let's go to the tattoo place and get a Dr. Q on you. No, I'm good. I'm good. Actually, I might want to get something that I want to get, and maybe there might be things that I do.
[28:57] C: Right?
[28:58] A: Yeah.
[29:00] C: Right.
[29:01] A: So again, just check. What are you noticing now? Cause notice how things are teeter. Tottering.
[29:06] C: Right.
[29:07] B: It's just like, at that time, I guess I was just. I was doing everything that I thought that I could possibly do to, like, make him happy or please him or whatever.
[29:22] A: That's right.
[29:23] B: No matter how Hard I worked through.
[29:25] A: That's right. You didn't know that it wasn't dependent on what you did. See, that's the error. You did everything that you could do, even any of the other stuff, even the money stuff, even the things that you came up with, even all that stuff. Everything you did was to try to make him happy. And that's why it didn't compute. Because you do the thing that one time would make him happy, you do the same fucking thing the next time, and he'd be an asshole. Like, what the fuck, man? Can't win for. And then the next time would be. And then the. And then I did enough. What? Like, there was so much inconsistency.
[30:08] C: Because.
[30:08] A: You kept doing everything to make him happy.
[30:11] B: It was just the things I was doing. It's just like, to think I spent hours and hours and hours, like, doing disgusting things. Like, you know.
[30:26] A: Yes.
[30:26] B: Every day in a disgusting place. Like.
[30:31] A: Isn'T it really cool that you're not doing those disgusting things now?
[30:37] B: Yes.
[30:38] A: How different is your life now?
[30:40] B: It's much better.
[30:42] A: You're running. For the first time.
[30:51] C: You'Re running it.
[30:55] A: Isn't that cool? Yeah. And see, there have been other things that were going on well before meeting him that groomed it, that left you open, that left you vulnerable, that left you more susceptible than some. Do you follow me with that?
[31:22] C: Right.
[31:25] A: And as you know that check inside your body right now. How's your body feeling?
[31:36] B: Like it's letting go a little bit.
[31:39] A: It is, isn't it?
[31:41] C: Isn't that kind of interesting?
[31:43] A: Yeah. Does a moment come to mind Past negative earlier, Mom.
[32:02] B: I mean, they're kind of all bunched together at a certain level.
[32:05] A: They are, aren't they all bunched together? If we kind of separate and just get one of the bunch to be the spokesperson for the bunch, and then we'll take care of the bunch.
[32:16] B: It's really gross.
[32:18] C: Oh, we'll be here.
[32:19] A: I. I'm not gross. I'm fun. Okay, we're just gonna describe one of those things that happened way back in the then.
[32:27] C: Okay. Yeah.
[32:28] A: Well, you're here now with me because I'm fine. So then you were where?
[32:33] B: In Sarasota.
[32:34] C: Right.
[32:37] A: At the house in Sarasota. Right.
[32:39] C: Good.
[32:39] A: And then what happened? You're like, where in the house?
[32:42] B: Well, I stayed home from school. I was sick.
[32:45] C: Yeah, right.
[32:45] A: So you stayed home from school. You're sick, Right?
[32:47] B: I don't really know if I was actually sick.
[32:48] A: But you just stayed home because I was sick, right? Yeah.
[32:51] C: Right.
[32:52] B: And I went with this guy. Yeah, well, I went with him.
[32:59] C: Right.
[32:59] B: We were gonna do drugs or whatever. And then. So I went with them.
[33:05] C: Right.
[33:06] B: And there was this other guy with him.
[33:08] C: Right.
[33:09] A: Which you didn't know was going to be with him until you were. Started to go with him.
[33:12] B: Yeah.
[33:13] C: Right.
[33:13] B: And I went with him. And then.
[33:15] A: How you doing right now?
[33:18] B: My heart here.
[33:19] C: Hi. Hi.
[33:20] A: Be here. Have fun. And then notice how it's better when you get back here.
[33:29] B: And so you went to go do.
[33:31] A: The drugs, but they didn't have the drugs or you did do the drugs.
[33:34] B: I think we. I don't even remember.
[33:37] C: Right.
[33:37] B: We smoked or something.
[33:38] C: Right. Did the drugs, whatever.
[33:39] A: Smoke pot.
[33:42] B: And they're like probably around like 20 years old.
[33:49] C: Right.
[33:49] A: I mean, so they're older.
[33:50] B: Maybe older than that.
[33:51] C: Right.
[33:51] B: I was probably like 13.
[33:53] C: Right.
[33:54] B: Okay. So sorry. Okay. I went with them, we smoked and then somehow I had to do oral on them. Yes. One of them. And then, like, why I had to do that? Then the other one put his penis in my vagina.
[34:15] C: Yes.
[34:15] B: But before that. This is the gross part.
[34:18] C: Right.
[34:19] B: I was on my period.
[34:21] C: Right.
[34:21] A: And he pulled the tampon out. Yes.
[34:24] C: Right.
[34:25] B: And.
[34:25] A: And there was blood on it.
[34:26] B: I mean, I don't know. I didn't see it.
[34:28] A: Right, well, it got pulled out.
[34:29] C: Right?
[34:30] B: Yes.
[34:30] A: And then he put his penis in your vagina.
[34:32] B: Yes.
[34:33] C: Right. And all that hurt and was weird.
[34:35] B: Yes.
[34:36] C: Right.
[34:36] A: And then what happened next? Be here.
[34:37] C: Hi.
[34:38] A: Hi.
[34:39] C: Hi.
[34:40] A: Right, and then that stopped.
[34:44] B: Yes.
[34:44] C: Right.
[34:45] B: And then I went home.
[34:46] A: And then you went home, which was better when you were doing that.
[34:49] C: Right.
[34:49] A: And then later on, you did something more fun.
[34:51] B: Yes.
[34:52] C: Right.
[34:52] A: Like do something fun with the kids.
[34:54] C: Right.
[34:55] A: Or get out of jail. Trying to start making connections or getting free. Being able to tell shitty things and not be troubled by it.
[35:02] B: Yeah.
[35:03] A: Yeah. Good job. Right, Right. And so you can remember that happening, right? You can remember putting your sneaks on. Well, stop putting on your sneaks.
[35:14] B: I'm not putting on.
[35:15] A: Well, then stop them from doing that. Say they're not doing that.
[35:17] B: They're not doing that.
[35:18] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. And that's when you realize you don't do drugs.
[35:23] B: I don't do drugs.
[35:24] A: Well, not.
[35:25] B: Oh.
[35:28] A: No, I didn't get that message then, damn it. I should.
[35:31] B: Yeah. Then I had to do them to, like, forget that. That.
[35:33] A: Right, exactly. That was the problem. I should have. I should have gotten that by going to do the drugs. Put me in the shitty situation.
[35:43] B: Kept happening to me somehow.
[35:45] A: Like, imagine that Right, right. And again, that earlier 13 year old you would have felt like that happening had something to do with you.
[35:54] B: Yeah, I mean, it was my fault. I went.
[35:56] A: And not just your fault. That there's something like inherently about.
[35:59] B: Yeah. I mean everyone. That's what they wanted from me. So.
[36:03] C: Right.
[36:03] A: Got it.
[36:05] C: Right.
[36:06] A: So therefore she didn't think that she got to decide whether they get to have it or not. She thought that if they wanted it, it meant they get to have it.
[36:16] B: Yes.
[36:16] C: Right.
[36:17] A: As we're looking at it, clearly it's up to you.
[36:20] B: Yeah, right.
[36:24] A: Yeah, it's totally up to you. Like you get to decide. That's the whole. That's the whole thing about being a gal. It's hard to be a gal, but the gal gets to decide the where and the when and the with whom and the how much and the how often and for how long she gets to decide at all. He doesn't. The reason he doesn't get to decide is he's always. Yes.
[36:49] B: That'S true.
[36:51] A: And she's. Yes when she wants to, but no when she doesn't.
[36:55] C: Right.
[36:56] A: That you didn't know that. Got it. So close your eyes, picture her and let her know what you know now that that's over, that no longer exists. And them doing that had nothing to do with you. It's not about me, it was about them.
[37:17] C: Right.
[37:19] A: Let her know what you know now that you get to decide that you hold the keys, you've got the goods, you get to decide. That's right. Not them. Right. So that she gets it. Let her know all the healing that you're doing and how you're dramatically changing your life for the better for you and your kids. That's right. Let her know about your superpowers. Mm, that's right. So that she gets it. And then that earlier you is going to let the rest of that earlier. You know, those other moments, connections not about me. Had nothing to do with me or my worth or my lovability. It's not about me. There's more to me than just that. They don't get to have that if I don't want. That's right. She's getting it all. So that the earlier you is learning how much you value her. Just think how strong and resilient she is. She got a little screwed up along the way, but just think about how bright she is, how powerful, how brave, all the different things she's been through and still has a big heart, loves her kids, wants a better life and is getting free like really free. Like really free. That's right. And as all of this filters in all the way through, the younger you grows up and into you. That's right. What's happening now.
[39:21] B: I feel better about it.
[39:23] A: You do, don't you?
[39:31] C: Right.
[39:31] A: Isn't that a good news thing?
[39:34] C: Yeah.
[39:36] A: So based on those experiences and what happened at that time.
[39:44] C: Right.
[39:44] A: That's what led that earlier you.
[39:48] C: To.
[39:49] A: Do all the stuff that she was.
[39:50] C: Doing then with him and the different.
[39:54] A: Names in the different spots.
[40:00] C: Not by our own accord, not by.
[40:01] A: Our own choice, not by our own decisions, but out of the things that happened to you, it led you to have those kinds of viewpoints about you that led you to do the things that.
[40:15] B: Do.
[40:16] A: You follow me with that? Now here's the key thing. If right now you and I can float back up above and back down the timeline all the way down, all the way back, all the way back, all the way back to before ever meeting him, before ever getting the first tattoo, before ever doing any of that stuff.
[40:37] C: Right.
[40:39] A: With all what was going on with her and if she knew what you know now.
[40:46] C: Right.
[40:46] A: Would you have gotten together with.
[40:48] B: No.
[40:49] C: Right.
[40:51] A: Would you have gotten the first tattoo?
[40:53] B: No.
[40:53] C: How about the third?
[40:55] A: The ninth?
[40:56] B: No.
[41:00] A: Got it. But back then, see that earlier you didn't know what you know now she was at the effect of all the fucked up shit that had happened to her in her life.
[41:15] B: I thought that like being with him was gonna make me safe.
[41:23] A: Yeah.
[41:23] C: Right.
[41:26] A: And loyalty.
[41:33] C: All right.
[41:33] A: I'm pledging. I'm in this for the long haul. I just had to keep repledging because unfortunately it didn't make me feel fucking safe. Because he's a wild card. When the person that I'm trying to get safety from is also the person that's inflicting the pain. It's really hard to make that work all the time.
[41:59] C: Right.
[42:00] A: So I wonder what it would be like for you to lighten up on the earlier you who was at the effect of that earlier traumas.
[42:12] C: Right.
[42:12] A: That led her to even find that guy being some guy that would be a good guy to be with.
[42:20] B: But I kept going with the other people.
[42:23] C: Uh huh.
[42:24] A: To do the pot.
[42:25] B: Yeah. Or like whatever.
[42:27] C: Well. Right.
[42:28] A: Wouldn't you?
[42:31] B: Yeah, I mean I did. And it was like inevitably, I guess I kind of knew it was always gonna happen. So that's why I've always just thought of those. My fault. Isn't that weird in that position.
[42:43] C: Right?
[42:43] B: Those positions.
[42:44] C: Right.
[42:45] A: But not every. So. So not every moment of the experience was Bad.
[42:52] B: Well, I just, like, I've never, like, it's always been like a transactional or thing that was taken from me. Like, I never.
[43:00] C: Right.
[43:01] B: Wanted to ever do it with anybody. I don't think really like that.
[43:04] A: What? Not all of the interaction when it went to that. The transaction.
[43:12] B: Oh, you mean like. Yes, Okay, I got what you're saying.
[43:14] A: Not the entire time that you were with those guys, was the time bad?
[43:20] B: Yeah, got it.
[43:21] A: Having to do the things that they wanted me to do was kind of like the payment.
[43:28] B: Yeah.
[43:28] A: For doing the things with the guys. And not all the things with the guys were bad, except the things that I had to do that I didn't want to do.
[43:35] C: Yes, right.
[43:39] A: Got it. I didn't go because I wanted to do those things.
[43:43] B: Oh, yes. Yes.
[43:45] A: That's not why I was going. Yeah, but I didn't go because I wanted to do those things.
[43:50] C: Yeah, right.
[43:51] A: And some people are. They have templates, right. For being a top, for being a bottom, for being into brunettes, for being in the blondes or being into big boobs, for like, people have templates. Templates are what people naturally desire. Erotic, pleasing, interesting, curious about. Everybody's got their own. They all fit within a range of different things.
[44:17] C: Right.
[44:18] A: But everybody's got different stuff.
[44:20] C: Right.
[44:20] A: So a lot of conditioning happened. Makes sense where I was conditioned, that I just do what they want. And that early conditioning will then worked really well when I was out at the clubs because I would just do what they wanted and made the money. And then that was really when I.
[44:43] C: Right.
[44:44] A: So like, I got a lot of training. Not training in what I thought I was going to be wanting to do in my life, but, like, there was a lot of. That's what. That's why we call it the grooming process that led that make sense. So what would happen if you now lightened up on the earlier you realizing how damaged she was, not because there was something wrong with you, but because of what had happened to you. Make sense that she just didn't know. She was not thinking as she was getting number seven going, man, I'm really gonna hate this in a few years. I'm really gonna hate the fact that I did it because I don't even like that name of his. I like the other one. Do you follow me?
[45:45] C: Right.
[45:45] A: There was no thoughts going on in that moment. Thinking, God, later on I am really gonna be mad at myself for having done this.
[45:53] B: But doesn't it seem.
[45:54] A: Do you follow me with that? Right. Isn't that great?
[45:56] B: It's not funny. I was gonna say. The funny thing is. I mean, doesn't that seem kind of extreme, though? But then I guess having sex for money every single day, all day long for five years and giving him all the money seems kind of extreme too. But for some reason. For some reason, I don't. I mean, I don't know why that somehow seems worse than that.
[46:21] A: Does it?
[46:22] B: I mean, I don't know, because as I've talked about before, I mean, clearly I'm having nightmares about that period because it must have affected me, you know? But I don't. I mean, I guess I just normalized.
[46:37] A: It or it was a job.
[46:39] B: Yeah.
[46:42] C: Right. But I didn't get paid a lot.
[46:46] A: Of work for not getting very much money. I mean, I made a lot of money, but I didn't get very much money. But every once in a while he'd throw me a bone, get me something nice. Not even that. He just wouldn't use the pink thing. No, no, that happened to.
[47:06] B: I mean, I guess. I don't know. I mean, maybe, like, thinking about it, putting it that way. I mean, maybe I thought, like, oh, after that five years was up, like now I'm not doing that anymore, so I'm safe, right? But, like, the reason I wasn't safe was because I was. He was. You know, I was doing that for him. So, you know what I mean? I don't know.
[47:34] A: Well, just check it out. It's been. The focus has been about him. What? What weren't you paying attention with you?
[47:45] B: Nothing. Like I wasn't paying attention to myself at all.
[47:48] A: Yeah, right. So what starts to happen is you start to take better care of you now.
[47:56] C: Yeah, right.
[47:58] A: That you're mattering to you. See, you kept thinking that I needed to matter to somebody. I needed to matter to him. And if I tattoo my. His name, one of them on my body, then that's proof positive.
[48:20] C: About mattering.
[48:25] A: You've been thinking who you needed to matter to is somebody over there. That's what was problematic then. But you're getting now. Who do you matter to? Yeah, you do matter to you. You've always known that you matter to your kids. That's why you went for the other thing instead of the riskier thing. Got it? Yeah. Because they matter and you matter to them, but you haven't been mattering to you until now.
[49:05] C: Right?
[49:08] A: You've been thinking, I need it from over there in order to make me okay in here. You started off from the factory okay in here. Fucked up shit happened along the way. That made you feel like you weren't okay in here or peeling the fucked up shit out of the way again. So that you get to connect to who you really are. Okay in here.
[49:30] C: Right. More okay in you.
[49:33] A: And that's pretty cool.
[49:37] C: Yeah.
[49:40] A: So again, just check. What are you noticing?
[49:48] B: I'm not as tense.
[49:50] A: Yeah.
[49:52] C: Right.
[49:53] A: Because we can get what must have been going on in her world based on what happened to her, that doing that makes sense. Because the things that people do make sense to them or they wouldn't do it.
[50:15] C: Right.
[50:18] A: Isn't it really cool that now that doesn't make any sense at all to you?
[50:25] B: Yeah.
[50:27] A: You're like, how could that even have had made any sense then?
[50:30] B: Yeah.
[50:31] A: Right. Isn't that fucking cool? How different it is that you can't even get to what it was like back then for me, where that was making sense for me to do. That's how transformed it is. Isn't that cool?
[50:53] B: Yes.
[50:53] A: Yeah. So I wonder what it would be like for you to lighten up on her. Cause she was pretty screwed up from the shit that happened to her and was ongoingly happening to her.
[51:05] C: Right, right.
[51:12] A: I mean, at least it didn't go on your forehead.
[51:16] B: That's true.
[51:16] A: That was number 12. 12 is going to be right on the neck. Or a big honker one like all around the neck.
[51:23] B: There's one on the back of my neck.
[51:25] C: Yeah.
[51:26] A: But notice how with the stuff that you have, you actually can cover.
[51:31] C: Yeah, right.
[51:35] A: You're not like Post Malone.
[51:37] B: No.
[51:41] A: That was smart. So even when you were in that up state, you didn't do your face.
[51:48] B: Yeah.
[51:49] A: Or like, you know, front up here. Yeah, right.
[51:56] C: Right.
[51:58] A: Because what we haven't also been including is how worse it could have been.
[52:01] B: It could have been worse.
[52:02] A: That's right.
[52:06] B: That would have probably affected my money though, if I would have. You know, I don't think he wouldn't have let me.
[52:16] C: Right.
[52:19] A: But good thing it's not about him anymore.
[52:21] B: No.
[52:22] C: No. Right.
[52:25] A: So again, just checking you. What are you noticing? What's the thing you're saying to yourself?
[52:42] B: I don't know. I'm still not convinced.
[52:45] C: Huh?
[52:45] A: Convinced of what?
[52:47] B: Like, me. Like, I just.
[52:51] A: You're not convinced of you? What?
[52:53] B: I. I don't know. Like, I just have this problem. Like, I just like, okay, for instance. Also, I've been thinking about, like, okay for regrets. Like, oh, I wish I never met him. But, like, I can't say that I can't regret all the time that I was with him because I have my Children. And, like, without him, I wouldn't have my children.
[53:16] A: So can you do both?
[53:18] B: What?
[53:20] A: Regret having met him and be thankful that I have my children?
[53:24] B: I don't think so.
[53:26] A: You can't do those two things at the same time. I don't think so. Why not?
[53:29] B: Then I wouldn't have my children if I didn't meet him.
[53:34] A: I know. So I can wish that I had never met him. And I can be really glad that I got my kids.
[53:42] B: I can do both.
[53:43] A: You can do both. They're not mutually exclusive.
[53:46] C: Really?
[53:47] A: Because the factual matter is I can't get myself to have not met him. Yeah, right. Just like I can't get us to have not had kids together, so I can't get it to have not happened. I can wish I hadn't met him because then I wouldn't have had all this other stuff. And I can also be. I'm glad I have my children.
[54:10] B: I didn't know I could do that.
[54:11] A: I wish I didn't have all that stuff. And I'm glad I have my children.
[54:15] C: Right.
[54:19] A: And given that I did go through all that stuff, I'm a heck of a lot stronger and things are getting plugged in and I'm becoming more clear. And I have more and more moments where I'm present. I have more and more moments where I'm able to connect with people. I have more and more moments where I'm feeling free. Have more and more moments where I'm like, okay, in me. I have more and more moments where I'm not second guessing.
[54:50] B: Yeah, that's true.
[54:53] A: So cool, right? So cool. And this continues to manifest, Right? I tell people sometimes if two ships are set out to sea on parallel courses and one gets adjusted by a degree at first it doesn't seem like they're moving in a different direction. But we know the further they move away from, the more vastly different their courses become. You have changed the trajectory. You've changed the wiring in your brain. The things that used to be unconscious triggers aren't triggering you like they did. The way that you used to feel about certain things that made you feel about your own worth or identity is. Isn't making you feel that way about you at all. Not that I'm accepting, but you're clear that that stuff couldn't have not happened. And all of it's done and over. And that's the best part about it, is that it's done and over. Yeah, got it. And that now I'm directing my life and I'm making good Decisions, and I'm taking right steps and I'm taking right actions and I'm doing things that there are for me to do.
[56:10] C: Right.
[56:12] A: And that's what you get to feel really good about.
[56:16] C: Right.
[56:17] A: Because this is all in your doing. Because you chose it.
[56:28] C: Right.
[56:29] A: And you chose it not knowing what it was really going to be or look like or how it was going to unfold. You didn't have to have certainty.
[56:42] C: In.
[56:43] A: Order to be certain how much things are changing.
[56:49] C: Right.
[56:51] A: Because the trust is moving inward. I have trust in me that I have what I need to handle what might show up.
[57:04] C: Right.
[57:08] A: Yeah. And as you're getting it, what do you notice?
[57:12] B: I feel lighter. Like more content.
[57:20] A: Yeah. Yeah. And really super glad that I'm not that earlier, me with all the stuff that was going on with me then that said. Sure. Number eight is good. I don't have one here yet.
[57:33] B: Can I ask you a question?
[57:34] A: Yeah.
[57:35] B: Okay, so what about. No, this is. Hold on. All right, so in all, you're super smart. Really, you are. Thank you. Okay. So I'm always hearing about, like, forgiveness and letting go of anger and stuff like that. So this is the way I've been thinking about it. So I haven't really let myself be angry.
[58:06] A: Well, are you angry anymore?
[58:09] B: Well, I don't know. I think.
[58:11] A: I don't know either. I'm not so sure you are angry anymore.
[58:15] B: I don't know if I was angry, though. I mean, I think I was, but, like, I couldn't explain, express it or acknowledge that it existed.
[58:24] C: Yeah.
[58:25] B: And then about, like, forgiveness, not necessary. Okay.
[58:31] A: So blame and forgiveness. Blame is a really bad thing to do, and forgiveness is a really good thing to do. But there is no blame without forgiveness, and there is no forgiveness without blame. So what we do is we get to a deeper level, understanding that although we don't like what happened, any of the stuff he did, any of the stuff that you did, any of that, we're crystal clear that it couldn't have not happened. We don't like it that it did, but we're clear that it couldn't have not happened. And when you get clear about that, it precludes the need for forgiveness. Because he couldn't have not done the things that he did. Just like you couldn't have not done the things that you've done. Not that it was all determined ahead of time, but looking back, cause and effect. Given that it happened, something caused it. Given that there was the cause, it couldn't have not happened.
[59:31] C: Right.
[59:32] A: So I look at when people talk about anger, anger is the response to perceived thought threat that's only active when the threat is still ongoing.
[59:43] B: Okay.
[59:44] C: Right.
[59:45] A: There are no resentful rhinoceroses in the world thinking about how that elephant came too close to their eggs.
[59:51] C: Right?
[59:52] A: That doesn't happen.
[59:54] B: Yeah, right.
[59:55] A: The guilty buffalo. Oh, my goodness. I can't believe you might feel so bad. Okay, Right, Yeah. They don't have those afflictions. So when your brain gets. It was a response to threat. When the brain gets it, the threat's gone, the emotion goes away. That's why there's not anger. That's why there's also a little bit of, like, if we had to trade roles, would you rather be him than you?
[60:26] B: No.
[60:29] C: Right.
[60:31] A: And in your family of origin, would you rather been, you know, bio mom.
[60:34] C: Bio dad, or you Me? Right.
[60:38] A: Isn't that weird?
[60:40] C: Right?
[60:40] A: Even if I didn't get dealt great hand to the set that we were dealt, like, I wouldn't trade places.
[60:47] C: Right?
[60:48] A: Because, like, what really has to have happened and what's going on over there that makes the stuff that he was doing made sense to do. Like, can't compute, can't grasp. That's why I say it's so freaking cool that you can't even get what was going on with her, that doing that would make sense. Like, that's how transformed it is.
[61:11] B: Okay, good.
[61:12] A: Because I can't get. Like, why would some. Like, I can't get it. Like, it doesn't compute.
[61:17] B: Like, yeah.
[61:22] A: Makes sense. And that's what changed.
[61:27] B: So I don't need to for. I mean, I haven't even been. It's just something you hear all the time.
[61:32] A: Yeah, I know, but I don't know whether there's anything to forgive.
[61:35] B: Okay?
[61:37] A: Because forgiveness means somehow it could have not happened.
[61:40] B: Okay?
[61:41] A: And all that shit couldn't have not.
[61:43] B: Happened because I've been feeling like I don't. I would have to figure out what I'm forgiving him for in the first place.
[61:51] A: And I don't think that there's anything to forgive him for because forgiveness isn't necessary in order to be. Okay.
[61:57] B: Okay.
[61:59] A: And what you got earlier was that deeper understanding, it couldn't have not happened. It no longer exists.
[62:08] C: Right.
[62:08] A: And that's where the feelings go away. That's why you feel lighter. That's why you have more energy. That's why it's less draining. Even if after a session, there's some reorg that's happening in your brain.
[62:21] B: Yeah.
[62:22] A: You follow me? The rest of it is ongoingly. Changing and updating, rewiring, proving.
[62:34] B: It's working.
[62:35] A: It is, isn't it? Isn't that cool?
[62:38] B: Yeah.
[62:38] A: And you're doing great. I'm super proud of you.
[62:40] B: Thank you.
[62:41] A: Yeah. So think about, you know, that I did it, or at least she did it then when she was in that state.
[62:47] B: What?
[62:48] A: You know, the tattoos. At least the first nine, you can be pissed off at 10 and 11. Did you think about it? Just check. What do you notice? It's.
[63:03] B: It doesn't hold the same weight. It does. Not like that. Yeah.
[63:06] C: Yeah, Right.
[63:11] A: There you go.
[63:13] B: I'm supposed to be getting some of them covered up.
[63:16] A: Meaning you get to pick cool designs.
[63:19] B: Yeah.
[63:19] A: Wouldn't that be nice?
[63:20] B: Yeah.
[63:20] C: Yeah.
[63:21] A: I mean, it can grow into something because you're manifesting into something different than you were then.
[63:26] B: Yeah.
[63:27] C: Right.
[63:29] A: Isn't that cool? Good job.
[63:33] B: Thank you.
[63:34] A: You're welcome. All right, we'll stop with that for now. You're doing great.
[63:38] B: Thank you.
