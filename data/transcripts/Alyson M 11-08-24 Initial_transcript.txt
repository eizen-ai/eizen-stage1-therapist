[00:00] A: So today is the 8th of November, Alison. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Okay, cool. So kind of thinking about a couple different things. What would we be wanting our time to do? Certainly that first part we want to get the effect that the stuff has had gone. But the second part is nobody would care about stuff that they've gone through if it wasn't negatively affecting now. Right. Like if right now I was feeling the way that I wanted to feel, getting good sleep, you know, whatever it is, I wouldn't give a shit about any of this stuff I went through. Right. The reason we do is that we get it that at some level it's having an effect. So that's what I'm really interested in understanding more of. Like, so for some people, they're a lot more tense, they're a lot more easily agitated or aggravated. They've got a really short fuse. They get triggered by stuff and then they blow their top and sometimes wish they hadn't. And they don't want to react to stuff like that. That's one of the things they want to get better. Other people, it's more, I would call it like nervousness, maybe some insecurities, maybe some worries about what others might be thinking. Maybe like worries about awful things that could. Or like maybe it moves into full fledged panic or maybe it's uneasy in certain groups or social situations. Or maybe this thing is running way too f and way negative or they'd like that to stop. Right. Some people, it's more grief. Like whether it be a relationship or a loss of a loved one, anytime they think about it, it still weighs on them and they don't want that to. Some people are down, depressed. Some people, as I said, get it that there's shit that they've gone through. And although it's over, may have been over a long time, it's still underneath the surface of facts, they want that better. Right. So that being said, what would we be wanting our time to do for you?
[01:54] B: Well, I guess a lot of stuff.
[01:59] A: But.
[02:01] B: I guess some of the main things that I noticed just day to day, and I'm starting to, you know, as I've had my time at the program so far, I've been noticing a lot of things. So one of the things I notice is that I think I. I kind of like tend To. Well, I shut down, I isolate, and I'm just like, really quiet. Speak. I mean, I'm starting to open up now more, which has brought up a lot of, like, okay, so I was so closed off. I feel like the more I'm opening up, it's opening me up to other people, like, to have a connection. But then also it's opening up, like. It's like digging deep into, like, the past wound.
[02:43] A: I see.
[02:44] B: So it's bringing up, like, past feelings that I have been shutting down for a long time.
[02:49] A: Sure. Or at least figuring out ways to not think about it.
[02:52] B: Exactly. And one of the ways that I do that, I guess to kind of control, feel like I'm in control or something like that is I. The reason I don't talk is because I think that I kind of, like, obsess over what I'm saying. And, like, I don't want to say the wrong thing.
[03:09] A: Sure.
[03:09] B: And they'll think this or that. And I think that stems back from, like, the past situation where I was afraid to speak, basically. Or, you know, for fear of repercussions. It might come with saying the wrong thing or doing the wrong thing.
[03:23] A: Yeah.
[03:24] B: So that's, like, one of the main things that I'm struggling with.
[03:27] A: Okay. So. So if I'm understanding that correctly, what you've noticed over time since being there is you're finding yourself opening up a little more. So where I was really, now I'm kind of opening. And that's been great in getting connection with others. But what you've also noticed is that that stuff that I've done, a thing that seems to be coming out in ways that I don't like it. And then it also has me really worrying about whether I'm going to say the right thing and what might happen if I don't. And so I got a lot of hesitation in actually speaking my mind, so to speak.
[04:11] B: Yes. Does that make sense?
[04:13] A: Yeah. And that's something that we want to get shifted so that you are more free. Free to use your voice in the times, in the situations that it makes sense and that it's okay. And the discernment of knowing which those situations are.
[04:31] B: Yes.
[04:32] A: You know that. So it's not like I just blurt out everything all the time.
[04:35] B: Yeah.
[04:37] A: Right. Yeah.
[04:38] B: There's a balance.
[04:39] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool. I know how to do that. We can certainly get behind doing it.
[04:42] B: And then one more thing.
[04:43] A: Yeah.
[04:43] B: And then after I speak, sometimes that I think for a long time afterward, like, sometimes it'll be just fine. But then sometimes I notice just when I get anxious, then I will, like.
[04:55] A: Think about it, whatever it was that you just said.
[04:58] B: Yes. Or did. Which is.
[05:00] A: Or did. And just kind of like, think over and over and over about it.
[05:03] B: Yes.
[05:04] A: Is there judgment going on as you're thinking?
[05:06] B: Probably.
[05:08] A: Okay, so not only are you thinking about it, there's, like, judging what I did or what I could have done or how come I didn't, or. Or. Or how.
[05:14] B: Yes.
[05:15] A: Okay. So we'd like this thing up here to be a little bit quieter.
[05:18] B: Yes.
[05:20] A: Right. And not so always going.
[05:23] B: Yes.
[05:24] A: Okay, cool. So that when you interact with others, you have more comfort in you. Okay, cool. I. I can totally get behind you on that. What else would be useful for me to know? What else would we want to get better?
[05:37] B: Well, all these feelings. I don't. That's something that's been going on for a long time. But these new feelings that I have are, like. I don't know what to do with them.
[05:46] A: They're just new feelings that you have.
[05:48] B: Well, for a long time, I feel like I was just living, like, I was in this constant state of just, like, fear and anxiety. So I was just used to feeling that, like, all the time. But then, like, new feelings are, like, deeper than that, I think.
[06:03] A: Like, how do you know when to feel the new feelings?
[06:06] B: There just this came up, like, just.
[06:08] A: This past, and it feels like they come up.
[06:10] B: Yes. Like, I literally have, like, a knot, like, in my stomach and, like, in my throat. Like, I feel like, you know, I don't know, but it's, like, gross. Feeling angry.
[06:24] A: Okay.
[06:24] B: Like that stuff.
[06:26] A: Yeah.
[06:27] B: I don't know. Exactly.
[06:28] A: So the feelings come up, and it's also about some stuff that happened.
[06:32] B: Yes.
[06:33] A: And then there's those strong emotions that are ones that you don't want to be feeling but are feeling.
[06:39] B: Yes.
[06:39] A: Okay. That seems to be newer because you're in a different environment where you're not so on edge all the time. Am I following you with that? Like. Okay. Okay, cool.
[06:53] B: Yeah.
[06:53] A: Yeah. Okay. I like the Noble shoes, by the way.
[06:56] B: Oh, thank you.
[06:58] A: I have the same pair. Kind, but not with the pretty flowers like you do, but the same version of those. Okay, thank you. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that's something that we want to get, those things where you find that knot and thing to stop happening so that. That's all unplugged.
[07:19] B: Yes. Because then with those feelings, it's. I. I started to notice that that anxiety is coming back, but then I also just have like, these waves of, like, crying. Like, I'll just cry and then I'll be okay for a little bit.
[07:32] A: How do you know when to cry?
[07:34] B: I just start crying.
[07:35] A: So where might you be when it happens?
[07:37] B: Just sitting. Like, just randomly. It's. It was kind of more like on Sundays whenever I first started feeling these new feelings. So then, like, throughout this week, it's kind of like not as, you know.
[07:48] A: But as those new feelings have come up, then sometimes you find yourself just crying. Yeah, I see. Okay.
[07:54] B: Like, I don't know if I'm just, like, releasing it or. I don't know. It's just.
[07:58] A: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, there's a certain aspect of. I've done a really good job of avoiding feeling feelings because anytime I think about those yucky things, it makes me feel yucky. Right now I'm having. I'm not so in survival mode where I'm constantly on angst. Now I'm having moments in time where I'm processing, and all of a sudden these things come to mind or they come up and I feel it. And sometimes it's just the thing, or sometimes I'm crying.
[08:33] B: Yes.
[08:34] A: Got it. Okay, so, yeah, we want to get that shifted so that that's not happening again so that you're more comfortable in you.
[08:44] B: Yes, that would be great.
[08:46] A: Yeah. Like, things lighten up a little bit.
[08:48] B: Yes.
[08:48] A: Yeah. So we're not so weighed down by all that stuff. Cool. Okay. What else would be useful for me to know? What else are we wanting to get better?
[09:00] B: I mean, I feel like if those things were gone, then I could deal with the things that are. I mean, I just don't know what to feel. Like I said, I've just been in that, you know, fear for so long. I just.
[09:15] A: I don't know.
[09:16] B: Like, I just don't know how to be, I guess, you know?
[09:19] A: Yeah. You haven't known how to be with what's coming up.
[09:22] B: Yes.
[09:23] A: Got it. Well, how do you actually want to be with what comes up?
[09:28] B: I want to be able to work through it so I can grow.
[09:32] A: And. And what would it be like if you're, you know, working through it? Like, how would you know? Like, how would you be being as you're working through it?
[09:42] B: You mean, like, how would I feel?
[09:45] A: No. It's a weird question, isn't it? So you said, how do I want to be right in being. We could call a state. State being a container that's going to hold how I feel. Thinking. Act so as you're having this space and the intensity of that, you know, flight fright was being turned down. And now things that I've done a really good job of avoiding thinking about because I've been constantly on go, now that I've got space, those things seem to come up, and I don't know how to be with it. Yeah, right. That was the thing that you said. I don't know how to be with it. Well, if you could be any way that you want it to be, how would you want to be with it?
[10:27] B: Oh, like how do I want to feel when the feelings are gone?
[10:31] A: Not yet. Not just when the feelings are gone, but even as you're having them.
[10:35] B: Well, I understand that I have to feel feelings. Like, I get that, but I just, like, want to be able to work through it. Without going, I guess.
[10:45] A: Without being there.
[10:47] B: Yes, without being there. Without. Because I guess that that fear and anxiety is just like my go to.
[10:55] A: Maybe because I've just, you know, it's been useful.
[10:57] B: Yeah, I guess.
[10:58] A: So that's like my helping keeping you alive.
[11:01] B: Yes.
[11:02] A: So we don't want to get rid of it. Yeah, we might want to turn down the intensity of it.
[11:06] B: Exactly. There you go. So that's like. I guess that's like my go to, like, you know, trying to push it down.
[11:12] A: Yeah.
[11:14] B: Still that I. Like, I need to.
[11:17] A: I don't know.
[11:17] B: Do I?
[11:18] A: Well, I don't know. Let me explain a couple different things, because then I think it'll make more sense to you.
[11:22] B: Okay.
[11:23] A: Because the language you're using is the language that we use to describe that stuff.
[11:27] B: Okay.
[11:27] A: But I'd like to give you a different thought on that. Okay. So what if Allison were not troubled emotionally by the stuff we went through because it happened, because it was wrong, because they shouldn't have done it, or I shouldn't have done it? What if we're not troubled because it happened, but we're actually troubled only because emotionally the brain doesn't know that what happened ended. I survived it, and I'm okay, right? In the moment that a rabbit is running for its life, Fox is chasing it. Are there any thoughts in the rabbit's mind about how nice it might be to have a carrot or they rendezvous it had planned with the cute bunny the next morning? No, in the moment it's Fox with no end. In the moment that we go through difficult experiences, it literally freezes our brain. And that part doesn't know it ended. That part got disintegrated from the rest of my nervous system. It doesn't know it's Over. I totally do. Got. Doesn't work that way for physical injuries. If I broke my arm when I was 11 and I told you about it right now, and I'm as emotional as when it first happened, you're gonna look at me like I'm crazy. This guy's moving his arm all over the place. What's wrong with him? On the flip side, if I told you about what my uncle did to me when he. When I was 11 and I started to get emotional, you'd be like, well, yeah, of course. Isn't that weird? We all say time heals all wounds. I'm 51. That's 40 years ago. Why am I still troubled? It's so weird, right? My arm is fine. So we know physical wounds heal, but why don't emotional. And the error isn't that emotional wounds don't heal is that it's the other part that the brain doesn't know that ended, that it's over, that I survived it, that I'm okay. Makes sense. Where therapy got it wrong is they gave us the language that when we have those troubling moments, we try to bury and repress, or lock it behind closed doors or put it in the closet. And that therapy or time is the time where we're supposed to help dig out those bad emotions and release them, which is like re experiencing the worst moments, like throwing up. Which, you know, after throwing up, I do feel a little bit better, but I still get re triggered by the same things. What we're going to do is the reverse of that. What we want to actually do is get the good news into the part of the brain that doesn't know certain awful moments ended. We want to unplug the memory so emotionally the brain can read what happened as data about something that happened versus where it's been coded in your brain is ongoingly happening. Does that make sense?
[14:30] B: It does. And now that you say that also, I think that part of the problem is that I feel like it could still happen, like in the future. You know what I mean?
[14:38] A: Well, sure. But even though it might possibly happen, it's not happening now. Right. And the person who's more alert and aware, meaning they've got a wider lens, is going to be able to handle things better than the person where it's still like this. So I'll give you this silly example. When a wolf goes out hunting and steps in a hole, hurts her paw. Well, now she's aware that there are holes. Now she's walking and avoiding the holes, right? The hunter Goes out and steps in the same hole that the wolf did. Hunters pissed first at the jerk who put the hole there without the sign, second at himself remembering all the other dumb shit that he's done, ruminating about how he should have been paying more attention. The hunter being preoccupied with what did is more likely to step in another hole. Got it. So yes, that stuff might. But I'm not going to be better able to handle it if I'm still activated by what did.
[15:45] B: That makes sense.
[15:46] A: Do you follow me with that? I'm gonna be at.
[15:48] B: And you're just thinking about that and.
[15:49] A: I'm gonna be at the effect of it. And when I'm in that distressed state, my vision literally tunnels. So it gets narrowed and I don't see things until they're like there. Like, I don't see any of it coming from the side where if I'm here, I can see things out to the sides. Do you follow me with that? Yeah. So we want you to be much more emotionally present and wise. Meaning she's learned from what she's gone through so that she's more alert and aware, but at the same time relaxed. Because she has inside the knowing that she has what she needs to make it through shit. And we know that with certainty because there's been some shit. You follow me with that and you've made it through it. You're here. Got that?
[16:39] B: Yes, that makes sense.
[16:40] A: Yeah, that's what we want to get shifted. Right? And then the second part with any of those troubling moments is all of them feel at this level, not at an up here level, that it meant something about me or it was because of me or somehow it was my fault. Right? And that happens because when we're little children are lied to in our culture by telling them that life is good. And by being good, you. Your life will be good and you'll get to live happily ever after. You know, the TV shows, the movies, the books, the stories, the fables, the fairy tales for children reinforce the message that good happens when you're good, which is great if life is always good. It isn't though. I've never met anybody where life has been nothing but good, right? We all have fucked up shit. Some people more than others. But there's not a single one of us that hasn't gone through some shit. And the error isn't that we told the kid life is good. It's that and good things happen when you're good. It's that the reverse must be true. Bad things only Happen when I'm being bad, or bad things happen because it was my fault, or bad things happen because I deserved it or I should have known better or I shouldn't have put myself in this situation. So even the little kid, when dad's out of the picture because him and mom got divorced, now that dad doesn't show up at all, the kid doesn't think, oh, right, that's a dad issue. Kid feels like if I was more lovable, my dad would be around. Right. If that dad said, I'll take you to Disney when he was nine. And then he doesn't show, the kid doesn't go, right, my drunken alcoholic dad's on a bender. He doesn't get to go to the coolest place in the world with me. No. He's feeling if I was more lovable, if I mattered, if I was worth it, if he truly cared. Right. So that's the other message with all these negative things. How it feels. Feels more like it was my fault and I'm to blame for it. Even when I know it totally wasn't my fault. It doesn't feel that way in here. Got it. And then what happens is once those two things are locked in place, my brain scan sort searches for anything that's similar to any of the things that I went through that was painful. But the problem is similar gets confused as same. That's why the guy diving on the ground when the firework bursts. Not because he didn't know it was the 4th of July he lit the firework. It's that the other part where that moment got stuck when his buddy got blown up by the. That part of the brain confused the sound and thought it was the mortar. Make sense?
[19:09] B: Yes.
[19:10] A: And that happens all the time. Could be times a day, could be colors, could be tones of voice, could be facial expressions, could be smells, could be all sorts of things can trigger me. Right. When you unplug the memory and the brain gets that it's data, and then what the person already knows, they start to feel it inside, the brain stops confusing. Similar as identical. It stops triggering at the wrong moments. Right. Fire detectors are useful, but only if they go off at the earliest sign of smoke. It's useless if it keeps going off all the time when there's no smoke. And that's what you've noticed. And you've noticed that I've been on high alert for a while. So I haven't been able to because I've been on high alert. Well, now I've got more time on my Hands. And with more time on my hands now, different intrusive thoughts are coming to mind. And normally. But am I supposed to? Or am I supposed to? Or am I supposed to. And you hadn't known what to do with them. Got it. So what we want to do is we want to unplug the effect that they've continued to have on you. Make sense?
[20:29] B: Yes.
[20:29] A: Because even when you were telling me about the different things earlier, just in the description, you were noticing some of that discomfort.
[20:37] B: Yes.
[20:38] A: Right. You turned on the problem. And in order to change something, we first need to have it on. So then all we've got to think about is if that's no longer an issue and that doesn't do that to you anymore, how would you actually be at peace?
[20:53] B: Content.
[20:54] A: You'd be at peace and content. Yeah. So we're headed towards a you, Alison, who's both at peace and content and free from the effect that the stuff has had. She's much more emotionally present and outwardly focused. Meaning she doesn't spend much of any time at all thinking or feeling about herself. When she's interacting with others, she's simply learning about them, maybe learning about something they might be thinking or feeling about what she said or did, but she's really not learning about herself. She's learning about them. And because of that, she's got freedom in how she responds. Which if she was learning and it's somebody that she cared about that she hurt their feelings, she might be responding in a way that's carrying you. Compassion. Right. If it's something that she was direct about and the person took it. Yeah, no, that's exactly what I was intending. And at other times, there's nothing for her to do or say because it just goes by. That's the you. This is the you that I'm seeing when we're done. Got it. You don't have to see the future you as clearly as I do. Okay. Because that's not the question how we're going to get you here. It's. Would it be okay with you?
[22:03] B: Yes.
[22:03] A: Yes. He noticed I was okay. And with it. Okay, we've got a green light to organize your brain now. We want to get your body more into a state of rest. Because when we're in states of rest, it allows accelerated healing to happen. It's why colds, flus, and surgery. What do we tell people to do? Yeah. So we have really neat levers that neuroscientists discovered that are designed to put the body at rest. First lever, supercilious about slightly lowering your jaw. So I don't mean like, ah, I mean just a little bit like this. Right, Just like that. When you slightly lower your jaw, it stimulates our vagal nerve, starts to put the body into more of a rest state. Second lever is you relax the back of your tongue so that your tongue is resting at the bottom your mouth. So it's like this, Right? Just like that. Then the third lever is you're going to begin to breathe. But how you breathe is in a way that's just a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale and then a little bit longer on the exhale. Right. So your jaw is slightly lowered, you're resting your tongue and you're breathing in. That's right. Just a little bit slower and deeper and a little bit longer. Right. And as you're starting to do this, Alison, check inside your body. How's your body feeling now? Like more tense or more calm? Isn't that cool? Right. So then we want to add the next one. When we're highly stressed for an elevated beta, it's where all the anxiety, agitation, frustration, upset, angst live. We're going to move down brain waves to lower level of beta, higher level of alpha. When we're in alpha wave, that's what surfers call flow or athletes think of as being in the zone. Got it? So it's both an alert, relaxed, aware state and what it's correlated with is with an expanding of your awareness so that you notice more with your peripheral vision. So how it works is your jaw is slightly lowered, you rest your tongue, relaxing the back. You begin just as you are breathing in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer. Right. And as you're breathing in this way. Right. Notice that you can look across and see me. You can see my nose. You can see my fingers. Stay looking at my nose as my fingers move out so that with the sides of your eyes, you pick up my fingers out here, wiggling. Notice as you just did, that you're becoming more aware of the space in the room which we normally disappear. But notice how you can be aware of the space between us and even the space beyond me. That's right, the space to either side of you towards the windows and doors, the space underneath you, behind you to the wall and above your head. Right. And as you're noticing more of the space, Allison, again, check inside your body. How's your body feeling now?
[25:10] B: More relaxed.
[25:12] A: It is more relaxed. Isn't that cool? And so as your body's staying in this more relaxed state, we're gonna request that the other part of your brain, not the conscious part, but the unconscious part. We're asking the unconscious part because that's the part that is a warehouse of everything you've ever gone through. The good, the bad, the ugly. And that part of your brain is designed to work in ways that are best for you. That's why it beats your heart and breathes for you. It's why it closes your eyes when a bug splats the windshield. It's out for your best interest problems happen because the interaction between our conscious brain and our unconscious, or our intellectual brain and our emotional brain have glitches. Makes sense. So we're just about getting your brain more in alignment with you. And so we're going to ask the unconscious part of your brain to travel back down the timeline of things that happened that sucked. That. What I've tried to do is do that with. And we're going to have that part of your brain select one moment and bring that one moment to your awareness so that as it comes into the light between you and I, we can unplug the effect it's had. Got it? Yeah. So, as you and I, Allison, are organizing towards the future you, who's present and light and clear and free and peaceful and content, as we're organizing towards this you, that other part of your brain travels back, write down the timeline and will bring a moment to mind, to clear. You got it. Good. The one that just came to mind happened how long ago?
[26:59] B: A bad moment?
[27:00] A: Yeah. Like you might have been how old? Um.
[27:11] B: 19.
[27:11] A: 19. Good. Right. And the feelings, as you think about it, are feelings of. What is it? Hurt, anger, sadness, grief, guilt, shame, regret, remorse. Combination. Okay, so here's the first question I have for you. Would it be okay to get those feelings gone?
[27:26] B: Yes.
[27:27] A: And if those feelings are gone, would it in any way, shape or form mean what happened then was okay? Right. You get to be okay now. Even though that wasn't. Got it. So how we clear something super, super simple? I know you're gonna go, this is crazy that this is gonna work, but it's super simple. Requires only one thing from you. Okay? Do you want to know what it is? Intend to emotionally be with me.
[27:50] B: Okay.
[27:51] A: You want to intend to be here. My job is to keep you here. The reason that you want to intend to be with me is that this is the thing that's happening. And that shit isn't. 2. We're working on the goal that we both want for you and three, remember, the bar is not set very high, but I'm hoping to be a little more enjoyable than that sucky stuff. Got it. Three, you're going to simply tell me facts, just what happened in a minute or less, and I go, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened. And it was done. Right. Last. If it happened when you were 19, there have been many things you've done later after that that were more enjoyable than that moment. What's one thing, anytime from when that ended until, heck, even yesterday, that was more fun than that moment. Yeah. Being with your kids. Way more fun than that moment. Good. Something else.
[28:36] B: I mean, that's really been, like, the joy of my life.
[28:38] A: Yeah. Well, being with your kids certainly is one. But, you know, even just a little more enjoyable than that moment, you know, at 19.
[28:46] B: Oh, at 19.
[28:47] A: Yeah. That thing. At 19, there's been a lot of things you've done. We got. Yeah. Being with your kids way more enjoyable than the thing at 19. What's something else? I mean, is getting out of jail more enjoyable? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so we got getting out of jail. Right. That's way more enjoyable than that moment. Right. Good. Something else.
[29:05] B: That's a good one. I mean, now being able to open up and have, like, connection.
[29:11] A: Well, sure. Creating connections.
[29:14] B: Yeah.
[29:14] A: Right. There's a part of you that doesn't know that moment ended. So we have good news to get in. Got it. So when that moment happened? Right. When it happened, you were where?
[29:29] B: Texas.
[29:30] A: You're in Texas. Good. Where you had a house or an apartment?
[29:32] B: An apartment.
[29:33] A: You're at an apartment. Were you, like, inside or outside? And were you in the living room, dining room, kitchen? Bedroom? You're in the bedroom. Right. Good. And was it daytime or nighttime?
[29:41] B: Nighttime.
[29:41] A: Nighttime. And so you're in the bedroom. Are you on the bed? So you're on the bed. Right. And then what happened next? Like under the covers or over the covers?
[29:50] B: On the bed.
[29:52] A: And you were sitting or laying down? Sitting. So you're sitting under the bed. Right. Good. And be here because I'm fine. Right. Notice how you're going there for a moment. Right. I want you to be here. The reason you want to be with me is that this is. That isn't. Okay, got it. So you're sitting on the bed. Then what happened next?
[30:10] B: I was getting punished for.
[30:13] A: So somebody was yelling at you?
[30:15] B: Yes.
[30:15] A: Somebody was standing there and yelling at you?
[30:17] B: Yeah.
[30:17] A: Right. So guy or gal?
[30:19] B: A guy.
[30:20] A: So he was yelling at you. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[30:22] B: He was Choking me.
[30:24] A: So then he came over to you and he grabbed you. Right. Put his hands around your neck. Right. And that was scary. And then what happened next?
[30:30] B: He choked me until I almost passed out.
[30:32] A: Right, and then you might have passed out. Right. And then he stopped. Right. And then what happened next?
[30:38] B: He raped me.
[30:39] A: Well, then he put his penis in your body. Different body parts. Mouth.
[30:43] B: Just.
[30:44] A: Just. Just vagina. Right. Good. So he did that for a period of time. Right. And then he stopped. Right. And then what happened next? And then he left, which was better than when he was doing that. And then eventually you got off the bed, and then later on, you did something more fun like hang out with your kids or get out of jail or I can even start to, you know, have conversations with folks. Right? So notice, as you were telling me about it, some discomfort. Notice, though, how it was less than normal. That's because you were intending to be with me. Got it. You're doing great. I'm really proud of you. So here's the crazy part. We never go backwards of the memory, but when we go backwards of the memory, it literally unplugs the memory. It takes away the charge. So we're gonna go backwards. Okay, Got it. So as we go backwards, we got, you know, opening up, sharing stuff with people. Right? We got getting out of jail. We got hanging out with the kids. Right. And then before that, you had gotten off the bed. Then before that, he left, and then he had stopped, and then he had his penis in your vagina, and then he had put his penis in your vagina, and then he had stopped choking you, and then he was choking you, and then he came to the bed, and then he was yelling at you. And then before that, he probably came into the room, and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing now. Again, as we go backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it different? I know. Isn't that weird? That's because your brain is getting that it's data about something that happened not happening. Right. Third, the emotional brain. I know that sounds weird, right? But see, it's the first time your brain is reading it as information about something that happened to you before. It had been living as if it's still happening to you. That's the big difference. That's why it didn't feel so bad. Got it. Now, the third part is that emotional brain does not get logic, but it does get patterns of association. And the error is that the memory of what happened and the experience are glued together. So they're living as if they're the same thing. But there are things you can remember doing even today that you know you're not doing right now. Like, for example, putting your jeans on. You can remember doing it. You can remember where you were when you did it. But if I simply said to you, hey, Alison, remember getting dressed, putting your jeans on? And you're like, yeah. I go, well, then stop putting on your jeans. You would look at me and go, I'm not putting on my jeans. Because, you know, there's a huge difference between the memory of you putting your jeans on and you actually doing it. Got it.
[33:04] B: Okay.
[33:04] A: Right. We're gonna play. And I'm not. You're not. It's not. Game. Because if I said to you, woven, stop me from putting on my pants, you would look over at me and go, you're not putting on your pants. They're already on. Right. If I said to you, wolven, stop putting on your nobles, you'd be like, I'm not putting on my sneakers. And if I said to you, well, then stop me from putting on my shoes, you'd say to me, you're not putting on your shoes. Got it? Right. You can remember that happening. You can remember him yelling at you, him choking you, him putting his penis. You can remember all that happening. You also can remember putting your jeans on today.
[33:39] B: Yes.
[33:40] A: Allison, stop putting on your jeans. Hey, I'm not putting on my jeans. Well, stop me from putting on my pants. So you're not putting on your pants. Well, then you stop putting on your sneaks. I'm not putting on my sneaks.
[33:48] B: I'm not putting.
[33:49] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shoes, so you're not putting on your shoes. We'll stop him from putting his hands around your neck. Say he's not doing that. Right. Well, then stop him from putting his penis. He's not doing that. Well, stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that. So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists.
[34:03] B: It no longer exists.
[34:04] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. Right. And as that starts to get in, what are you noticing?
[34:10] B: I feel there.
[34:13] A: I know. Isn't that cool, right? That earlier you felt some of what happened to you then was your fault. Right. Because you should have done this or you shouldn't have said that, or if you had acted more like this, and you wouldn't have done that. Right. Like. But as we're looking at it clearly, adults that we are right now, him doing that to you, was that anything to do with you? No. It had everything to do with what was screwed up in him. You didn't know that then. So I want you to repeat these four words. Here we go. It's. It's not about me. Right? It's not. Say that it's not about me. Right? One more time. It's not about me.
[34:47] B: Not about me.
[34:48] A: Right now. We're going to have you in a moment. Close your eyes. You're going to picture the younger you. You're going to let that younger you know that moment is over, finished, completed, defeated. It no longer exists. You're going to let her know that you're okay. You're going to let her know about playing with her kids, right? Getting out of jail, right? Beginning to create connections, right? You're going to let her know that you're okay. Because there was a moment when all of that was going on that she wasn't sure she was going to be okay or survive. So we have really, really good news to get in, don't you think? Yeah. So go ahead and close your eyes. Picture that younger you and let her know that's over, finished, completed, defeated, it no longer exists. Let her know that that happening, him doing that had nothing to do with you. It's not about me. And everything to do with what was fucked up with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Let her know that you're okay, that you made it through it, that you're okay. Let her know about playing with her kids. Let her know about getting out of jail. Let her know about being. Being able to open up. Let her know so that she's getting it. And as the younger you is getting it, what do you notice now happening to that earlier? You. What happens to her face?
[36:00] B: She's not crying.
[36:01] A: She's not crying. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Notice how she's not hurting. Right. And then whenever you're ready, take another deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Yeah. So just check. Alison, as you're thinking about that thing happening then, right now, what do you notice?
[36:36] B: Do you mean like that looking back at it?
[36:37] A: Yeah. As you're thinking about it right now, what are you noticing in here that's different than it was?
[36:43] B: It just feels different. Because when I think back on it now that he's not there.
[36:47] A: Oh, he's not there, is he? Yeah. Because it's not happening. Right? Did it? No, it did.
[36:52] B: Oh, it did happen.
[36:53] A: Right? Is it? No.
[36:55] B: Oh, no, it's not.
[36:56] A: That's right. Good job. Right. And that's what's finally getting into your brain? Because your brain didn't know that he's no longer doing this, that now it's getting it as that emotional brain gets it. What do you notice in terms of the feelings?
[37:14] B: I don't know, it just doesn't feel as like heavy.
[37:17] A: Notice how it's not feeling so heavy, right? I want to explain one other thing to you because it'll be useful as we move forward with other stuff and be useful with this. So most of the time, us, you and me, human beings, we walk around over identifying my thoughts, my feelings, my body, what I do, what happened to me, my past, as if it's me, right? We over identify. So people walk around going, I am my body, right? My body is me because I'm in it, so I must be my body. I might. But you know that you're not your body. Weirdly, my mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident. But when she goes to visit people now, they don't say to her, hey Susie, I'm glad almost all of you, you could come over. Because they recognize that she's all there, even if that part of her body's missing. And we know that there's no cell within your body that's the same as it was. It's all been replaced so you're still you, even though it's all changed so you can't be your body. So then we go, if you're not your body, you must be your thoughts. But what if you're not your thoughts? What if you're just the, you know, the one that notices the thoughts? Because you're not even the thinker of your thoughts. Your brain is. And your brain is not you. It's an organ just like your liver and your lungs. Your is not you. So now we go, wait a minute, I'm not my body and I'm not my thoughts. Oh, I must be how I feel. But you feel different these at different times, right? Happy, sad, angry, glad. So you can't possibly be a feeling. Then people go, well, if I'm not how I feel, I must be what I do. But there's lots of things you've done over time. When you were doing this and then stopped and did that, you didn't cease to exist. So the weirder questions becomes, if you're not what you do, or your thoughts or your feelings or your body, then what the heck are you? Weird question, I know. So I wanted to give you a thought of this. So think of a Time, Allison. When you were outdoors in nature and you see something and it's beautiful, like it's captured your awareness, and in the moment that you're seeing it, you're just struck with that wow, what is it that you see?
[39:14] B: A butterfly.
[39:15] A: Yeah. And isn't there the moment that as you see the butterfly, you feel that peace, all wonder, excitement. And some people would tell you it is the seeing of the butterfly that's giving you those feelings. But what if we got something different? What if the seeing of the butterfly drew your awareness down and in towards your center? Because what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited? Kind of like I'm at the campfire and I'm cold, and so I bring my hands to the flames and I go, holy shit, the fire's getting hot. Hotter. Is the fire getting hotter?
[39:50] B: You're getting closer.
[39:51] A: I'm becoming more aware of the heat as my hands get closer. That's right. So what if your awareness, in lots of awful times, has been anywhere but at your center? But what if at your center, you're always peaceful and excited? Right? And we could call knowledge, right? Light of knowledge. We could call this light of wisdom. And I do work with all sorts of people, that yucky stuff. I remember a girl that I worked with, older brother, used to take Matchbox cars, driving them up her leg. And so she had a lot of yuck. But we worked together, cleared it all. The guilt, the shame, the anger, the hurt, the pain, it's gone. And I asked her that question one time. I go, you know all that? I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone. I don't feel it. I go, isn't that cool? She said, it is. I go, was it surface, like intellectual? She's like, no. I go, was it in there? She's like, how could it survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited? I go, well, then where was it? And she went, huh? It was hiding in the shadows between the lights that are now touching. And I said, that is cool. And then I told her about, you know, the over identifying and how I went to the dentist and what the jerk did to me. She goes, what did he do? I go, well, first he put me on a chair. My head went down and my feet came up. It's very uncomfortable. And she's like, yeah, but you're at the dentist. And then I said to her, well, then he turned the light on and positioned it right in my eyes. I can't see anything. And she's like, you're at the dentist. And then I said, well, she took this cold instrument and shoved it inside of me. And she's like, oh, my goodness. And you're what? And I said, my mouth. But it's the same thing that I said to her with her brother in the Matchbox car. I said, when you were little, he really messed with your stuff. And she said, he did. And for a long time, that screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings. And then she said to me, but you know what? I go, what? She said, he never touched me. He messed with my body. It screwed up my thinking. It hurt my feelings. But he never touched who I really am. He never touched me. And I went, whoa, that's powerful. So I want to show you something. What you're going to do, I'm going to move slightly closer. You're going to take that hand. You're just going to hold it like that right there. You're going to look at that spot right there. Now, as you're looking at that spot, Alison, I'm going to take my hand. I'm going to move it towards your hand. You're going to see that my hand is moving in towards your hand. And you're going to notice that as my hand gets closer, it's closer to your hand. And that before it ever touches your hand, that you're going to notice that you can feel the warmth and energy from my hand. Isn't that weird that you can feel that warmth and energy? Right. This means I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with respect. Mutual respect. That's right. That's right. So you can say this out loud. I have a nose. I have ten fingers. I have two elbows.
[42:47] B: I have two elbows.
[42:47] A: I need ten toes.
[42:49] B: I have ten toes.
[42:49] A: I'm not my nose.
[42:50] B: I'm not my nose.
[42:51] A: I'm not my fingers.
[42:52] B: I'm not my fingers.
[42:53] A: I'm not my elbows.
[42:54] B: I'm not my elbows.
[42:55] A: I'm not my toes.
[42:56] B: I'm not my toes.
[42:57] A: I have a vagina.
[42:58] B: I have a vagina.
[42:59] A: I'm not my vagina.
[42:59] B: I'm not my vagina.
[43:00] A: It's mine.
[43:01] B: It's mine.
[43:01] A: But it's not me.
[43:02] B: It's not me.
[43:03] A: He messed with my stuff.
[43:04] B: He messed with my stuff.
[43:05] A: And it hurt my feelings. And it screwed up my thinking.
[43:08] B: And it screwed up my thinking.
[43:09] A: But he never touched who I really am.
[43:11] B: But he never touched who I really am.
[43:13] A: He Never touched me.
[43:14] B: He never touched me.
[43:15] A: He messed with my stuff, but he never got me.
[43:18] B: You never got me.
[43:19] A: That's right. Because who I am. Because who I am can only be touched. Can only be touched with mutual respect.
[43:25] B: With mutual respect.
[43:26] A: Or the love I allow in. Take a deep breath in. Long exhale. That just drops like this. Right? And then that hand and arm can drop down, but only at the same rate in which you are unconscious. Fully integrates with what it's just gotten and learned about never touching who you really are. Never got you. That's right. Never touched who you really are. They never got you. See, I wonder what happens now as you let the younger you now close your eyes again. Let that younger you know that it's over, finished, no longer exists. That he messed with my stuff, but he never got me. Because there's no part of me now, no part of my body. Then that's the same as it was now. That's right. So that he never, never attached who I really am. He never got me. Let her know you're okay. Let her know about playing with her kids, getting out of jail. Right. Healing. Let her know about how you're healing, that what you're doing now is you're changing the course and trajectory of your life for you and your kids. Cause you're healing. That's right. And as all of this gets into the younger you, what do you notice happening to her face?
[45:14] B: She looks capable.
[45:17] A: Yeah. Oh, stronger. Yeah. Capable and strong. Mm. Right? Isn't that cool? And what are you noticing for yourself as you know? That she's capable and strong. You do feel lighter, don't you?
[45:36] B: My shoulders feel a lot lighter.
[45:38] A: They do, don't they?
[45:39] B: Yeah.
[45:39] A: Yeah. So if in any way, shape or form, when you're back up at assessment, this is the way that we would want material to get cleared, to get unplugged, to heal. Right. Aaron can do some of that with you. Right? But that's. We don't want to go into and start feeling yucky. Because notice when you started to feel yucky, what did I do? Get here with me. Do you follow me with that? Right. So that we could go through that yucky moment quick. Do it in reverse so the brain can read it as data, have it fully get integrated, that it's data by the brain getting that it's not happening. It no longer exists. And when emotionally the brain gets that it no longer exists, it goes. Never mind. Because the feelings were only there trying to get you to get it to stop. Your brain Wasn't making you feel bad about it because it wanted you to feel awful. It was trying to motivate you to get it to stop. Stop. It didn't know it stopped. Right. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Yeah. And that's why, when you think about that, we still don't like that he did it. But notice how I don't have any of the visceral emotional charge anymore. Isn't that cool?
[47:03] B: Yeah.
[47:03] A: Yeah. Yeah. So any questions about that?
[47:08] B: I mean, a lot to wrap my mind around, but, yeah.
[47:12] A: The good news is you don't have to do a lot. The only thing that there is for you to do is notice what's different for you in terms of how you feel as it pertains to stuff. We'll do more, but I wanted to give you the experience of that transforming. Right. Because what we did is we changed the relationship to was coded as happening. We now coded it as data about something that happened. It automatically added to your strength. That's why you felt her being stronger and you feeling lighter, because she's now fully through the awful moment. We get that there's others. We'll get to those. But now you have a good way of doing it. First, we want to get the body to be in a settled, calm and neutral state. Then it's okay to bring content and in collaboration with somebody who's interested in keeping you here, go through just the facts so that we can unplug the memory and experience it as data about something that happened. Isn't that cool? Notice how different that is than, like, what other people do.
[48:28] B: Yeah.
[48:29] A: Yeah. It's a much gentler and nicer way. Yeah. Cool. And then we can get back together. And you can also, you know, tell Erin and do stuff with this. She'll probably hear this.
[48:39] B: Okay.
[48:39] A: So she'll know what we did. Yeah. And then we can move forward. But it was really great meeting you today. Awesome. My pleasure. Oh, it's great. You can come with me.
