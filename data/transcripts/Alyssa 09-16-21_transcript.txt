[00:00] A: Today is the. What is it? The 16th. 16th of September. Holy cow, Melissa. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is transformative, life changing, and, you know, makes a really positive difference for you, that recording may be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:22] B: Yes.
[00:22] A: Cool. So when you were in here the last time, and kind of a little bit of our recap, you had mentioned that certainly there's been a whole bunch of stuff that's happened. Lots of crazy, dramatic stuff happened when you were growing up that although those experiences are over, they have a underneath the surface effect on you. Again, not that you're thinking about it often or all the time, but if it does arise or if you do think there's still stuff attached to it. We get that there's been a tendency, based on what you went through, that what was much more safe was to be dissociated from what was going on. And that's kind of how you've functioned through lots of life. Right. You get that sometimes that's been interrupting your ability to be able to connect and understand what another might be going through. And that's been slightly problematic. We get that. Then there's been a whole bunch of other stuff that's happened through adulthood and different things that you've done that again, there's some emotional stuff revolving around that again, even though you've been distanced from it. And what we're wanting is for you to be much more at ease, much more comfortable in your own skin, that if there is the dissociation happening, that it's more intentional and on purpose, not just automatic. You follow me with that? Because there are times like when runners dissociate. So somebody who's doing a long run, it would suck to be in their body the whole time, don't you think? Right. So they're not there. Their body's doing the running. In their mind, they're somewhere else. So with certain forms of exercise and other situations, it's useful to go on like that. We also want to get it so that other things don't trigger problematic thoughts or feelings or reactions. Because you've also recognized that sometimes the intensity in which you have that go on is more than you would want it to be. Makes sense. We also know that mom, now medicated, is certainly better than she was. But. And you can know, because you do know, that mom wasn't well, better now. And that's better for my kid that's staying with her. I'm glad that at least she's better now and they don't have to experience the craziness that I did with her. Yeah, but the other component with all of this is even though you know where you're bright, reasonable, rational and logical, that mom not being well wasn't about me. It doesn't fully, at an emotional level feel that way. Follow me with that. Like there's still like stuff that's tied where it's been feeling somewhat as if it was about me. In the same way the boy whose dad winds up being an alcoholic and isn't around, that boy isn't thinking, oh, it's my dad who's a loser. That has nothing to do with me. The boy thinks, if I was more lovable, worth it, good enough, Daddy would be here if I mattered, Daddy would show up. Right. The little kid isn't. Because at that level they don't have that ability to process and they don't have that distance from it. So you can know a lot more things now from your head up. But what's been problematic is that it hasn't been fully integrated. So it's connected all the way through. And unfortunately, or fortunately, we are not intellectual beings with the ability to feel. We are feeling beings with the ability to think. Because all those feeling states are primary makes sense. So we want to adjust the way that that more automatic emotional, we'll call it pre conscious part of your brain has been reacting and responding to the stuff Right. In the whole purpose always is to get life to work better. Now my take is nobody would care about any of the shit that happened to them if their life right now was totally working the way they wanted it to. They were doing the things they wanted to do. They were thinking the ways they wanted to think. They were reacting to things the way they wanted to. Right. Nobody would give a shit. The only reason that we are at all interested is that it's been negatively affecting. Now does that make sense? So from what we've said, kind of an idea that I've had in my mind, one would be clearing out the effect the impact that those prior things have had the long term, long ago, maybe even long forgotten, the more recent. So they don't have that same weight on you. What I'd be wanting is for you to have the freedom to be connecting at the times and in the situations that actually make sense for you to be doing it. And the freedom to have Distance when it doesn't and actually feel okay either way. You follow me with that? The you that I'm seeing is much more at peace. Her mind has quieted so that her emotions match. The situation at hand makes sense. The you that I'm seeing has that freedom and flexibility to be both associated in her body when that would make sense, given again, context, situation where she's at and the ability to move outside when it would. Right. So the you that I'm seeing just has a lot more freedom, flexibility and ease in terms of how she's maneuvering through her day. And this is the you that I'm seeing. Does that make sense? So my question for you then, Elissa, isn't how it's going to happen that we get you here. My question is more would it be okay with you to be the way I just described? That'd be okay. Is there anything that, as you know, in between when you and I last got together and now, and even in what I'm describing, is there anything else that we would want to add, you know, to the future you that would make it even better for you? Anything else that you think would be either a useful for me to know or things that we'd want done that you know, could make a difference for you?
[07:41] B: No.
[07:45] A: Okay, so we're on board.
[07:47] B: Yeah.
[07:47] A: Okay, cool. Alright, so. And it's okay with you? Yeah, yeah. And with it. Okay. That actually moves it. Did you know that? Well, it's really interesting because in order to go anywhere, first I need to know where I'm going, and then second, it needs to be okay with me that I'm headed there. Once I've got those two things in place, I'm actually a lot closer to being there than before I knew where I was going and whether it was okay. Does that make sense? So already at a deeper level, whether you fully realize it yet or not, things have begun to organize, begin to restructure, liking it to. Maybe when, you know, you take a package of seeds, right, and we look at the picture on the package, that's like the end result. But then we open up the package and we pour out the seeds and we go, fuck, man, these things don't look anything like that, right? But you know that once we've tended to the soil, planted those seedlings in the areas that we needed to, covered them up, maybe watered that top layer, that something immediately begins to happen at a deeper level. We don't see it, right, but something's going on underneath the surface. The seedling is beginning to sprout roots. And a lot goes on first before you and I ever see the end result. Right. But it's already on the way. That's what's happening within you. And so I'm going to give you kind of a layout of a few different pieces. Some of it is a recap of what we talked about, but kind of giving you an understanding of really how our brain works in the way it does, how come we have the reactions, responses we do, and how we're able to get it better. I gave you that silly example the last time that we tend to look at life. That that thing made me feel this way. So when I did that, I felt like this. When they did that, it made me feel this way. That stuff causes feelings. And I said, that's not a wrong lens, but it gives us limited power because we're left with two choices, change or avoid, which is how most of us deal with stuff. But you've already discovered there's some stuff I can't change and shit, there's some stuff I can't completely avoid. And then there's a whole bunch of stuff that I can't get the bad stuff to have not happened. So we got to do something else. But where we're coming in now is all about adjusting how that more preconscious emotional brain reacts to stuff. I gave you the example of the lion and the zebra, that it tends to be most people's thinking that lion causes zebra to become scared. And we don't disagree, but we look at it from an alternative and we go, no, it's actually the zebra's brain that's making the zebra alert, motivated, and stronger. Yes, it's doing it. As soon as the zebra sees or senses or smells or feels or thinks that lion's coming. But it's totally the zebra's brain, not the lion. So we're going to say that there's been ways in which your brain has been working that's been problematic for you. Problematic in that there are times that you want to be feeling things that you're not. There are times that you didn't want to be feeling things that you were. There's a whole bunch of things that have happened that, like, still have lingering emotion. There's reactions that you find yourself having that aren't optimal. Your brain might do all of that to you, of course, Alyssa, in response to stuff past or current or future, but you've been able to recognize that that way of your brain working has been problematic. And that's the Issue, it's really on the table for us to get addressed, right? And if we look at it from that wonky lens that your brain makes you feel bad. First question. Do you really think it wants you to feel bad? No. Do you think it would want you to feel good? No. That's the fucked up part. I know it sounds crazy, right? But what we've discovered in working with thousands of different people. You're a bright gal. I'm a pretty bright guy. Most of our brain, though, emotionally, works more like the brain of an animal. And an animal's brain doesn't cause feelings. Because the brain of the animal is concerned about the animal's mood or its affect or how it feels about itself, or whether it's having good or bad days. It causes the emotion to truly motivate the animal to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. It's that simple. So when a rabbit sees a fox approach, the brain immediately makes all of rabbit experience features. Not because it wants rabbit to have a bad day, but to make it run really fast away. Squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire immediately. Brain of squirrel makes it experience pain, but not because it wants the squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid, dumb moron. And now it's embarrassed because it's marred and all the other squirrels are gonna pick up. No, just really simple, get tail out of fire. So what's crazy for us human beings to even consider is that all of the negative emotions we experience, the hurt, the anger, the sadness, the sorrow, the grief, the guilt, the angst, the upset, the worries, the pains, are all being caused by that primitive part of our brain that works like an animal. Same purpose, motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. Here's the big error. Many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. Have you ever noticed as human beings, we have a tendency to feel shitty about the same kinds of things over and over and over again? Now really good. Many of those things are in time periods that are completely finished. So we don't need to solve the problem. Instead, we want to update the timing. The malfunction for human beings is a timing malfunction. And the reason is we have another part to our brain, that logical, reasonable, rational brain that gives us time, right? You can remember something you did yesterday. You can think about something you might go do over the weekend. No other animal can do that, right? An animal is always right. Now that is Not a problem for human beings if experiences are positive or even when they're neutral. Because in positive or neutral experiences, the brain easily identifies the difference between the memory and the experience of it. The memory of it and the experience of it. They're not merged. Easy example. Somebody's telling us about a trip that they had to Key west, how when they were down there, they took their picture next to the sign that said 90 miles from Cuba. They, you know, had some cocktails on Duval street, they went to see Hemingway's house, they went out deep sea fishing, they got to see a Florida marlin, they caught those little blue lobsters. Of course they tell us all about their experience.
[15:13] B: And.
[15:13] A: And don't you and I both know that? They totally know the difference between remembering being there and being there. Totally clear. The problem is when it's negative. And it doesn't matter whether it's a big fucking negative or a little negative. And it doesn't matter whether the negative happened a long time ago when I was a young child, or heck, just the other day. And it doesn't matter whether it was a one time occurrence or many times throughout many years. All those negative experiences, the weird, the bad, the awful, the sad, the scary, the horrific, the upsetting, the catastrophic, the traumatic. Our brain will confuse the data, memory and info about it, thinking it is it, and cause the person to have an emotional response. Right? Guy is telling us about getting mugged 12 years ago when he happened to be in Chicago. And he gets to the part where the guy had come up behind him, grabbed him, and he's got a knife at his blade, blade him right at his throat, whispering, if you even breathe, motherfucker, I'm gonna slice you. And all of a sudden we look at this guy and his face has gone completely white. His voice is all trembling, his arms are shaky, he's got a tear. But again, you and I are kind, nice people listening to him. What the fuck is happening with him? And what do people say? He's reliving it, but you know what's actually happening. That more emotional part of his brain is simply confusing the memory, the data, the information about what happened, thinking it's happening. That's why he's having that emotional response. We know that it's affecting him as he was talking to us because we can tell, we see it all over him, but it was also affecting him even over the weekend when he was playing in the pool with his kids. It was underneath the surface. Logically, up here, the guy absolutely knows that he's Safe, that he survived, that he's okay, that he didn't die, that he didn't even get caught. But what we're also learning, and this is the key mechanism with all troubling moments, part of his brain never got the good news. So with those emotionally charged, upsetting experiences, they tend to freeze at the worst moment. When it freezes at the worst moment, it also gets the disconnected from the rest of my nervous system. So it lives kind of like an island by itself, not connected to the world, but always on hypervigilant mode. Right. And that's the first thing that keeps those troubling experiences stuck. Does that make sense? Second thing that happens. All little children are trained in the same ways in our culture. They're trained to believe that good things happen because I am good. I'm a good boy, I'm a good girl. We lie to children. We tell them that when they're good, good things happen. And that gets reinforced because they get praise, they get hugs, they get love, they get candy, they get cookies. We reinforce the notion of this, you know, pedophile old man who watches young children but brings gifts to them once a year. Fucking weird, right? If you really think about Santa Claus, old man who watches kids all the time, does that sound. We bring them, put them on a lap, like, doesn't sound like. Doesn't sound like a good idea, does it? But we teach them that when they're good, these good things happen. Somebody I don't even know will give me gifts, right? Which reinforces the notion that good happens because I am my identity. Good kids, when they're little, don't distinguish my behavior from my identity. So it becomes the same merged thing, which. You know what? That would be fine for that child if everything in their life was always good. They lived just a charmed existence. Nothing bad ever happened. Unfortunately, that's not life. I have never met anybody who hasn't been scarred with emotional wounds. I think the human experience is traumatic. I don't think you get to go through life and not experience awful stuff. Some people more than others. Some people in bigger ways than others. But there's not a single one of us that makes it through unscarred. And so the error isn't just that we were telling them and having them believe at the deepest level that good happens because they're good. The evil part is, if good happens when I'm good, then bad must happen because I'm bad. Which, as an adult, you know that that's not true. You can cognitively get that Bad shit can happen to good people without them doing anything wrong. Totally know that. But that's not what gets stuck when we're little. So even in really simple examples like the kid doesn't get picked for kickball. Now, he didn't get picked for kickball, not because he doesn't have friends, but because the two people picking sides were interested in the most athletic kids because they wanted to win the game. And this kid happened to not be that athletic. He happened to be really good at math. So if the game was times tables, who can tell us the, you know, five times five fastest? That kid would be freaking number one selection, right? He'd be like mvp. Right? But because it's that other game, he's not picked. Now, of course, the kid doesn't go in his own mind, oh, I get it. I'm not getting picked because I'm not that athletic. Think I'm not good at this game. No kids thinking, see, if they like me, if I was more popular, if I fit in more, if I had more friends. So it goes back to being about me. Make sense? Right? Think of the girl who is 25 and she got a promotion at work. So she's going out with some of her co workers to celebrate. One of the co workers brought a friend. He seemed to be nice. They hit it off, they flirted. He bought her a couple drinks, they played darts in the pool. They had a good time. He said to her, well, instead of you taking an Uber home, you're on my way, I'll drop you off. Nice guy, co worker's friend, right? And such a nice guy that when he got to her apartment because it's not in the nicest area, he said, well, let me walk you to the door, make sure you're safe. What a cool dude, right? She might have even been interested in giving him a little peck. Now, she had no idea that when she got to the door, he was going to force himself into her apartment and rape her, which is what he did. And that's fucking awful. But worse is what she's telling us because she says things to us like, I was so stupid. I was so careless. I put myself in that dangerous situation. I should have known better. Yes. In life you should be thinking that a co worker's friend is going to rape you. No. Right. But again, it goes back to, that thing happened because it was my fault. Right? Maybe I wore the dress that showed off a little and a little, and that's why that guy did that thing. I mean, we have that example Going on all the time for us, that it's bad, it's my fault. Well, I should have known better. I shouldn't have been on that street, or I shouldn't have talked to that person, or I shouldn't have been there. So the second thing that keeps all the bad stuff stuck, right, Is the meaning that gets attached, that makes me feel worse about me, right? And that would be more so even as a child growing up with somebody who wasn't well, because everything would have been about me and I wouldn't have been able to do it right, no matter what I did. And I'd have to be dancing on eggshells and I wasn't sure which one I was gonna get. And I could do it the same way each and every time, but I get different results, right? You know the good thing about a jukebox? If I want to play the song, I hit the button and it plays that song. But see, when I grow up with somebody who's not well, I hit the button and it doesn't play the song I wanted. It plays like, what did I do wrong? I just did that yesterday. That was the same thing, was like, what the. There must be something not okay with me. It doesn't get turned around like she's fucking nuts. There must be something not okay with me. Does that make sense? Right? Even if the kid doesn't do well in school, well, it must be because I'm not smart. Or it could be that that teacher doesn't know how to teach to your way of learning. No, it doesn't get turned around that way at all. No, no. It has to be because I'm not smart, right? So when all the negative things happen, it comes back and means stuff about my identity, right? And then once we've got those two pieces stuck there, my brain, emotionally is about my survival. So what is it left to do? It's left to scan and search for anything that's similar to anything that had been painful. The problem is that it will also merge or confuse anything that occurred around the same time and anything that has a structural similarity to what was painful. So think of this guy. He's really into this gal. They've been dating for a while and it's the first time they're going to be intimate. So he's kind of excited, right? And they're making out and it's feeling really good. And he's touching her and she's touching him and then all of a sudden she touches his inner thigh and he's like this and now he's thinking to himself, what the fuck is wrong with me? The gal who I'm into, I've been dating for a while is into me, is touching me in a way that should feel good. But I. Yeah, but is there any similarity to what happened with Uncle Mark when you were seven? Yeah, it was a hand on the inner thigh. Now, her hand was nice female hand. His hand was grubbing manhand. But still her brain will confuse hand to hand. Does that make sense? Right. Or it could have occurred around the same time. Right? Like I remember a woman, this is a crazy story. Not because she didn't have money, because she had enough money and all of her other bills would get paid. But she had the hardest time paying the electric bill. So much so that she would miss it and the electricity would be turned off. Crazy. No idea. Why? Come to find out, as we were clearing up stuff for her, she happened. She didn't even remember this. She happened to be writing out a check to the electric bill when she got a phone call that her daughter had been hit by a car. Daughter wound up being okay, thankfully. But you know what got stuck? That call and the electric bill. Because the part of the brain that merged them together wasn't logical. Logically we know that paying the electric bill doesn't cause kids to get hit by cars. That's not the same thing. But it co occurred, so it got merged as part of the problem. Does that make sense? And that can happen with this for as little things as facial expressions, tones of voice, times of day, times of year, smells, clothing. I remember a woman one time, she had met her boss's daughter who happened to be wearing a Christmas party lovely red dress. I mean, lovely green dress with a red silk scarf around her neck. And she's like. There's just something about her, she's like 13 that I don't like. What is it? Is she rude? Is she mean? Is she nasty? No, she was very pleasant and sweet, but I don't want to be near her. My boss's daughter, though, like, what's going on with me? Come to find out, when she was 19, she got raped by a large, fat, ugly, bald, grotesque guy, black in nails, who happened to be wearing a red bandana around his neck. Not same, but similar. She wouldn't even have known that those two even related together. Follow me with that. So sometimes we are totally consciously aware of the shit that has an impact. But then there's a whole bunch of shit back here that we don't know, that we don't know. That's also affecting us and probably even more make sense. So those pieces have one thing in common, it's distortion. Distortion in that if I take my hand and I slam it into the sand and I pick it up, it does leave an imprint. But it isn't the same thing as my hand. The meaning certainly isn't. What happened? She didn't put herself in danger and she wasn't being careless. She got dropped off at her apartment by her co workers friend. Right. And if a grenade goes or if a firework goes off in the air and the soldier dives on the ground, how different is the firework from the grenade? Very different things. So that's why I say instead of our job being to get it out, you actually don't have it trapped inside, you just distance from it. Which was useful primarily because when I think I feel so I'd rather not follow me. If I'm gonna live and survive in life, I don't want to be at the affected. I should all the time. Right. So it's not about getting it out. It's really more about unplugging the emotional effect that it's had so that I gain the strength and wisdom from having made it through the difficult thing. And it reads in my brain more as knowledge that wound is no longer active, so I'm not susceptible to things coming in that way. Does that make sense? Okay, any questions? Cause that was a whole chunk of information that I threw out all at once. Okay, following me makes sense. Okay, cool. So then the next piece to this is in order to do effective change work, we want our bodies to be in the right state for healing. Right. Healing is something that accelerates when people rest. So colds, flus, surgeries, what do we tell people to do? Get more rest. So we have some really interesting, somewhat unique, maybe a little different, scientifically proven brain levers that are designed to put the body more into a state of rest. And the first lever is the lever. That's silly. It's about slightly lowering our jaw. I don't mean ah, I mean just a little bit. I know that sounds silly and stupid, but the key thing is when you slightly lower your jaw, it stimulates the vagal nerve in the body, starting to activate it and putting the body into more parasympathetic response. Isn't that interesting? The second lever is about resting your tongue at the bottom of your mouth so your jaw slightly lowers and you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. When you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. It tends to cause a satiated feeling in the body and turns down more of the internal dialogue. The third lever is all about our breath. That we want to begin to breathe in a way that's just a little bit slower and deeper than how we automatically breathe. So that our exhale becomes just a little bit longer than the inhale. Right. So you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You now breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. That's right. So that your breath on the exhale becomes just a little bit longer than the inhale. Right. And as you're doing this right now, the. So just check. How's your body feeling? Like more tense or more calm? Calm, Right. Isn't that kind of interesting how that works? So the fourth lever is also an interesting one, and I'm going to explain it in this way. Beta brainwaves are the brainwave state that we're in when we're awake. So it's good for things like focus, concentration, communication, social engagement, conversation, things like arithmetic. But when beta waves spin at a higher hertz, it's where all anxiety, fear, angst, upset, worry, anger, frustration, it's where they all live. And what it causes is, and you may have heard this term before, more of a tunneled, like, vision. So it kind of narrows what I'm able to see. Right. What we want to move our body into for healing is more of an alpha wave set. Alpha waves are highly correlated with what athletes call being in the zone and what surfers would refer to as being in front flow. It's more of an alert, but also a relaxed state. And what signifies us moving more into alpha waves is when our awareness is able to expand, expand out with our peripheral vision. So how it works is you slightly lower your tongue. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. That's right. You begin to breathe in this way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. So that as you're breathing in this slightly slower and deeper way, notice that you can look across and see me. Now stay looking at me, but with your peripheral vision. Notice my fingers moving out. And as my fingers move out, notice that you can see them way out, wiggling, which means you're now becoming more aware of what's in your peripheral vision as you're staying looking at me. And as you're doing this, notice that you're aware more of the Space that with your peripheral vision, you can sense the side windows and the side doors. Right. You can sense the space between you and me in the space that's beyond me, the space that's underneath the couch and the space that's directly behind you, and even the space that's above your head towards the ceiling. And again, as you're noticing more and more of this space, just check inside. How's your body feeling now?
[37:24] B: Calm.
[37:25] A: Yeah. Isn't that kind of interesting? And then the last little lever that we're going to utilize is one that I find really fascinating, because if you've ever said or maybe heard other people say, I'm really overwhelmed or I'm under a lot of stress, in order for them to be under a lot of stress, where must the stress be in relationship to them? It's a weird question, isn't it? Right. But if I am underneath the roof, where is the roof in relationship to me?
[38:10] B: On top of you?
[38:11] A: That's right. It's got to be on top, over me or above me. So isn't that interesting? That's why stress feels sometimes like I've got a weight on me. We call it metaphorically, but kind of feels pretty heavy. Right. That we know that one of the solutions is to get the person out from under it so that they move out from under it and they start to rise up above it. Kind of like if they were in an airplane. As they go up, what happens to the stuff underneath them?
[38:48] B: It goes down.
[38:49] A: It gets down smaller.
[38:53] B: Yeah.
[38:53] A: Because they are rising up above it, having what we like to call another metaphor, a bird's eye view, which simply means I'm up above seeing things underneath and below me. But not just a perched bird. One of the cool things that a bird does is a bird is able to fly through sky, through space. A bird is able to glide and move easily, flowing with the wind, maybe making big turns and curves. A bird is frightened. Makes sense. And up above and over it all. So we want to have the same thing. So again, you slightly lower your jaw. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. As you're breathing in this slightly slower and deeper way, notice once again, you can look across and see me. But as you see me, my fingers move out. You begin to notice them wiggling. And then all the way out, with your peripheral vision, you can sense my fingers wiggling. Notice that as you're noticing all of that, you're connecting more to the space that's within this room. But you can also imagine how the space moves well beyond this room, that it goes all the way out in all directions and in all ways there's space. As you're noticing more and more of the space, just for a moment, go ahead and close your eyes. And you'll notice that with your eyes closed, your eyes can rest and you can sense even more of the space because there's no objects in the way. Imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body so that you go well beyond the ceiling and well beyond the roof so that you're way, way, way up above it all in the sky, having that bird's eye view, seeing things underneath and below you. But again, not just perched. A soaring, gliding, flying, moving bird in all ways and in all directions. Soaring, flying, big, wide turns, curves, arching angles. Soaring, moving, flying all around, free, above and over it all. Now bring your awareness back down and in your body so that you begin to reassociate inside you. When you're ready, go ahead and take a nice, slow, deep breath in. And then as you exhale, allow your eyes to open. Good job. Those short moments, eyes were closed. What a you notice within yourself.
[42:14] B: What do you mean?
[42:15] A: What were you just noticing as I was going through that process with you.
[42:19] B: That I was just calm.
[42:21] A: You were, weren't you? Which is a nice feeling to have and not always the one you have. Isn't that cool? Your body's wonderfully responsive and totally interested and working in ways that are beneficial and best for you. That's what's starting to change. So the last little piece before we move through clearing out stuff is I'd like you to think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something that as you're looking at it, it's just, like, beyond beautiful. You're, like, caught in it for a moment, like, wow. What is it that you see?
[43:00] B: Like water. I was at a lake in Oklahoma.
[43:03] A: Yeah. And wasn't there a moment that as you're seeing that lake, that you were feeling both peaceful and excited? And some people would tell you, well, dull. Of course, being there is going to give you those feelings. But if we looked at it from that other lens again, we could say that being there simply drew your awareness down, down and in towards your center. Because at your center, you always are peaceful and excited. In the same way, if my hands are cold and we're outside by the campfire, and I now begin to Move them closer to the flames. And I say to you, holy shit, this fire is getting hotter. Is the fire getting any hotter, or am I becoming much more aware of the heat as my hands draw closer to the flames? Right, so we could say then that in your life, there have been many times where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Stressors, upsets, angst, pains, guilt, shame, hurts. But no matter where your awareness has, has been always at your center. You're peaceful and excited. And, you know, two of us are in here because you can look around your senses, bring in that data. Your intellect organizes it. We think of that as knowledge. Sometimes people call knowledge light. So we'll call it light of knowledge. At your center, it's actually a brighter light. It's light of wisdom. So now we've got knowledge, We've got wisdom. And I work with all sorts of people who've gone through all sorts of awful stuff. And I remember working with this one woman now. She had done stuff, stuff was done on the street. She had shitty relationships, all sorts of other stuff. Childhood. One of her older brothers, when she was like six, used to take Matchbox cars, drive them up her leg, and then park them in her. And she had a whole bunch of ugh around all of that. But as we worked together, we completely cleared it all. The pain, the discomfort, the hurt, the anger, the resentment. This gone. And I was sitting across from. And I asked her the question. I go, you know, all of that, ugh. I go, where was it? And she looked at me and she goes, it's gone. I don't feel any of it. Said, I know. Isn't that cool? She goes, yeah. I go, but the question was, where was it? And as we started thinking, I asked her, I go, was it at the surface level? And she's like, no, dude, it wasn't intellectual. Well, then maybe it was at your center. She's like, really? How could that survive in light where I'm peaceful and excited? I go, well, then, where was it? She goes, ah, it was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I said, well, what's happened to them? She goes, the lights, they're now touching. The shadows are gone. I said, whoa, isn't that cool? And then we started thinking even more. Because most of the time, people walk around identifying themselves as their bodies and my body, that it's me. But what if you have a body? What if your body is totally yours, but it isn't actually you, that there's no cells in your body right now that are the same that they all get replaced probably millions upon millions upon millions of times. Feet alone are longer than they were when you were two. Yet despite the changes, you're you. Right. My mom, when she was 17, lost the tip of her finger in a snow cone machine accident. And when she goes over to visit people now, they don't say to her, susie, I'm so glad almost all of you could show up today. They don't say that. Why? Because she's totally all there, even if that part of her body's missing. So you have a body totally yours, but isn't actually you. You also think thoughts, but did you know that you're not really the thinker of your thoughts? That your brain is, and that your brain is yours, not you, which is weird. And we go, okay, well, maybe I'm my emotions, but you feel different ways at different times. Happy, sad, angry, glad. So you can't possibly be a feeling. Well, maybe I'm what I do, but there's lots of things you've done and lots of stuff you're gonna go do. But when you stop doing one of those things, did you stop existing? Leads us to a really weird question now. Because if you're not what you do, or your thoughts or your feelings or your body, then what the heck are you? So let's just say, for our purposes, with what we're doing in this room together today, that the who you are is what you became aware of as you see that lake. That the who you are, truly you, is the light at the center. And the light that's at the center can actually be touched, hurt or harmed. Whole and complete and indestructible. And I say that because people come in to see me, you'll never guess. And they fuck up identity all the time. They tell me things like, I am depressed. I am anxious. I am ocd, I am bipolar. I'm shy. They're thinking the way they feel is who they are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm upset, and as I'm coming back telling you about it, I go, you'll never believe what that asshole did. What did he do? I go, well, first he put me on one of those chairs, you know, where my head goes down and my feet go up, you know, like, well, yeah, of course, you're at the dentist. Okay, well, then he takes one of these lights and he shines it right in my eyes. I'm blinded. Yeah, you're at the dentist. I go, well, then he took this cold metal instrument and shoved it right up inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness. I go, but, Alyssa, I'm at the dentist. My mouth. Because I got one. I'm not one. But it's the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother when she was like, six. I said, your brother, he really messed with your stuff. And she looked at me and she had that glowing smile because, yeah, he did mess with my stuff. And it hurt my feelings, and it screwed up my thinking, and it affected a lot of what I did. But then she started to have that glow again. She goes, but you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body, screwed up my thinkings and feelings, but he never got me. I said, whoa, that is powerful. So one more time, go ahead and slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Begin to breathe in this way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. So that as you're breathing in this, slightly slower, deeper, longer exhale. Notice that you can see me. You can see my fingers out here and how they're wiggling. That's right. Noticing more of the space. As you're aware of the space, you can close, close your eyes. As your eyes are closed, you sense even more of the space because you no longer see the objects. And you begin to recognize that space is all around you and even inside that. You're made up mostly of space, the light that is you more and more okay in you. As things begin to lighten up, you already know what it might be like to float up and out of your body, while beyond the ceiling in the room, so that you go way up above it all in the sky, and you have that bird's eye view from above, seeing things underneath and below you. And not just perched, but soaring free to glide through the sky, through space, which is out in all directions and in all ways. Unending space, big curves turns soaring, flying. And at the same time, we're organizing towards this future you becoming more present, more clear, more lighter, more free and more okay. The other than conscious parts of your mind have also been listening to everything that I've been saying have been already marking different situations. Maybe ones that you remember, maybe ones that happened a long time ago, maybe ones that you might not even think have any effect now. But because your unconsciousness, it's begun to mark those moments so that when requested, it'll bring one of those moments to your awareness for us to unplug and clear out the effect that it's had. The Doing of which changes programming in you, provides freedom and energy because it's no longer stuck in dealing with that for you to reorganize. So as all of this is happening now, go ahead and bring your awareness back down and into your body, down towards delight at your center. And then when you're ready, what you'll do is take a nice slow deep breath in. And then a long exhale. And then one more deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And again. In those moments eyes were closed, what were you noticing for yourself?
[53:47] B: I'm not like, understanding what you mean by what I noticed for myself.
[53:51] A: Like, huh. Well, what are you noticing in you? Like, normally I might have all the different kinds of thoughts that I'm having. Maybe that's a little bit quieter. Maybe I'm noticing my body feeling a little bit more calm. Maybe I'm noticing that it's easier to breathe. And I'm finding myself feeling a little bit more at ease. Maybe I'm more tense. Maybe I'm finding myself anxious. Maybe my brain is room. I'm interested in kind of getting what's going on inside of you because I'm not there.
[54:22] B: It's wanting to not go.
[54:25] A: Go where? I don't know.
[54:27] B: I'm there, but then it just doesn't want to go anywhere else.
[54:33] A: Where is the there that you are?
[54:35] B: Like this, like, light place. But then it just goes dark.
[54:39] A: Oh. And what happens when it's dark?
[54:42] B: I don't know. I start to not think about it anymore.
[54:45] A: Think about dark?
[54:47] B: Yeah. Or like what? I just. I don't know. My mind's kind of just going everywhere when it happens.
[54:52] A: Mind goes dark.
[54:53] B: Yeah.
[54:53] A: Dark means it goes towards yucky stuff. And what we already know is you have done a really good job of making sure that whenever it starts going to yucky stuff, I stop and think about something else. Really good skill. But your mind isn't going dark because it's wanting you to feel bad. It's going to those experiences because we've started to request your brain begin to mark and target particular events, moments that would be useful to bring into the light and clear. Because the error that's been going on, the reason that there's still troubling emotions attached to any of those things isn't because of how bad they were. It's only because there's a part aspect of your brain that doesn't know that those experiences are over. So you and I kind of together are on a reconnaissance mission, Right? Think of a soldier who Happened to get separated from the troops in the jungle. And he's there by himself when the war actually ends and his side wins. But he doesn't know, he's never gotten the update. He's still in the jungle, on edge, constantly looking for enemy. When we find him going on that reconnaissance mission, do we not have really kick ass good news for him, right? War's ended, we've won, you get to come home really like for that guy, he'd be like, woohoo. You follow me with that? That's the same kind of good news that we want to be getting in to. Aspects of the brain that haven't fully updated. Does that make sense? Yeah. So what you've done is anytime that shows up, I don't ever want to feel. So do you know the best way to not feel past things is to intend to be emotionally with me? Because this, what we're doing right now, is totally what's happening. And that shit isn't. Two, we're working on a mutual goal that you and I are collaborating on, that we're both interested in for you. 3. And I don't set the bar very high, but I know I am at least a little bit more enjoyable to be around than awful fucking moments. Got it. So I'm gonna have you intend to be with me. Second part. My job is all about keeping you with me. If I notice that you're not with me, I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure you're back with me. Got it? Because we're organizing towards the future you. And with any of the negative experiences, remember, they got detached or disconnected from the rest of my life experiences. So what those moments don't know is any moment that I've had after a negative experience that for me was at least a little more enjoyable than the negative experience. And it doesn't have to be big ones, but it could be one as simple as, you know, putting lipstick on today. Probably more enjoyable than one of those yucky moments. Brushing my teeth might have been more enjoyable. You know, combing my hair might have been more enjoyable.
[58:57] B: You know, so am I supposed to bring. I'm not understanding what I'm saying.
[59:02] A: I know I didn't tell you anything to do yet, okay? That's why you're not understanding yet. It's so good. Alyssa, what we're doing is we're setting the stage for how we're going to go about clearing things, right? I didn't ask. Okay, so now what I want you to do is bring a thing up, we'll get there. And it doesn't matter how they come up or which order they're in or when they occurred. We know a memory is active not by how often I think of it, but because whenever I do, there's a negative charge attached to it. It creates a physiological emotional disturbance in me. Make sense? So many questions about that piece of things. Anything that I can clarify? Right. So again, you're going to intend to be emotionally with me. You notice what happens, by the way, when you slightly lower your jaw and you rest your tongue and you breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper. We're going to be creating distance from any of the things that had been troubling. So even in addition to you being here with me right now, any of those moments that have any amount of negative charge attached to it, we want to think about those moments as being much, much smaller and farther away. Kind of like if I were to take the iPhone screen and I were to place it down at the bottom of the door there, and even if we were to think about any negative thing, but as we think about it, we're thinking of it as if it's happening way over there and I'm watching it occur in that tiny, small little iPhone screen. Make sense? So we've gotten distance and you're above it because that's down on the baseboard. Make sense. So that's how we want to do. But again, we want your body into the right states so that your body stays more in that state of calm resting and open door awareness. So one last time, slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. That's right. Breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper. As you're breathing in this slightly slower, deeper way. You see me, you see space. That's right. As you're noticing space, check inside your body. How is it feeling now? Relaxed. It is. Right. And as your body's feeling relaxed, the other than conscious part of your mind is going to scan back through negative experiences that have happened. It's begun to group and categorize. And now narrow down, pinpoint one and bring that moment to mind. That would be useful for us to clear. Right. The moment that came to mind happened about how long ago you might have been how old?
[62:42] B: 20.
[62:43] A: Yeah. And the feelings that come up are feelings of what is it? Anger, hurt, sadness, guilt, shame, regret, remorse, angst, worry.
[62:53] B: Combination anxiety and fear.
[62:58] A: Yeah. So first question is, would it be okay to get the feelings Gone. Right. And if the feelings were gone, would it mean in any way, shape or form what happened was okay?
[63:09] B: No.
[63:10] A: Right. You actually get to be okay even if what happened wasn't. Follow me with that.
[63:14] B: Yeah.
[63:14] A: Right. Where sometimes people get stuck as if I'm okay, then it means what happened was, so I can't be okay. But as we look at it really clearly right now, you being okay now doesn't mean. Mean that any of what happened was okay. Got it. So how we clear it is you're gonna stay here with me because I'm more fun. My job is to keep you here. You're gonna tell me just facts. In a minute or less, really quick, it'll go, that happened, that happened. That happened, that happened, that happened, that was done. 3. Given that it happened when you were 20, what's something you've done after that moment? Anytime from heck yesterday until before till after that was over? Anything in that period of time that was more enjoyable than that moment? What's one thing?
[63:56] B: Going to the beach?
[63:57] A: Yeah. Going to the beach. Way more enjoyable than that. Good. Something else?
[64:01] B: Seeing my son.
[64:02] A: Yeah, seeing your son. Good. And one other thing.
[64:06] B: My best friend, Kendall.
[64:07] A: Like doing what?
[64:08] B: Hanging out with.
[64:09] A: Hanging out with Kendall. Right. Seeing your son going to the beach. All those moments happened after that. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moments beyond that. So we have good news to get in. So when that thing happened. You're 20. When it happened, you're where?
[64:23] B: When that happened?
[64:24] A: Yeah. That yucky thing. You're 20. You're where?
[64:26] B: I was at a hotel.
[64:27] A: So you're at a hotel. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[64:29] B: It was daytime.
[64:30] A: Daytime. And you were in the hotel, like, at the pool? In a room. In a room. Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[64:36] B: I was beat for seven hours.
[64:38] A: So you. So somebody came in.
[64:40] B: Yeah.
[64:41] A: Right. And they did what?
[64:42] B: They beat and burned me.
[64:44] A: So they hit you with fists?
[64:45] B: Yes.
[64:45] A: Kicks, Punches. Slaps. Right. Good. And then they, like, lit your skin?
[64:50] B: Yeah.
[64:50] A: Or your hair?
[64:51] B: My skin.
[64:52] A: Skin. And that hurt.
[64:53] B: Yeah.
[64:53] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[64:55] B: And then he let me go. After.
[64:58] A: Well, then he stopped.
[64:59] B: Yeah.
[65:00] A: Which was better than when he was doing that.
[65:02] B: Right.
[65:02] A: Good. And then what happened next?
[65:04] B: And then I left.
[65:05] A: And then you left. And then that moment ended. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to the beach or hang out with Kendall or see your son. Now, notice, even as you were recalling it, there was a little bit of discomfort. Not because that was so sucky, but because your Brain literally was confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience. It was causing the little bit of discomfort, trying to motivate you to get that moment to stop. Good news, it has. Now. Here's the craziest shit I'm going to tell you. You're going to be like, really? We never go backwards with a memory. Remember? Notice we go from beginning towards end. We never go from end towards before it happened. But when you go backwards, it literally unplugs the memory. It flattens out the neurons. It takes away the charge. So we're going to go in reverse. So we got, you know, hanging out with your son. We got seeing Kendall, we got going to the beach, right? And then you had left, and then he had stopped, and then he had burned skin, and then he had hit you multiple times, and then he had come in. And then before that, you've gone to that hotel room. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing now as I ran through it backwards compared to when you told it to me, forward emotionally, how was it.
[66:14] B: Easier to.
[66:15] A: Isn't that weird? Like, who would think? Really, going backwards makes it less, Right. Because your brain is beginning to read it as information about something that happened versus happened. Right. Now, here's the third part, and this is the really crazy part. Remember, though, that emotional brain does not get logic. It gets patterns of association. And the error that's happening is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening are glued together. So they're living as if they're the same thing. There are things, however, you can remember doing earlier today that you know with certainty you're not doing. Now.
[66:58] B: Explain that again.
[66:59] A: There are things that you know that you've done that you can remember having done that you know with certainty you're not doing right now.
[67:08] B: Yes.
[67:08] A: For example, putting your pants on.
[67:10] B: Yeah.
[67:10] A: Right. You can remember doing it. You can remember where you were in your room as you were doing it. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your pants on, and then I went, alyssa, stop putting on your pants. You look at me and go, but I'm not putting on my pants. Because, you know, there's a difference between remembering, doing it and doing it. Make sense?
[67:32] B: Yeah.
[67:33] A: So we want to play this stupid pattern of association game, because you can remember him doing that. Hitting you, punching you, slapping you, kicking you, burning. You're by. You can remember all that happening. Right. You can remember putting your pants on earlier today. Alyssa, stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants.
[67:49] B: I'm not putting on my pants.
[67:50] A: Well, then stop me from putting on my pants. Say you're not putting on your pants. Well, then you stop putting on your top. Say, I'm not putting on my top. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. See, you're not putting on your shirt. We'll stop him from hitting you. See, he's not hitting me. We'll stop putting on your sandals.
[68:04] B: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[68:06] A: Right. Well, then stop him from burning you. Say he's not burning me. Well, stop him from doing that. See, he's not doing that.
[68:10] B: He's not doing that.
[68:11] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[68:13] B: It no longer exists.
[68:14] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to get in to. The part of you that didn't fully know that make sense Right now, again, checking in as you're thinking about it, what are you noticing?
[68:26] B: It feels lighter.
[68:27] A: I know. Notice how there's already a little bit of relief, not thinking. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So then here's the last little part back then that you felt some of what he was doing had something to do with you. Yeah. Did it have anything to do with you?
[68:41] B: No.
[68:41] A: No. See, notice how fucking clear you are with that now. But then that was confused. Then you felt like him doing that had something to do with you. Right. In the same way, the kid who's got two Ds and two Fs, mom says, wait until dad comes home. Dad comes home, takes the belt off and starts wailing on the kid. The kid feels in that moment, dad hitting me has to do with me getting the poor grades. But does it. See, being a parent, you know that there's more than just that one way to deal with poor grades.
[69:16] B: Yeah.
[69:19] A: So it had nothing to do with the kid. It had everything to do with whatever was off with dad. So again, that earlier you didn't fully know that. So we're going to do this process that in a moment, I'm gonna have you close your eyes, picture the earlier you. You're gonna let her know that that moment is over, finished, completed, that it's defeated, that it no longer exists. You're gonna let her know this second part, and I want you to repeat these words after me. Here we go. It's. It's not about me. Right? It's not.
[69:59] B: That's not about me.
[70:00] A: That's right. Good. One more time so that she gets. It's not about me. Then we're gonna let her know about going to the beach and seeing her son and hanging out with Kendall. Got it. So go ahead and close your eyes. Think back to the earlier you letting her know that that moment, it's over, finished, completed, defeated, that it no longer exists. Letting her know that him doing that had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was fucked up with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Let the you know about going to the beach, about seeing her son, about hanging out with Kendall so that she gets it, that you're okay. And as that earlier you is getting it, what do you notice happening now to her face. That's right. That's right. What do you notice?
[70:53] B: Relief.
[70:53] A: Yeah. And you can open your eyes. Isn't that weird? Like, notice how as you think about that moment now, I want you to try to feel bad.
[71:03] B: Why?
[71:04] A: To see if you can. Right. That was a really good why. Listen, dude, I've done a good job of not thinking about that. Why are you thinking about it now? Right. The reason is, notice that as you think about it now and try to feel bad, it's not there. Notice that even in your memory when you look for it, it's not in the same place it used to be. Right. Isn't that cool? It got coded as data, right? Now it doesn't have a charge attached to it. I still remember that it happened. I still don't like that he did it. Some of it I can remember having hurt then, but I'm not actually hurting over it now. Right? Like, my body's not hurt right now. I can even touch a place that he might have hit then. And when I touch that place now, I don't feel that. Right. Isn't that cool? Because your brain has got fully updated. And that's what I mean. Part of what goes off with human beings is that our brain, when it comes to emotional wounds, just doesn't fully update. And we want it to update. Right? So again, you can slightly lower your jaw, you can rest your tongue, you can breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper. You can notice more of the space. And again, as you're noticing more of the space, notice how much easier and faster it is to have your body begin to feel even more and more calm and resting. Isn't that interesting? Right? And then again, the unconscious part is going to travel back through negative experiences that have happened in your own history, narrowing to pinpoint. And now to bring another moment to mind. Right. And what's coming to mind now? Yeah, that one. That's a Good one. So, again, you might intend to be with me because I'm more fun. Right. That one happened about how long ago?
[73:25] B: I was 23.
[73:29] A: Yeah. So you're 23. You're where?
[73:32] B: In Polk county at some house.
[73:34] A: So you're at a house in Polk county, right? Yeah. Upstairs, Downstairs.
[73:38] B: Downstairs.
[73:40] A: Right. Good. Right. And you're wearing the house, kitchen, dining, living room. Right. And you're sitting on a couch or.
[73:45] B: A chair in a dog cage.
[73:47] A: You're in a dog cage. Right. Good job. Good detail. And that was weird. Right. Good. Then what happened next? So you're in the cage. Well, before that, you had gotten put in the cage. So let's go to before. So somehow you got to the house?
[74:00] B: I was at a hotel.
[74:01] A: You're at a hotel. Right. Good job. Right. And then they took you from the hotel?
[74:04] B: Yes.
[74:04] A: Right. And then they brought you to the house?
[74:05] B: Yes.
[74:06] A: And then they had you get in the cage that was already at the house?
[74:08] B: Yes.
[74:09] A: Right. And then you got in the cage and then they shut the cage?
[74:11] B: Yeah.
[74:11] A: And then they put a lock on it?
[74:13] B: Yes.
[74:13] A: Right. And that was weird.
[74:14] B: Yeah.
[74:15] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[74:17] B: And then I was.
[74:18] A: Notice how you're here?
[74:19] B: Yeah.
[74:19] A: Yeah. Come back here. Hi. Good job.
[74:22] B: I was there for four days.
[74:24] A: So you're in the cage. Right. Was it big enough that you could lay down? No, no, not.
[74:29] B: I was in and out of it.
[74:30] A: Oh, good. So they put you in and then they took you out and they did.
[74:33] B: Yeah. They didn't do anything to your body? No.
[74:37] A: Right. But they took you out, like to walk you. Yeah. Have you go to the bathroom? Did you eat out? No. No. Then they put you back in. Yeah. Right. Did you eat in?
[74:46] B: No.
[74:46] A: No. You just didn't eat?
[74:48] B: No.
[74:48] A: Because you weren't hungry? No. Well, I might have been hungry, but they clearly weren't feeding. Right. Good.
[74:54] B: And then they. The dad came home.
[74:56] A: Right. Then the dad came home. Right. Good.
[74:58] B: And put a gun in my mouth.
[74:59] A: And put a gun in your mouth. Right. That was scary.
[75:01] B: Yeah.
[75:01] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[75:02] B: And then I was taken.
[75:04] A: Well, then he took the gun out of your mouth.
[75:06] B: Yeah.
[75:06] A: Right. Somebody did. Yeah. Right. Because it was there and now it's not there.
[75:11] B: Yeah.
[75:11] A: I mean, you can check. It's not there now, is it? Right. Good. That's much better. Right. Don't you think that it's not there now? Right. So somebody took the gun out. Right. And then what happened next?
[75:22] B: I started running down the street.
[75:23] A: Oh, so they took the gun out and then you Opened the door and ran.
[75:27] B: Yeah, it was out front. They pushed me out front.
[75:29] A: Well, good job they pushed you out front. Dad was there. Dad put the gun in. Somebody took the gun out. Yeah, right. And then you ran.
[75:34] B: Yeah.
[75:34] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[75:36] B: And then I was picked up by the person who took the gun out of his hand.
[75:40] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. Then that person drove in a car after you.
[75:44] B: Yeah.
[75:45] A: Right. And then they said, get back in the car. Yeah, Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[75:48] B: And then took me to his house.
[75:49] A: Then you got back in the car. Right. And then he drove you to his house, which wasn't that house. Yeah, right. Good job. Good detail. And then what happened next?
[75:55] B: And then he. In order for me to leave, he made me do sexual stuff with him.
[76:00] A: So he had you have sex with him, do oral with him. Do. Right. So he had you do oral. Right. Good. Then what happens?
[76:06] B: And then he let me go.
[76:08] A: And then he let you go, like, out of the house?
[76:10] B: Yeah.
[76:10] A: Right.
[76:11] B: Yeah.
[76:12] A: And you left and walked?
[76:13] B: No, I left in a car. It was a car that was. That brought me there. The whole situation was just.
[76:21] A: Right. So you left in and somebody drove you.
[76:23] B: Yes, the girl. The other girl that was with me. But we got split up.
[76:27] A: Good job. Right. So she drove the car back to, like, your apartment house.
[76:32] B: Her house.
[76:33] A: Back to her house. Good job. Which was better than when you were there.
[76:35] B: Yeah.
[76:36] A: Right. And then that moment was over.
[76:37] B: Yeah.
[76:38] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[76:40] B: Yeah.
[76:40] A: Like see your son.
[76:41] B: Yeah.
[76:41] A: Her. Go to the beach or hang out with Kenny. Going to the beach or seeing your son. Then you're back at her place. Right. And then she had driven you back to her place, and you got in a car, and then you had done the oral. And then he drove you to his place. And then he said, get in the car. Right. And then you would run. And then the gun was taken out of your mouth. Then it was put in your mouth, and you were pushed outside. Right. And then you'd been in the cage. Out of the cage. Into the cage. Out of the cage. Right. And then they had drove you there, and then they had picked you up at the hotel. And then before that, they'd come to the hotel. And then before that you're at the hotel, and then before that you were doing whatever you're doing. Right. And again, as it goes backwards, compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[77:22] B: I know.
[77:23] A: Isn't that weird?
[77:23] B: Yeah.
[77:23] A: Isn't that so weird? Right. You can remember that happening then. Taking from the Hotel, bringing you a place in the cage. Out of the cage. The gun, the world. You can remember all that happening? You can remember putting your jeans on. Alyssa, stop putting on your jeans. I'm not putting on my jeans.
[77:38] B: I'm not putting on.
[77:39] A: Well, stop putting in your hoops.
[77:40] B: I'm not putting in my hoops.
[77:41] A: Well, stop me from putting on my glasses. Say you're not putting on your glasses. Well, stop me from putting on my shoes. Say you're not.
[77:48] B: You're not putting on your shoes.
[77:49] A: Well, stop them from putting you in the cage. Say they're not putting it in the cage. Well, then you stop putting on your sandals.
[77:55] B: I'm not putting on my sandals.
[77:56] A: Well, then stop them from putting the gun in your mouth. Say they're not putting the gun.
[77:58] B: They're not putting the.
[77:59] A: Well, then stop that from happening. It's not. It's not happening.
[78:03] B: It's not happening.
[78:03] A: Right? Yeah. No. Stop it from happening. Hurry. Say it's not happening.
[78:06] B: It's not happening.
[78:07] A: Well, stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that.
[78:08] B: He's not doing that.
[78:09] A: Well, then you stop doing that. Say I'm not doing that.
[78:11] B: I'm not doing that.
[78:11] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Again. What do you notice happening to the feelings? Right. Notice how it's beginning to lighten up again. It doesn't mean any of the shit was okay, but you actually get to be okay. Right. And again, that happening didn't have anything to do with you. Right. Would it have mattered whether it was you or somebody else in that same situation? Isn't that what they would have done? Right? Yeah. Notice how much you've already survived strong. Right. Nobody goes, you know what? I want to go through really difficult shit. To become stronger. But you know what happens when you go through difficult shit automatically? No shit. And you get more resilient. And then we get it all the way in because that stuff stops being open wound. So I'm less susceptible. Right? Right. So again, close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You let her know that that moment is over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists. Right? Let her know that that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with them. Not about me. So that she gets it. Let the you know that you're okay. Let her know about seeing your son and going to the beach and hanging out the Kendall. Let her know so that she gets it. Let her know that she's clean and clear. That's right. And again, as all of this is getting in. What do you notice happening to her face?
[79:51] B: Calm.
[79:52] A: Yeah. And you can open your eyes. Isn't that a good news thing? So just check inside you right now, kind of scanning head, heart, and down. What do you notice in you?
[80:06] B: I feel better.
[80:07] A: You do, don't you?
[80:08] B: Yeah.
[80:10] A: Yay. Makes me really excited. Who would think, right? I mean, in all actuality, that this is what heals trauma. You know how many people do it the other way? I went to a training once. I was freaking mortified in it, okay? It was a training called Systematic Desensitization with Prolonged Exposure Therapy. And the woman was saying, I've got two boxes of tissues on each side of the couch. Which I do too. So I wasn't upset over that. And she said, what I do with somebody is I sit there and I encourage them to really get in the emotion of it. Like, really put themselves back in that situation. Like, what it was like to having been in the cage, getting out, to not sure what's gonna happen next, to really feel the emotion of it. How scary it was to have the gun and the right. Like to really feel all the emotion. That shit. It was fucking relief to just get the dude a blowjob. Fuck, I can get the hell out of here. I'm like, fuck, whatever. I'm like. To really feel, like, the pain of it. Emote and emote. And I get people and they are just, like, drenched in tears, snot coming out. And I'm thinking to myself, this is the most uncomfortable thing in the whole wide world. Why the fuck are you doing that? Like, yeah. And, you know, after six months of doing this work with that same person, each week, coming back, doing the same thing, you know what? They're a little bit better. And I go, like, why are you doing that?
[81:54] B: That's crazy.
[81:55] A: That's fucking crazy. First of all, who's the person that keeps coming back? Oh, no, this is the way to heal. Okay? That's why I said to you, no shit. No, I felt that bad. I'm not fucking going back to this. Crazy.
[82:10] B: Yeah.
[82:10] A: Like, that doesn't make any sense, right? So I told you right off the bat, you've already done the hard part. That shit was the hard part. Sitting here with me kind of going through the moments of it way fucking easier than the actual days that it was happening. Follow me with that. And what we're getting into, the part of your brain is, holy shit, I made it through that I'm okay that it's over. Because there were moments I'M sure during all of that that you weren't sure you were gonna live, that you weren't sure you were gonna make it. That you sure weren't sure you were gonna ever see your son. You sure weren't sure you were ever gonna be okay.
[82:49] B: Yeah.
[82:50] A: Right. Right. And now all of that has just gotten in to that part of you that didn't know. Right. Right. What are you noticing now?
[83:06] B: I just feel a lot better.
[83:08] A: Yeah. Like that.
[83:09] B: Yeah.
[83:11] A: Not what you're not. It's.
[83:12] B: When I think about it, it's not right. It's weird.
[83:16] A: It's totally weird, isn't it? Like, that is so foreign because anytime you used to think about it, it would do it. Now you can intentionally think about it, try to feel really bad, be mad at you, try to be really mad at you about having gone with them. Because I'm sure there's some of that, too, that was there before. Right. Probably some of you going, why the fuck did I go with them?
[83:45] B: Yeah.
[83:45] A: Right. Well, guess what? If you had known that when they came and said, come with us that that all was gonna go down, would you have fucking gone?
[83:55] B: No.
[83:55] A: Right? Hey, by the way, here's what's gonna happen. Come with us. We're gonna lock you in a cage, make you scared, make you not think that you're gonna actually survive. Put a gun in your mouth so that you really feel like we're gonna, like, kill you. Ready? Grab your bag. Dude, I'm fucking out of here. Like, no, thanks. You can take your purse. Come on. No, I'm good. I'll stay. Right. But again, that you back then in that situation, didn't know, even if they said, you know what, and you were using at the time. Well, we've got a whole bucket filled with drugs for you yet. No, I'm still not going. I'll figure out a way to get him elsewhere, you know? Like, fuck, man. You follow me with that?
[84:43] B: Yeah.
[84:43] A: Right. So that's where it also starts to begin to lighten up on you because we really want you to be easier on you. Because people always make better decisions when they feel good. We don't make good decisions when we feel bad. Not at all. Got it. Yeah. And again, just check inside. What are you noticing within you?
[85:14] B: And that's just concentrating a little better.
[85:17] A: Oh, it is, right. Notice how it's easier to be right. Outwardly focused, like that's starting to slow and quiet down a little.
[85:27] B: Yeah.
[85:28] A: Yeah. It'll make it easier in conversations to be able to connect when it Makes sense to, because I don't even know where the fuck they're coming from. Right, right. That's so good. So again, go ahead and slightly lower your jaw and right your tongue and breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper. And I'm not suggesting that this process that doesn't take very long is also a really useful process at different times, not just now, for you to be utilizing ongoingly in your life. Because it's all about getting your body into the right states.
[86:11] B: That's right.
[86:11] A: And notice how much easier it is to get your body to be more in that state of rest. Notice how different it is to connect not just to me, but to the space in here. Right. Isn't that cool? And again, as you're doing all of this, that other than conscious, will travel back through things that have happened in your own history. And again, narrow, pinpoint and bring another moment to your awareness. Well, what's coming to mind now? Boy, those times in your early 20s, they had to be fucking awesome. I was 17. 17? Yeah, you're right. So you're 17, you're where?
[86:59] B: @ my boyfriend's house.
[87:01] A: To your boyfriend's house. Good. Daytime or nighttime?
[87:04] B: Nighttime.
[87:04] A: Nighttime. And you were in the house, like, living room.
[87:06] B: Oh, I'm sorry. It was the daytime.
[87:07] A: It was daytime. Right.
[87:08] B: And you're wearing the house in the bathroom.
[87:10] A: You're in the bathroom.
[87:11] B: Right, Good.
[87:11] A: And like on the toilet or by the sink.
[87:13] B: I was using the bath.
[87:14] A: You're using the bathroom. Right, good. And then what happened next?
[87:17] B: My friend started yelling from the back shed.
[87:20] A: Yes. Right. So you heard somebody yelling from the back shed and that was weird. Right, good. Then what happened next?
[87:25] B: I went out there.
[87:26] A: Yeah. So you got off the pot and went. Right, good. And then what happened?
[87:30] B: And we both found her boyfriend.
[87:34] A: Yeah, good job.
[87:35] B: Overdosed, Right. Dead.
[87:36] A: So he was laying there and you both found the body.
[87:38] B: Yeah.
[87:39] A: That was fucking scary.
[87:40] B: Yeah.
[87:40] A: Right, good. No one happened next.
[87:42] B: I called my friend Stacy first.
[87:44] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right.
[87:45] B: And then called the police.
[87:46] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened?
[87:48] B: And then the police came.
[87:49] A: Right. Good job. Right.
[87:52] B: They took him.
[87:53] A: Yeah.
[87:54] B: And then that was it.
[87:56] A: And then that moment ended.
[87:57] B: Yeah.
[87:58] A: And then later on, you did something more fun.
[88:00] B: Yeah.
[88:00] A: Right. Like go to the beach. Yeah. Her see your son.
[88:02] B: Yes.
[88:02] A: Hang out with Kennel. Hang out with Kendall. We got going to the beach. We got seeing your son. Right. And then the police had taken the body. Right. And then they got there and then you had called them and then you called Stacy, and then you had seen the body, and then she was screaming. Well, then you had gone out there, and then she was screaming.
[88:18] B: Yeah, Right.
[88:18] A: And then you've been on the bathroom.
[88:19] B: Yeah.
[88:20] A: And then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing. Yeah. And again, as we go backwards compared to forward, what are you noticing?
[88:27] B: It's not as.
[88:31] A: Right. We still don't like that it happened. Yeah, Right, Right. And by the way, when you found the body, he wasn't in it. Right. That's why it was cold.
[88:42] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[88:44] A: Right. Isn't that weird? Right? Like, when we're young and even now, like, going to a funeral, like, and you touch the body, they don't feel the same way they used to because they're not in it. That's that whole essence of, like, when people's bodies stop, it's not that they stop, it's that their body stop because they're no longer needed at the exit. It. We don't pick them up in the same way we did, but we don't pick up radio waves until we turn on a radio, because we don't have the way to pick up those frequencies within us. Does that make sense? Right. Like, our senses get limited in our scope and what we can perceive and understand. That's why bodies feel different. And you can remember all that happening. You can remember putting on your pants. Alyssa, stop putting on your pants.
[89:33] B: I'm not putting on my pants.
[89:34] A: Well, then stop getting that tattoo.
[89:36] B: I'm not getting a tattoo.
[89:37] A: It'll stop me from getting this tattoo.
[89:38] B: Don't get that.
[89:39] A: So you're not getting this.
[89:40] B: You're not getting this tattoo.
[89:41] A: Well, then stop finding that body.
[89:43] B: I'm not finding that.
[89:44] A: We'll stop her from screaming.
[89:46] B: She's not screaming.
[89:47] A: Well, then you stop putting on your sandals.
[89:48] B: I'm not putting on my toes.
[89:49] A: Well, stop painting your toes.
[89:50] B: I'm not painting my toes.
[89:51] A: We'll stop me from painting my toes. Stop painting your toes.
[89:54] B: You're not painting your toes.
[89:55] A: We'll stop it from happening. It's not happening.
[89:58] B: It's not happening.
[89:58] A: Yeah. So where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[90:00] B: It no longer exists.
[90:01] A: Right. And again, we don't like that that happened. But notice what's happening within you now. And what do you notice?
[90:11] B: That it's not. And it's feel the same.
[90:15] A: Right. Right. By the way, he actually has been doing better with that moment than you two have, because he's actually not troubled by it anymore. Right. Einstein was a smart dude. The only Reason that I know that he was smart is that everybody after him who's really smart is called Einstein. So right. They do that to be brilliant. He said two things that are really interesting for this conversation. Who we are is energy plus matter equals this physical existence and that. What became the second law of thermal dynamics is that energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. So when the body stops working, it's not that they stop, their body stops, they exit it. We don't pick them up in the same way, but we know that if we take a glass of ice and we put it out on the patio and an hour goes by, Kit looks and goes, oh, my goodness, somebody stole the ice, replaced it with water. We would educate the kid and go, no, but he stole it. It melted, went from solid TO liquid. But H2O molecule is the same. Okay. We leave the glass of water. A week goes by. Kid comes back and says, somebody stole the water. They drank it. No, nobody stole it. Nobody drank it. It evaporated. Went from liquid to gas. But H2O is H2O. How we perceive and pick it up totally changed. Kid goes, wait a minute. But if I don't see it, how can I feel it? We go, right? Because you live in Florida, it's fucking all around you, man. We put him in the desert in Arizona. We go, you don't feel any of it here, do you? And we bring him back to forward and we show him the rain clouds and we capture the water and he discovers it's all the same thing. Isn't that interesting? So again, notice what's going on with you. That. That stuff starting to lift and lighten. Because although we're not going to light, the moments that happen, they don't have this same charge or feeling tone attached. Yeah. Any guilt or bad feelings attached in that moment now. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah. So things are beginning to reorganize. And again, your brain knows it's going to travel back. Another moment's going to be brought to your awareness. What comes to mind now?
[92:26] B: When I was living, I was in my apartment.
[92:30] A: Yeah. So you're in your apartment. Good. Daytime or nighttime?
[92:33] B: It was nighttime.
[92:35] A: And you're where in the apartment as this is happening?
[92:37] B: In the living room.
[92:38] A: So you're in the living room, like on a couch, chair. I couldn't know what happened next.
[92:43] B: I made a shot for myself. Like drugs, Right?
[92:48] A: Good. So you got it all set up. He did. I pulled right. I didn't. Good job.
[92:52] B: I didn't do it right.
[92:53] A: Good job.
[92:54] B: I couldn't find vain. Right.
[92:55] A: Good job. Right.
[92:57] B: And I ended up. I was with someone else.
[93:01] A: Yeah. Good job, good detail.
[93:02] B: This kid, Miles.
[93:03] A: Yes.
[93:04] B: And I felt. I nodded out.
[93:06] A: Yeah, Right. Good job, good detail. Because you're already up.
[93:08] B: Right. And he took that rig.
[93:10] A: Right. Good job.
[93:11] B: And he did it.
[93:12] A: Right. Good job, good detail.
[93:13] B: And he woke up or I woke up.
[93:16] A: Yes.
[93:16] B: And he was overdosed.
[93:17] A: Right. Good job, good detail. And then what happened? And then.
[93:20] B: So I called the ambulance.
[93:21] A: Yeah, good job. Right.
[93:22] B: And they came.
[93:22] A: Yes. And did they give him the Narcan?
[93:25] B: He didn't survive.
[93:26] A: Right. Good job. Right. So they came, they realized.
[93:28] B: They tried to.
[93:28] A: They tried. Right. And I didn't like, do it.
[93:30] B: Yeah.
[93:31] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[93:33] B: And then they took him and then got everything that they needed for me.
[93:41] A: Yeah.
[93:43] B: Then they left and it was over.
[93:46] A: Right. And then later on you did something more fun.
[93:48] B: Yeah.
[93:49] A: Like those beats.
[93:49] B: I was horrible saying it like that.
[93:50] A: But yeah, but no, I mean, that was. It's not as if you said, you know what would be really cool? I hope that I leave this. That he does it and dies. You know what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and nod out. I was going to use it myself, but I couldn't find a vein. So instead I'm going to nod out and hope that he sees it and uses it for himself and dies. Right. Was any of that going through your mind at that time?
[94:17] B: No.
[94:18] A: No, not at all. Did you even want him to die?
[94:23] B: No.
[94:23] A: No. That's why immediately you called the police or 91 1, which got you the ambulance here, while you have all sorts of paraphernalia and other shit. Right? Like, if I didn't care about him, I'd be like, alright, let's figure out a way to hide all this shit, get it all gone.
[94:41] B: No, I didn't do that.
[94:42] A: You didn't do that? No. You didn't, did you? You immediately called as soon as you realized that he doesn't look like he's doing okay. Right. Right. Which is all about your caring. Right. Even if you know at the time you were fucked up and using. Right. So you can remember that happening, Right. You can remember them taking the body, them coming, them getting all the information from you. You calling, you seeing him, you waking up, you nodding off, you getting it set up, you having done it earlier or different one? Earlier.
[95:19] B: Yeah.
[95:20] A: Right. You can remember all that happening, right? You can remember putting your pants on.
[95:24] B: Yes.
[95:24] A: Melissa, stop putting in your pants.
[95:25] B: I'M not putting on my pants.
[95:27] A: Stop me from putting in my pants.
[95:28] B: Don't put.
[95:29] A: So you're not.
[95:29] B: You're not putting it.
[95:30] A: Well, then stop him from using that needle. Say he's not using that needle.
[95:33] B: He's not using that.
[95:33] A: Well, then stop that from happening. Say it's not happening.
[95:35] B: It's not happening.
[95:36] A: Yeah, so then where is it? Say no longer exists. Bingo. Again, we want to get that in and see. It's not that I don't care, because you totally care. That's why you called. But we also want to get in that there are moments later in life or better. Oh, and by the way, we want to also get into that you. That you're clean. Clear. How long has it been now?
[95:56] B: A year?
[95:57] A: How cool is that? That's cool, don't you think? I mean, that's fucking amazing. Yeah, like really, really amazing. Because that shit ain't easy to get off of. Yeah, right. There's a lot of that has my body be wanting and seeking. And that ain't easy to get off. Right? So we want to get all of that news in. So again, close your eyes. Think back to that. You. And letting her know that it's over, finished, that it no longer exists so that she gets it. Knowing that he's actually been doing better with all of it than you have for a while, having you realize that you absolutely did the thing that was for you to do because you care. Right? Let the you know that it's been a year. You're clear, clean, clear from all of that. How cool that is to feel the difference in you. Let her know about seeing her son, been hanging out with Kendall. Let her know that you're okay. That's right. Again, as that's getting in, what are you noticing now? Right? Because what's also clear, Alyssa, is you're being okay now. Doesn't mean that what happened was okay. Right? Right. And it's not as if he's thinking, God, I hope she fucking is in pain every time she thinks of this experience. Right. In the same way, think of the guy whose buddy happened to be in the Hummer ahead of him. And they just rotated and their Hummer hit the hike and blew up and Buddy died. Now he's got a lot of guilt. Should have been me. Could have been me. How come it wasn't me? How come it was them? How come it wasn't me? Right? They had this. I didn't have this, like, you know, all that survivor guilt that goes on as if. If it were in Reverse. You'd be wanting the person to continue to feel really shitty. Right, right. Like his buddy would be going, you know, I really hope that his life sucks every time. No, buddy would go, hey, I'd like you to have a really great life, and maybe you're gonna have a really great life and life work even better for you. And maybe that can be an honor of what happened to me. Yeah, right. Like, we wouldn't want to have you be clean and sober in honor of things that happened to people that you cared about when they all had been using. Right, right, right. That you actually, you know, being clean and clear is really good for all parties involved. Right. That you crawled through the sewage system in alf. Right. Ever seen the Shawshank redemption movie where a guy's in prison, wrongly, for a long period of time, and every day he kind of dinks this hole, and for years he would just bring the gravel in his pockets and dump them out so that nobody would know that he created a hole that cut him out and he had to. To go like a mile through the sewage to get himself out. And he survived and he got out and all that kind of stuff. Yeah. That's like what you did. You got dragged through lots of awful, yucky stuff. How freaking amazing and resilient you are. I mean, really resilient. Right. Like, you just keep getting up.
[99:56] B: Yeah.
[99:56] A: Yeah. Right. That's pretty darn amazing.
[99:59] B: Yeah.
[100:01] A: You wouldn't want to actually feel really good about that. That's right. Right. What's it like for that to start getting in?
[100:09] B: What do you mean?
[100:09] A: Like, the you being more okay in you.
[100:18] B: I feel. I feel better.
[100:20] A: You do, don't you?
[100:21] B: Yeah.
[100:21] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool? Right. Right. Yeah. You didn't realize that all that shit going on with mom was gonna be training.
[100:33] B: Yeah.
[100:34] A: A lot of boot camp so that I can make it through the. They're difficult. Yeah, right, right. I mean, because that's what happens when somebody enters the military. They go into boot camp first. Right away.
[100:48] B: Yeah.
[100:49] A: Right. And then they move through boot camp, but they're going to go into other forms of specialty stuff. They go through, like, another version of another boot camp, but more intense. They make it through that, then they go through another version of another boot camp. It's more int time. They get stronger and they become more resilient. Yeah, Right. You're pretty amazing.
[101:21] B: Thank you. Thank you.
[101:24] A: Yeah. Yeah. So again, another moment's gonna come to. Isn't that interesting? Notice how there are other moments, but as you're recalling them Right now they're not having the same feelings that we didn't even actually talk about them, and they've already changed. Isn't that weird?
[102:02] B: Yeah, I really can't think of any right now.
[102:09] A: Isn't that weird? Because even the ones that you are, it's like. It doesn't really.
[102:14] B: Yeah, it doesn't seem like.
[102:20] A: Right. Notice how different that is.
[102:28] B: I can't really think of one.
[102:31] A: Yeah. Yeah. So as we're checking in with different things, because there's aspects of stuff that I want to get resolved that have to do with mom, but I also want to check in with you because there were times that you were out on the street and there were times that your body was something that you utilized or that other people utilized, and that was a way that you made a living, earned an income, whatever. My question, in all of that, were there times that it was you directing it? Were there times that it was somebody else directing it for you?
[103:14] B: There was somebody. There was a time where it was.
[103:17] A: Yeah. Where it was somebody else that was directing it for you. So how did that whole thing get started?
[103:25] B: I met him online.
[103:26] A: Okay, right. So you met a guy online.
[103:28] B: Yeah.
[103:28] A: Right. And he came to you?
[103:31] B: No, I went to him.
[103:32] A: You went to him. Right. Good. And then what happened?
[103:34] B: And then I started working for him.
[103:39] A: Well, he might have done what first? Like, as you got over there, was it like, hey, I'm, you know, posting for a job interview?
[103:46] B: No, no, no. But I knew what I was going.
[103:49] A: To do over there.
[103:51] B: Yeah. In Iowa, right?
[103:53] A: You knew. You're gonna. So you went from here to Iowa?
[103:56] B: No, I went from Virginia to Iowa.
[103:57] A: Virginia to Iowa. So you got. Met the guy in line. He said, hey, I've got a job for you.
[104:02] B: No, I knew what I was doing. I knew that I was gonna go be a sex worker.
[104:07] A: Yeah, Right. Good job. So he said, I've got a place for you to be. Yeah, right. And you went there?
[104:12] B: Yes.
[104:13] A: Right, Good. And then what happened?
[104:14] B: And I worked for him.
[104:16] A: Did he have, like, a house?
[104:18] B: No, he stayed out of hotels.
[104:20] A: Right. So it wasn't like we were actually doing, like, Bunny Ranch. No sex. Working where? I have a location. I have a place that I stay. I go to this particular spot. People come to see me at this particular spot. You guys were with different people? Maybe some of the same people, but in different locations at different hotels. Yeah, Got it. All right. So you went there. Right. Good. Then what happened?
[104:47] B: I had to work for him and give them all my money.
[104:51] A: All of it?
[104:52] B: Yeah.
[104:52] A: Oh, well, that doesn't seem like a good job. No, no. A lot of taxing.
[104:56] B: Yeah, all of it. And then, you know, he was abusive, so.
[105:00] A: Right, Good job. Right. So he would hit you.
[105:02] B: Yeah.
[105:03] A: Like with a object or with a fist. Slap. Right. And face. Arms. Yeah, Right. Some of that hurt. Yeah, right. Good. Then what happened?
[105:12] B: And then I went to. After several months.
[105:17] A: Yeah, right. Good job.
[105:18] B: I went to a cop.
[105:20] A: Yes. Good job, good detail.
[105:22] B: Warrant out of Florida.
[105:23] A: Yes, good job, good detail. Get me the back to Florida.
[105:26] B: Yeah. And then, hey, Mr.
[105:29] A: Officer, here's who I am. I've got a warrant. Could you get me out of this situation? Because that's way better than that. Yeah. That is resourceful. Again, how cool is that? Right. So then you told the officer, then what happened?
[105:46] B: And then I was arrested.
[105:46] A: The officer looked it all up and said, oh, yeah, no, right. And then what happened next?
[105:51] B: And then I went to jail and then got extradited back to Florida.
[105:54] A: Right. And then that moment is over. And you got away from her. Right, Right. Because again, there were certain times when all of that was going on. Because when you went out there, you weren't thinking, oh, you know what? I'm gonna go have stuff happen to my body and give him all of the income from it. That sounds like a great. I mean, oh, and do I have to pay my own way out there? Totally. I'm totally in. You know, because, like, I just want to donate to that charity, so everything that I make just goes to somebody else.
[106:28] B: Yeah, I didn't know that.
[106:30] A: Right, right. Because again, if you had known that it was going to be that, would you have gone?
[106:35] B: No.
[106:35] A: Right. That's right. But again, just check. There were also moments as that was going on with him when there was the physical stuff happening, even though you were giving him the income, or you would think at least, you know, like, you know, treat me cordially if I'm, like, the one paying for everything.
[106:52] B: Yeah.
[106:54] A: Like, where's the perks? Where's the bennies? Yeah, Right. But there were moments that you weren't sure you were going to be able to get away. Right. And then you're like, oh, wow, police officer. Hey, dude, guess what I am. Like, how fucking awesome is that? Yeah, right. Like, where did you see the cop? How did that even, like, pop to mind?
[107:17] B: He was at a hotel, like. Cause. And I guess helping someone else or someone else was having an argument.
[107:23] A: Yeah. So he'd gone to the hotel because maybe of a domestic dispute.
[107:26] B: Yeah.
[107:27] A: And then you walked over to him. Right. How Cool. Is that. Yeah, Right. Like, that's resourceful. Right. So, again, knowing all of that stuff, go ahead and close your eyes and let that earlier, you know, of course, that all that stuff is over. It's finished, it's completed, it's defeated, that it no longer exists, that you got out of there. Again, getting it in. You didn't know that that's what it was going to be like when you went there. Right. So again, you get to lighten up on you and then let the. You know how you got out, you know, in, like, that sneaky way, resilient way. Oh, look, there's a police officer, huh?
[108:08] B: Yeah.
[108:08] A: I'll spend a couple nights in jail. That's more enjoyable than what I've been doing. Then I'll go back to Florida, top. Hey, better than Iowa, right? And again, as all of this is getting in, what do you notice?
[108:25] B: Did I feel better?
[108:26] A: I know. Good job, Alyssa. Good job. Yeah. I've been in Iowa once. I had a friend that coached soccer at University of Wisconsin, Platteville, and he lived in Dubuque, Iowa. And the only thing that I remember about Iowa is that we went out to a bar, and in that bar, they had to have probably a hundred or more stuffed dead animals.
[109:02] B: Really?
[109:03] A: Yep. Fucking weird.
[109:04] B: West Des Moines and Cedar Rapids.
[109:09] A: Yeah.
[109:09] B: And Quad City.
[109:12] A: Yeah. It was the weirdest thing that I'd ever seen. Like, big, like, glass case in the ceiling that had, like, a big, dead polar bear. You know, deer and what is it? Elk. Like squirrels, Chipmunks. I'm like, this place is weird. It's called Paul's Tavern. Weirdest fucking thing I've ever gone into my life.
[109:41] B: That's funny.
[109:43] A: Yeah. But notice. Chat. Notice how you actually feel better. Right. Because, again, that stuff's getting reformulated in you. Make sense? So it wasn't. Right. Like, the. The whole nature of things. And then there had been other times in Florida that, for lack of better words, you were your own boss in that regard. So would you be, like, posting stuff on backdoor, Craigslist, other kinds of ways? Were you at establishments, clubs, that kind of thing, or.
[110:17] B: Yeah, I did. Online.
[110:20] A: Online, mostly. And then would it be something that they came to where you were or that you went to where they were? Both. Both. Okay. So. And that was just agreements made and conversations nothing ever happened with, like, undercover, with a cop? Yeah.
[110:36] B: Yeah. I've been arrested for it once.
[110:38] A: Huh.
[110:39] B: Yeah. I was like, 21 or 22.
[110:42] A: How'd that happen?
[110:43] B: I showed up and it was just.
[110:46] A: Because it was like, a You would contacted me. Contacted you, like, text her online stuff, right?
[110:52] B: Yeah, and then I went there.
[110:53] A: And then you went there.
[110:54] B: And then they gave me money outside.
[110:59] A: Of the hotel room, which is weird. Yeah. Yeah.
[111:03] B: And they. And then when I was walking towards the said hotel room.
[111:09] A: Yeah. Good job. Good detail.
[111:11] B: They all came out, like, with masks on and bum rushed me into it.
[111:17] A: Geez. I didn't. I thought it was just one person. I didn't think it was everybody. Yeah, well, this is gonna cost us more. Like, what the fuck, man? That's right. Good job. Right. See that? You're getting kidnapped. Right, Good. And then what happened?
[111:30] B: And then they took me. Me to the police station.
[111:33] A: Yeah, Right. And then I went chill. Then eventually got out. Right. And again, you can remember all that happening. You can remember putting your top on.
[111:41] B: Yeah.
[111:42] A: Come on, stop putting on your top.
[111:43] B: I'm not putting it on.
[111:44] A: Well, then stop them from doing that.
[111:46] B: They are. They aren't doing it.
[111:47] A: They're not doing that, right?
[111:48] B: Yeah, they're not doing it.
[111:49] A: Good. Well, stop it from happening. Say it's not happening.
[111:51] B: It's not happening.
[111:52] A: So the m. It's. It no longer exists.
[111:53] B: It no longer exists.
[111:54] A: That's right. Good job. Right. And again, what are you noticing now?
[111:58] B: I feel better.
[111:59] A: Yeah. Right. Isn't that weird?
[112:01] B: Mm.
[112:01] A: Right. So even in those things. And notice how much faster it's going.
[112:04] B: Yeah.
[112:05] A: That things are lightening and lifting and clearing because it's not feeling so heavy. My fault.
[112:11] B: Yeah.
[112:12] A: Right. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. That was when police officers had been thinking that everything has to do with, you know, prostitution.
[112:25] B: Yeah.
[112:26] A: Versus that there's this other evil thing called trafficking. Yeah, that happens.
[112:32] B: Yeah.
[112:33] A: Right. I mean, I remember early on in Sarasota, we had to actually educate the law enforcement who thought, yeah, no, Sarasota has a minor prostitution issue. No, no. Sarasota actually has a trafficking issue because not all of these women are voluntarily doing this thing.
[112:52] B: Yeah.
[112:53] A: Oh, and there's also a secret drug piece that's going on in addition to that. Right. Like. Oh. Oh, yeah. Wow. All right. I guess you're right. Yeah. Huh. Right. So what happens with you with Crossroads? Like, how long is it of a program for you?
[113:19] B: I have, like, three more months left.
[113:20] A: Okay.
[113:21] B: Yeah.
[113:24] A: And then what's the result of that? So you've gone through Crossroads, you got hooked up through Selah. Is some of that through Tyla?
[113:32] B: Yeah.
[113:33] A: So you have some stuff that will help eliminate, like, felonies and misdemeanor stuff. That's cool.
[113:40] B: Yeah.
[113:41] A: Yay.
[113:41] B: Yeah.
[113:42] A: Oh, that's so good. Oh, that makes me happy.
[113:46] B: I will not be a convicted felon.
[113:47] A: Yay. How cool is that? Oh, my goodness. Oh, good for you.
[113:52] B: Yeah.
[113:53] A: Yeah. And then, like, what's your kind of like, okay, I gotta go through this program, and then what's your thoughts after that? I know you said something the last time about being able to move back in for a little bit with Mom. Is that an idea or no? No.
[114:06] B: I'm gonna go to a halfway house maybe. I mean, it's always a possibility, but I don't know.
[114:10] A: So you'll go to a halfway house?
[114:11] B: Yeah.
[114:12] A: And at that point, you can start, quote unquote, working.
[114:14] B: No, I work now.
[114:15] A: Oh, you do?
[114:15] B: Yes, at Metro dining.
[114:17] A: Nice.
[114:18] B: Yeah.
[114:18] A: Okay. I didn't realize that through that program you actually get to leave. You do the lovely, fun campus. I can't believe they got rid of the pool.
[114:28] B: I know. I used to. I was there one time when there was a pool.
[114:31] A: They got rid of the pool. Like, I used to go there and do a talk with Bob Piper. Bob Piper, who did the Bob's boxes thing. So I would go like once a month, and after he did his Bob's boxes, I would do a little trauma resolution talk. They don't have a pool anymore. At least I'll have the volleyball net.
[114:52] B: Yes.
[114:57] A: Okay, so then are you gonna continue to work at that?
[115:03] B: And then, I mean, I would like to. To go to school to be a realtor.
[115:09] A: Nice.
[115:10] B: That would be nice.
[115:13] A: Okay. Yeah. There's lots of things to sell here. Yeah. And the market right now is unbelievably ridiculous.
[115:24] B: Yeah.
[115:26] A: No matter what it is, cars, homes, like, they're all like, above market value.
[115:32] B: Yeah.
[115:33] A: It's just. It's a weird time right now. Yeah. Okay, so that's all cool stuff. Good job. So now we want to do stuff that takes care of things that happen with mom. And we don't have to go through every single thing that happened with mom. But there's gonna be moments that pop. That we want to get unplugged. Because in those moments, that's when the first camera lens got stuck stuck inward. That this behavior and these actions have something to do with my worth lovability, whether I'm okay. Because remember now you know that mom wasn't well then. But for a long period of time, you didn't know that mom wasn't well. And part of that time, it felt like mom not being well had something to do with you. Got it. So we want to re Educate that younger you too. Right. So again, as it just kind of trails back, what's a moment that comes to mind?
[116:39] B: I mean, I don't really know, like specific moments. It was kind of like as.
[116:47] A: Like a whole. It is as a whole. So here's the best way to think about it, because it's a whole. There had to be moments. Right. If somebody said to me my dad was a bastard. And that's because there's a generalization of a lot of times a dad acted that certain way. Well, we still want to narrow down or think of it as one time that he did. Because what your brain, emotional brain, is really good at getting. Taking the one and extrapolating out to the rest. What it's not good at doing is taking the big and narrowing. Okay, Right. Like how we learn, we learn on one and then it applies to the rest. Like tying shoes. We learned on one pair. We didn't get green, red, blue, orange, yellow, white. Let me show you how to do it on green and then on red and then on blue and then on an orange, on a yellow then a white. We just learned on one pair. Once we mastered how to do the bunny rabbit ears or the one lace and the other thing, we were good. We got it. We could do it on any of them. Even boots. Yeah. So we think of it even though there's a conglomeration, but let's kind of narrow it, thinking of it as one time that it did. And by the way, you can make it up. Cause we're really going for structure, not content.
[118:18] B: When she hit me in front of my friends.
[118:21] A: Well, yeah, you might have been how old?
[118:26] B: 14.
[118:26] A: Right. So you might have been 14. Your friends had come over.
[118:29] B: Yeah.
[118:30] A: Right. And you know you're a 14 year old doing what 14 year olds do. Right. Then what might have happened?
[118:36] B: She just started going. It didn't make any sense. Crazy. And just started hitting me.
[118:41] A: She got all upset over something. Yeah. And then you guys were like in the living room or in your bedroom or in the living room?
[118:47] B: In the kitchen.
[118:48] A: Right. Good. And then she came over to you?
[118:50] B: Yeah.
[118:51] A: And then she started hitting you?
[118:52] B: Yeah.
[118:52] A: Like with fists. Slaps.
[118:54] B: Yeah. Grabbing my hair.
[118:55] A: Grabbing your hair. That hurt.
[118:56] B: Yeah.
[118:57] A: Right. Did you hit her back?
[118:58] B: No.
[118:59] A: No. Right. And then what happened next?
[119:02] B: Then I went out front and.
[119:04] A: Oh, then she stopped.
[119:05] B: Yeah.
[119:06] A: Which was better than when she was doing that.
[119:07] B: Yes.
[119:07] A: Right. Then you went outside.
[119:09] B: Yes.
[119:09] A: Which was better than being inside.
[119:10] B: Yes.
[119:11] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[119:12] B: I started talking to one of my friends about it and Then that was it.
[119:15] A: That was over. Right. And then later on you did something more fun like go to the beach, see your son. Going to the beach, seeing your son. We got talking with your friend out front. Then her stopping and then her hitting you, and then her going off on something and then them all coming over and again. As it goes backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it easier? Right. And you can remember mom being that way in the same way you can remember putting your pants on. Stop putting on your pants. We'll stop mom from doing that.
[119:44] B: Mom isn't doing that.
[119:45] A: Yeah. So then where is.
[119:47] B: Doesn'T exist.
[119:49] A: Right. And again, close your eyes and think back to that earlier. You let her know what you know now that it's over, finished, that it no longer exists and that mom wasn't well. Then let her know that mom not being well had nothing to do with you. Had everything to do with mom being unmedicated and using a problematic substance so that she gets it. Let the you know that you didn't need mom to be well in order for you to turn out okay. To turn your life around. Right. To get clean and clear from using, to begin to free up from the effect that stuff has had. To have future visions of where you're headed and going, what you want to be doing. That's right. And as that earlier you is getting it, what do you notice now?
[120:50] B: I feel better.
[120:51] A: Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. And of course, you know, real estate has selling involved. Right. And sales skills translate because it doesn't matter what you're selling.
[121:06] B: Yeah.
[121:06] A: I mean, this job is a sales job. We're always looking win, win. But it totally is a sales job. My job A, is to understand the pain. Right. That's what sales is about. B, to begin to think of, like, how what I do can be a solution to the pain and then be able to share it in such a way that it's something that somebody can actually buy into and that we can actually do stuff to relieve the pain. Right. It's all of that. That's right. What are you noticing now?
[121:43] B: That I feel better.
[121:48] A: Right. Notice how you feel lighter. Right. Notice how you're feeling more okay in you.
[121:54] B: Right.
[121:54] A: Try to get, you know, you know, lots of shame, guilt. Try to feel really resentful, angry. I feel really, really hurt over some of this stuff that happened.
[122:10] B: I can't.
[122:11] A: No. Isn't that weird?
[122:12] B: Yeah.
[122:12] A: Right, Right. That on purpose you're trying to get it and it's not actually showing up. Right. What's another weird thing. Crazy thing that mom might have done.
[122:30] B: She's hit me before. Just at another house that we lived at. I was by myself.
[122:36] A: Yeah.
[122:39] B: She was drunk and.
[122:41] A: Right. And she hate you. Right. And you can remember her doing that?
[122:46] B: Yeah.
[122:46] A: Right. And as you're remembering that happening now, what do you notice.
[122:53] B: That it doesn't feel as, like, shameful or it doesn't feel as it did.
[123:02] A: Right. Mom not being well, did that have anything to do with you? No. Did it have anything to do with your deserving being hit?
[123:12] B: No.
[123:13] A: No. Or not deserving being hit. Right. Had nothing to do with deserving at all. Right. Notice how different that is.
[123:23] B: Yeah.
[123:24] A: Right. That you're more okay in you. That the lens isn't reading as somehow it means something about me. Right. Right. Isn't that a good news?
[123:39] B: Yeah.
[123:40] A: Yeah. And notice, by the way, that that's different than it's ever been.
[123:45] B: That is.
[123:46] A: Yeah. Yeah. So I wonder what might happen because, like, you know, you're going to be in grand groups. That's part of the Crossroads program.
[123:54] B: Right.
[123:55] A: They have to sit in groups. And I wonder what happens if, like, you know, somebody starts sharing about, like, one of those things that they went through, you know? You remember how it used to be? Like, I didn't get why they'd be upset over that.
[124:08] B: Yeah.
[124:09] A: Right. That is nothing. Right.
[124:15] B: I can have more compassion for it.
[124:18] A: Right.
[124:18] B: Because I can understand. I did have feelings. They just obviously weren't showing up or I wouldn't let them show up, you know?
[124:26] A: Right. Because the thing was, it couldn't just show up as fitting the situation. If they started to happen, it's like the fire hose turning on. It's all fucking coming out. So if it's all coming out because it's all underneath the surface active, then I can't let even a droplet come out.
[124:49] B: It also sometimes makes me feel like I'm feeling that emotion, too.
[124:54] A: Of course. Right. If I could. If I get swirled up in their thing, then it takes me back to my similar thing. That's what I meant by the brain will confuse. Similar is same. So this person is talking about whatever it was that they went through, and you went through something similar, and now your brain has mapped it and all of a sudden you're in it. Yeah. I don't want that to happen. I got none. I'm going to sit aloof and overhear her.
[125:38] B: Yeah. That's pretty much how I handled it.
[125:40] A: I know, but that was the only way to handle it.
[125:44] B: Yeah.
[125:44] A: Because there wasn't Fluidity in being able to move through it. And it wasn't that I couldn't not get tied into it. So the only way that I could do is kind of be off over there.
[125:56] B: Yeah.
[125:57] A: As they were telling this, which made me look like I've got no empathy, compassion, or concern for other people at all.
[126:05] B: Yeah.
[126:05] A: Like that. I just don't care. It's not that I don't care, is that I couldn't care. Because if I started to care, then I get swallowed in it, too.
[126:14] B: Yeah.
[126:17] A: And I don't want to get swallowed in it. No offense. I don't want to get. Right. But notice now you're developing more range in how you respond things. Does that make sense? Right. Lots of people think that I got to choose, but frequently. And I know that you've done your genogram.
[126:40] B: Yeah.
[126:41] A: Right. What's different about things for you now is that you're not finding yourself at the effect of what you had gone through. But you didn't choose to go through that stuff. Right. You didn't get. You didn't choose to be born to that mom with that mental health issue.
[127:01] B: Yeah.
[127:02] A: With that drinking problem. You didn't decide, you know, it would be really cool when I come into this planet and into this body to be born to her, you know, the last go round. Because, you know, there's more than one go around. Of course. Right. The last go round was so much easier. I need a fucking roller coaster. The last go around was just, you know, the easy train ride that went in a circle. So I really need something that gives me what I want to experience the breath and the depth of emotion this time around. No. Didn't go down that way. You didn't choose to be born to that mom. Right. You didn't choose to be born in that environment in which you grew up in. And with those things that happen, they led to other things happening. Right. While you were growing up with their. With that mom, was there any other. I got that there was physical violence and yelly stuff, so we got verbal abuse. Was there any stuff that happened sexually? No, not with mom, but during that time frame that was unwanted sex stuff.
[128:27] B: When I was 15, I was raped.
[128:29] A: Oh. That would be one to get cleared, don't you think?
[128:32] B: Yeah.
[128:36] A: Right. Cause that wasn't a choice.
[128:39] B: Yeah.
[128:39] A: No. So again, you want to be with me because I'm fun. At least more fun than that. So you're 15. You're aware what happened.
[128:45] B: I'm at this guy's house.
[128:47] A: Right. So you've Gone over to his house.
[128:49] B: Yeah. He was selling drugs.
[128:50] A: Right. Good job. To get something.
[128:51] B: Yeah.
[128:52] A: Right, you were getting.
[128:53] B: Yeah.
[128:54] A: What? Crack. Crack, right. Good job. Good detail, which is what you want to use at 15.
[128:59] B: Yeah, no, but.
[129:01] A: But again, remember, notice the environment in which you were born in. That led that to be something that would come to mind to do, which is all about something that could take me away from the distressing feelings that I have living in what I'm living in. I don't care what it is. Right. So, I mean, when you really think about it, we want to get out of the idea that somehow it meant something about me, that those were things that came to mind. They would come to mind based on anybody who was in that situation at that time, living through that stuff, trying to figure out a way to survive.
[129:38] B: Yeah.
[129:38] A: And if I found something that immediately took away the pain, and then, oh, by the way, that thing's got a fucking addiction nature to it. I'm gonna do something that takes away the pain. Make sense?
[129:50] B: Yeah.
[129:51] A: They did an experiment. There's a guy, Phil Zimbardi, Dr. Zimbardi, and he did an experiment called the Stanford Experiment, where they basically had college kids, half of them be prisoners and half of them be guards. And the amount of stuff that the guards did to the prisoners, and we go sitting on the outside, well, I would never act like that. I'm hoping my own moral compass would prevent me from doing these atrocities that these people were doing. Except we can't say that when we're in it because we got groupthink. We've got all the other stuff that goes on with. So you went over there to get the substance. Right. And then what happened next?
[130:28] B: And then I got left there.
[130:29] A: Right, you got left there. Right. So the person who.
[130:31] B: The. My friends who brought me there, left me there.
[130:33] A: Left you there?
[130:34] B: Yeah.
[130:34] A: After they got the stuff. Yeah. Oh, well, that was nice.
[130:37] B: Yeah.
[130:37] A: Is it okay, we're out of here.
[130:39] B: Well, then I just. I started using drugs with a guy. Right.
[130:41] A: Good job. Right. Which made sense.
[130:42] B: Yeah.
[130:43] A: I mean, it's there. Why not?
[130:44] B: Yeah. Right.
[130:44] A: Good.
[130:44] B: Know what happened? I had Xanax.
[130:48] A: Yes. Good job. Good detail.
[130:49] B: And then I fell asleep.
[130:50] A: Yes. Good job. Goodita.
[130:52] B: And then I woke up and he was having sex with me.
[130:55] A: He was having sex with your body. So he had pulled off some clothes. He had put his penis in your vagina. He was doing that. That was a hell of a way to wake up. Then what happened next?
[131:04] B: And then I started doing more drugs with him.
[131:06] A: Well, he'd done that, and then he stopped. Right. And then that part was over. And then you did more drugs. Right. Good. And then I'm gonna have an ex.
[131:14] B: And then I went to my friend's house. And then you left the one that was staying at.
[131:19] A: Yeah. Good job. Then you went to our house. Right. Good. And then that moment ended.
[131:23] B: Yes.
[131:23] A: And then later on, you did something more fun, like see your son hanging out with Kendall Beach. Right. So Kendall seeing your son, you're back at that friend's house, and you left, and you did more drugs, and then he'd stop. Then you woke up with that happening, and then you'd nodded out, and then you'd done some drugs, and then they. Then they had left, and then you had gone over there. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[131:43] B: Yes.
[131:43] A: And again, as it goes backwards, compared to forward, emotionally on, was it not as bad? Right. You can remember that happening. You can remember. Put your hoops in. Stop putting on your hoops.
[131:52] B: I'm not putting in my hoops.
[131:53] A: Well, stop putting lipstick on.
[131:54] B: I'm not putting lipstick.
[131:55] A: Well, stop me from putting lipstick on. So you're not putting on.
[131:57] B: You're not gonna put on lipsticks.
[131:58] A: So you're not putting lipstick on. Stop him from doing that. He's not doing it.
[132:02] B: He's not doing that.
[132:02] A: Right. So then where is it? Saint no longer exists. That's right. By the way, he never touched you. He messed with your body. I'm gonna give you an example that. Right. So if you were to repeat these words, right? I have a nose.
[132:17] B: I have a nose.
[132:18] A: I have ten fingers.
[132:19] B: I have ten fingers.
[132:20] A: I need two elbows.
[132:20] B: I have two elbows.
[132:21] A: I have ten toes. But I'm not my toes or my elbows or my fingers or my nose or my nose. Right. I have a vagina. I'm not my vagina. It's mine, but it isn't me. Right. I'm going to show you something. So if you take your hand like this, right? And you want to look at just that spot there. And if I take my hand and I move it towards your hand, you'll notice that as it moves in and it gets closer before it touches you. Feel my hand.
[132:51] B: Mm.
[132:52] A: Isn't that cool? That's weird, right? Which means I'm coming closer to touching who you really are. That's so weird than anybody that ever messed with your stuff or your body, because who you are can only be touched with respect and love. Right? So he messed with your stuff. Right. But he never touched who you really are. Right. Which is what we want to get in that any of that stuff that happened to your body, whether it be stuff that you did intentional on purpose or stuff that happened to you, they never got who you really are. They messed with your stuff, but. But they never touched you. Right. Take a deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. And then that hand just drops down, down, down. As you also drift deeper and deeper down and inside towards delight at your center. The calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy that is you. That's right. Your unconscious responding, integrating that wisdom and knowledge. That there's no single cell within your body now, that's the same as any of that stuff that happened. That he may have messed with your stuff, but he never got you. Because who you are can't be touched. And that way. That's right. That even there was different stuff that had happened to your body. Some of it willing, some of it unwilling, some bit more than what I thought it was going to be. That even in all those moments they messed with your stuff, they never got. You are becoming more and more at peace inside. You're lightening up on you. You're becoming more and more okay in you. That's right. You're directing your life now. Not based on what you grew up with, not based on the environment you got forced into being into and all the stuff that went along with that. But now you're choosing to change your life for the better. To become even more of who you really are.
[135:26] B: That's right.
[135:29] A: Worth it to you. You're becoming even more worth it to you. More okay in you. More at peace with you. And even looking back, seeing how strong and resilient and tough, no matter how many times you got knocked down, you got back up, that you're still here and that you're seeing a better life for you and those that matter to you. And you're engaged in doing it now. Knowing that some of the steps along the way might be challenging, but you already know how to make it through difficult stuff. That's right. See all of this, this is integrating those seedlings which sprouted roots have now begun to rise up and out of the ground, becoming more and more like the picture on the package. You are becoming more and more of who you really are. Okay. In you. That's right. And then when you're ready, you can take your time, find your way all the way back up and out. And eyes are open. What did you notice in those short moments? Eyes were closed.
[137:29] B: It was really peaceful and very bright.
[137:33] A: Yeah, right. Right. Try to get into that dark stuff now.
[137:43] B: I can't.
[137:46] A: Isn't that cool? Yeah. Right. Notice how it's not dark now?
[137:50] B: Yeah. Yeah. That's cool.
[137:54] A: Right? Light got rid of the darkness.
[137:57] B: Yeah.
[137:57] A: Right. Right. Yeah. Isn't that weird?
[138:06] B: Yeah. I feel a lot better.
[138:07] A: Yeah, I bet. Right. And we know that you can try to feel bad about this stuff and is not doing that. But the whole purpose of resolving, freeing you from the effect that this stuff has had is about you now being more okay in you reading other people's stuff as being about them. And of course, dependent on the circumstance and the situation where you're at. You may respond in a way that's more compassionate, caring, understanding. You may respond in a way that's more informative or more direct. You may just let it go by because there's nothing for you to say or nothing for you to do. But there's more range in how you respond to things that you're finding yourself more emotionally present. Meaning the emotional states match the situation. Make sense?
[139:09] B: Yeah.
[139:09] A: That you're more outwardly focused and that it's quieter up top so that it's easier for you to be more at peace inside. That doesn't mean that we live life as bliss. No. There are going to be ups and downs with life. What I want you to begin to pay attention because we'll get back together one more time. But I like this next time to have you have like a few weeks so that a, you begin to notice what you notice that's new and different for you. And that's what I want you to start paying attention to. What do I notice that's new and different for me? And it might be in a situation where normally I'd be a diagnosis for distant and I was actually engaged and. Okay. Right. It might be after the fact that I'll go through something and think back and go, normally it would have been all. And I don't have that. That's kind of cool that normally in a situation I might get offended by what somebody looks or. And it didn't do it to me. That's kind of cool. I like that. That's neat. Right? So I want you to pay attention to what you notice that's new and different. Sometimes it might be I got triggered, but it didn't go as high or if it went, it didn't last as long or it's not happening as frequent. Right. I want you to begin to notice what you notice that's new and different. Right. If there are other things that come to mind. We'll get those clear. They're easy, fast to do because we've already got the foundation laid. Right. Notice how quickly and even faster we went through other stuff.
[140:49] B: Yeah.
[140:49] A: Right. Because your mind and I, we all know how to work together and we know what we're doing and we're all aligned with it. Make sense before it's like you got to go through the steps to get to where we are that we can start making changes. Once you do it, it's a, you know, you got the ball rolling, it's easier to keep it rolling. Right. That hardest change is from something stopped to make it move or something moving to make it stop.
[141:15] B: Yeah.
[141:16] A: Once you got it moving, it's just easy to keep it going. Right. So those are the things that I want you to pay attention. I want you to pay attention to what you notice for yourself. Maybe it shifted. You know, you laying down at night where this used to be overactive, now it's easier for that to quiet down. You have a wonderful tool you can utilize, which is that slightly lowering the jaw and resting the tongue and breathing a little bit slower and open up awareness. Sometimes being up above. Right. That's a wonderful tool that if you utilized a couple times throughout your day or even first thing in the morning to do that breathing piece for just a few minutes will set the day in the right place. Right. There will be moments that as you move through your day, whether it be at work or other stuff, there's going to be the stressors. Right. It might be a time where normally it'd be something that really would piss you off in lim linger. And yeah, maybe you reacted to it, but again, it didn't get as high and then it was over.
[142:14] B: Yeah.
[142:15] A: And so it wasn't ruminating in you. You're like. Because the emotional states are more matching the current situations. They're not current situations plus past which escalates and elevates. So that's what I want you to pay attention to in terms of what you notice for your. Okay. Does that make sense? Yeah. And then we'll get back together in like a month or so so that we make sure we've got everything working the way that we want it to and that you're, you know, still moving in the directions that are going to be really good for you.
[142:54] B: Yeah.
[142:55] A: I'm really excited about all already prior to you coming in here. All of the positive changes that you've already made. Made for you. Like that is amazing, remarkable and really, really cool. Like you've gotten a year away from all that substance stuff, and that's, like, amazing. Right. And now we're doing a whole bunch of stuff that the substance stuff had started off as a solution to the unwanted emotions, but there's also an addiction to it which had me get looped by it.
[143:31] B: Yeah.
[143:32] A: Follow me with that. Like, if it was that, it was PRN use as needed. Okay, fine. But it got looped so that I then had a yearning to do it and then it would stop. Not even working for all that stuff.
[143:46] B: Yeah.
[143:46] A: Right. So we got clear from that. Now what we've done is cleared out the emotional effect, the past, so it's not weighing on you. You're not feeling those heavy, strong emotions. There's not the guilt, there's not the angst, there's not the worry. There's not the tension. Right. Yeah. Cool. You've done great.
[144:10] B: Thank you.
[144:11] A: Any other things left for you for today that we didn't get to? Any other questions you might have before we stop? For now. Cool. Awesome. Well, it was really great connecting with you.
[144:25] B: Yeah, I enjoyed it.
[144:26] A: Yeah. Awesome. Cool.
