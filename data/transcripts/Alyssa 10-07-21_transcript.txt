[00:00] A: Okay, so Today is the 8th. 7th. Sorry, the 7th of October. And Alyssa, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And again, given what we do is useful and valuable, it may be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:16] B: Yes.
[00:17] A: Cool. So first, give me an update in terms of how our last session left you. What have you been noticing for yourself? How have things been?
[00:30] B: I don't know. I'm more. I feel like I'm a little more easygoing than I have been, and I feel like I'm a little bit more empathetic towards people's situations. I can connect more with them, and I have noticed that. So I noticed I was a little angry, like, the first few days. Like, I didn't know why. Like, it wasn't. I was just. Maybe because I just didn't like that I was connecting or something. I don't know. But. But then it just. It smoothed out. Things are a lot more just easy going for me.
[01:14] A: Cool. Which is how we want it to be.
[01:15] B: Yeah.
[01:16] A: Yeah. So not so ups, downs, and not so having to keep things far away or bottled up.
[01:25] B: Yeah.
[01:26] A: Cool. When you think about the experiences that we talked about and cleared. Not that necessarily they came to mind, but even as you kind of think about them now, what do you notice in terms of how you feel?
[01:42] B: I don't really have much of a feeling towards it.
[01:45] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[01:48] B: It kind of just is what it is. It was something that happened.
[01:53] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool? Notice how it doesn't have the same.
[01:58] B: Weird feelings to it. Yeah.
[02:02] A: Which is a really good news thing. That's how we want that to be. And even as it comes to mom, because we know that there was a whole bunch of early stuff with mom and mom was unmedicated, bipolar with an alcohol problem. Now Mom's better. Right. She's not drinking to the same extent that she was. She's.
[02:27] B: Yeah, she's not drinking at all.
[02:28] A: Well, that's even better.
[02:29] B: Yeah.
[02:29] A: Okay, good. And. And does she have, like. Is she more regulated, medication wise? Okay. And she has a child of yours currently, right?
[02:39] B: Yeah.
[02:39] A: So there's probably a. What goes on in my mind. Again, I don't want to mind reading what might be going on over there with you, but I would imagine that there would have been some conflict in that. I have some gratitude and appreciation that she's taking care of my little one.
[03:00] B: Yes.
[03:00] A: And that's great. While I'm getting myself back up and on my feet and ready to go out into the world. Yet there was all this like, okay, you're a better grandmom than you ever were a mom.
[03:13] B: Yeah.
[03:14] A: Which. Okay, great. Like if that's the case, I'm grown up and I've got somebody that you're taking care of. Okay, great. But still like there's like a.
[03:24] B: No, I don't really too much feel like that because I don't know, I don't feel like feeling like that would make anything different. So. You know what I mean?
[03:35] A: Sure.
[03:36] B: It's not going to change the fact that I grew up the way I grew up.
[03:39] A: Yeah.
[03:40] B: So. And I just, I'm so happy because I don't want Aiden to grow up like that.
[03:45] A: Right.
[03:46] B: So.
[03:46] A: Right. Which is really cool that like she got her shit together.
[03:49] B: Yeah.
[03:50] A: Even if it wasn't for you.
[03:51] B: Yeah.
[03:52] A: Or early enough for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And even when you think about cuz one of the things that you shared, which is it isn't funny but you know, it's kind of funny like you have friends over and mom in one of her spells comes and you know, hits you in front of your friends and then eventually stops and then you're out on the porch just chatting like okay, anybody else get this was the fucking crazy shit that just happened.
[04:21] B: Yeah.
[04:22] A: Like I can just imagine a younger you, like outside with your friend going like what the fuck do I do? Like I didn't even do anything. I could just imagine that scenario going. She's like that. Yeah. So really relieving at least in one aspect that she's better than she was. She's getting medication, she's not doing problematic drinking.
[04:48] B: She doesn't put her hands on people. She doesn't. Yeah.
[04:51] A: That's way better. Yeah. So what has it been like being. Because you're going through program. Right. And you're also interested in, if I'm remembering correctly, future going into real estate, that kind of thing. So. And were you also had you already started working or had just started working, not necessarily in real estate, but doing something.
[05:20] B: Yeah.
[05:21] A: Say more about that. What are you currently doing work wise?
[05:26] B: Oh, I work at Metro Diner.
[05:28] A: Oh, right. That's what it was. Right. How has that been? Right. Going from being in program working, beginning to manage stuff, still having responsibilities around group stuff and other kinds of programming stuff that they have. How have you been managing all of that?
[05:53] B: Well, I just, I do what I'm. I'm supposed to do and I'm at where I'm supposed to be at. And if I have to go to work, I go to work. And if I have to go to group, I go to group. It's. It's not really. Has never been an issue. I don't really get in trouble or.
[06:14] A: You're good at the rule following thing.
[06:15] B: Yeah, so I am. And if I don't want to do it, I just do it. So.
[06:23] A: Yeah.
[06:24] B: You know what I mean?
[06:25] A: And I would imagine based on all the other stuff, you also stayed away from or out of a lot of the quote unquote drama that might show up in being in a residential place because there's drama that shows up right on the free time or the. Maybe not drama is the right word. Maybe the gossip. Right?
[06:47] B: Yeah.
[06:48] A: There a world of like gossip that happens.
[06:51] B: Yeah. It's kind of like you're living in a. In a house with like, there's I think like 72 people on that campus, you know?
[06:58] A: Yeah.
[06:58] B: So yeah, there's all that. I don't really engage in it. I mean, obviously if it's like where it's being talked about in a group setting, then I can't control what other people are saying, but I don't have to respond to it or like to feed into it. You know, I. I'm very cordial with everyone.
[07:22] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[07:24] B: There's no one that like, we just like dislike each other or anything like that. So.
[07:30] A: Okay. How has like other things, Ben, like sleep. Have you noticed? I know you said more easygoing, like less irritation, agitation, angst, less thinking. Right. Because a lot of times what kind of spins us up is our brain becomes overactive or over analyzing or overthinking. How has all of that been.
[07:59] B: Good? I sleep well, actually.
[08:02] A: Yeah, I do.
[08:06] B: So I'm not.
[08:09] A: Like.
[08:10] B: My mind isn't race like crazy.
[08:13] A: Well, that's cool.
[08:14] B: Yeah.
[08:15] A: Yeah.
[08:15] B: You know, I had like a pretty bad scare. I don't know if I. I told you this about. I think I might have or I don't know if I told you with. My counselor called me and it was right before work or not right before. Right before I started working, as I was looking for a job and he called me into his office and proceeded to tell me that lab results came back from the health department and I was HIV positive.
[08:51] A: Oh my. No, I didn't hear anything about that. Holy shit. Okay, well that's a good thing to have first thing in the morning.
[09:00] B: Yeah. Well, I'm not HIV positive, so that's great.
[09:02] A: Thank goodness. Yay.
[09:03] B: But he tells me that I Am. My labs come back and I'm HIV positive, and I'm not expecting this at all. And I'm like, what the. You know, like, I thought I was taking labs for my thyroid. Like, what are you talking about?
[09:15] A: How did you even get to there?
[09:17] B: Yeah. And he's like, I guess it was like, annual lab, so they, like, it's. They test for just, like, everything.
[09:23] A: Wow.
[09:24] B: And. And first of all, I don't think my counselor is, like, certified to tell me news like that, first of all. I mean, he's like a. A social worker, so I'm not sure, but I just don't feel like that he was certified to tell me something like that. And then when you tell.
[09:39] A: That might come from the nurse or the doctor's office.
[09:42] B: You think that a doctor would tell me I'm diagnosed with aids? Right. Like, he's telling me this, and he's like, oh, and by the way, your.
[09:48] A: Grandmother died and we ran over your dog.
[09:49] B: Yes. This just doesn't seem like. Because I feel like someone certified would not just be like, I'm so sorry. I'm so. Last thing I want to hear is, I'm so sorry. You know what I mean? Like, that's the last thing I feel like someone wants to hear, because it was a whole 24 hours that I. Now I'm trying to process that I have hiv, you know?
[10:08] A: Right. So now it's like, okay, we bring you in early in the morning as you're getting ready to go.
[10:13] B: No, it's actually at night.
[10:14] A: Oh, at night. Oh, good. Even better. So that I can just, like, think about that tonight.
[10:18] B: Yeah. Oh, my gosh. I didn't sleep. It was.
[10:19] A: I bet that night you didn't sleep very well.
[10:21] B: I didn't.
[10:22] A: Dude, I.
[10:23] B: It was so worse. Dude, I can't tell you what it feels like for someone to tell you that you're HIV positive. And then. And I'm like, so I got to the first. Or I went to. When I got to first step, you know, because I have you. I was a sex worker for so many years, and I have used needles, so that's a real life consequence. It's something, you know, so that was always a fear of mine that. What if I did have this? You know? So when I got to first step, they tested me, and I was negative. And I had been in jail for seven months, and it only takes two weeks for them to find it in your. In your blood. Once you. If you come in contact with it, you know, the longest, I think, is like three Months that it could take to become. Their tests are so advanced now. So I'm like, okay, I'm good. You know, when I first got there. And then, you know, I'm taking labs for my thyroid and whatever. And so it didn't make any sense to me. And I'm like. And I called my mom immediately and I told my mom and my mom tells my grandmother. So now it's like, you know, it's all. Everyone's freaking out about this, as they should be, you know, and they're trying to look at, like, funding that they can get for me and, like, insurance that they can put me on that will cut, like, you know, and they're just like, we're gonna get through this. And then my mom's like, but this doesn't make sense. You got tested. And I'm like, I know. And she's like, so have you used. Have you had sex with someone? I'm like, no, mom, I haven't. She's like, that this isn't making sense. And when she said that, it clicked. I was like, that's right. I did get tests. And I. I went and I grabbed my negative results and I'm like, this doesn't make any sense. So anyways, the next day they had an appointment set up for me for the Rhine or the. At the health department, but to sign up for, like, Rhino White, which is like, it's the insurance that pays for people that don't have money, the medicine or whatever. So I go in there and it's so, like, fast paced. They're like, sign me up for all this. Like, sign here, sign here. And don't worry, we can get you housing and we can get you all this stuff. And like, I'm just like, still trying to process that. I can't. I'm crying everything. I'm in the middle of, like a n. A meeting and I'm just like. I'm just like crying. And everyone's like, what's wrong? And I don't know how to. I can't tell them this. I don't, you know, and so I'm just. I'm like, oh, I have hep C and my liver is messed up. You know, that's just where I go to. Because I don't want to be like, oh, I just found out I have hiv. I was like, this close to going to Coastal because I didn't know. It wasn't because I want to kill myself, but it was because I didn't know how to process it. Being around all These happy people that are like, what's wrong? Because they genuinely care about me, and I'm crying at, like, everything, and I don't cry.
[13:03] A: I know. That's, like, up. They're like, there's something really going on.
[13:07] B: Yeah. Like, dude, there's something up with her. And so, anyway, so I go and I have to see, like, the clinic lady first. And then the nurse and then the doctor comes in. Why is this going off? So. And so I see all that, and then I get to the. The main lady who was, like, trying to tell me about it, and she's like, so you already know? Because it was. She is, like, specialized in telling you. And I'm like, yeah, I know. My counselor told me. She was like. Or, no, it wasn't her. It was the doctor. She told me, and she was like, oh, you already know. Okay, well, the hard parts, I guess, already done. But she did it the right way. She was like, oh, there's housing for it, and people live forever with it. And now it's just one pill a day and not all these other pills.
[13:58] A: At first it was like, you get it? It's a death sentence.
[14:01] B: Yes. But they were. She even made me feel a little bit hopeful because she's certified in giving people this news, you know, not. My counselor is like, I'm so sorry. HIV positive. So sorry. We're gonna be here for you. Like, what the fuck is going on?
[14:16] A: Only for a few more weeks, though.
[14:18] B: Yeah. You're gonna graduate, and then I'll probably never talk to you.
[14:22] A: But we're here.
[14:23] B: Yeah.
[14:23] A: I promise.
[14:25] B: And I'm so sorry. So, so sorry for you. Like, us lasting. Someone that gets that news wants to hear that they're so sorry for you, you know, I don't want anyone being sorry for me.
[14:37] A: Yeah.
[14:37] B: And so anyways, I go. But before I went there. Sorry. Let me backtrack a little bit. I went to the nurse's office, the. The first step nurse. And I was like, can I talk to you? She's like, of course you can. So I go in there and I said, what are. I know I might be, like, in this denial stage or something, but what are the chances that this test could be wrong? Because this doesn't. And I explained her about the test that I got and how long that I was in jail, so it didn't really make sense. And I haven't used that or slept with anyone. And she looked it up, and she was like, is it a blood test? It wasn't like, a mouth swab. And I Was like, no, they took my blood out of my arm. She's like, a 1% chance that it's wrong. And I'm like, oh, my God. Okay, so I have hiv. Like, that's what's happening right now. I'm like, do you have my labs? Does anyone have my labs, please? Because I. It does. I'm not understanding this. I don't feel like I have. It. It just doesn't. It just doesn't feel real. And she's like, no. What happened was, is the lab got the results. And when the lab got the results, they tried to get a hold of my main doctor who ordered the test. They couldn't get a hold of that doctor because she was on vacation. So instead of just waiting three or four days, I mean, if I have hiv, three or four days is not going to make any difference for what's going to happen for the rest of my life. But they felt some need to call First Step, the health department, because the health department has to be noticed if anyone's positive for HIV because it has to go in, like a state file, registry, whatever. Yeah. So they have to be notified. But the health department calls First Step Nurse because they're close. They used to work together. Tell them that. So then the First Step nurse tells, emails my counselor, emails my counselor on a group email that every counselor in there can see. And so it was like a million different HIPAA violations. It was. It was done all the wrong way. And then they. And then they set up the appointment for me to go see them, the doctor, the next day, instead of just saying, hey, the health department needs to see you for lab results. And then I go in.
[16:48] A: I could have avoided all the distress.
[16:51] B: Yes.
[16:52] A: So I know calling mom, my grandma, everyone, the whole family, does everybody get freaked out?
[16:58] B: Yeah.
[16:58] A: And so there's not enough stress in life. Let's go ahead and pile one more thing.
[17:03] B: Yes. And. And so I. Anyway, so I go to the doctor and the doctor comes in, and now I'm explaining to her, I'm like, I was in jail for seven months and then I got tested. Right. When I got there, it was negative. And I have not done anything with anyone or used any drugs. And now it's been four months, and now it's, I'm positive. So I'm like, please, will you explain the labs to me? And she was like, sure, let me go over it. So she looks at it and she was like. And she flips face. And she's like, huh? And I'm seeing this face and I'M loving it. I'm like, oh, there's something going on here. She's not. She's like, huh? And then she flips the next page. She's like, that's really weird. She's like, hold on one second. And I was like, okay, take your time.
[17:49] A: Take your time.
[17:50] B: Go figure this out. And I'm like, oh, my God. So she goes out of the room.
[17:53] A: Wow.
[17:54] B: And 10 minutes later, she comes back in and she said, I'm so happy that you advocated for yourself. Because she had thought that my doctor had went over the labs with me. They skipped my doctor because my doctor was on. On vacation.
[18:10] A: Yeah.
[18:11] B: So, I mean, this woman was about to prescribe me antivirals. I was gonna leave there that day with antiviral medication. That's crazy, right? That would have been the biggest lawsuit I've ever had in my entire life. I would have been on antivirals. But still, that's neither here nor there. And so she's like, I'm so happy. She goes, so if you look at the test on the face sheet of it, it says HIV antigens, antibodies, and it says reactive. So that would tell anyone that's a positive test. If it says reactive, it's supposed to say non reactive. But then you flip it over and it says, individually, it says, HIV blood negative. Then it says, you flip it over, HIV antigen negative. HIV antibody negative, negative. So it was a human error of putting not reactive instead of non reactive.
[19:03] A: Oh, my.
[19:05] B: Yeah. That's crazy, right? Do you match the 24 hours of every emotion that I went through? What if I would have. And that's the crazy thing because, like, what if I would have killed myself? Right. Because that's a thing that people, I'm sure, think about when they get that type of news. Or what if I would have left the program, just, like, went and got high or.
[19:24] A: Right. I mean, fuck life now.
[19:27] B: Yeah. I can't believe they didn't go over the results when that happened. That happened before or September 1st. Wow.
[19:38] A: Holy cow.
[19:40] B: It was. It was like 24 hours of just.
[19:46] A: Crazy distress.
[19:47] B: Yeah. So then she gave me a rapid test there. Like the blood one, negative. And she's like, it's looking like it's. It's pretty much negative. The chances that you have two negative results and you. You are positive. She's like, I bet the lottery on it. They. You don't have it. And so then she. They took this because they already sent this state confirmatory to the state that says that I have hiv. So then they had to take a whole nother one for the state and I'm negative, but. Yeah, that's. That's crazy. Right? So that's what.
[20:22] A: I had a client one time who the doctor back when Zyrtec was prescription.
[20:29] B: Mm.
[20:29] A: Had.
[20:30] B: That's heartburn, Right. Or something.
[20:32] A: Zyrtec is an allergy.
[20:33] B: Oh, that's right. Yeah.
[20:34] A: Had for like a six year old. Mm. And went to the pharmacy and the. So it's 10 milligrams of Zyrtec. The pharmacist filled 10 milligrams of Zyprexa.
[20:47] B: Oh, my God.
[20:48] A: Zyprexa being an antipsychotic.
[20:51] B: Yeah, I know. I've heard of Zyprexa.
[20:52] A: Who are in psychosis. Might get 2.5 to 5 milligrams, 10 milligrams. This little girl took it for a month. Like, she went. Because they thought it was allergy medicine. Mom thought it was. Oh, well, this must be the generic of.
[21:14] B: Wow.
[21:14] A: Isn't that crazy? I mean, the kid gained like a whole bunch of weight.
[21:18] B: Yeah.
[21:19] A: All of a sudden was really.
[21:23] B: Wow.
[21:23] A: Yeah. And then finally went, oh, this is not. You know, in talking with her, I'm like, no, no, that's not a generic forzy. That's a major.
[21:37] B: Yeah, that's a.
[21:38] A: You know, I mean, 200 plus pounds. Maybe they'll up the dosage. This is like, you know, a 45 pound, you know, five year old.
[21:47] B: Oh, my gosh.
[21:48] A: Six year old. Oh, my goodness.
[21:52] B: Wow.
[21:54] A: Well, that was a relief. Yeah. After you got all the distress.
[21:59] B: Yeah.
[21:59] A: Yeah.
[22:01] B: But now thinking back on it, it's like I just find gratitude in it. Even though the whole thing was done all completely wrong.
[22:09] A: Sure.
[22:11] B: You know, way wrong. And it could have, you know, if it would have been anyone else, it could have ended or not ended, but went in a very bad direction for them. Especially because I'm not just like a normal American that's lived like a normal life. I obviously don't know how to handle situations well due to where I'm at. So, you know, they probably should have thought that through a little bit better than they did. Like maybe actually seeing lab results before you tell me I'm HIV positive. Like that you think would be.
[22:50] A: Yeah.
[22:50] B: You know, but I just find gratitude out of it because in all honesty, those. That is a real life consequence that happens to people. People that do the things that I did. And I feel like almost it was like God giving it to me without giving it to me.
[23:08] A: Oh, nice. You know, like, really good reframe.
[23:10] B: I like that like showing me like that this. It can be real, but then, you know, giving me that feeling of it.
[23:18] A: Right.
[23:18] B: But not giving it to me.
[23:19] A: Yeah. Right. And what. And how that really changes what life looks like moving forward.
[23:30] B: Yeah. Like, I feel like I had the whole world ahead of me.
[23:34] A: Yeah.
[23:35] B: Where when I got that news, I mean, everything went through my head. Like, I'm gonna be alone for the rest of my life. I'm gonna. You know, how do I tell someone that I have that and expect them?
[23:44] A: It's one thing to tell them that I got herpes. It's another thing to tell them that.
[23:49] B: Yeah, like that.
[23:51] A: You know, I don't want to say the first thing, but shit, this is.
[23:55] B: Yeah. So I'm just. Anyways, I feel like I have the rest, like just so many more options.
[24:04] A: Well, I'm so glad in life. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. So one other question that kind of pops up for me, you know, even just in talking about the different stuff, because we know that given what you went through, like, and again, not funny. Haha. But guy comes, gets you, you go with them, craziness happens, you're in cage, they're all weird with each other gun, Other guy takes you. Then like, okay, no, we're in the car and we're driving away. Like, like you think of that kind of stuff and you go, okay. That could have gone like so many other ways too. Yeah, right. Or didn't you go to Iowa? Was it Iowa? Right. And okay, I'm gonna go do this thing here. And you like, super smart. Go. Please. Oh, hey, by the way, I've got a. Yeah. Like, how amazingly resourceful.
[25:05] B: Yeah.
[25:06] A: Are you in how you were able to maneuver through, like, really uneasy, difficult, challenging things. So given all of that, and given that there was the, you know, pay for sex stuff. Where are you with all of that now? Because there's sometimes people, for lack of better words, romanticize certain aspects of it. Like, if I only look at it from this point and I go, wow, well, I made X dollars. Or. Or then that's not that bad.
[25:42] B: Yeah.
[25:42] A: If it's not included with. Oh, and then there was this and then there was that. Oh, and by the way. Oh, right. And then. So. So where are you with. With all of that for you? Like, are you like, I want to just check, making sure, like there's not any, like, romanticizing components or even uneasiness around what transpired then.
[26:07] B: No, I know that that life comes with all that other stuff. So there's no.
[26:14] A: And yours is a slightly different thing. Than sex worker. Right. Sex worker is a different. Is a term that people use. But like yours wasn't like the bunny ranch where we would consider them sex workers. And people are getting tested and they're, you know, having all sorts of protocols and it's in an environment that they're having all the upper hand. The environments that you were in. Maybe there were sometimes, but lots of times you didn't always have the upper hand.
[26:44] B: Yep.
[26:45] A: As it pertained to that kind of stuff. Yeah. So the secondary component goes, you know. Okay, so you said like being alone. One of the things that happens after. If I've done that kind of stuff and it's been transactionally based, how does it work for you, relationship wise?
[27:05] B: Well, I don't know. I haven't been in a relationship, so I don't know.
[27:10] A: Like as you kind of think about forecasting. Right. And I'll just give you my kind of back end view of things. So the mechanism of attraction, Right. Men, guys are attracted to women. Why is there so much visual stimulation in that regard? Whether that be porn or posters or sex sells or. Or it tends to be guy viewing woman. Because women are beautiful and they're sensual and they're provocative and they're shapely and they smell good and their body moves in different ways and they've got different parts. So women are in that regard, the object of desire. Right. When you're the object of desire, you are the one that determines when, where, how often, how much. So on the flip side, a guy who's interested in a gal, a guy is typically an always Yes. I never know. So if the gal says to him, hey, would you. You don't even have to get the word. Yeah, it's already out. Yeah, no, I'm in. Right. Like, oh, I know you have to go to work, but I'm really okay, I'll be late. You know, whatever it is, guy tends to be the always yes. Women on the flip side are not always yeses. Women are yeses when they want to, nos when they don't. So in the world of relationship and even in the world of sex, women are the regulators. Women are the ones to determine how that all goes. Because guy tends to be yes, whenever, always, now. Okay. Yes. I mean, kind of thing. Second part to that is when a woman has had sexual stuff happen, whether it be younger or out on streets or one of the things that starts to change in how she interacts is that she can be the pursuer, not the pursue. So if we use the metaphor, women are like the lure for fishing, the lure never chases after the fish, right? That would like freak the fish out. If all of a sudden this lure started coming after it going, eat me, eat me. Like the lure tends to be there and then dance provocatively and slowly move away, which causes fish to become interested in chase. Does that make sense? Same thing if a guy is at a bar with friends and gal that he's interested comes up to him and says, hey, would you like to come home with me and have sex? He goes, yeah, okay. Even if it's buddies that he hasn't seen in 20 years. Alright guys, I'll see you later. Right? A guy can't do that to a gal. Guy comes up to a gal in a bar and says, hey, you want to come home and have sex? You might go, you don't get to say that to me. Right. A female panther never runs down a male. Even when she's in heat, even when she's really wanting it, she lets him know that I'm approachable, but she makes him work to get me. So sometimes when women have had early sexual stuff happen to them that happened to them that they didn't choose, what happens is they start doing it because they're choosing. And what happens in that regard is women will have sex like men, where they can have a one night stand where they can just go and fuck and leave. That tends to be a guy thing. Women have chemicals in their body that are released through sexual contact interaction that have them be more endeared. Certainly in what you had been doing. I couldn't always get endeared. And we know that. And this is a common thing. There are certain people that I did that with that it was easier for me to do it with because maybe I had a more better interaction or attraction to them. And then there were other people that I was just like, this is grog, get away from me kind of thing. Right? That's the common thing. So what we want to make sure, as you move forward and that goes into a dating world, that you're looking at it, that I've got the goods, that they're lucky if I'm gonna allow them to spend time with me and that they need to work to get it versus I see somebody and I can go get them. Because for women it works that way. If the woman is interested in the guy, she pretty much don't get it, but that's why it flips it around. A guy, quote unquote, who has sex with lots of girls, he tends to be called a Stud. A girl who has sex with lots of guys. What's she called?
[32:15] B: Stud.
[32:15] A: Yeah, right, right. Because. Because in all actuality, they say she's easy, but it's not that she's easy. It's that we're easy. We're easy and we go fast sometimes. I mean, it's just so. So it's a whole different world. So we want to make sure that as you move into the dating world, it's not you pursuing, it's you letting them know if it's somebody that you're interested in that they can start to pursue you. We want to make sure that you hold what I'm going to call the keys, that you're the one that's supposed to determine how often and how much, how frequent, where, when, not him. Makes sense. And that it's all yours. Right. And my only other question within any of that, given that there was different stuff that happened and some of it was out of, you know, what I was doing, is there any kind of, for you, closeness, touch, touch on different body parts that cause discomfort? I asked that because that's a common thing. I had a woman who had been married with her husband for 20 years, but because of early abuse, if he were to touch, like, the lower part of her back towards her butt, boom, trigger her into a huge, like, panic attack. Because that's what grandpa used to do when he was gonna. So I just checking, you know, based on where we are and what we've already done, is there any of those things that circulate for you and it makes sense in terms of that you're the regulator, not the pursuer. Does that make sense? You follow me with that and that you hold the key.
[34:04] B: Yeah, I get it.
[34:07] A: Because I just want to make sure that. Because again, frequently what happens is somebody who has that goes well, because it happened to me, I'm going to do it now on my terms. But then they have sex like guys. So there was a show a long time ago called Sex and the City, and the lead character, the Carrie Bradshaw, Sarah Jessica Parker character, was a writer. And she said now that women are making the same kinds of money, living in the same kinds of places, doing the same kind of work that men do. Can a woman have sex like a guy? And what they came up with is it's a yes, but. And the but is that for women, there's a chemical that causes them to be more endeared towards person that they were intentionally being intimate with with different than guy who tends to not have that. Right. So If a woman is cheating on her husband, she tends to only be having sex with the guy that she's cheating with, not her husband. Guy that's cheating on his wife. Have sex with the gal that he's cheating and have sex with wife, because why not? That's the difference. So we want to make sure that that part is installed in you in a way that you feel authentically good in you and that like I've got say as to what happens. Does that make sense? Okay. Any questions about that part? Okay. Where are you in terms of programming and are you in Tyla currently too? So where are you in terms of programming? Tyla graduation, moving from first step, all that kind of stuff.
[36:01] B: I have like two more months at first step and probably like four more months in Tyler Court.
[36:12] A: Okay. Okay. And then through Tyler, they're going to get rid of felony stuff for you.
[36:18] B: I believe so.
[36:20] A: Which will be really cool.
[36:21] B: Yes.
[36:21] A: Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. And then as you kind of look forward, because I know that you have the whole interest in real estate, what does it look like for you as you, you know, transition from being at first step and out? Will you transition to a halfway house first? Will you transition and start living with mom?
[36:43] B: Probably go to a halfway house.
[36:45] A: Okay, so that's the plan. Okay. And that makes good sense with you?
[36:52] B: Yeah.
[36:52] A: Okay. Have you had much interaction other than like phone call? Has mom come to visit?
[36:58] B: Yeah, I see her and I visit with her and we go out to lunch and.
[37:02] A: Okay.
[37:03] B: Yeah.
[37:04] A: And that all has been fine.
[37:06] B: Yeah.
[37:07] A: Cool. Yeah, I'm glad. Yeah. Cool. All right. So any other stuff kind of like surface for you? I get that, like it's been a lot more easy going. You've had more freedom to connect if and when it makes sense for you to do that. I get that the intensity of emotions have been less that you're not finding yourself troubled or having the weirdness around. A lot of the different things that have happened that we closed, I get that out of what showed up with hiv, that's created even more gratitude that I don't have it in that, like I have more of an opening for me to kind of move forward and create a life that I want.
[37:51] B: Yes.
[37:53] A: Okay, cool. That's exciting.
[37:55] B: Yeah.
[37:55] A: Yeah. I'm very happy for you. Yeah, let's do this. Given that you have another couple months and then there's going to be a transition, I'm thinking, and prior to Tyla being over, maybe in a couple months or so, let's get back together for like an Hour or so and just kind of checking in because life will be showing up different because you'll have moved through lots of other hoops.
[38:24] B: Yeah.
[38:24] A: So to speak. I think that that would be a useful thing for us to do.
[38:29] B: Yeah.
[38:29] A: Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So one other little question. Given that we had the first conversation when you first came in and then we did treatment, did you think that it was going to be like that at all?
[38:48] B: I didn't know what it was going to be. I had no idea. I had no idea. So I guess no, I didn't think it was going to be like that.
[38:57] A: And isn't it interesting that we can get heavy stuff, lighten up, without a lot of the re experiencing. Reliving component of it.
[39:09] B: Yes.
[39:10] A: Isn't that cool?
[39:10] B: Yes.
[39:11] A: Yeah. That's the part that always amazes me. And that once it's better, that stuff's better. Like once my brain totally gets that it's data about something that happened, it's not reading is happening. And I don't have the feeling tones. Yeah. And I would say for you, in the first few days there was re regulating starting to happen, which might have been why there was more agitation or more anger stuff going on with you. Because this is not how I've known myself to be.
[39:51] B: Yeah.
[39:52] A: What the hell is this? Right. So that is a re regulating component and now it's become, quote unquote, the new norm. Right. Like I don't think of it as weird and different. I'm like, oh, yeah. That kind of thing.
[40:09] B: Yeah.
[40:11] A: Cool. So any other stuff for you for today?
[40:18] B: No, I don't think so.
[40:20] A: Okay. Well, you've done great. I'm really proud of you. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely. It's been really good getting connected with you. I'm really glad about all the positive changes. The stuff that you're noticing for yourself, where you're headed. Even that world of like, that was awful to find that out. Really relieving that it's not it. And even that whole reframe, like, wait a minute, it got shown to me what could could have been without it actually being that way. Wow. Okay. How cool is that for me moving forward, I really now have more of an opening to be creating what I want for me in my life. Cool, cool. Awesome. All right, well, we will stop with that for now. You can come with me. We will head on out.
