[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 3rd of July, almost 4th of July actually. This is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing and that recording may be made available given what we do is actually transformative and life changing for you in teaching and training professionals. And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:19] B: Yes.
[00:19] A: Okay, cool. So let me lay down a couple different things for you to understand a. I don't think that there is any purpose in dealing with prior stuff, just to deal with prior stuff.
[00:34] B: Right.
[00:34] A: I think that the reason that we would in any way, shape or form want to deal with anything that somebody's gone through is because it's somehow negatively affecting today. So what I'd be more interested in is kind of understanding for you how do you actually want to be different than you've been. Like if there are ways that you find yourself feeling that you don't want to feel or reacting that you don't want to react. I know you mentioned that at night I can't have my back out if there's not a light on. I've got to have it to the wall. So that's an interesting kind of thing you've accommodated by either having a light on or making sure your back is to the wall. Follow that kind of thing. But like in terms of your day to day world, if there are ways that you feel that you don't want to feel or react that you don't want to react or what do we actually want different for you? How do you actually want to be?
[01:33] B: I get offended. I think I feel like people are criticizing, like when I feel judged a lot and it makes me very self conscious.
[01:48] A: Okay.
[01:48] B: And when people say things, I get offended. Like they're making jabs at me.
[01:56] A: Okay.
[01:57] B: And then I do and I like, let's say you were to walk in the room and something be missing, I would automatically feel like you thought that.
[02:12] A: I did it, you know, and isn't it interesting? I want to point something out to you and maybe nobody's ever said that to you before, but watch where your hands went. Right. What are you covering? I don't know what's up here?
[02:27] B: My heart.
[02:27] A: Yeah. Have you ever heard, you know, people take things to heart?
[02:32] B: Yes.
[02:33] A: They take it personally.
[02:34] B: Yes.
[02:35] A: Did you know that our heart is a brain? No. I know, it's weird, right? So our heart is actually a brain. So we know that for you in particular, with others, worrying about what others might be thinking about you, some of the things they might say where then you're taking it to heart or personally, that that brain for you is a little overactive. We want them to be more in coherence because we also have a gut brain as well. That's another one of our brains. So we have a head brain, we have a heart brain, and we have a gut brain. So sometimes our brains are out of coherence. And what that means like coherence. So for example, if we had a 5 watt light bulb and it was dark and we were trying to read, we wouldn't be able to because the light would be so diffuse. It would be broad, it wouldn't be bright enough for us. However, when light beams are in coherence with each other, you can take a 2.3 watt laser beam and. And reach the moon. So we want your brains to be in coherence. Okay, so I get that sometimes it's overactive. You take things personal. You're worried about what others might be thinking. You're thinking that they're thinking bad stuff about you. So that if something's missing. Definitely a gunpowder. That creates a whole bunch of discomfort.
[03:54] B: Yes.
[03:54] A: Okay, so we'd like that to be gone so that you're more settled, comfortable in your own skin.
[04:01] B: Yes.
[04:01] A: Yeah. Less of the mind reading about what they might be thinking. Because that causes that self conscious thing.
[04:08] B: Right?
[04:09] A: Okay, so we want that going.
[04:10] B: Yes.
[04:11] A: Cool. Okay. What else do we want to do for you? I know how to do that.
[04:14] B: Okay, great. There was something else that I do. Crap. I just forgot what it was.
[04:21] A: Was it forgetting?
[04:25] B: Okay, when you. Yeah, well, I don't know. Just when people say things to me and then I get like offended, like I don't say anything. Cause I'll think maybe they didn't really like mean it like that way, or maybe they did, but I just don't say anything. And then I freak out. Like, I'll get like, how so what does that mean? I'll just get mad inside.
[04:47] A: Okay.
[04:48] B: And then I keep it. And then I'm like secretly hating this person, you know? And they probably. And they're not even thinking nothing about what they said earlier. It was just like, oh, you're not loading the dishwasher. Right? And I'm like, what do you mean? I've been loading the dishwasher for years, you know? And I get upset inside. And now I notice that I keep doing it.
[05:08] A: Isn't that interesting? Yeah, well, it's just telling us. See, the cool thing is when you communicate, there's what you're thinking and saying. And then there's everything else that's also happening. So your body communicates. Your body is most closely connected with your unconscious, meaning, automatic processing. So when I work with people, my job is to pay attention to what's happening so that I know what's going on. And then we'll know what's different when it's already changed. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that's something that then it kind of. My words might be like, it. It stews or it harbors inside, where you've got a lot more like, mad anger at them.
[05:53] B: Yes.
[05:54] A: Got it. And then does sometimes it come out eventually. Okay. Way more intensely than you want it to.
[06:03] B: And then they're looking at me like, what the hell?
[06:05] A: Yeah, got it. And I'm like, I've been mad at.
[06:07] B: You for like a month now over something stupid.
[06:12] A: Okay. So you having more freedom to say.
[06:17] B: What'S there and knowing when I should and shouldn't say something.
[06:21] A: Okay.
[06:22] B: Because sometimes I have no problem saying something, but. And then when I say it, it's too harsh, you know, over something silly, you know?
[06:31] A: Okay. So with less of an edge, less harsh. Maybe a little softer, easier. Because if we're gonna give people feedback, some people like to have bun with their meat.
[06:45] B: Yeah.
[06:45] A: They don't just want to be hit with it. You'd said jabs. Not everybody wants little jabs. Somebody wants a little bun, maybe a little lettuce before they get the feedback. Right. Okay. Okay, cool. So I follow you with that. I understand what to do about that thing too. What else do we want different?
[07:05] B: I just want. I want to not hate who I see in the mirror.
[07:08] A: Oh. Well, how do you know when to do that?
[07:10] B: I don't.
[07:13] A: Well, how do you know when to start hating? Is it before you look? What is it that you're looking at that you're seeing that you're then hating?
[07:19] B: I'm just. I don't know. I just hate the way that I like, in some ways, when I look in the mirror, like, I just hate, like, the way my eye look.
[07:28] A: Was it your ear?
[07:30] B: No, it's like, side of my face.
[07:32] A: Just this side? Yeah, this side's fine. So we only want to look in the mirror this way.
[07:36] B: I'm telling you, it looks different. I know it sounds crazy, but I have a problem with it. Like, when I look in the mirror, I look at all angles and I look at the side and I'm like, I hate the way the side my face looks.
[07:49] A: Okay. Okay. So you beginning to have more comfort. Right. Peacefulness inside yeah. Good with you.
[08:01] B: Good with me.
[08:01] A: Yeah. Because I'm also hearing that if you're not liking that, is there also a tendency to be more critical.
[08:08] B: Oh, yeah.
[08:09] A: On yourself? Right. So people use the words, I either get down on myself or I beat myself up. Those words make sense to you?
[08:16] B: Yeah.
[08:16] A: Okay, so we'd like that to stop so that the chatter inside, because that tends to be going on a lot.
[08:24] B: A lot. And.
[08:24] A: And, like, sometimes it revs up fast, sometimes it's in, sometimes it's back towards you, sometimes it's towards others. But we want to turn down the volume and the intensity inside. Okay, cool. I know how to do that, too.
[08:38] B: Okay, great.
[08:39] A: To get you to be more at peace with you.
[08:42] B: Yeah.
[08:42] A: Yeah. And that you're more than just your body. Right, Right. Cool. Okay. What else do we want to do?
[08:51] B: I don't know.
[08:52] A: Well, those are, like, really, you know, useful things. Right. Does it ever seem to you that things that have happened, whether they be recent or a long time ago, continue to, underneath the surface, affect things?
[09:05] B: Yes.
[09:05] A: Right. Like sometimes you think about it and you don't want to, or sometimes there's reminders of it and you don't want that to happen. So we'd like that to go. Had there been for you any. Because this kind of ebbs and flows with people. Any remorse, regret, guilt, or shame over some of the things that you did when you were running around in Orlando and that kind of stuff? Yeah. Right. That's why I say it ebbs and flows for people. Sometimes people have that, sometimes people don't. Because, you know, I was doing what I was doing to get by.
[09:37] B: Right, Right.
[09:39] A: So world of world, you know, you sometimes got to do what you got to do to get by.
[09:44] B: Yes.
[09:45] A: Yeah. Not that we look at it and go, you know what? I'd really like to go back and do that all the time.
[09:50] B: Right, right.
[09:51] A: I'm more.
[09:52] B: I don't really so much focus on what I do. I'm more, like, hurt about what other people do.
[09:58] A: Okay.
[09:59] B: You know.
[09:59] A: Okay. Yeah.
[10:01] B: Like, those things bother me.
[10:02] A: Like, you know, like what other people may have said or done to you.
[10:07] B: Right.
[10:08] A: Got it.
[10:08] B: Yeah.
[10:09] A: Okay. Yeah. And that's the stuff that lingers.
[10:11] B: Yes.
[10:12] A: Yeah. And that's why I say, have you ever heard the saying, gosh, this is a long time ago. When I was a kid, we used to have this saying. Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me. What a fucking lie. What a fucking lie. The broken bone that I got when I was, you know, 17, I don't think about that one at all. But the mean shit that people say, gosh, that hurts, right? Yeah. And it's not that the emotional wounds don't heal, because you ever hear that other saying, all wounds heal over time?
[10:46] B: Yeah.
[10:47] A: Well, that's true, except emotional wounds. And they don't heal. Not because they can't, but because part of the brain never got that it stopped. See, the real issue with anything that's happened, mean thing that was said, mean thing that was done, bad, bad shit that went down, hurtful stuff that happened to me. The reason that it still stuck is that when it happened, part of my brain got locked. And that part is always on, meaning that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening got locked together. That's why anytime I think about it or I'm reminded of it, I still got the hood. And it's not because my brain wants me to feel shitty about it. My brain doesn't give a rat's ass. It's because my brain doesn't know that it's not happening. I do.
[11:48] B: Yeah.
[11:49] A: But there's an aspect that never got that news. So I'll give you a great example. This guy is with his, you know, girlfriend, and they're going to be intimate for the first time, and they're making out and it's feeling really good. And, you know, they're kissing, they're kissing, they're touching, they're touching. And all of a sudden she touches his inner thigh and he gets tense and he goes, what the is wrong with me? My girl, who's touching me in a way that's supposed to feel really good, and I'm tense. Yeah. But is there any similarity to what Uncle Mark did to him when he was 12? Right. Yeah, it's similar. Mind will confuse similar as same only when it doesn't know that the negative things stopped. So where therapy got it wrong is they thought, oh, we need to get it out, talk about it, be emotive about it, process it. And, you know, after a good cry, people do feel slightly better, but they get re triggered by the same bullshit.
[12:47] B: Right.
[12:48] A: So instead of doing that, we just want to unplug the memory because it's as simple as that. As soon as the brain gets that it stopped, mm. All of the pain immediately is gone. Done. And it won't come back about that ever again. In the same way that Santa Claus, really cool fictional character, although disturbing because, you know, old man who's always watching children. Yeah, it's kind of freaky you know, you know, comes to their house in.
[13:16] B: The middle of the night.
[13:16] A: Like, I mean, the whole thing is, like, a little creepy.
[13:19] B: Yeah.
[13:19] A: Okay. I don't want this dude always watching. I like some privacy. There's things I like to do by myself. I don't need this dude, like, watching me, you know? But that. But when you realize as a child that Santa's not real, you can't go back to believing him.
[13:34] B: Right.
[13:34] A: Once that's done, it's done. It's flipped.
[13:37] B: I know.
[13:38] A: Same thing for trauma. Once the brain gets it, it gets it and it's done. Now I can think about that thing and it not do any of that stuff to me. So. So we want to get the effect that those things have had cleared as well. Okay, cool. So I'm understanding that for you there's been a tendency for you to, again, take things personally where you're kind of feeling that people kind of think stuff about you all the time and not good stuff. They're not thinking, oh, what a wonderful, sweet love and caring. What a horrible. She's going to do something connieving. Bad, awful. Right. And so there's a constant, kind of on edge around stuff.
[14:16] B: Yes.
[14:16] A: With people. And then if somebody says something that's got a little bit of a harsh tone or even says something that maybe even corrective sometimes it's like really taken to heart. You might not say anything, but it kind of like stews. And then later on, if some other things along the way happen, then it comes out.
[14:33] B: Exactly.
[14:34] A: Okay. That's something we want to get rid of. So that. That's not happening. There's also inside for you kind of more negative, critical, internal voice. Meaning you aren't always saying loving, wonderful things about yourself. What's coming to mind is, well, I'm not this and I'm not that, and I should be more this, and I should be more that, and this doesn't look like that.
[14:54] B: Yeah.
[14:54] A: And that thing goes on. We'd like that to stop. We want it to be quiet inside. We want you to be more and more comfortable with you, all of you. Not just what your body looks like, but the rest that you actually have lots of, you know, strengths inside. Right. And then the other thing that we want to do is get the effect that those prior experiences, whether they be more recent or a long time ago, shit that people done, can no longer cause that hurt and pain. Right. Okay. Anything else that we want to do for you?
[15:24] B: Nope.
[15:24] A: No, we get that done. We think that would be really useful.
[15:27] B: I really Do.
[15:27] A: Yeah, me too. Okay, cool. So let me start with two other pieces. So I told you that one reason that trauma gets stuck or. Or those moments get stuck is because our brain doesn't know that it stopped. That part's on. But there's a second thing, and this is going to explain to you just so that you have a little more insight, and then we can actually do processes to get it cleared. But the insight piece is when we go through troubling experiences, two other things happen. One is my mind attaches a meaning to it that lives as. As if it's the truth.
[16:06] B: Right.
[16:07] A: So what that means is when we're very little. So, like in the first seven to eight years of life, they call that the imprint phase.
[16:17] B: Oh, wow.
[16:20] A: Meaning during the imprint phase, everybody else around us is older, wiser, smarter, they know more. We don't have the realization that there's things called like, you know, lies.
[16:33] B: Yeah.
[16:34] A: And myths and fairy tales. Right. When we get a little bit older, we realize, oh, shit, 90% of the stuff that these people were telling me was not true. Lies, lies. But one of the biggest cultural lies, and you can see it everywhere, I do it with my own children, because we swim in this stuff, is that we lie to children. We lie by telling them if they're a good boy and if they're a good girl, their life will be good and they'll get to live happily ever after. Which that lie is reinforced in everything in our culture with all the TV shows, books, movies, stories, fables, fairy tales, everything geared towards little children is to have them believe good things happen when you're good. Which is fine if everything in life is always good for you. Unfortunately, we are humans, and I've never met a human that hasn't had shit happen.
[17:26] B: Right.
[17:28] A: See, the problem isn't that we're lied to and told that life is good. The problem is that the evil also gets perpetuated. That bad things only happen when I'm bad, when I'm doing something wrong, when it's my fault. So even though that guy who was with his girlfriend knows that when he was 12, it wasn't his fault and he didn't do anything wrong. And that some of actually what uncle did felt good, but not because he's gay or wanted uncle to touch him, but because that body part touched that way is designed to feel good. He knows all of that. He knows. All he did was go out to the barn to see Uncle's car that he was working on. He's got it. Why does he Feel all of the self hate, the guilt, the shame. One is because that brain doesn't know that it's over. And two, because what got stuck to it is, well, it was a bad thing that happened to me, therefore it must be my fault. That's why frequently we take things personally. Because the second thing that we were trained to believe when we were little is that we are the cause of everybody around us. Emotions. That's what we're told over and over and over again. How we cause other people around us to feel, however it is that they feel happy, sad, angry, glad, because you hear it all the time. The mom says to the little child, oh, you made my heart happy. Oh, I love you so much. Oh you're so sweet and wonderful. Oh, and the kids aren't doing anything, they're sitting there, right? But the mom says all that. Or the mom says, I am so mad at you, I'm so disappointed at you, I'm so upset with you, I'm so frustrated with you. This little kid is hearing I am causing everybody else around me to feel so. With those things layered in and I've got bad stuff that's happened and there's a multitude of it, Guess what? I'm on a hyper vigilant and a hypersensitive mode. No wonder why things keep getting taken here. No shit, man. Because a, those things are still active underneath the surface, which makes your brain more vigilant, meaning you're quicker to react to it and more sensitive. And that's actually a good news thing that your brain does that because that's negativity bias and that's pre programmed to keep us alive. The rabbits who are hanging out when they hear a twig snap and the one rabbit takes off and the other rabbit when it heard the twig snap, thought it might be its buddy George, that one's dead, the other one's alive. So the quicker I am to respond in that system mode, the more apt I am to survive it. The other problem though is the stressors that we encounter day to day aren't the same as they were when it was animals and when we were in, you know, the hunter gatherer society, there's a problem, right? So somebody giving us a, you know, a stern look can cause the same reaction that seeing the saber toothed tiger would cause. Except that might be because they've got indigestion. So it's a whole different thing. So we want inside you to become more outwardly focused, meaning that you're not thinking or feeling much about you at all. Instead you're interacting with others, realizing their shit emotionally is their shit and it not causing that reactivity inside. Yeah, got it. So we've got impression, we've got those meanings. That's why it's hyper vigilant and hyper sensitive. And then my brain is going to scan for anything that could have even the smallest amount of similarity to anything that was troubling. But again, because it's on, similar gets mapped as same. That's why it's all reactive. That's why frequently our emotions are way more than what we would want them to be. Got it?
[21:41] B: Yes.
[21:42] A: Okay, so any questions about what I've laid out so far? Far. Okay, so then the next little piece is. I always find it's useful when working with somebody A, to begin to understand what goes on, but B, to have an idea of how we want them to be. Right. So if you are no longer being troubled by those past experience and what those people have done to you, if you're no longer overly reactive and sensitive and taking things personally, if that's no longer going on, how would you actually be.
[22:21] B: More relaxed? Probably more able to focus on what's really happening.
[22:28] A: And what's it like for you, Ashley, when you're relaxed? I mean, there's been times when you're relaxed, aren't there?
[22:36] B: Well, yeah, I mean, I'm a lot happier.
[22:38] A: Oh, you're a lot happier. Okay. So we want you to be relaxed and happy and light and free and a little more easy going and a little more good with you. So that you've got more comfort in your own skin. Yeah. And you got more ease in maneuvering through the stuff that might come your way. And you're more peaceful and you're free from the effect. Yeah. So that's where we're headed. Got it. That's where we're going. Your brain is already organizing because even just by thinking about it. Check. How's your body feeling now?
[23:13] B: More relaxed.
[23:13] A: It is, isn't it? Right? Yeah. So it's already happening.
[23:16] B: Oh, you were doing that to me.
[23:19] A: That's right. It's already happening because you and I are collaborating on a mutual goal that we're both interested in. And your body's responding too. Right. We don't always pay attention to what's going on with our body. But you noticed already just by thinking of why. Which means that part's in responding to it as well. Make sense? So really quick question. How do you know when to take something personal? So let's think of a Context could be at the house, could be somewhere, but we want it. The reason we do that is everything that we're able to do in life is state dependent. And what I mean by that is it's a container that holds how I think, how I feel and how I act. And the issue that we have as human beings is when we're in a problem state, it's not that we don't have the resources, because we have resources, it's that those resources aren't appropriately linked to the problem. Silly example, but let's think of a 13 year old boy who's with his buddies at lunch and one of his buddies says something mean, throws his ear and it hurts his feelings and he doesn't have a good comeback. So he's just kind of like stewing with it, right? The bell rings, he goes off to math class. Now this kid happens to be really good at math. Teacher's there, he's understanding everything, he's feeling really great, he's getting it, he's answering a question, you know, teacher says, okay, we've got 10 minutes left, go ahead and do your homework. Five minutes. He finishes his homework, he's done. Now he's just sitting there. Perfect comeback comes to mind. Shit, why couldn't I said it back then? Yeah, right, that's happened. So the problem wasn't that he didn't have the resource, clearly he does. It's that he was in a crappy state. And see, crappy states don't have any solutions. It's also the reason why is a bad question to ask myself. Why am I feeling this way? Why do I react like this? Because the only time that we ask the why question is when we're in the crappy state. When we feel great and we're happy, relaxed, feeling good. Why am I feeling so wonderful and great? No, it never happens. It's only in the crap. So it's kind of like if I'm in a house and there are flames all around me, is it a good idea for me to ask why? Better idea, get the hell out of the house. If once I'm out, I want to go back to discover why, fine. But not when I'm in the crap. Got it. So all of the resources are actually there between you and I and what you've already gone through and all sorts of other things, they're just not linked to the crap. So therefore we want to get context. So where might you be when you take something personally? So think of a situation, because there's going to be A way or something that goes on that enables your brain to do that for you.
[26:34] B: Okay. Usually if I'm like, so let's think.
[26:39] A: Of a context, specific one you might be aware in what might happen.
[26:45] B: I might be new and I feel like everybody's watching me. Let's say I just have to walk in the kitchen and get a drink or something.
[26:56] A: Good. So you're at the new house and you're walking from where to the kitchen?
[27:01] B: From my room.
[27:01] A: From your room to the kitchen. Right. And where. Which side of the house are you on?
[27:07] B: I'm in the master bedroom.
[27:08] A: Okay, good. So then you're coming from that side and around. Right. And then what happens?
[27:16] B: Well, yeah, I don't really know.
[27:19] A: How do you know when to start feeling that discomfort? How do you know that they're looking.
[27:26] B: At you when I walk in the room?
[27:28] A: So you walk in the room and then what happens? Their eyes. Yes. Huh. Right. And then what happened? Then? What is it that you're saying to yourself?
[27:38] B: I don't know.
[27:39] A: Or what is it that you're feeling? I know this is the weird thing because you don't actually know how the program runs.
[27:45] B: Yeah.
[27:46] A: But we're slowing it down so that we can change it.
[27:49] B: Okay, so keep talking.
[27:51] A: Yeah. So check. You start walking, people look, right? Where do you first feel it? The discomfort as they're looking? So you. Does that feel warmer?
[28:09] B: Yes.
[28:10] A: Okay, so then your face feels a little bit warmer. And then what do you say to yourself?
[28:17] B: I don't know. Nothing. I'm just. I don't know. I don't say anything.
[28:24] A: Right. So check it out as you're thinking, because I know this is gonna sound weird, but as you're thinking about them looking at you, isn't it like this close? Yeah, Right, got it. That's structure. Because I'm wondering what would happen if instead of them being this close to you, they moved over here. Right. So think of, like walking in and as you see them looking at you, they're over there.
[28:57] B: Okay.
[28:58] A: Right. How does it feel? Not. So it's not, right?
[29:02] B: Not so much.
[29:03] A: Isn't that interesting? Right. That's already knowing that one of the things that we want to do is shift where your brain has them represented to you. Because in order to intensely feel, feel emotion, the thing has to be big and close.
[29:19] B: Right.
[29:20] A: Nobody has spider phobias. When they see spiders is really small and far, far away.
[29:24] B: Right.
[29:26] A: Bothering.
[29:27] B: Yeah.
[29:28] A: Big and close. Yeah, yeah, got it. And I knew that because as you were talking about it, your arms went here but your face went back.
[29:39] B: Yeah.
[29:39] A: Right. So what I knew then is that's something that goes on for you. So I'm wondering what it would be like if that weren't happening. That's right. And you see people from further away. That's right. Because as you think about them, as they're looking at you and they're further away now, how does that feel inside? How's your body feeling?
[30:00] B: Calmer.
[30:01] A: It is feeling calmer. That's right. That's right. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. So it's already feeling calmer. Now we want to do a few processes that are all about getting your mind to become more responsive. And I want to teach you something that you can use later. And it comes from neuroscience. They're brain based leverage points that are able to bypass the fight flight freeze responses, humans. So the first thing is just put both feet on the floor. Second thing, you're going to slightly lower your jaw. So it's not like ah, but it's just like a slightly lower jaw.
[30:45] B: Like let it hang.
[30:46] A: Right. And rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Just like that. And now begin to breathe, Ashley, in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper than how you normally breathe. That's right. You can breathe a little bit slower and deeper. Right. So just continue to breathe in a way that's a little slower and deeper as you're breathing in that way. You can look at the tip of my nose. You can look at the tip of my nose. And as you look at the tip of my nose, you can focus in on it. Then you can notice what happens when you shift awareness and notice more of what's in the periphery, like what's towards the sides of the room. Continuing to breathe in the way that you are. A little bit slower and deeper. And notice more of the space that's out towards the sides. That's right. And you can notice that there's space in between you and me. You can notice that there's space up above you, even space below your feet. And then you can begin to notice that there's lots of space behind you, even beyond the wall space. And that no matter how many things and objects are in the room, there's always more space than there is things. And as you're noticing your awareness expanding, just check again. How's your body feeling now?
[32:21] B: Really relaxed.
[32:22] A: It is feeling really relaxed. That's right. That's right. And notice how much more of the space you're aware of. Yeah. And then do One small thing. Just close your eyes for a moment and imagine you are able to shoot up out of your body and. And beyond the ceiling so that you're way up in the sky, way up in space, like a bird. You're able to soar and glide through the sky. That you're moving and soaring all around in all ways and in all directions. Moving, gliding, soaring. Big, wide turns, figure eights, arching angles. Soaring. That's right. And then bring your awareness back down into your body. That's right. Take a slow and deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Good. And again, what you're noticing now, how's your body feeling now?
[33:45] B: It looks weird in here.
[33:47] A: It does look a little weird in here. Yeah. What else are you noticing?
[33:52] B: Everything.
[33:53] A: Oh, now you're aware of a lot more. That's right. And how's your body feeling?
[33:58] B: Relax.
[33:59] A: It is. Isn't that interesting? So you can notice that things look weird and feel relaxed at the same time. That's right. So think about, you know, going into the, you know, headed towards the kitchen, and people are looking at you. You just kind of notice because isn't that what happens? You know, I was talking to this kid who had this fear of going into a class late because everybody would look at him and he thought it was just him. And I said, well, would it matter whether it was you going late or any other kid?
[34:34] B: Yeah, everybody's gonna turn around and look.
[34:37] A: Cause all of a sudden it made noise that they weren't expected. Yeah, they turn and look and then they go back to. Right, Exactly. So if somebody walks into your field, you turn and look. That's right.
[34:49] B: I can understand that fear, though.
[34:51] A: You can understand that fear. But I want you to check, as you're getting that now, how's your body feeling?
[34:56] B: As I'm thinking about that?
[34:58] A: Yeah. Well, no, as you're thinking about knowing what you just learned. Because you can identify with what was going on with him, but you can also realize that people turn and look just because there's a new object coming in the field. That's right. And as you're realizing that, just check again. How's your body feeling? It is. Yeah. So again, as your body is feeling relaxed, think about walking in and they're turning and looking as you're making your way towards the kitchen. That's right. And as you're thinking about that, you're noticing any discomfort. It's already less than it was.
[35:38] B: It is less.
[35:39] A: I know. Isn't that weird? Yeah, that's right. That's right. It's already less. Because what's happening is were changing how your brain has had that program. Because check now, as you're thinking of them turning and looking, where are you seeing them? That's right. Notice how it's farther away. Yeah, yeah, that's right. And see, we can't get as troubled if it's farther away. See, the problem wasn't in them turning and looking. The problem was that in the person programming that when they turned and looked, it felt like they were here. Got it. So some of what we're going to do for you in changing things is going to be what we call content oriented, but more of what we're going to do is going to be structure oriented. So I don't know how familiar you are with web pages, but like if you go to a webpage, there's what we see as the user and there's different things that we can type and that's all user stuff. But then there's the coding, the structural programming behind the face that enables the webpage to actually do what it does. We don't ever see any of that coding. So when we go to change things from you, we want to change it both at a content, but even more so at a structural level, which means when you go to interact with new things now there's a whole new program running and therefore you won't have the same feelings happening. Okay, Right, got it. So what you're going to notice as we move forward with what we're doing is that when we do change stuff, you're going to notice that I'm using for yourself. So that's the other cool thing in particular when we clear out troubling stuff, is that you'll know it immediately, right away. And I'll get people that they'll be like, they would avoid thinking about it because whenever they did think about it, they felt awful. That we'll do the intervention and it flips and then I'll say to them, now think about that and try to get the bad feelings and they'll. And it's not there anymore.
[38:04] B: Right?
[38:05] A: That's right. So that's what you're going to notice for yourself. You're going to notice things and the volume turning down inside so that things are quieter so that you're more and more at peace, so that your brains are more in alignment and in coherence and that you've got a lot more ease and then access to experiencing more joy. Because just by deciding, and although you might not have really like decided at first because somebody said, well, you're arrested or we could get you into this thing. Yeah, oh well, I'll go to the thing. Right, right, exactly. But given that you've been there and now you're here, you've actually made some decisions along the way to improve your life and have it work in a very different way than it has been for you. Right. And so we want to do everything that we can to be supportive of how you want to be moving forward in life. Feeling a lot more free and light and clear and dealing with the stressors with more ease.
[39:16] B: Right?
[39:17] A: Yeah. Yeah. Cool. All right. Any other questions for me?
[39:24] B: Not at this time.
[39:26] A: So again, think about like walking in and they might turn and they might look and they might do one of those things and what do you notice? Right. Notice how it's not doing the thing anymore. Right, right. Because they're not so close. And I know that that's different not just because of what you said, but because the thing that happened body wise when you were thinking of them looking at you is. And you might not even have realized it, you went like that. Now I'm over exaggerating.
[39:55] B: Yeah.
[39:55] A: But there's a little bit of.
[39:57] B: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[39:58] A: Right. Yeah. And that wasn't happening even just thinking about it.
[40:01] B: Right.
[40:02] A: And that's the other thing. I'll lay out one other component which will be, you know, kind of laying the groundwork because we're going to get back together. I think it is not this Wednesday, but next Wednesday. We'll be together for two hours and we'll get all this stuff adjusted and cleared and you'll like being way, way, way better, right? Absolutely. So one other useful kind of thing to understand is we tend to look at life by saying stuff causes feelings. Past stuff, current stuff, future stuff. Makes me feel. So when I'm thinking about that thing that could. I'm feeling all nervous. When that person looks at me like this, then I feel this way. When that person said that thing, it made me feel like this. When those people do that stuff, it made me feel this way. We go stuff causes feelings. With that lens, we've got limited power. Change stuff, avoid stuff, which is how we deal with stuff. But we know, unfortunately there's some stuff I can't change and there's some stuff I can't avoid. And then there's all the stuff that's happened. Shit, I can't get the stuff to have not happened. So we got to do something else, which is what we're gonna do adjusting the way that your brain reacts and responds to stuff. So silly. Example. But when lion approaches zebra, don't we all agree that the lion makes the zebra scared? Yeah, but if we look at it from the other lens, you go, wait, no, it's the zebra's brain that when the zebra sees senses, feels, smells, thinks that lions coming. Zebra's brain, not lion, is what's making zebra alert, motivated, strong. We'll call it scared. So it runs away. Yes, it was doing it to the zebra in response to lion approaching. But it's really the zebra's brain that's doing it to the zebra, not the lion.
[41:57] B: Well, yes.
[42:00] A: So from that lens we could say the same thing. There's been a way in which your brain has been working that's been causing you to feel bad. Bad. Sometimes it's the hurt from stuff that people have done. Sometimes it's the taking things more personally. Sometimes it's the internal anger negativity inside. Sometimes your brain might be doing it in response to stuff that's happening or that could, or that has. But you've recognized that way of your brain working has been problematic for you. That's right. That's what we want to get tuned up. That's how I know we were able to shift this. Because even just by thinking about you being in the situation where they're all turning and look, you notice the discomfort just by thinking about it. So therefore what we know is that it's something your brain is doing to you.
[42:55] B: Right.
[42:55] A: And that's why we have everything we need. Because you're going to bring it with you. Right.
[43:01] B: Can't leave that at home.
[43:02] A: That's right. Because you know if we could, we would, right? Lots of times, yeah.
[43:08] B: Leave my brain home today. Yeah.
[43:09] A: Right. Well, sometimes, yeah. Where'd it go? It's. The glasses are on top of my head. Where are they?
[43:14] B: Where are they? Where are they?
[43:15] A: Where are they? Oh, yeah, they're there. Yeah. So that's what we're going to be doing is adjusting how your brain deals with stuff so that you inside have more freedom, more power, more strength, more connectivity, more groundedness, becoming more settled, more ease, more peaceful. Great. Yeah. That's where we're headed. Yeah. Cool. So any other questions for me before we stop for today? Okay. So then you and I will get back together. I will stop.
