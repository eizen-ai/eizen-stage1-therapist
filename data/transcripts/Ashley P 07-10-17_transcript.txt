[00:00] A: So today is the 10th of July, all day. Yep. Ashley, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that that recording may be made available in teaching and training professionals. And I just want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:14] B: Yes, it is.
[00:15] A: Okay, good. So how did the last conversation that we have leave you? Because I know one of the things that I was interested in checking is how has it been walking in and having people look at you?
[00:31] B: Well, better. I don't know if it's. I'm. I don't know exact. I'm more comfortable.
[00:41] A: Oh, you are more comfortable?
[00:42] B: Yeah, I'm more comfortable in the house.
[00:44] A: Right. You're not experiencing them so close?
[00:48] B: No.
[00:48] A: Right.
[00:49] B: I'm really not.
[00:50] A: I know.
[00:51] B: Yeah.
[00:52] A: Yeah. That's different. I mean, we're not saying that that was the solution to everything. Right. But one of the things in the brief conversation that we had the last time was about getting that shifted.
[01:03] B: Right.
[01:04] A: So that how you experience them was with a little more distance. Right. Yeah. Cool. Okay. So that was one thing that I wanted to check on. The other thing is you had mentioned a variety of different things to. One of the things that you said is that sometimes you take things to heart or take things too personally, where it feels like it means stuff about you all the time. Like even if somebody's looking or they might be saying, you don't always necessarily say anything back, but then that sometimes kind of builds up and then you're like thinking to yourself and really kind of internalizing. And then all of a sudden it's going to come out and bleh towards people. And you don't really always like reacting that way. And that's something that you recognized has been problematic. You also said to me that there's been a whole bunch of things that have happened, some of them a long time ago, that even though they're over, they still underneath the surface, affect things. You mentioned to me that sleeping at night, you haven't wanted to sleep with your back to the door without there being a light on and you're going, okay, so that's kind of weird, but like, there's that discomfort that goes on with. With that kind of stuff. So we want that whole thing lightened and lifted. We want the impact of the prior stuff clear. We want to get it so that you're more comfortable, more at ease inside your own skin, that there's less of that being hard on yourself, negative, critical thing, that you're more outwardly focused. Not taking so many things Personally. So that's what I'm remembering from at least what we talked about. But then you're going to give me an update.
[02:37] B: You're spot on about everything that we talked about, but now I feel like.
[02:41] A: I have more problems. Oh, yay. Well, that's great that you're here today, then. So what would be useful for me to know?
[02:47] B: Okay. I feel like I have body morphic disorder.
[02:51] A: How does that. That's so That's a really big word.
[02:54] B: Yeah. Did I say it right?
[02:56] A: I don't know.
[02:56] B: Well, I heard that you specialize in.
[02:58] A: It in body dysmorphic disorder, whatever that means. I know that sometimes when you look in the mirror, you don't like what you look like. And you said there's one side of your face that looks better than the other.
[03:08] B: That's what I'm saying.
[03:09] A: That.
[03:09] B: And I put clothes on, and I'm like, oh, my God, I look so white up here. And, like, you know, just things stick out to me. And last night, one of my roommates, which is like, my friend, you know, I only have two friends in the house that I really would consider my friends. And even though I don't really consider.
[03:25] A: My friends, they're really, like, acquaintances.
[03:26] B: Yes. But they're the ones that I associate the most with. She was like, I think you have body.
[03:33] A: Who's that?
[03:33] B: Dysmorphic disorder. Savannah. You haven't met her yet.
[03:36] A: Okay.
[03:37] B: But I'm sure you will. But anyways, so that kind of had me thinking, because I was like, yeah, I do. I see things, and I. It bothers me. But then I look at other people, and I'm like, I don't. When I look at other people who might be bigger than me or have some of the same. You know, it doesn't look bad on them, but it looks horrible on me. So I don't know if maybe I just. If I have that. Well, if we can just get rid of that.
[04:06] A: Right? I mean, I don't. So the idea goes. I mean, we could say that people have things, but then what do you do about that thing? What we know is that there are times that you haven't been pleased with when you've put clothes on, what your bodies look like as you've done it.
[04:25] B: Mm.
[04:27] A: You'd like to get more ease and comfort with you. Yes. Yeah. Right. So, like, that's, like, not even a big deal, or. It doesn't even come to mind. You just put whatever you put on, you're fine.
[04:36] B: That's what I like.
[04:37] A: That would be way Better, wouldn't it? Yeah. Whether you have this thing or not. Because people ask me all the time. They go, do you work with bipolar? Do you work with ocd? Do you work with manic. No, I work with people. I don't know. What the hell am I gonna do with the thing? Yeah, it's people. Right. Any other stuff you think would be useful for me to know?
[04:57] B: Yes. I know what I'm scared of at night.
[05:00] A: Oh, okay.
[05:02] B: This sounds crazy, but I. I am really working on my relationship with God.
[05:09] A: Okay.
[05:09] B: And I think somehow I got it in my head. I don't know how, but I was gonna say it. Okay. The demons demonstration. What I'm scared of at night, I don't, like, see them, but in my head, I think about them and I'm like. I don't know why. When I wake up in the middle of the night, that's what I'm scared of. Shadows freak me out, and I'm scared that they're demon, because I think I've got it in my head that the devil is fucking with me because I'm trying to get my life in order with God. And, you know, when you're, you know, doing drugs and you're doing, you know, you're living this lifestyle, the devil's not really worried about you. But then whenever you're trying to get on God's side, I feel like that's when he's like that little voice in your ear, you know, well, can your.
[05:56] A: Life be better and not on God's side? Mm.
[06:00] B: Well, I mean, I don't know.
[06:02] A: It's weird. Oh, you couldn't. I mean, it's not possible for people to, like, have, like, a really good life and it worked really well and then be really happy, regardless of whether they have a connection to God or not. See, I only say that, Ashley, not because there isn't a connection with God, but because you're thinking that the devil cares whether you're connected to God or not.
[06:23] B: Yes.
[06:23] A: Oh. So when you were, like, doing drugs, he's like, fuck that person. Oh, my goodness. She's actually gonna have a life that we're. That's really, like. Totally.
[06:29] B: I just wasn't scared of him then.
[06:31] A: Right. You weren't, were you?
[06:33] B: And now, for some reason, I'm scared. I don't know why.
[06:37] A: Right. If there's actually a thing called the Devil, right, as a him, why can't it ever be a her?
[06:42] B: I don't know. Yeah.
[06:45] A: Has to be a him.
[06:46] B: Yes. I don't know. I just Grew up Illinois.
[06:49] A: I know, right? We just get stuck with all that kind of stuff. I. I have the same thing. I have girls. I go, come on, guys. Come on, guys. Come on, girls. Right? I mean, but, you know, we all have the thing. I remember girls dating this guy, and he kept calling her a dude. She's like, I am not a dude. I don't mean that. Right, exactly. It's just friend. Yeah. Okay, so that's what you're worried about at night.
[07:14] B: Yes.
[07:15] A: Okay. And if you weren't worried about that, how would your sleeping be?
[07:18] B: I don't know.
[07:19] A: No, because you're actually thinking that the devil cares. How come?
[07:26] B: I don't know.
[07:29] A: If they didn't care when you were doing drugs, why would they care if you're not?
[07:34] B: I don't know. Because he's at a war with God, you know?
[07:39] A: Really?
[07:40] B: I don't know. We can leave the spiritual part out of this if you want.
[07:45] A: No, no, it's interesting because, you know, God's old. Takes naps. That's why bad shit happens. Not really. Bad shit just happens because it happens. Right. God's a bookie. That was my other one. Because, you know, all the athletes point up to God. Doesn't matter what team he's on. You know, the guy just scored a touchdown, he points out. The next guy scores a touchdown on the other team, he points up.
[08:08] B: Yeah.
[08:08] A: God's getting money on both sides. He didn't care.
[08:10] B: Yeah, right.
[08:13] A: But see, you want to be in the light. Connected. Yeah. What if there is no demon thing?
[08:22] B: I'm sure there's not. I'm sure that's not what's going on.
[08:26] A: So if there isn't a demon thing, then what are we worried about? The shadows. It's like Halloween.
[08:32] B: I mean, I know where. I feel like I know where it stems from.
[08:35] A: Oh, where does it stem from?
[08:36] B: Because me and Dr. Wiseman talked about it.
[08:38] A: Uh. Oh, well, we don't know whether that's true or not. It is what you guys talked about, though. What did he think that it stemmed from?
[08:46] B: Well, I was molested.
[08:48] A: Oh. That's why. Okay, but see, he did this white thing, and that didn't really, like, white it out. Okay, we're gonna take care of that for you.
[08:56] B: Okay?
[08:57] A: I promise. Okay, cool. Yeah. So it may have something to do with that, but you just want to be in connection. You want to sleep easy.
[09:04] B: Yeah.
[09:05] A: At night and rest and be more like, you know, connected. Whole good with you inside and out.
[09:13] B: But maybe it could be that I'm not Used to sleeping alone.
[09:17] A: Oh, but don't you have a roommate?
[09:19] B: No, I don't. All by myself.
[09:22] A: Okay, well, you're in a house filled.
[09:25] B: With girls, but they're on the other side of the house. But I'm 31 years old. What am I scared of? Nothing. I'm really not scared. But I'm just. I feel like when I turn, like there's something behind me.
[09:41] A: Okay, so if you had more expanded awareness and noticed more of the space because you know that there's a wall behind you, you could tell without even looking.
[09:53] B: Right?
[09:53] A: Right. But did you know that beyond that wall there's space? Yes, that's right. A lot more space than the wall. And the wall is actually made up of more space than we think.
[10:03] B: Right.
[10:03] A: Because did you know, here's the weirdest stat ever in neuroscience, that if we thought of the part of our body that's actually solid, you have to go out five decimal points. It's.00001% of our human body is solid. I know, it sounds weird, right? The rest of us is made up of space. If you took an atom, which is like really small measurable thing, and we blew up an atom to the size of a small marble. Now, in the atom at the central, there's a proton and a neutron, and then there's electron that floats around it. The electron floating around it. If you blew it up to the size of a marble, would be more than a football field away. That's how much space there is. Ain't that crazy? Now, why the heck do we feel pretty darn solid, right? Well, think of the phenomenon of when a ceiling fan is spinning at high and you try to stick your hand through it. You can't. It feels like a solid disc. Same thing with us. We are made up of tiny, small, what they call subatomic particles that are vibrating at such a rapid speed that we feel solid.
[11:18] B: That is cool.
[11:19] A: Crazy. Excuse me? It's crazy, right? But that's the whole thing. So we're made up of space. But you know why? Night. See, the night thing is, have you ever done like a Halloween horror? Nights Bush gardens, or do you know why they only do them at night?
[11:37] B: No.
[11:38] A: Well, they're not scary during the day.
[11:40] B: Okay, Right.
[11:40] A: If the guy is standing behind the bush wearing the ugly scary mask during the day. I see him. Yeah, look, there's a guy that's gonna jump out to scare me. And he jumps out. Rawr. And I go, whoa, wow. I'm scared. Versus I don't see that he's there and he jumps out and I go, what the. And I'm startled. Right. It happens because in the darkness, that's when there's more distortion. So we just want to have you be more and more in the light. Because you know what? Light gets rid of darkness. Right. Like, even on a cloudy day when somebody says there's no sun, there's still sun. It is. Right. Just as hot and happy and bright as it was.
[12:20] B: Still get sunburned.
[12:21] A: That's right. Even at night. It's there at night. No, but the sun is there.
[12:26] B: Right.
[12:27] A: It's just our view of it has changed. Right. So we want you to be more and more connected to the light. We want you to be more and more at peace. We want you to be good with you. Got it. Okay. Any other stuff you think would be useful for me to know?
[12:40] B: Not today.
[12:41] A: Okay. All right. So the way that we're going to look at things, we kind of organize it, and I think I mentioned this briefly to you is what we tend to look at in life is it's the stuff in my life that causes the feelings, past, current, or future. It's what my body looks like. It's what that person said. It's this thing happening. It's that thing going on that makes me feel. And that when we look through that lens, we've got very limited power. Either change it or avoid it. But in life, there's some stuff I can't change. There's some stuff I can't avoid. There's all the stuff that's happened. I can't get it to have not. So we got to do something else. We're gonna adjust the way that your brain has been reacting and responding to stuff. Got it. So when you were telling me about different things, whether it be, you know, how it feels when you're putting something on or, you know, stuff that happened, do this. Just think of whatever you need to think about. Feel just a tiny little bit of the bad feeling. Right. And notice how it didn't take long to get there. Right. And you didn't have to do a lot. But see, what you did is you used your brain on purpose to do it.
[13:49] B: Yes.
[13:49] A: I asked you to. You cooperated. That's not a problem if it only happens when you choose it.
[13:55] B: Right.
[13:56] A: The problem is that your brain's been doing it to you when you haven't been choosing it.
[14:00] B: Yes.
[14:00] A: That's the glitch. We want to get that tuned up.
[14:02] B: Yeah.
[14:03] A: So it stops. So therefore, the you that I'm seeing that that way that your brain just worked. The you that I'm seeing now, she remembers having had that kind of feeling, but if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't even know how to get it. For her, it's, like, cleared, it's lifted, it's gone, meaning the lingering effect of the prior experiences where there's been any of the hurt or the pain or the sadness or the guilt or the shame or the resentment or all that burden's gone. So the you that I'm seeing is at peace. She's comfortable in her own skin. The you that I'm seeing is a lot easier on herself, so that things are lighter, she's more outwardly focused, so that she experiences other people's garbage as being about them. And she's able to move herself around that stuff. The you that I am seeing is really satisfied with where she's headed and what she's up to and really glad as she's thinking back recently about the things that she's done. So there's that sacrifice of feeling really good about what she's doing. That's the you that I'm seeing. Got it. My question isn't how it's gonna happen. My question is, would that be okay?
[15:09] B: Yes.
[15:09] A: Yeah. Good. So we got a green light. And because we've got a green light and our brain is responsive to things that are symbols. Did you know that? It's why, when somebody sees a yellow arch, what do they think of? Right. But what the hell does a yellow arch have to do with cheeseburgers?
[15:23] B: Right.
[15:24] A: But our brain responds to symbols. We want to get a way to symbolize a you who's at peace, who's clear, who's light, who's free, who's present, who's got ease as she's moving through things, who's good with what she's up to. Right. And if we're to symbolize you that way, we could use a wild animal, something out in nature, something up in the sky, a natural formation of the earth. What comes to mind to symbolize you that way? We make it up. There isn't really one.
[15:53] B: Okay.
[15:53] A: Yeah.
[15:54] B: So make it up.
[15:54] A: Yeah, exactly. To symbolize you at peace. Free. A leopard. Powerful. Right? Right. Because the leopard isn't like, you know, annoyed or feeling bad about others, even when they're looking at her.
[16:09] B: Right?
[16:09] A: That's right. So we got a powerful symbol. We're going to use that to activate mind. Next thing, think of the time when you were outdoors in nature and you see something and as you do it, it's beautiful. So, like, when you're looking at it for that moment that you're seeing it, there's, like, peacefulness and excitement. What is it that you see? There's a moment when you're doing that that it's right there. And people would say, yeah, it's, you know, and seeing that, they gave you the feelings. But if we looked at it differently, we could see. Say it's in the seeing of it that drew your awareness down in towards your center. Because at your center, you always are peaceful and excited. Kind of like, you know, if we're at the campfire and I take my hands and I move them down towards the flames, and I go, this fire is getting hotter. Is it really the fire that's getting hotter, or am I becoming more aware of it?
[17:06] B: You're becoming more aware of it.
[17:07] A: Right. So we know that there's been lots of times in your life where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. The upsets, the angers, the stresses, the pains, the guilt. But the way we're gonna say it is that no matter where awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited. And you know that there are two of us in this room. Now, how do you know that? Well, you're looking around your senses, bringing the data. Your intellect organizes that. That's knowledge. And we sometimes call knowledge light. So we'll call it light of knowledge. Knowledge. Let's then say that at your center, where you're peaceful and excited, brighter light. Light of wisdom. So now we've got knowledge. We've got wisdom. And I remember this one girl that I worked with. She had a lot of stuff, a lot of, like, negative stuff, didn't like how she looked, a lot of beating herself up. Lots of bad stuff happened. I mean, one of the things that happened when she was really little is her older brother. She's like five or six, used to take Matchbox car, drive them up her leg. And so we can imagine all the around that. But we worked together, we cleared it. And when she was sitting across from me, she was fully present, feeling great. And so I had to ask her. I go, you know, all of that hurt, the anger, the pain. I go, where was it? And she looked at me, Ashley, with the most beautiful, glowing smile. And she says, it's gone. I don't feel it anymore. I go, I know. Isn't that cool? She goes, yeah. I go, but the question was, where was it? And we started thinking. I go, was it at the Surface. And she's like no. I go, oh well then maybe it was at your center. And she's like, dude, that's dumb. How could that survive in the light? I go, oh well then where was it? And this is what she said. It was hiding in the shadows in between the lights. And I said, well what happened? She goes, well, the lights, they're now touching. I said, isn't that cool? And so then we started thinking just like I told you, you know, that the part of our bodies. So then we. Wait a minute. I go, well then you have a body. You're not your body, it's yours, but it isn't actually you. I mean, heck, there's not even a cell today that's the same as it was when you were born, right? They've all been replaced millions of times, yet you're still you. So then you're not your body, you're go, oh well then maybe you're your feelings, but you can't be your feelings because you feel differently at different times, right? So you have them, they're not you. Oh well then maybe you're your thoughts. And of course we over identify my brain as me because you know, if I have an upset stomach and I'm gassy, I don't go, I'm gas. But if I have a stupid thought, I go, I'm an idiot. Yeah, right. But they're my thoughts, they're not me. They're brain generated. My brain is mine, but it is me. So now we go, wait a minute. There must be what you do, but you do lots of different things and you've done lots of different things and now you're doing something different than you were doing, so you can't actually even be what you do. Oh, well then I must be my past. But again, your past is things that have happened, right? And maybe things that you've done, things that have happened to you, but you can't be any of those things. So now we've got a weird question. If you're not your past and if you're not your body, and if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not what you do and if you're not your feelings, weird question. So let's just say that who you are is what you became aware of as you see the sky. That who you are is the light at the center, that light that is you can't be touched or hurt or harmed, is whole and complete and totally indestructible. And I say all of that because people gup Identity. Words all the time. You hear people come in, they go, I'm anxious, I'm shy, I'm depressed. They're thinking that who they are is how they feel. But if I go to the dentist and I come back and I'm upset, and you go, why are you so upset? I go, you'll never believe what he did. What did he do? While I'm on this chair, my head goes down, my feet come up. He shines a light in my eyes. I see anything, he takes a cold stick and shoves it at me. And you go in your what? I go, ashley, am I the dentist?
[21:04] B: My mouth.
[21:06] A: Because I've got one. I'm not one. Which is the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother. I go, yeah, when you were little, he really messed with your stuff. And she said, yeah, he did. And then she had this big rolling smile again. She goes, but you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body. It hurt my feelings, changed how I thought for a while, but he never got me. I said, whoa, Isn't that a powerful way to be thinking of things? And we tend to relate my soul, as if it's a thing that I have. I remember. I don't know if you ever got this prayer, but when I was a little kid, they told me this prayer. Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. And my mom would, you know, kiss me on the forehead, turn off the lights. And I'd be lying there thinking about my impending death. About two large hands breaking through the window, ripping open my dead body, grabbing it from me.
[22:02] B: Yeah.
[22:03] A: So later on in life, I started to realize, wait a minute, maybe I have a body. And the thing that I have are my fingers and my toes. But the light at the center is me. Which is kind of interesting if we started thinking of that light as the center. That's who you really are. Essence. So much more than the things that have happened to you. So much more than your body, body. So much more than the thoughts or the feelings you've had. And therefore, as we're organizing towards, you know, we said, what a panther. Leopard. Right. What the leopard symbolizes inside is where we're organizing. So we want to do a quick little process. There's a small little yellow tack at the top. You just looked at it right there. That was perfect. You're going to do that same. Look. Picture the leopard in here. A slow breath In. And that's the first part. That was easy, right?
[22:56] B: Yeah.
[22:56] A: I told you it's going to be simple. Second, same thing. This time, though, after inhaling, exhale and close your eyes. So look up, think leopard. Breathe in and then exhale and close your eyes. And then you can open that same thing as that. This time, though, when you close your eyes, you're going to keep them closed for a few moments and bring your awareness down towards your breath. So look up, think upward, breathing in. That's right. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. Now with your eyes closed, actually bring awareness in towards your breath. Just notice your breathing so that as you're aware of your breath, your awareness is influencing how you breathe, which is happening in a way that's just a little bit slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. That's right. Take a slow and deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. Those few short moments that you had your eyes closed, what did you begin to notice within yourself?
[24:06] B: How slow is breathing.
[24:08] A: Yeah. And how is your body feeling feeling as you were breathing? Slow.
[24:11] B: Really relaxed.
[24:12] A: Which is a nice feeling to have because the coolest thing here. I can do this. And I have to do this too. I have to spit out our gum.
[24:19] B: Thanks. Did you have gum, too?
[24:24] A: I did.
[24:25] B: Okay.
[24:28] A: But the coolest thing is when our body's relaxed, it enables it to do accelerated healing. It's why if somebody has a. A cold or flu or even after surgery, we tell them to get rest. So again, look up, think leopard. Deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. With eyes closed, they rest. As your eyes rest, you also rest. You're aware of your breath, the background sounds in and out of the room, how it feels to be sitting in the way you are noticing all of that. At the same time, your unconscious is responding, organizing towards what the leopard symbolizes. And because your unconscious has direct access to the control panels within your brain, it knows exactly what to do to make adjustments from within, to organize and restructure more and more. That's right. Because everything that you and I need to make change is already there, there. It's just about connecting resources inside to what's been problematic. So there's more freedom and ease to become more and more of who you really are. So much more than you think you are, becoming more and more of who you really are. That's right. Which is so much more than you think you are becoming more and more of who you really are. Now, responding from within as you rest, and then in A moment. When you're ready, take another slow, deep breath in. That's right. And then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Good job. And again. What were you noticing within you?
[27:02] B: Really relaxed.
[27:03] A: Yeah. Which is a nice feeling to be having. Now I want to show you something. That's weird. Wanna see something weird? Okay, cool. So take that hand. Hold it out like that. Good. Look at that spot right there. Now, as you look at that spot, don't do anything at all on purpose to move the hand or fingers. I'm going to take my hand, I'm going to move it towards yours. As I move my hand in, you're going to notice something happen as it gets a little bit closer and closer and closer before it touches. That's right. You're going to feel that energy. Yeah, that's right. You can feel my hand here. Noticing it feels down different here than when it's there.
[27:36] B: Yeah.
[27:37] A: And you can see my point, that with it here, you feel it. Isn't that cool?
[27:41] B: Yeah.
[27:42] A: Which means I'm actually coming closer to touching who you are than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings. Isn't that weird? Because who you are can only be touched with love and respect.
[27:54] B: That's good.
[27:56] A: That's right. Isn't that cool? So take another deep breath in. That's right. Exhale. Close your eyes. That hand can just drop, resting down deeper and deeper inside. That's right. Towards the light at your center. Peace. Fully integrating within you. Whole, complete. That's right. And all we're doing is taking those impressions that have made you at times feel less than or not as good as. And getting rid of that distortion, clearing, making room for more healing. You becoming more and more at peace and comfortable inside. Realizing that everything you need is already there. And your unconscious has direct access to the control panels of your brain. All the neurochemicals, the neural pathways, knows what adjustments to make, buttons to press and knobs to turn, levers to shift switches to foot, to reorganize, to restructure within you now becoming more and more of who you really are. Energy light. That's right. That's right. And then when you're ready once again, we're gonna take a slow and deep breath in. That's right. Exhale and open your eyes. There we go. So we're gonna do a brief grief process called ghost busting. Why ghost busting? Because if an experience is finished, it can't still be haunting. It must be the ghost. So what we want to do is turn the lights on. How that works is anytime you've gone through anything yucky in life, it got stuck, lodged. Energy has been being used to deal with it ongoingly, whether I think about it or not. So the coolest thing is we're already moving towards where we're headed. You're already noticing feeling a lot more calm inside. We have the opportunity to free up more energy to be used in this transformation that's already underway by clearing out the effect that some experiences have had.
[30:53] B: Okay.
[30:53] A: So that things free up. So what's going to happen is as you look towards that leopard. That's right. The unconscious parts are going to scan back through those negative experiences in your own history and it's going to bring a particular moment to mind, to clear. Yeah. What comes to mind now?
[31:21] B: The negative experience.
[31:22] A: Yeah. Happen when you might have been howled. 1212. Good. So the feeling, as you think about it, is a feeling of what is it? Anger, sadness, hurt, pain, guilt, shame, resentment. Combination.
[31:34] B: Yeah.
[31:35] A: So second question. Would it be okay for you to be free? Meaning if you're no longer bothered by it, does that make what happened okay? Oh, you get to be okay even if it wasn't. That's right, you do, don't you? That's right. So we've got you being okay. So how we clear? It is very simple. A, you're going to intend to be with me. You want to be here, because this is what's happening and that isn't. Two, we're working on the mutual goal that we're both interested in. Three, on more fun than sucky stuff. So second, when you tell it to me, the experience, you're going to go through it in a minute or less, and it's just going to be facts. It'll go, this happened, this happened, this happened, this happened, this happened, and it was done. Three, if it happened when you were 12, there have been things that you've done after that experience that were more enjoyable than that particular experience. Yeah. So what's one thing, anytime in your life from when you were 12 until yesterday that was more fun than that moment?
[32:28] B: Having my kids.
[32:29] A: Yeah. Having your kids. Way more fun than that. Good. Something else.
[32:32] B: Six Flags.
[32:33] A: Yeah. Going to Six Flags. Way more fun than that. Good. Something else. One other thing.
[32:39] B: My boyfriend.
[32:40] A: Yeah. Meeting your boyfriend. So we got meeting the boyfriend. We got going to Six Flags, we got having your kids. All of those things happen after that. So what you didn't know back then when that was going on is that they were on the way. That moment was on the Way to go into Six Flags and having your kids and get back up. All of that. Way more enjoyable in that moment. Good. So you're gonna tell me just the. What happened? So you're 12 when it happened, you were aware. By the way, when you tell it to me, you're gonna be with me because I'm funny. That's right.
[33:08] B: I was in my bed.
[33:09] A: So you're in your bed daytime or nighttime?
[33:10] B: Night.
[33:11] A: Night time. And you're, like, in the bed. And then what happened?
[33:13] B: Sleeping.
[33:14] A: You're sleeping. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[33:16] B: I woke up to somebody touching me.
[33:17] A: So you woke up and somebody was touching your leg or touching between your legs? Touching on your leg?
[33:22] B: Between my legs.
[33:23] A: Between your legs. And that was weird? Some of it might have felt good, but it was weird. Right, Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[33:29] B: I froze.
[33:30] A: Right. Good job. And then what happened next?
[33:32] B: I started crying.
[33:33] A: Right, Good. And then what happened?
[33:35] B: He left.
[33:36] A: Did he put his finger in your vagina? Did he touch anyone else? Just between the legs. Then he took his hand off.
[33:40] B: Yes.
[33:41] A: Then he walked away?
[33:42] B: Yes.
[33:42] A: Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[33:44] B: I laid there, scared.
[33:46] A: Right. Good job. And then what happened next?
[33:48] B: I ended up falling asleep.
[33:50] A: Right, Good. And then you woke up the next day and that part was over.
[33:52] B: Right.
[33:52] A: Right. And then later on, you went to Six Flags and you had your kids. Now, you notice that there was a little discomfort as you were recalling, not because it was uncomfortable, but really because your brain was confused, confusing the memory, thinking it was happening. It actually causes a discomfort, trying to motivate you to get it to stop. Weird, right?
[34:11] B: Yeah.
[34:11] A: Your brain doesn't know that it already has stopped. So we've got good news for it to get. Now, the weirdest thing is when you go backwards with a memory, it actually unplugs it. It flattens out the neurons. It takes away the charge. So we're gonna run it backwards. So we got the boyfriend and the kids are going to six legs. And then what happened before that is you woke up and then you went to sleep, and then you laid there, and then he had left, and then he took his hand off, and then you froze, and then he had had his hand there, and then you had woken up, and then he had put his hand there. And then before that, you'd gone to bed, and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Right. Good. Now, as I ran through it backwards, compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[34:47] B: That's uncomfortable.
[34:48] A: Same thing. Right. So here's the third piece to this right, emotional brain works more with patterns, association than logic. So, for example, you can remember putting your hoops in and where you were when you did it this morning. But if I said to you, remember putting your hoops in and then said, ashley, stop putting in your hoops, you'd look at me and go, I'm not putting in my hoops. Because you're crystal clear there's a difference between the memory of it happening and it happening. So remember getting dressed, putting your hoops on. Actually, stop putting in your hoops. Say, I'm not putting on my boots. Well, stop putting on your boots. Well, stop putting on your bracelets. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. I can't say, you're not putting on your shirt. Well, stop me from putting on my watch.
[35:35] B: You're not putting on your hair.
[35:36] A: Well, stop me from putting gel in my hair. Well, then stop him from touching between your legs.
[35:40] B: He's not touching between my legs.
[35:42] A: We'll stop him from doing that. See, he's not doing that. So then say, where is it? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. There we go. Which is what we want to get in. Last piece to this one. Younger. You didn't know back then that that guy doing that had nothing to do with you, right? And everything to do with whatever was going on with him had nothing to do with you. But see, it felt like it did have something to do with you a little bit. Yeah, right. Because some of it was weird, but some of it felt good. So like is like my body, like. But now we know that if a body part is touched in a certain way, since to feel good, that's just how it works. Not that I'm interested in that, just how it's design. Right. So we want to educate. So close your eyes. Think of the younger you. Letting her know that it's over, finished, completed, that it no longer exists, that it happening had nothing to do with you. Let her know that it was on the way to having her kids and going to Six Flags. Let her know so that she gets it. That's right. As she does, you notice what happened? Her face, right? She's not troubled anymore. Right. Isn't that a good news thing? Right. And notice how that's different. And we didn't even do any white out. That's right. But as you think about that particular moment, try to feel that way. Oh. Hmm. Isn't that weird?
[37:01] B: A little.
[37:02] A: It is, isn't it? Because you've never not felt bad about it.
[37:08] B: This is uncomfortable.
[37:09] A: Wait, how about now, well, is there anything uncomfortable about it?
[37:16] B: No.
[37:17] A: Oh, is the uncomfortable thing no longer that it happened, but coming from the thought that it shouldn't have?
[37:22] B: Yes.
[37:23] A: Oh, okay.
[37:24] B: Yeah.
[37:25] A: Well, that's only because you can conceive of it having not happened, and then your brain is trying to motivate you to get it to not happen. Weird, right? But see, would it be okay? Because in life, the real factual matter is everything that has happened couldn't have not happened, even if we don't like it that it did. But see, in your brain, you can imagine it having not happened. That's with your logical brain. Your emotional brain works more like an animal. And an animal can't conceive of something it can't do. It can only think things that it can actually do. So it's causing the feeling to try to motivate you to get it to not happen in a time period that no longer exists. Weird, right?
[38:26] B: Yeah.
[38:27] A: So it's kind of like this guy. A year ago, his brother died in a motorcycle accident. He's feeling guilty. He's thinking he's feeling guilty because he should have gone on the ride, but he's not actually feeling guilty because he should have gone on the ride. He's feeling guilty because he can conceive of having gone on that ride. And if he had, his brother might still be alive. That would be better.
[38:50] B: Then he would be dead, right?
[38:52] A: Well, he might have gone on the ride, and then they might not have gotten in the accident.
[38:55] B: Okay?
[38:55] A: Right. That was the whole idea. So because he can conceive of that, his emotional brain goes, well, then do it. Hurry. Go on the ride with your brother a year ago. What are you waiting for? Huh? That's where the error mechanism comes in. Got it. So we want to get it clear that although we don't like that it happened, it couldn't have not happened. So I'm going to say, stop him from doing that. You're gonna say, there's nothing to be done, Right? So quick, Ashley, stop him from doing that. Say there's nothing to be done.
[39:22] B: There's nothing to be done.
[39:22] A: No. Cory, stop him from doing that. What are you waiting for?
[39:24] B: Say there's nothing to do.
[39:26] A: No. Come on, let's go.
[39:26] B: Stop him.
[39:29] A: And now, Chap, what do you notice happened? Feelings.
[39:32] B: I'm laughing.
[39:33] A: You are, aren't you? Which is weird, right? Because now you don't have any discomfort, right? We still don't like that it did. But notice how it doesn't have any of that feeling anymore, isn't that cool.
[39:46] B: Well, your little dance thing helped a lot.
[39:50] A: There's a lot of things that I do that people don't realize help a lot. But you pick that one up, right? Because we're just getting timing oriented. Because your brain doesn't make you feel bad because it wants you to feel bad. It only causes bad feelings to motivate you to do something to get it to stop. See, the problem with any kind of troubling memory is that we're only haunted because our brain doesn't know that it's a memory. Our brain has the memory about it and the experience of it stuck together as if the memory of it is the experience.
[40:29] B: And the feelings, I think, well, that's.
[40:31] A: Why we have the feelings. The feelings are there to try to get us to stop. Right? So the mama bear, when she sees a man poking a stick at her bear cub, becomes ferociously angry and attacks. If the guy gets away, she's not sitting around the bear den going, can you believe the nerve at that mother effort? If I ever see him again, I'm gonna. She doesn't do that. Nor if she killed the guy, is she, like, going, do you think I overreacted? I mean, I probably didn't need to kill him. Yeah, he was doing something. He said, I'm horrible. But she's not doing that.
[41:06] B: Right?
[41:07] A: Because for their brain, when they get that, it's not happening. There's no purpose for the feeling. Isn't that weird? So all the regrets, the remorses, the guilt, the shames, the angers, the resentments are being caused by our emotional brain to get us to get it to stop. When it realizes, oh, it stopped, it goes, oh, that's right. All right, so there's one. So again, you're going to look towards that leopard, and as you're looking towards the leopard, that unconscious part is going to scan back, back, back, back, back through experiences that have happened. Narrow, pinpoint, and bring another moment to mind. Good. That one happened when, huh? Moment to mind, troubling experience happen when the bad 12. Well, that one doesn't bother you, does it?
[42:08] B: No.
[42:08] A: Oh, well, there's been more than one negative moment you've had in your life.
[42:13] B: Yes.
[42:14] A: Oh, right. So let's get another one cleared.
[42:16] B: Okay.
[42:17] A: So you got enough?
[42:18] B: Sorry today?
[42:20] A: No, you're doing great. It's only meant to be confusing.
[42:24] B: Okay.
[42:25] A: That's right.
[42:25] B: Okay.
[42:26] A: Because, you know, if we're going to do that, we want to get things to be cleared. So the other. The next one that came to mind happened when I don't know.
[42:34] B: A lot.
[42:35] A: Why now? What one? Yeah, that one. And you want to be with me because I'm more fun.
[42:44] B: Okay.
[42:45] A: You might have been how old?
[42:48] B: Around the same age?
[42:49] A: Yeah, around the age. It was a good year.
[42:51] B: Yeah. Yeah. I was really doing things that year. I feel like another thing that bothers me is the scared feeling of, like, I know that he would, like, look in my window, like, watch me.
[43:05] A: Right. The person who touched you.
[43:07] B: Yes.
[43:07] A: Oh, good. So you might have been 12.
[43:11] B: Yeah.
[43:11] A: You might have kind of had a feeling.
[43:13] B: Right.
[43:13] A: Might have kind of, like, seemed like a shadow.
[43:15] B: Well, no, I would hear him go outside. He would be outside for a while, and I could just.
[43:20] A: So who was he?
[43:21] B: My stepdad.
[43:21] A: So it was your stepdad? Right. So stepdad was outside and you were 12? Right. Good. And then what happened next? You, like, knew he was outside?
[43:29] B: Yeah. And I just felt him looking at me.
[43:31] A: Yeah. You kind of felt like him in the shadows.
[43:33] B: Yes.
[43:34] A: Like, looking at you.
[43:35] B: Exactly.
[43:35] A: That's right. But you couldn't, like, really kind of see because he's, like, kind of hiding.
[43:39] B: Yeah, right.
[43:40] A: Exactly.
[43:40] B: Outside in the dark.
[43:41] A: That's right. Good. And then what happened next?
[43:44] B: Nothing.
[43:45] A: Right. You might have been doing whatever you're doing.
[43:47] B: Right. I would just get this eerie feeling.
[43:49] A: Right. Good job. Right. Because that would have been weird. Right. Good. And then what might have happened next?
[43:53] B: That would be it.
[43:54] A: And then that would have been it. And then you might have gone to bed. And then you would have got up the next day.
[43:57] B: Right.
[43:57] A: And then later on, you did something more fun, like six legs. Your kids. Right. Good job. So we got some Six Flags and having your kids. We've got maybe going to bed. We've got, you know, kind of feeling like somebody might be looking in the shadows. We might, you know, notice that he had gone outside. And then you were doing whatever you were doing before that. Right. You can remember all that happening? Right. You can remember putting your pants on?
[44:16] B: Yes.
[44:17] A: Ashley, stop putting on your pants.
[44:18] B: I'm not putting on my pants.
[44:19] A: Well, stop putting in your hoops.
[44:20] B: I'm not putting on my hand.
[44:21] A: Well, then stop me from putting gel in my hair.
[44:23] B: You're not putting gel.
[44:24] A: And stop him from looking at you in the window.
[44:26] B: Not looking at me.
[44:28] A: Stop him from doing that.
[44:29] B: He's not.
[44:30] A: Right. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[44:32] B: No longer exists.
[44:33] A: That's right. That's right. And again, by the way, him doing that, did that have anything to do with you?
[44:39] B: No.
[44:39] A: Right. Because would it have mattered whether it Was you or any other 12 year old girl with that guy?
[44:45] B: I don't think so.
[44:46] A: Right. See, it's the funny thing where people get screwed up. I'll give you a great example. Think of this, you know, 13 year old kid. He's in the cafeteria, he's got a tray filled with food. He's walking towards the table, he winds up tripping. Fawn. Freaking chick goes everywhere. Right? He's got soup. I mean, splatters, the whole thing. He is completely mortified and embarrassed. You know what everybody else in the cafeteria is doing?
[45:08] B: Looking.
[45:09] A: They're all like. It stops. Yeah, it was loud noise. It stops. Everybody turns and looks and they're all laughing and the kid just wants to disappear. Feeling like they're all laughing at me, which they are. But you and I as an adult go, wait a minute. Would it have mattered whether it was that kid or any other kid?
[45:30] B: No, it was just funny that he fell.
[45:32] A: Right. Any other kid having the same accident would get the same response.
[45:38] B: Right?
[45:38] A: That's right. So it had nothing to do with you. It had everything to do with something being off with him, which you know now, but you weren't fully clear of that then. Sorry. How long was he in your life? Like when did he start dating mom?
[45:52] B: He married my mom when I was two. Three days before I turned two and they're still married.
[45:57] A: Okay, so he was in life for a long time then.
[45:59] B: He's my dad.
[46:01] A: Well, at least the one that raised you. Exactly, right?
[46:04] B: The dad that raised me.
[46:05] A: Yes, exactly. I got one of those. Yeah, I got. Well, I love it when people go, well, it's not my real dad.
[46:11] B: Yeah, I know. I've always said that it's not my real dad.
[46:14] A: Well, but it's not my birth dad.
[46:16] B: Right?
[46:17] A: He might have been the one. Right? Yeah, it's not the bio dad. He might have been the one that actually was there.
[46:21] B: Yeah.
[46:21] A: Played more of the role than the birth dad did, but, you know, whatever. Right? And there was something off with him. Right. But again, we didn't know all of that then. So again, close your eyes. Picture that earlier. You let her know it's over, finished, completely. That it no longer exists. And that him doing that had nothing to do with you and everything to do with something being off with him. So that she gets it, then let her know, how about going to Six Flags? In her case, let her know, how about the hoops? That's right. You can open your eyes. And again, as you think back about the moment, what are you noticing now really Calm you are, aren't you? Right.
[47:02] B: I'm almost sleeping right now. I could go to sleep.
[47:06] A: Isn't that interesting? Right? You're really calm. Your body's really calm, even though you were thinking about stuff that had been really disturbing. Isn't that interesting? That's right. That's right. But see, when your brain starts to get it, that it's not. It doesn't have any purpose for the feelings. Right. And we want to get that re Educated. Yeah. So again, as you're looking towards, you know, the you that's been symbolized by that leopard, and as everything is organizing you, the unconscious can scan back once again through things that have happened in your own history, and another moment will come to mind. We got one. Good. This one happened when?
[47:50] B: Same time.
[47:51] A: Oh, good. It was a good year.
[47:52] B: Well, actually, no. This happened when I was 14.
[47:56] A: I just say that because it's so common for people to have, like, a whole bunch of shit happen. I go, well, that was a good year.
[48:03] B: Yeah, piss somebody off.
[48:12] A: I remember one time, actually, this is a riot. I was in college, and I got in a car, and I was taking my car in for the first tuna that I'd ever gotten, and. And I didn't have anybody to drive me, so I put my bicycle in the car. And as I'm driving to get my car tuned up, I stop at one of those things where there's a yield sign, and there was a car coming, and the car behind me rammed into me, smashed, broke the back of my car. I'm like, mother, right? So then I get to the thing. Not only my car gonna get its service, it's gonna actually have bodywork done to it. I get off on my bike, and I start biking back to my apartment at college, and I'm biking and biking and biking, and then a car pulls out and hits me. No. I'm like, this was not a good hour and a half of. Kay, I'm done for the rest of the day. Yeah, I'm not going to classes tonight. I'm just sitting in the.
[49:02] B: You might not make it.
[49:04] A: I mean, come on. It was awful. Literally went over the hood of the car.
[49:08] B: Like, oh, my gosh. I think you weren't hurt.
[49:11] A: Yeah. Crazy. All right, so you're, like, 14. What happened? You're where?
[49:18] B: I'm in my room.
[49:19] A: You're in your room. Good. Right? That was a fun place to be too.
[49:25] B: Yeah. Right.
[49:25] A: And you were in your room alone? Yep. Ah, I wonder. I wonder if anything relates.
[49:34] B: Well, no, this is a little bit Different?
[49:35] A: Well, it might be, but I wonder if anything relates to you being alone in your room. Oh, we wouldn't want to like get that cleared so, like, you're comfortable. Yeah, that's right.
[49:48] B: That's right.
[49:49] A: Yeah. So you're 14, you're in your room. What happened?
[49:52] B: The cops came in.
[49:53] A: Cops came into the room. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[49:57] B: NDCF came.
[49:58] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[50:00] B: Removed me from my parents house.
[50:01] A: He said, you gotta come with us. Yeah, Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[50:05] B: And my mom was so mad.
[50:06] A: She was mad, but like, upset.
[50:09] B: Mad at me?
[50:10] A: Well, she was mad but upset.
[50:12] B: Yes.
[50:13] A: Right. Wasn't she upset?
[50:14] B: Yeah.
[50:15] A: Yeah. And like kind of thinking it was like on you.
[50:18] B: Yeah, it was my fault.
[50:19] A: Right. That's what she was thinking. Right. And then what happened next? So you were taken to go stay somewhere else for a little bit.
[50:25] B: My mom just like washed her hands of me and just.
[50:28] A: What does that mean?
[50:30] B: Told the judge that I was out of control.
[50:32] A: So mom was mad.
[50:33] B: Yeah.
[50:34] A: Then you got taken out. Right. She said that you lied. So you got taken. You stayed with wherever you stayed with. Then you had to go to like court with grandma.
[50:42] B: Yeah, with my grandma's.
[50:43] A: Oh, good. Which was better. Way better, wasn't it?
[50:47] B: Well, yeah.
[50:48] A: Well, it's better than.
[50:49] B: Oh, no, it was better. I was safe.
[50:51] A: Right? You were, weren't you?
[50:52] B: Yeah, I was safe there.
[50:53] A: That part was better. Right. You weren't having to deal with some dude, like.
[50:56] B: Yeah, exactly.
[50:59] A: Right. Exactly. Right. But then you're like in the court and mom says to the judge, she's a troublemaking teenager, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And she lied. That never really happened.
[51:11] B: Right.
[51:12] A: Good. Then what happened next?
[51:14] B: They. My mom gave me up.
[51:17] A: Well, then she said, you can go live with your grandma.
[51:20] B: Yeah.
[51:20] A: Or she signed over parental. Signed over parental rights to go live with grandma.
[51:25] B: Yeah. And then I started being out of control. Then I really was out of control and I started speaking out and drinking and smoking and having sex and doing all kinds of craziness. Anyway, so then I moved in with my best friend because my grandma was like, you're out of control.
[51:41] A: Right.
[51:41] B: You really are out of control.
[51:42] A: Right, Right.
[51:43] B: Good.
[51:44] A: Right. And then you live with your best friend. And then what happened next?
[51:47] B: And I just kept on getting crazier.
[51:51] A: And crazier doing whatever you did.
[51:53] B: Do whatever I wanted.
[51:54] A: Right. And then that ended well. Well, because you're not doing it right now.
[51:58] B: Right?
[51:58] A: Right.
[51:59] B: It just now ended.
[52:01] A: Right.
[52:01] B: Yeah.
[52:02] A: And then later on, so we want to get to the particular moments. Right. Because there was the moment that certain things happened that then kind of triggered like a domino. You know what dominoes are?
[52:13] B: Yeah.
[52:13] A: Right. Not just the. Yeah, that. King of wands. Yeah, right. Yeah, that kind of thing. Right. They're really cool. And hit the one. See, we didn't know that that was going to be a domino effect. Right. But, like, you've changed it now.
[52:25] B: Yes.
[52:26] A: You are. Aren't you changing it?
[52:27] B: I'm changing.
[52:28] A: You are, aren't you?
[52:29] B: Yes.
[52:29] A: Isn't that a really good thing?
[52:30] B: It is.
[52:30] A: Oh, yeah, it is, isn't it? That's right. So what we want to get in to is. So there was the moment. Well, because then later on, you did other things. Kids, that kind of stuff. That wasn't like, literally right after. No, Right, right. So we know that we had kids. We know that you went to your grandmother's house, and then we know that DCF had taken you out. And then mom was, like, really, like, upset, furious. Right. And then they had come into your room, and then before that, they had come into the house. And then before that, you were doing whatever you do. How'd they know? I told you. Told who?
[53:12] B: I told my friends. And. Well, I went to school, and I was really well, okay, hold on.
[53:18] A: Right, See, there we go.
[53:19] B: What happened was my stepdad started questioning me, like, what would I do if somebody was, like, paid me to flash them or something like that. And because of what had already happened, I was really uncomfortable in this conversation.
[53:32] A: Well, I don't think, regardless of whether the stuff had already happened, it would have been just a weird conversation at 14 to have with, like, your stepdad.
[53:39] B: Yeah, it was a really weird conversation.
[53:41] A: If somebody were to come up to you and ask you to, like, show them your boobs, like, how much would it cost?
[53:45] B: Yeah. Yeah. Well, he was like, you know, what would you do? And then he was like, what if it was me in the end? And I was like, I don't know what to say right now.
[53:55] A: Right. It would make me really uncomfortable.
[53:57] B: Yeah.
[53:57] A: Regardless.
[53:58] B: Yeah.
[53:58] A: Yeah.
[53:59] B: So I told my friends, and they told me. Cheerleading coach, principal, and.
[54:03] A: Oh, right.
[54:03] B: They called dcf.
[54:04] A: Right.
[54:05] B: Police were there that night, Right?
[54:06] A: Yes, they were, weren't they? Right. And then you went and lived with Grandma.
[54:11] B: Right after he. And he failed five lie detector tests, which he told me. He told me. He texted me and told me that he felt five, but that I couldn't use that for the rest of my life as a crutch to be like, why I act the way that I do.
[54:25] A: Oh, well, good. We won't use that it as a correction, but we want to actually get it cleared. So do you remember that moment, like, when, like, Mom's, like, looking at you and you're thinking, like, she's really mad. She's really upset. Yeah, Right. And she didn't want to know that. And then she told the judge that, like, you were out of control and that you were lying.
[54:42] B: Yeah.
[54:43] A: You can remember her doing all that? You can remember putting your pants on. Well, stop putting your pants. Stop her from telling the judge that she's not. Well, then you stop putting in your hoops. Well, stop putting your hair in a pony.
[54:54] B: I'm not.
[54:54] A: Stop me from putting my hair in a pony.
[54:55] B: You're not.
[54:56] A: Well, then stop mom from saying that she's not. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Now, here's the second thing, and I don't know whether you've ever considered this or not. Mom. It wasn't that mom didn't believe you. It's that mom couldn't because of what that would mean about her, that her own husband would be doing that to her daughter. Not weird. I mean, it's one of the most common things that happens. I remember this one guy told his mom that grandpa was molesting me. And his mom said, you need to pretend like that never happened. Like, talk about the dagger right now, come to find out, it was mom's stepdad who had also molested her. And the only. And he was a very prominent, wealthy individual in the small town. And the only way that she was able to manage is to pretend like it never happened.
[55:56] B: Yeah.
[55:57] A: So she was trying to ruin her life, give him the invisibility cloak, so to speak, that she used. I remember another woman whose daughter said, you know, uncle Tony's been touching me. Don't you dare say that about my brother. Right. But again, it came from Mom. Couldn't even, like, process and be with it because of what that would mean about me as a mom, that my own brother would be doing this to my kid. Can't even, like, be with him. So back then, mom didn't know in the way that she probably knows more now.
[56:37] B: She refuses to, of course, not, talk about it.
[56:40] A: Do you know why right now? Yeah, you're getting why.
[56:44] B: I mean, I've kind of already come to that realization.
[56:48] A: But she can't do it.
[56:49] B: She can't.
[56:50] A: Not because she doesn't believe you, but because of what it would mean about her if she did. See, where this is off is that, like, again, it's been featured. Like it had everything to do with you, but didn't have anything to do with you. It had to do with, like, creepiness going on with stepdad. That's right. And you may have also been a teenager that, you know, was out doing stuff. I mean, you could have.
[57:23] B: At the time.
[57:23] A: I wasn't at all.
[57:25] B: No. I was very. He was controlled. Everything I was inside, I barely was allowed to go anywhere.
[57:33] A: Right. But see, that's what changed.
[57:36] B: Yeah.
[57:37] A: Is when you went to Grandma's house, you didn't have the same rules.
[57:40] B: Exactly.
[57:41] A: That's right. You didn't have the same rules, so you went to do your own stuff for the first time.
[57:48] B: That's why I hate it when people tell me what to do. I think it makes me mad when people tell me to do something. I'm like, I.
[57:56] A: Well, now we want to get it so that you have the freedom that if they do and it makes sense, you're able to do it.
[58:03] B: Yeah.
[58:03] A: Because I have a hard time with.
[58:04] B: That even when I think I should know.
[58:06] A: Yeah. Right. So the thing that happens, I remember this woman telling me her mom was a very controlling mom, and she did have a little bit of a drinking problem, but she had decided she's going to this party at Mom's house, she's not going to drink at all. And she gets there and she's helping mom out. And before people are coming, mom goes in her. I really hope you don't drink today.
[58:26] B: She got drunk.
[58:27] A: Oh, my goodness. Game on. Not just drunk. Where's the fucking hard lip? Thinking that she was exercising her own free will. But see, she wasn't. She was still being controlled by mom because she couldn't not drink. As soon as mom told her not to, she had to have a drink. She had already decided, I'm not drinking anything. Isn't that crazy?
[58:50] B: But I get it.
[58:52] A: Yeah. So we want you to be free to make really good choices, even if it's ones that somebody suggested. Yeah, that's right. That's right. So again, as we. Because here's the thing. How do you know when to get. And somebody's made that. You know, let's say somebody says, you know, Ashley, you really should do this. This thing. How do you know when to feel that? Because you just felt it a little bit, didn't you?
[59:21] B: Yeah.
[59:21] A: Right. Isn't that good? You're able to just turn it on like that. Right. So you got that feeling. Right. And where did you feel it first you did. Was it in like your here? Yeah. Now how did you know when, like how would you be if that wasn't going on? Meaning you weren't having. You would be maybe more open minded. Oh, and what's it like when you're open minded?
[59:52] B: What's it like when I'm open minded? I'm able to experience new things.
[59:56] A: Oh, and when you're open minded and you're able to experience new things, how's your body feeling?
[60:00] B: Happier.
[60:01] A: Oh, it's feeling happier. And so as your body's happy and you're open minded and you're able to experience new things, think about somebody telling you realize you do this and what do you notice?
[60:12] B: I didn't screw up my face.
[60:13] A: Not the same. Right. So it's already beginning to lighten up. So again what we do, because our brain works in a recursive pattern, we think of you as, you know, being more open minded. Right. And we know what it's like when you're open minded, you're able to try like new things. Right. And when you're trying new things and you're open minded and you're feeling happy, how else is your body feeling?
[60:34] B: Feeling free.
[60:36] A: It's feeling free. And you wouldn't want to be in control of your feeling free to do it or not, whether they suggest it. That's right. So if somebody goes, hey, you know, this would be a really good thing for you to do and you might be open minded to decide whether it is or not because you wouldn't want to be free to choose. Oh, you do, don't you? Right. Check it out right now. So think about, you know, somebody going, well you really should go to church and you might, well, you might be open minded.
[61:08] B: Right?
[61:09] A: But you know what you can do when you're open minded? You can go try it and see if it's the thing that works for you. And if it is, you can keep going and if it isn't, you can do something else. Because there's more than one way to connect. That's right. God doesn't just exist in those buildings. That's right. You do know that's right. Because we want things to be lightening up inside so you can remember all that happening and mom acting like that and even him saying that you can remember putting your pants on. Actually stop putting on your pants. We'll stop mom from saying that to the judge. We'll stop her from looking at you like that. Stop it from happening. It's not. So then where is it say it no longer exists.
[61:50] B: It no longer exists.
[61:51] A: And again, now close your eyes. Picture that earlier you and let her know mom acting like that and being that way had nothing to do with you or even her love for you or even her belief in you, but had everything to do with something. Being off with her like that. She can't even get there because of what it would mean about her. So that that younger you gets it let that younger you know that she didn't need mom to get it in order for you to turn out and now be making really good decisions for you. Having your life work more in the way you want it to for the first time. That's right. And as all of that gets into that younger you, take another deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. And what's happening now? Just check. How's your body feeling now?
[63:00] B: Relax.
[63:01] A: It is. Think about that moment of them coming. Dcf, police mom, what she said to the judge and all of that. What do you notice now?
[63:13] B: I'm really relaxed right now.
[63:15] A: You are, aren't you?
[63:16] B: I don't have any feelings towards it.
[63:17] A: Yeah. It's not causing that same thing. That's right. And then we can now think about Grandma's. And when you were at Grandma's, at first it was okay, but Grandma was like a lot older, so she couldn't be as strict. And was grandma working at that time too? She was retired. Yeah, but like you were like having to deal with the after effects of what you had went through and kind of at that time feeling like my mom washed her hands of me, which was then feeling like I'm like not even worth it to her. Well, then I'll show you.
[63:58] B: Yeah.
[63:59] A: How not worth it I am.
[64:01] B: Yes, exactly. What happened?
[64:04] A: Right? So then drinking started. Right. And then when drinking started, there was also like boy stuff. And you already kind of had the idea that boys are interested. And then you started being interested in boys. Right. And we know that when a girl is interested in a boy, it's pretty easy for her to have him do whatever she wants him to do. Right? Because that's how it works. Because guys don't say no.
[64:26] B: No.
[64:26] A: Right. I remember one time girl telling me, she took my advice, I gave her the advice. You know, the whole idea is why buy the cow if you can drink the milk for free.
[64:34] B: Yeah.
[64:35] A: She goes on the first date with the guy, she goes, I didn't have sex with him on the first date. I'm like, awesome, that's great. She goes, I did give Him a blowjob. That is almost the same thing. Like, no, no, no. You didn't get the idea. The whole idea was to have you have a little more. Like, it totally went right by. Exactly. Because the guy's gonna be like. The guy's gonna be like, this is even better. Not only. Like, I don't have to do anything.
[64:55] B: Yeah.
[64:55] A: It was fantastic.
[64:56] B: Was she blonde?
[65:01] A: Yeah. So it's that kind of thing. So we want that to be, you know, and we know that that's what would happen. And then was there other stuff that transpired then, too? I mean, is there stuff that you feel bad about having done then?
[65:17] B: Lying.
[65:18] A: Lying to my grandma. Okay.
[65:20] B: And my mom.
[65:21] A: Yeah.
[65:22] B: I've milked them for so much money. It's crazy. And I've kind of, like, used things. I've just become very manipulative. And I know that they know that it was wrong, because even my grandma kind of, like, jumped on their bandwagon. Like, I remember being on the back porch and, like, screaming at them, you know, that they don't believe me. And they're just like, well, look at your track record. But I think he used that for his advantage, you know, like, he knew they wouldn't believe me or something. Or he knew he could make them not believe me.
[65:56] A: Right. So grandmom said she was just mad.
[66:00] B: Yeah. My grandma never blatantly put it on me that I was lying, but I felt like. I think my grandma was just torn. I think my grandma didn't know what to do with her daughter. I'm her granddaughter, you know, So I think she was just stuck in the middle. And so I started just acting crazy.
[66:21] A: So what do you mean, you milk them?
[66:24] B: I would just make up all these lies and this. That I was doing this or that I had a job interviews. I needed money for, you know, a uniform or shoes or that I needed to pay my rent or, you know, whatever, and I would just have them give me money for drugs, But.
[66:42] A: So you were being creative, very creative and resourceful.
[66:51] B: Never thought of it that way.
[66:53] A: You didn't, did you? That you're actually really resourceful.
[66:56] B: Yeah.
[66:57] A: And creative, because that's a hidden ability that you have. Because in order to be able to get money ongoingly from people, you had to be pretty creative.
[67:10] B: Oh, yeah.
[67:11] A: And you had to be pretty resilient.
[67:13] B: Yes.
[67:14] A: And resourceful. And I'm wondering how you being creative, resilient and resourceful can, you know, serve you now.
[67:23] B: Sure, it probably could.
[67:24] A: Don't you think, in what you're doing yes. Because doesn't it take some resiliency to continue.
[67:30] B: Yes.
[67:31] A: In this program.
[67:32] B: Yes.
[67:32] A: And being resourceful. That's right. And you know, you get to exercise your creativity. That's right. Now. That's right. And that a good news thing.
[67:44] B: Yeah, it is.
[67:45] A: Yeah. And again, that you back then. See, the thing that goes on is, let's just check with what you know now, where you are, what's transpired. If you had known what you know now back then, like when you'd started going out and drinking then doing stuff with boys and then in it. If you had known what you know now.
[68:15] B: Yeah.
[68:16] A: Back then, like how this thing was going to turn out, what that was going to lead to, what is going to lead to in kind of lifestyle in it. If you had known that back then, what you know now, would you have done it? I mean, would you have gotten into the drinking and the stuff with the boys and the. Would you have done it? If you had had all the resources, like, if you had known the knowledge that, you know now, if you had all that information back then, would you have done it? Isn't that interesting?
[68:49] B: You know, I can't really say no that I wouldn't because it's made me who I am today, you know, And I don't feel like I should have regrets, but I mean, it probably would have been a lot. Maybe I could have walked the easier path, you know, maybe I wouldn't have been so hurtful, you know.
[69:09] A: See, the interesting thing is when we see, you know, what's happening now.
[69:14] B: What.
[69:14] A: What's happening now, like, body wise, what are you noticing?
[69:17] B: Nothing.
[69:18] A: Nothing. So do you have any regrets?
[69:24] B: I don't know.
[69:26] A: We'll check.
[69:30] B: Yeah, I have regrets.
[69:31] A: You do? Okay. What's the regrets about? There we go.
[69:38] B: Not being there for my kids.
[69:40] A: Oh, okay. Which you're working on doing different things now. How old are they?
[69:48] B: My son just turned 13 Saturday and my daughter's 11 and my other daughter's 7.
[69:54] A: Okay, 13, 11 and 7. So you were young. Young. I was 18, yeah. 18 when you had him.
[70:08] B: Yeah. I'm pregnant.
[70:11] A: Yeah. I was 18 when you got pregnant too. So you just turned 18 or were you 17?
[70:16] B: Oh, yeah, I guess I was 17 when I got pregnant. Yeah.
[70:19] A: Yeah, yeah. My mom was 19 when she got pregnant. So was mine. Yeah. Yeah. So the regrets would be that you didn't have as much time as you might have wanted connecting to your kids. Where are they now?
[70:46] B: Brendan is with my grandma.
[70:48] A: Okay.
[70:49] B: And Nikayle is in Wyoming with her dad.
[70:52] A: Okay.
[70:53] B: He went to a rehab and moved her out there. And Mercedes is with her. I have. She has a different dad and she's with him and his mom. His mom legally adopted her. I was in jail.
[71:07] A: Yeah. Yeah. So they're safe. They're safe where they are now.
[71:13] B: Yes.
[71:13] A: Yeah. And in a good environment. Yeah. That's cool. Because they weren't in a good environment. Environment as much when you were like.
[71:26] B: Yeah.
[71:27] A: In jail or on the streets.
[71:30] B: Yeah. And even with me, you know, I was getting high in the bedroom and stuff. I mean, you know, I was still like, around, but I think I was kind of like short tempered and, you know, they were like, mistreated them. But, yeah, I kind of forgot them. One day I was going to the methadone clinic and I just. I was like 10 minutes late getting them. I tried to call the school and tell them not to put them on the bus, but they were already like, on the bus as the buses were pulling out because, like I said, I forgot. So my kids were like outside waiting for me to get home for like 10 minutes. And somebody called DCF and my kids got taken.
[72:13] A: That's fine.
[72:14] B: I went even more crazy.
[72:17] A: Yeah.
[72:18] B: Because I didn't have the kids. You know, I could do whatever the fuck I wanted to then. And I was just mad it was their fault, you know, I lost my kids. I was mad that they took them and fuck this, I'm not doing nothing. I don't know why. It was crazy.
[72:32] A: Well, yeah, but I mean, that's the whole thing. That's very common. Right. Because maybe the train was a little off the track, but I was sustaining then. The kids are gone now. I'm way off the track. Yeah. Yes. The train's been tipped.
[72:52] B: Yeah. Rolling down the hill. Exactly.
[72:57] A: Yeah. But see, the thing that we want to get is again, all that stuff, what you're doing now, changing your life for the better. That's right. See, that's the whole thing. And we know that you couldn't have not done that stuff that you did then. So I understand where you are in that. I don't want to have any regrets. But I'm also thinking that if, at 14, when all that transpired and you started living at Grams, if you had known then what you know now, meaning how all of that stuff was gonna turn out.
[73:48] B: Yeah.
[73:48] A: Would you have done it?
[73:49] B: You're right.
[73:52] A: Yeah. But the thing is. And see, that's where we want the learnings. See, if somebody's got regret and remorse, it's because they have really good Learnings, but that the learnings are in the wrong location. See, if we take the learnings and we put it back to that moment, and you've known all of that, like somebody had laid out this. Right. But. But you didn't know any of that information back then that earlier you didn't have the wisdom that you do now. So therefore, back then, based on the circumstances and experiences and everything that was going on for her, she just did what occurred for her to do, Right. Nobody. Nobody, you know, when they're like 11, goes, you know what? I'm hoping later on I can become a junkie and be like, you know, I'm going to start first, like, snorting and I'm gonna be really like, injecting. That's what I want for me. What do you want to be, Billy? I want to be an astronaut. What do you want to be? I want to be totally strung out. Nobody says that. Right. Because that's not what people have planned. But again, it wasn't as if that was like a thing that kind of transpired along the way. It wasn't the first starter, you know, 14. If someone goes, you really want to do this? Like needles. Hello. Oh, thank you.
[75:25] B: Yeah, right.
[75:26] A: That's a whole different world. Yeah, but now, see, if we go back that earlier you didn't have any of that information, Right. And therefore, with her knowing it, it's just really good, useful knowledge. Same thing with having left the kids for 10 minutes. Same thing with, you know, if you had known back then what you know now. That's right. That's right. Which makes it becoming easier and easier to be at peace with what has on the way. Because aren't you changing your life totally different than it's been?
[76:09] B: Yes.
[76:09] A: Yeah, that's right. Isn't that a good news thing? Very good news thing. Yeah. So again, just check. How's your body feeling now? Yeah. When you think back about the stuff that we talked about, what do you notice now?
[76:28] B: Nothing.
[76:30] A: Yeah. And the stuff with stepdad. Right. And even stuff with mom. I mean, there's some disappointment.
[76:41] B: Yeah.
[76:42] A: Yeah. But let's check. Does mom love you? Yes, she does. Does mom love you in the way that you wanted to be loved by that mom now? Well, she might better now.
[76:55] B: Yeah.
[76:56] A: But not back then.
[77:00] B: She loved me then, too.
[77:01] A: She did. And she still does. But here's the thing. She didn't love you in the way that you thought she should. Yeah, Right, got it. Which has nothing to do with your lovability.
[77:15] B: No.
[77:17] A: Right. Has everything to do with Something being off over there with her. Do you remember jukeboxes like before? Like iPads and pods and things like that. But you used to be able to go into like a club, a restaurant, bar, what have you. They'd be this thing that would play music. And they'd have lots of different records or albums or CDs. Right. And you could pick out different songs and play. It was really cool. Moms mind is more like a broken jukebox. There wasn't a lot of songs. So even if you pressed the buttons and they were different buttons, it only could play that song. So it has nothing to do with mom loving you. She just loves you more in the way that a broken jukebox loves. Which isn't necessarily how you love or wanted to be loved by her. But see, back then it felt like it had to do with your lovability. Like if you really mattered to her then she would have been different then. But see, you mattering because you do. It wasn't about you, it was about her. And again, close your eyes and let that younger you know that what you know now that it's not about me or my lovability. That it had everything to do with something. Being off with mom. So that she gets it. And if she gets it. That's right. Let her grow up with that wisdom that it's not about me. So that she realizes is that it's all on the way to now. Making really good decisions, choices and the freedom. That's right. And then when you're ready, a deep breath in and exhale. And open your eyes. What's happening now?
[80:07] B: It's really relaxed.
[80:09] A: You are, aren't you? So let's think. You know, you might be somewhere and you might be talking to somebody and they might say, you know, Ashley, I really think you should do this. What? Do you notice I said what you did, didn't you? Right. It didn't have that automatic repulsion.
[80:32] B: Yeah. I was more curious.
[80:33] A: You are, aren't you? Yeah. More curious now. That's right. Because that's really about learning. Right. And then you're going to determine whether it's something that fits for me or not. Because you're curious. That's right. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. So then think about, you know, you might be sleeping in the room. You know, everybody said good night. Good night.
[81:04] B: Good night.
[81:04] A: Goodnight. Good night. Goodnight to the boy. Good night. Good night. Swelling. That's right. Everybody says good night. Exactly. Everybody says goodnight. You. You might go in your room. There's nobody else in there. I might be laying down. And what do you notice?
[81:21] B: I'm alone.
[81:23] A: Yeah. In the room, all by myself. Mm. And as you're realizing that you're alone in the room all by yourself, how are you feeling? Comfortable. Because it's nice to get comfortable, you know, when you're laying in bed. Stretching out.
[81:46] B: Yeah. Get some sleep.
[81:48] A: That's right. Because your body's equally distributed, the weight. Cool. Any discomfort, you know, as you put yourself in that room. It's night. It's dark.
[82:04] B: Oh. Why are you looking at me like that for?
[82:10] A: I'm just checking.
[82:11] B: Oh, well, a little.
[82:16] A: Yeah. There we go. That's what we want to get activated. Right. Where'd you notice. What was it that you were thinking about?
[82:24] B: Shadows.
[82:25] A: Shadows. Good. Right. And where. So as you think about shadows, if they're visually located around you, where are they? The shadows, when you think of them? Over there, are they far away?
[82:46] B: Mm.
[82:47] A: Okay. And did you see the shadows over there? Far away.
[82:51] B: Mm.
[82:53] A: How's your body feeling? The nervous right now?
[82:57] B: No, not right now.
[82:58] A: Oh. It isn't. Right. It's not actually feeling nervous as you think about the shadows over there. Far away. That's right. What if they're right here? What you think of the shadows and they're right there?
[83:16] B: Well, that would make me nervous.
[83:18] A: Right. But see, when the shadows move over there and they're far away.
[83:24] B: It'S better.
[83:25] A: It is, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. So it's really just about changing where they were. To be something that used to be true but isn't true now, so that you have more ease. So now think about the shadows and then being really close. Right. And feel some of that discomfort. Got the feeling. Close your eyes. And let that feeling, on its own, actually travel back through time. Back, back, back. Let it take to an earlier, other experience, towards the neurological route. And another moment will be brought to your attention. What comes to mind now?
[84:41] B: Can I open my eyes?
[84:42] A: Yeah. Oh, you can. What comes to mind?
[84:47] B: Just my stepdad.
[84:49] A: On a different moment?
[84:56] B: No, the same moment.
[84:58] A: Well, is it?
[84:59] B: I don't know.
[85:01] A: You don't know? What if he did?
[85:06] B: I really didn't.
[85:09] A: Oh. Cause you think there's more.
[85:13] B: Yes.
[85:13] A: To what happened with him that you don't remember now?
[85:17] B: Yeah.
[85:18] A: Oh, okay. Well, if we were to make up what we think might have happened, that might have been more. What might have happened?
[85:30] B: I don't know. I think he might have touched me before when I was sleeping.
[85:34] A: So he might have touched you before. Right.
[85:36] B: And I Just woke up one time.
[85:38] A: Right. So he might have touched you before. He might have touched between your legs. He might have put his finger in your vagina maybe. He might have been touching you and touching himself.
[85:48] B: He was. He was doing that.
[85:50] A: Oh, he was, wasn't he?
[85:51] B: Yeah.
[85:51] A: Right.
[85:51] B: So I've been working out my backs kind of. So I.
[85:54] A: It's okay. Right? Which is what the peeping tom does.
[86:00] B: Yeah.
[86:01] A: Is watch but touch themselves. You know, most peeping toms, if they get caught, they think the girl's only gonna like, be angry. Cause that's what they show. What are you doing? Watching me? But for some, it flashes to yucky. Right. So I might have done other stuff in the shadows when it was dark. And so you noticed that he was touching himself when he touched you, when you were frozen.
[86:36] B: Yeah.
[86:36] A: By the way, do you know why an animal freezes?
[86:38] B: Because they're scared.
[86:40] A: Oh, it's better than that. So we have fight, we have flight. We have freeze responses. Fight. Yeah, Flight. Run away. But if I can't get away. You know what a predator is not attracted to an already dead animal.
[87:05] B: Right.
[87:07] A: That's where freeze comes in. And by the way, you froze and then it stopped. Well, it did.
[87:22] B: Yeah. I had to think about what you were saying.
[87:26] A: Right. You froze and it stopped. That's right. You didn't realize that that was an adaptive thing, that by freezing you made it stop. That's right. I. I remember this woman that I was working with not too long ago. And she had been raped by this guy. And she fought, fought, fought, fought, fought. Until the point that he was, you know, penetrated. And then she stopped. And then her mind took her away. So she wasn't there for what happened to her body.
[87:58] B: Right.
[87:59] A: Which is really good because, you know, with a guy, only two minutes.
[88:04] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[88:07] A: Check out it doesn't take long.
[88:09] B: Right.
[88:09] A: So she didn't realize that the adaptive feature by her not fighting had it get done faster. That's right. She didn't know that that by her stopping the fighting, had it finished sooner. Kazaki's a guy. Couldn't last very long. Right. So that earlier, you freezing stopped it. That's right. And he might have been doing what he was doing. Touching himself as he was touching you. That's right. And so you can remember that happening, but as you're remembering it happening, how's your body feeling now? You are, aren't you? That's right. Because you defeated that. That's right. So now close your eyes and let that earlier, you know that she's Defeated it. Finished. Over. Completed. Defeated. It no longer exists. That's right. That's right. Take another deep breath in. Exhale. Open your eyes. What's happening now? Right. Right. So now you want to check something else out, Right? So repeat these words after me. I have a nose.
[89:46] B: I have a. No.
[89:46] A: I have two elbows. I have 10 fingers. I have 10 toes. I'm not my elbows. I'm not my fingers. I'm not my nose. I'm not my toes. I have a vagina. I'm not my vagina. My vagina is mine.
[90:03] B: My vagina is mine.
[90:04] A: But it isn't me.
[90:05] B: But it isn't me.
[90:06] A: So we mess with my stuff.
[90:09] B: So I mess with my stuff.
[90:10] A: And it hurt my feelings. And it screwed up my thinking for a while.
[90:13] B: And it screwed up my thinking for a while.
[90:15] A: But he never touched who I really am.
[90:17] B: But he never touched who I really am.
[90:19] A: He never touched my essence.
[90:20] B: He never touched my essence.
[90:21] A: He never touched me.
[90:22] B: He never touched me.
[90:23] A: He messed with my stuff.
[90:25] B: He messed with my stuff.
[90:26] A: But he never got me.
[90:28] B: But he never got me.
[90:28] A: Because who I am because who I am can only be touched.
[90:31] B: Can only be touched.
[90:32] A: With love and respect.
[90:33] B: With love and respect.
[90:34] A: So he messed with my stuff.
[90:35] B: So he messed with me stuff.
[90:36] A: But he never got me.
[90:37] B: They never got me.
[90:38] A: Close your eyes and let that earlier, you know what you know now at a deeper level, all of that integrating so that things lighten up and you experience more comfort and ease inside you. Lightening up more and more comfort and ease. That's right. Take another deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. So now think about, you know, it's night. You said good night. You're in the room, it's dark. You might notice there's different, you know, in particular, if you got a night light, what are you gonna see more of?
[91:58] B: What do you mean?
[91:59] A: The room or shadows in the room?
[92:01] B: Yeah.
[92:02] A: Oh, you didn't realize that, huh? See, when the lights are totally on, you don't see the shadows. But see, we can kind of see a little bit of a shadow from the desk. Right? Is that scary? No, it isn't, is it? Right. Huh? It's just a shadow. I'm wondering what it would be like to be realizing. There we go. See, you just got at a body level that was perfect. That. But it's just a shadow. That's right. You know, paper tigers scare people.
[92:31] B: What?
[92:31] A: Yes, I know, it's crazy. Do you know how they scare people?
[92:34] B: No.
[92:34] A: People don't Know that they're paper.
[92:36] B: Why wouldn't they know?
[92:37] A: Well, because they think it's a real tiger. That's scary. Dreams can scare people when they think it's real. But they're not scary when you realize it's paper. Right? That's right. That's right. Paper tigers.
[92:55] B: Wondering where this paper tiger is.
[92:57] A: Well, see, you've been thinking that those, you know, shadows are real. Right. See, I'm wondering what it's like when you realize that they're paper tigers. Is there anything scary? That's right. That's right. And you're getting more comfort and ease. Yeah. So as you look in the mirror and you see what you've put on, what is it that you're saying to yourself? And ugly. Any other good things?
[93:28] B: No, just those.
[93:31] A: Uh huh.
[93:31] B: And then I look stupid.
[93:33] A: And when you're saying it, whose voice is it in?
[93:36] B: Mine.
[93:37] A: It is, I think. Check it out.
[93:39] B: I don't know whose voice it is really.
[93:41] A: You don't work. So is it coming from? I don't know. You don't. What if you don't look in the mirror?
[93:51] B: Then I'd really look stupid. Probably.
[93:53] A: You're not. You don't think you could like actually put on clothes.
[93:57] B: Yeah.
[93:58] A: Without like seeing yourself do it? I mean, I can close my eyes and actually take my shirt on and off.
[94:02] B: I can.
[94:03] A: You can, can't you? Right. So you don't actually even need to be looking.
[94:06] B: No.
[94:07] A: In the mirror to know that you've got it on.
[94:09] B: Right?
[94:10] A: That's right. That's right. You don't actually even have to look in the mirror to know that you've got it on. I mean, are you afraid that you're gonna forget what you look like?
[94:20] B: No, I'm just.
[94:21] A: Are you afraid you're gonna forget what you look like?
[94:24] B: No.
[94:25] A: You already know. Right?
[94:26] B: Right.
[94:27] A: I don't need to look at me to know what I look like. Right. So let's check. You know, you put on clothes. How do you want to be as you're putting clothes on? You know, feeling inside. Good. Oh, well, how do you know you would be? How do you know when you're feeling good? Oh. Cause you're happy. So you wake up in the morning, you got on whatever you've got on. And then you're changing to get ready. Feeling happy.
[94:55] B: Yeah. Then my clothes probably would look better.
[94:57] A: And then you put your clothes on.
[94:58] B: Yeah.
[94:58] A: Oh, okay. So think about doing that now.
[95:02] B: Being happy.
[95:03] A: Well, just check. Waking up in the morning. Right. Putting your clothes on. What do you Notice nothing. Because you wouldn't want to actually feel good about you.
[95:17] B: No, I would.
[95:18] A: Right. Getting up. Yeah, that's right. And getting dressed. So check. Try to feel bad now.
[95:28] B: I don't want to.
[95:29] A: Well, just. Wouldn't you rather try here?
[95:32] B: Okay. Try to feel bad.
[95:34] A: Yeah.
[95:35] B: Okay.
[95:36] A: Try to access that same thing. Right. You put on whatever you put on. Hmm?
[95:47] B: I got it.
[95:48] A: You got it. Good. What'd you say to yourself?
[95:51] B: No, I wasn't saying anything. I wasn't getting in that. Trying to get in that slump.
[95:55] A: Oh, it's a slump. Well, can you feel it if you're not slumped? Like, if you're sitting upright?
[96:02] B: I don't mean that kind of slump. I mean an emotional slump.
[96:05] A: I know you didn't mean that kind of slump. You didn't know that physically and emotionally, it's the same circuitry.
[96:11] B: Yeah.
[96:12] A: Yeah. You didn't know that, did you?
[96:15] B: Not really.
[96:16] A: That the circuitry in the brain that understands things in a emotional way is the same circuitry that understands it in a physical way that actually. Sitting up. Right. So check. Try to feel. You know that slump when you're sitting up? Right. It's harder. Can you even get it slumping when you're actually. No, weird. Actually, when you're actually sitting upright. Right. Check. Try to get it. Try to get that slump. See, you can't get it until you start doing this.
[96:52] B: Yeah, I have to do this to feel that way.
[96:57] A: You do. Right. Oh. So I'm wondering what it would be like if you were looking in the mirror and you were standing upright. I mean, you could definitely slump in the mirror if you wanted to, or you could stand upright. So just check. Go ahead. Stand up. Think about, like, you're looking in a mirror and you're, like, literally standing upright. What do you notice? Right. How's that feel?
[97:20] B: Good.
[97:20] A: It does, doesn't it? Now do it when you're slumped. Right. Of course I'm gonna look stupid. Right. How does it feel different now? Stand upright. You didn't realize that it was actually based on how you were standing? No, I didn't. You didn't?
[97:35] B: No, but it makes sense.
[97:37] A: Isn't that crazy? Because it is the same circuitry in the brain, Right? That's right. There's a great YouTube video by Amy. Maybe it's a TED talk by Amy Cuddy. C U D, D Y. I think she talks about power poses, but literally our posture changes how we feel. Oh, right.
[98:04] B: I thought that.
[98:06] A: Yeah, yeah, it's a TED Talk. I think it's a TED Talk, but it's really TED Talk is just like a YouTube.
[98:13] B: Okay.
[98:13] A: It's a short, 20 minute talk.
[98:16] B: Okay.
[98:17] A: On power poses, like how you feel different if you have, like that celebration pose.
[98:23] B: Yeah.
[98:23] A: You actually feel different.
[98:25] B: Yeah.
[98:25] A: Than if you're. Yeah, right, right. So think about waking up, getting up in the morning. You got, like, your closet with stuff in it or drawers. You might pull out a couple things and you put them on and you're upright. Right. And as you're looking in the mirror, what do you notice?
[98:49] B: You feel better. I look better.
[98:51] A: Oh, you feel better. Oh, because you're looking better because you're up. Right. You didn't realize that. That's right.
[99:02] B: When you said that, I started thinking about stretching and, like, stretch like that. I do feel like I'm in a good mood.
[99:09] A: You do, don't you? It makes a difference. Yeah. Right. Isn't that a good news? So those are all practices that you can have. Right. Because try to get that, you know, discomfort thing. No. You might be walking in, people might look at you.
[99:29] B: But if you're feeling good, you're feeling confident, and you're not really worried about what people are.
[99:33] A: You aren't, are you? Right. Right. So just check, you know, think about, you know, walking out in the main area. There are people in the kitchen. I might be looking at you. Did you know that you can actually press this button? It'll start coughing. Yeah, I know. You probably don't know that.
[99:59] B: I do now. If I wasn't sure, I would know.
[100:04] A: Right. But I want you to check. Is it making you uncomfortable?
[100:07] B: No.
[100:08] A: Right. It isn't. And you might see the different girls. There might be Savannah. Right. What do you notice? I don't care. Or Rachel.
[100:23] B: I love Rachel.
[100:26] A: I don't care. There might be Megan, Rhonda. They all might be.
[100:31] B: I love Rhonda. I love Rhonda. She's so funny.
[100:36] A: They all might be there. They might look at you.
[100:41] B: I don't care.
[100:42] A: Right. That's right. Notice how there's more comfort there because it doesn't matter. Right. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. Cool. So what else are you noticing now that you weren't before? Like, just check again. How's your body feeling?
[101:08] B: Oh, I'm sitting up straight.
[101:09] A: You are more sitting up straight, aren't you? Mm, yeah. Yeah. When you think about this stuff that happened.
[101:22] B: I don't feel anything towards it right now.
[101:28] A: Stuff that happened with stepdad, things that's transpired with mom after what happened with stepdad.
[101:37] B: I can't Change it, huh?
[101:40] A: Is it making you feel bad about you?
[101:43] B: No, I don't feel bad about me right now.
[101:47] A: You don't, do you? And that's different than it's been. Yeah. Cause you wouldn't want to feel, you know, good about the positive changes you're making now.
[101:55] B: Ever.
[101:56] A: That's right. Yeah. As things are getting lighter. Right. And easier for you to move forward in ways that are truly useful and good for you.
[102:09] B: Thanks.
[102:10] A: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. And we didn't even have to wait it out.
[102:21] B: They call it the eraser.
[102:22] A: The eraser.
[102:23] B: Yeah.
[102:24] A: We didn't even have to erase anything. No. I think people are better off having the memories because once we've got the learnings in the right location, we're a lot wiser.
[102:36] B: Yeah.
[102:36] A: Yeah.
[102:37] B: Gotta keep it real.
[102:38] A: Well. Right. And as you said, there are things that I've gone through that I. That I learned from. Mm. That have contributed to me being who I am now. That's right. Yeah.
[102:53] B: That is true.
[102:54] A: Yeah.
[102:55] B: If you take that away, then and.
[102:57] A: Now, you're on the way to being an even better you. Right. So go back to, like, you know, at night, you might be in the room alone. You might see a shadow.
[103:11] B: Maybe I'll try sleeping with the light off.
[103:14] A: Well, you might see a shadow. What do you notice as you think about seeing a shadow?
[103:19] B: It's just a shadow.
[103:21] A: It is just a shadow. That's right. That's right. And devil's got way too many other things to handle other than you.
[103:28] B: Mm.
[103:33] A: Too many other, you know, other people to fuck with. That's right. That's right. Even if there is one. Yeah. Or not. I was always told that the devil you know is the better. Better than the one you don't.
[103:53] B: Oh.
[104:00] A: And then I told that to somebody. Then I told that to somebody in Holland. They go, that's different than our culture says, it's better to not know the devil.
[104:09] B: Yeah.
[104:10] A: Or to that the. The devil you know is better than the devil you don't. Which basically means that if you already know, then you've got more wisdom.
[104:22] B: That makes me see. No, I don't like that idea.
[104:26] A: What if there isn't a devil actually out to get you?
[104:33] B: I hope that's the case.
[104:34] A: Well, I mean, is there.
[104:36] B: I mean, I don't know.
[104:37] A: It would be a really weird thing to start believing in.
[104:40] B: Yeah. Yeah. That's it. We give him power.
[104:47] A: Right. Right. And we want you to be able to choose. Right. You know, you should really do this thing. You go, I'm curious. I Might try it out. Cause I'm curious. That's right. Because you might know. Try it out because you're curious. Yeah, that's right.
[105:08] B: I like that idea.
[105:09] A: It is. Yeah, I know. I can tell.
[105:12] B: I haven't even thought about being curious. How fun that would be.
[105:15] A: Right? How much more fun can you have as you're curious? Right. Because then you can learn all sorts of new things and then you get to try on different things and whether they fit for you or not. And if they do, you get to wear them. And if they don't try something else on, it might fit better.
[105:32] B: More possibilities.
[105:34] A: That's right. That's right. Cool. All right. So anything else left for you for today that we didn't get to.
[105:44] B: No. Got it.
[105:48] A: You do. So one more time, think of the leopard. Take a deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. And with your eyes closed, they rest. And as your eyes are resting closed, you also rest. That's right. Your mind and body integrating. Absorbing what it's gotten in life all the way. Because just like with planting seeds in the soil, all the work is in the planting. And then maybe some light watering. And then there's nothing you need to do to make them growl. The water seeps in the seeds. Seedlings begin to sprout first, developing strong roots, solid from within. And once it's solid, it grows up. And so much goes on before you ever see any of it. Above ground. Happening in that same, same way within you. Becoming more and more of who you really are. So much more than you think. Things lightening up so that as you're seeing yourself, whether it be the visualization or just in the mirror, feeling really good up, right? That's right. And more ease and comfort inside, knowing that you're doing those things that are best for you. Now on the way to even more. And then when you're ready, take a deep breath in. And then exhale. Cool. You did great. Thanks.
[108:03] B: Yeah, so did you.
[108:05] A: All right, well, we will stop for today.
