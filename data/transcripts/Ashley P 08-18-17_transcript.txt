[00:00] A: Today is the 18th of August, Ashley. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that you and I and Steve, who is observing is also in here. That recording may be made available. Given what we do is life changing to training others. Wanted to make sure all of that was okay with you.
[00:20] B: Yes.
[00:20] A: Okay, cool. So A, give me an update from how our last session left you, and then B, you're mad, but you don't really know why and you'd like to stop being mad or upset. Yes. Yeah. Okay, cool. Thank you. So what would be useful to know? How did the last session leave you? When you think about some of this stuff that we talked about, how do you feel about those things now?
[00:46] B: I feel good. I don't feel like people are like, all right here.
[00:51] A: Right.
[00:51] B: Remember that?
[00:52] A: Yeah. They moved away a little bit. They're not so close. Yeah. Yeah. When you think back about. Because we talked about different things that happened, like stuff that had happened with stepdad. When you think about that stuff, how do you feel about it now? It doesn't have the same.
[01:10] B: I don't think so.
[01:11] A: Right. I mean, because you can think about it now. You can remember what he did, but as you're thinking about it, you don't have a physiological disposition. Comfort.
[01:19] B: Right.
[01:20] A: Which is different than a temperament. Pretty much, yeah. Right. Okay, good. And then, like, you know, how. How has stuff been at night? Sleeping.
[01:29] B: Oh, yeah, I sleep.
[01:31] A: Oh, you sleep now?
[01:32] B: I do.
[01:32] A: Oh, isn't that interesting? Because that's not what was happening when you came in.
[01:35] B: I couldn't sleep.
[01:36] A: Right. You had like the whole shadow thing and now that's different.
[01:39] B: Yeah. I don't have that anymore. Yeah, See, I forgot about it. I'm like. I don't even remember what we talked about last night.
[01:45] A: That, like, it already became the new normal. Right. But you can go back to remembering how it was now and how different it is.
[01:54] B: It just doesn't bother me anymore.
[01:55] A: Right. It doesn't. Yeah. And when you think about. Well, first of all, we talked about you being out of a slump sitting up. Right? Yeah. Remember that? Right. Because when you sit upright, how does your body feel? Right. Yeah. Right now it does, doesn't it? Right. Get your upright. And then we talked a little bit about, like, bad feelings that you had about losing kids and the drugs and traffic stuff. And bad feelings about, like, negative, more critical thoughts about you.
[02:27] B: And you know what? I really don't hate what I see in the mirror anymore. It is because sometimes I think about it and I'M like, why don't we you.
[02:37] A: Hmm? Right? Huh? Isn't that interesting? Yeah. Yeah. You're, like, more at peace when you look at you. I am like, you're more okay with you.
[02:47] B: I'm more okay with me.
[02:48] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yay. Okay, so good. Well, now that we kind of presence what it was that we got accomplished for you, think about whatever it was that you were feeling, you know, about.
[03:00] B: What I'm mad about.
[03:01] A: Yeah. Think about it now. What do you notice? Mm. Oh, yeah. I don't know.
[03:08] B: You know what I think I'm mad about?
[03:10] A: What?
[03:11] B: I'll tell you what I'm mad about.
[03:12] A: Okay.
[03:12] B: I think I'm mad. Everything's really going, like, good with me. Like, I just phased up. Ms. Lori found somebody donated. They paid for my. I want to be a victim's advocate. And it's like a course that you take online, like, five to six weeks. And anyways, she found somebody already paid for it. And so, like, everything's going really good, you know?
[03:41] A: We will really want to be mad about that.
[03:43] B: Huh?
[03:44] A: We really want to be mad about that.
[03:45] B: I don't know what all these things.
[03:47] A: That are going really good.
[03:48] B: Yeah, everything's going good. Like, why am I so freaking annoyed today? Yesterday I had a session. I'm doing, like, my. My genogram and with Lisa.
[04:00] A: Okay.
[04:01] B: Lisa Ro and. I don't know, just some things about my mom.
[04:06] A: Oh, that's what you're. No. So would you like to get free from that?
[04:10] B: Yes.
[04:10] A: Okay. We could do that. Because it's useful. As Lisa was doing that stuff, it kind of reminded you of things that you hadn't thought about in a long time, and then as you were thinking about them, there was, like, hurt and upset and about all of that. Right. Okay, so if that wasn't happening to you when you were free from it, how would you actually be?
[04:31] B: Probably grateful.
[04:32] A: Oh, grateful. What's it like when you feel grateful, not mad? And when you're not mad, how are you happy? That's right. And as you're feeling happy and grateful. Right. Think about whatever it was that mom did. What do you notice takes the happiness away?
[04:51] B: Oh, well, I'm not so happy.
[04:52] A: Anyway, let's check. Is it the same as it used to be just a second ago? Because as you're feeling like, you know, grateful and happy and light. Right. Think about mom doing that stuff. Oh, it's so interesting what's happening now.
[05:08] B: I just can't stay happy.
[05:09] A: Oh, so what about mom doing that Stuff isn't okay. And if you were actually free and light and no longer bothered by it, would that make what mom did okay?
[05:18] B: No.
[05:19] A: Oh, okay. So you get to be free from it, even though what mom did wasn't okay. So what's bothering you about what mom did then? Right. Like, there's a time you might have been how old and what might have happened. So you might have been 14. You might have been where?
[05:40] B: I mean, it's just.
[05:41] A: Well, we want to think of one time because we know that mom is broad. So let's narrow down to one thing mom did back then, that when you think about it, it's still got yuckiness.
[05:50] B: She was my stepdad.
[05:52] A: Well, how do you know? Oh, well, what happened?
[05:57] B: She didn't believe me.
[05:58] A: So let's go to the experience. By the way that happened, you were my 14. Ish. There are other things you've done after that was more fun than that. Yeah. What's one of those things?
[06:08] B: I graduated high school.
[06:10] A: Yeah, you graduated high school. That was way more enjoyable. Something else.
[06:14] B: I had my kids.
[06:15] A: Right. Yeah. Right. And one other thing.
[06:18] B: I got a car.
[06:19] A: Right. So getting a car and having your kids and graduating high school, all more enjoyable than that. Which. That part of your brain isn't bothered because of what mom did, but because part of your brain doesn't know it stopped. Right. And you probably know now better than then that mom back then wasn't 100%, mentally, emotionally, well, stable gal. Like, she had, like, her own crap going on, which might have also clouded why she made crappy decisions. Right. And then the other thing is, you know, it's really hard for a parent to actually think that somebody that they care about could do that to their own kid. So it kind of like, blanks it out. Because. Not because they don't believe their kid, but. But because of what it would mean about them that they would be with somebody that does that. I mean, I remember, gosh, there was a kid, boy, whose uncle had molested him, and he went and told his mom, and mom said, don't you dare say that about my brother. Whoa, jeez. Like, I mean. But not because she didn't believe the son, but because if that was true, what would it mean about me that my own brother could do that to my kid? Right. Like, can't even be with that kind of thing. So you might have been 14, you might have been where?
[07:29] B: At home.
[07:30] A: At home. Right. Like in the hallway or kitchen or dining room.
[07:33] B: Bedroom.
[07:34] A: Bedroom. Right. And then what might have happened next? Mom Came in and you and mom were talking and you said what?
[07:42] B: He touched me.
[07:43] A: Well, he touched me, like, in parts of my body that made me uncomfortable. Right. Good. Know what might happen next?
[07:49] B: She acted like she believed me at first.
[07:51] A: Oh, yeah.
[07:52] B: Okay.
[07:52] A: Wow, that's really sad. And sorry about all that. Right. Then what happened next?
[07:57] B: And then I told.
[07:59] A: And then you told my friends. Right. And then you said something to your friends. Right. And then what happened next?
[08:05] B: They called. They told my principal.
[08:07] A: Right. Good. And then, like, your principal called, and then people came and investigated.
[08:11] B: Yes.
[08:11] A: And then what happened next?
[08:12] B: My mom was mad at me. Yes.
[08:14] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[08:16] B: I was removed from the home.
[08:19] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[08:21] B: Moved in with my grandma.
[08:22] A: Right. And then what happened?
[08:24] B: I started.
[08:25] A: Well, you did other things.
[08:26] B: Right.
[08:26] A: Right. But you moved in with your grandma, which was better than when mom was mad at you and even better than when stepdad was touching you. Right. And then later on, you had your kids and got your car and graduated high school. So we got graduating high school and getting your kids having your car. We've got living at grandma's, We've got leaving. We've got them doing the investigation, mom being paid, the principal, kids telling you tell kids you told Mom. Mom seemed to believe mom came in before that stuff had happened. And before that, you were doing whatever you were doing. Good. And again, running through it backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was.
[09:00] B: Was not the same?
[09:01] A: It wasn't the same. Right. You can remember all that happening in the same way you can remember putting on your jacket. Ashley, stop putting on your jacket.
[09:09] B: I'm not putting on my jacket.
[09:10] A: Well, then stop mom from doing that. Well, then you stop putting on your flip flops.
[09:13] B: I'm not putting on my flip flops.
[09:14] A: Stop me from putting gel in my hair.
[09:15] B: You're not putting gel in my hair.
[09:16] A: Stop that from happening.
[09:17] B: I can't.
[09:18] A: It's not happening. That's the good news, is that you don't even need to stop it. Stop it from happening quick till there's nothing to be done.
[09:24] B: Nothing to be done.
[09:25] A: Right. Because it no longer exists.
[09:27] B: No longer exists. Right.
[09:28] A: And as you get that, what do you notice? Calm you are, aren't you? Right. Right. Things are beginning to lighten up. Right. And mom was mad, but because of, like, all the problems it caused. Right, Right. It's kind of like, you know, somebody knows that somebody smokes pot. Don't tell anybody at school because they're gonna, like, I mean, all sorts of things. Mom had what was going on Cause it created more problems for Mom. Right? Not because she didn't care or didn't even believe, but because it created more problems for her. Right. And we also know that she's not like 100% mentally, emotionally. Well, at least she wasn't back then. She might be different a little bit now, maybe, but she certainly wasn't then. But that you didn't know any of that. So close your eyes. Think of the younger you back then realizing Mom's reaction had to do with mom and what it was doing for mom. Not about you have that younger you realize that mom wasn't back then, well, emotionally. So that she gets it. Let her know, by the way, that she didn't need her mom to be well, in order for her to graduate high school, to have her own kids, to get a car, to be making really positive and powerful changes in her life now. That's right. And as that you realizes it, what do you notice happened to her? Who? That younger you back then.
[10:55] B: Ask me again.
[10:56] A: Yeah. What happened to that younger you's face? Just check.
[11:00] B: I'm smiling.
[11:01] A: Oh, you are, right. Oh, she is smiling inside of you, isn't she? Because she's free now.
[11:06] B: Isn't my eyes supposed to be closed?
[11:08] A: No.
[11:08] B: Okay.
[11:09] A: I mean, I don't know. It doesn't really matter.
[11:11] B: Okay.
[11:12] A: Right. But you can just check with how you're feeling now. What do you notice?
[11:17] B: I'm not so mad anyway.
[11:18] A: Well, you're not so mad anymore at Mom. Oh. Well, would it be okay to not be mad at Mom?
[11:27] B: Yeah, I don't want to be mad at her.
[11:29] A: Well, I'm thinking you're mad at her not because of she was. I know that's weird, right? But I think it's because you can conceive of mom having not been that way, which if she wasn't that way, it would be better. So your brain's trying to get you to get her to not be that way. Hurry. But the timing's all screwed up. Right? So we want to get the timing organized. Right. So I'm gonna say, well, stop mom from acting like that when you were 14. Quick, say there's nothing to be done. No. Ashley, hurry. Stop her from doing that. What are you waiting for?
[12:07] B: Nothing to be done.
[12:08] A: No. Come on, let's go. Nothing to be done because it no longer exists.
[12:12] B: No longer exist.
[12:12] A: That's right. And now check. What do you notice happening to those feelings?
[12:17] B: Oh, they're going away.
[12:18] A: Well, they are, aren't they? Right? Yeah. What you're saying to yourself now, about that, like, does it bother you? I mean, just. I mean, we still aren't ever gonna, like how mom was. We're never gonna think that how mom was. Right. Just. And okay. But you being okay now and no longer hurting over how mom was back then, wouldn't that be all okay? Yeah. Right, right. And don't we want to have an accurate lens when we think about Mom?
[12:51] B: Yes.
[12:51] A: That there are going to be certain capabilities and certain limitations that she's got that have nothing to do with you, but everything to do with, you know, what goes on with her. Make sense? Yeah. Right. And what's happening now, you're not so mad. Right. So have you ever gone to McDonald's? Yes. You have? Do you like it? I love McDonald's. You do? Like, what's your favorite?
[13:19] B: Sausage biscuit.
[13:20] A: Ooh. Can you tell me other things on the menu without like looking and hash browns?
[13:24] B: Yes.
[13:24] A: Right. Well, it's like, you know, the main things that they serve.
[13:27] B: Hot dog, cheeseburger, McChicken or McDo. McDo. I don't know.
[13:32] A: Right. What's the big, big thing that they have? They have a.
[13:36] B: Is that a whopper? Big Mac.
[13:38] A: Ah, see, there you go. So you know all of that stuff without even stepping foot in McDonald's. You don't get shocked that that's all they have. You don't go into McDonald's going, where's the salmon? You know, I was looking for a kale salad, right? You know, do that. I was looking for a kale salad. Do they have that here?
[13:58] B: No.
[13:58] A: Right. Because that's not McDonald's. So would it make sense to go into McDonald's hoping for, you know, quinoa?
[14:07] B: No, no.
[14:07] A: Right. McDonald's isn't going to serve quinoa anyway, right. So McDonald's only has a certain amount on their menu. That's all they have. If you go to McDonald's and go, can I have a Pepsi? They go, I'm sorry, we only serve Coke. Right. You can't get Pepsi there. Right. So you can only get certain things at that store. There's a lot of other places that you can get cheeseburgers from them. Other fast food places, other sit down restaurants. There's actually a magazine that came out, Sarasota magazine came out with the burger magazine. It's got like 15 of the top places in Sarasota to get burgers according to I don't know whom, but then maybe I don't know whether it's true. Right. But you can get a lot of places to get burgers. But McDonald's only has the same thing. It's like, mom, you don't have to go into McDonald's. You don't have to go visit Mom. You don't have to interact with McDonald's. You don't have to interact with Mom. But if you do, you want to know what it has? What's its strengths and limitations? What are you going to get in that particular interaction?
[15:17] B: Only what she's got.
[15:19] A: Right? Right. You might think it would be better if she could give more. We might think it would be better if McDonald's served, you know, kale and quinoa salads.
[15:30] B: Ale, maybe.
[15:33] A: Right. But that's not on the menu. Yeah. It has nothing to do with you or me, what McDonald's serves. Right. And you wouldn't want to be realizing that about your mom, though. And as you already get it, what do you notice?
[15:51] B: There's nothing I can do about it.
[15:53] A: Well, is there anything for you to do about it? And if that's all you get from her, and you know that ahead of time, can you be hurt?
[16:02] B: No.
[16:02] A: Or disappointed? Right.
[16:04] B: Shouldn't be.
[16:05] A: Well, how could you be?
[16:07] B: I could be.
[16:08] A: You could.
[16:08] B: It'd be stupid.
[16:10] A: You could get hurt and disappointed that McDonald's doesn't have salmon.
[16:12] B: Oh, no.
[16:17] A: Could you realize that what mom and how mom does isn't about you?
[16:22] B: Yes.
[16:24] A: And when you realize that, how does it feel?
[16:27] B: Better.
[16:28] A: Well, it does. All right. So check. Think about the thing that you were angry about. That's a good breath. What do you notice?
[16:39] B: I'm calmer.
[16:41] A: You are calmer. Right? Yeah. So, I mean, you woke up this morning and you were kind of like, you know, in a funk, funky mood. Right. And you know what happens when you sit upright?
[16:53] B: Feel better.
[16:54] A: That's right. Right. And as you're sitting upright now, you know, thinking about you lighter and more easy going, more peaceful and free. Right. Because things are actually moving in the direction you want them to go. You're, like, intending where you want to go, and all of a sudden, hey, look, wow. We've got this thing painted for that you can go do now. Right. How cool is that?
[17:20] B: Really cool.
[17:21] A: Yeah. Yeah. Because you realize that it's better to be, you know, giving back in a bigger way.
[17:27] B: Yes.
[17:27] A: Right. That may be like, people could learn or at least get that you understand them. Right? Huh? And when you think about all of that and you think about you now, what do you notice?
[17:41] B: I'm really happy.
[17:42] A: You are, huh?
[17:43] B: I am grateful.
[17:43] A: You are grateful. And as you're Feeling grateful. Think about mom being the one that brought you, you know, here. Because without her, you wouldn't be sitting in front of me.
[17:52] B: Right?
[17:53] A: Right. And you wouldn't want to be feeling grateful about that. How much better your life is now. Right. And what's happening now? I'm crying. You aren't you?
[18:04] B: I love her. I know she loves me.
[18:07] A: She does. But she loves you in the way that, like, a broken jukebox loves.
[18:13] B: I don't even know what that means.
[18:14] A: I know. You don't even know what a jukebox is. No, I do know what a jukebox.
[18:19] B: I've played one before.
[18:23] A: Well, one that's broken doesn't have a lot of songs. See, the whole purpose of a jukebox is like an iPad or ipod now. Or our phones. Now, you can have lots of different songs from lots of different people. That was the jukebox. They'd have a bunch of different records from different bands from different genres, and you could play different songs from different people. But mom being a broken jukebox, she only got a couple songs they constantly replay. Those are the only ones she has. We would like it if she had a much more variety. But McDonald's also only has a narrow target market. You know what? McDonald's is not serving food for vegans. That's not like their target audience. They don't cater, you know, to the non dairy, non GMO vegan people. Right. They're not catering to that. Whole Foods more so. Right. Different target audience.
[19:18] B: Is that burgers? Beef?
[19:20] A: McDonald's? Yeah.
[19:21] B: Or are they soy?
[19:23] A: Oh, McDonald's burgers are beef. Although I'm not sure what kind of beef it is.
[19:27] B: Okay.
[19:27] A: McDonald's had been known at one time to take, you know, the anus of the animal as well.
[19:32] B: Oh, God.
[19:33] A: They were as burgers. Yeah.
[19:37] B: He's like, shit, I love McDonald's.
[19:42] A: Right. See, that's the whole thing. If you go to McDonald's and you've been to McDonald's and you continue to eat it, then you will really love McDonald's because they also do that. Oh, right. They put something in it, make it so that you. Yeah, well. Or have those things that your body then starts to crave and want. Really? Sure. But that's how it works for anything. You date 21 days and you eat broccoli for 21 straight days, your taste buds change and you're gonna start liking broccoli.
[20:10] B: Well, anything you do for 21 days becomes a habit.
[20:13] A: Anything and everything.
[20:15] B: That's what I heard.
[20:18] A: Of fat I think. Yeah. I mean, it could be 21, 28. Sometimes it's a one time learning. Like, I didn't have to 28 times. Touch the hot stove to go. I'm not touching that again. Or I certainly don't want to. So check. What are you noticing now?
[20:41] B: I'm in a better mood.
[20:42] A: You are in a better mood, aren't you? Huh? Yeah. I mean, you are, right? So, you know, try to get into that bad mood by thinking about whatever you need to think about. Like, try. I mean, it would be useful to try to get there. You know, like, woke up and I was like. Right. Like, try to get there.
[21:00] B: I can get there.
[21:01] A: Oh, you can?
[21:02] B: If I want to.
[21:03] A: We'll try. I want to see.
[21:05] B: I'm not. I can't. I can't really, because you're funny. So.
[21:10] A: No, try to get there. Like, you know. You know, you think about, like, waking up.
[21:13] B: I'm not mad anymore.
[21:14] A: Oh, you know, mom all about that crap. I mean, you live with a house of women, right? That's not crazy. It's crazy. It is crazy, right? Yeah. And some of them might like, oh.
[21:31] B: My God, they did that today. One of them did that to me today.
[21:35] A: I think that is, by the way, for you now.
[21:37] B: Yeah.
[21:38] A: Yeah. Right.
[21:40] B: I don't do this as much anymore either.
[21:42] A: Right? Yeah. Huh. Isn't that cool?
[21:45] B: Mm.
[21:46] A: Yeah. That's a lot different than it was.
[21:48] B: I don't get so offended anymore.
[21:50] A: Oh, right.
[21:51] B: I'm trying not to let things. Try not to personalize things. It's still a struggle.
[21:56] A: Oh, how do you know when to struggle? What do they need to say? How do they need to say it for you to take it personally?
[22:06] B: Any kind of. Any way that I feel, like, judged or like, okay, like, if I feel like somebody is saying that I did something wrong, not like, oh, you did that wrong, but, you know, trying to, like, correct me. I don't.
[22:22] A: And when you think about them crying, trying to correct you and you hear them saying it, where are they, you know, representation to you?
[22:30] B: What do you mean?
[22:30] A: Close to you? Are you at eye level with them? Are they above you?
[22:34] B: No.
[22:35] A: As you think about them that way, is it at all? Well, check it out. Looking at them eye to eye, can you take it personally? Oh, Ashley. This is how you do that. Can you believe that? Ashley did it pop? Why? Oh, my. She needs to do it this way, right? Well, check. What are you noticing? I don't know. Well, are you getting that discomfort? Mm. Mm. Oh, you're not. But you just Said that you hate it, but you weren't feeling that way.
[23:09] B: I know. Because I'm learning to deal with it.
[23:12] A: Oh, you're realizing it's not about you.
[23:15] B: Yes.
[23:15] A: Oh. Huh.
[23:16] B: Yes, I am.
[23:17] A: So notice how it's not coming in here and it's being read more here.
[23:23] B: See, I'm growing.
[23:27] A: You sure are growing. Yeah, well, you got a lot of freedom.
[23:33] B: Yeah.
[23:33] A: Because you're like, more okay with you. The internal dialogue that was negative and critical. The volume has turned way down.
[23:42] B: It really has.
[23:43] A: The frequency has greatly, you know, decreased. So you have a lot more space. Right. You're actually looking in the mirror going, gosh, why do I like you?
[23:56] B: Yeah. I don't hate you. You look very good today.
[24:01] A: Wow. I wouldn't want to actually say something good. Yeah, Right. Because you're actually feeling good about you. And then you're following all of the good feelings. Feelings up with making really positive, powerful changes. Right. Becoming more and more of who you really are. Yeah. Which is so much more than just that stuff. Right. Cool. Yeah.
[24:34] B: I'm really glad I came to see you today. I feel so much better. Oh, my God. I was in such a bad mood and I could not get out of it.
[24:43] A: Yeah.
[24:43] B: Everything people were doing was making me mad. I'm like, why are you looking at me?
[24:46] A: Stop breathing. Yeah.
[24:48] B: Why are you breathing for?
[24:49] A: But you also realized that you weren't really mad at them. You were just in a shitty mood. And you were in a shitty mood based on having bad feelings brought up from remembering stuff that happened. Huh. But now when you think about the stuff that happened, you know, even what stepdad did, mom, how mom was pissed, why do you die? All that stuff, what do you notice then? Right? Because that. Then you. When went to grandma's house, was like, yeah, Mom.
[25:22] B: Yeah.
[25:23] A: And you went off and said, I'm gonna do whatever. If that's how they're thinking of me, then I'll show you. Oh, you want to know what it's like to be? I'll show you what it's like. Like, Right? That kind of thing. I love it when people tell me that stuff. I remember this woman who had a problem with drinking, and she had decided going to a party at my mom's house. I'm not drinking today. She gets to mom's house. She's helping mom set up. Mom comes over here. Sweetie, I really hope you don't drink today. Now have friends coming over. Oh, really? You hope I don't drink today?
[25:53] B: Okay.
[25:54] A: Yeah. Okay. Where's the liquor? Right I mean, just like. And she thought that she was exercising her own free will. Don't you tell me what to do, Mom. Yeah, except she had no freedom there at all.
[26:10] B: Right.
[26:11] A: Because she couldn't not, not drink.
[26:15] B: She had to.
[26:16] A: Right? Huh? Because the freedom would have been in her going, oh, okay, sure. I wasn't going to anyway. I'm good.
[26:28] B: I can see where she would act like that, though.
[26:30] A: Yeah, right, right. And see, that's what had been going on. But that's not happening now for you. Right? Right. Because you've got more freedom. Right. That's what was going on back then at that early child brain that wasn't fully developed. Right. I have a buddy that works in drug treatment and he does a talk and he calls that time of life the young and stupid years. Because we do really dumb stuff. So it's the young and stupid years. Right? Yeah. And that's that you just didn't know. Right. Because if she had known what you know right now. Right. With the wisdom that you have here, if you had had all of that knowledge from what it was, what you went through, what it led to, all that other kind of stuff, if you had known all of that back then, what you have clear now, would that you have done what she did when she moved in at Grandma's.
[27:38] B: Some things I wouldn't do. Some things.
[27:44] A: Right. Well, you wouldn't do that, meaning all of the things that led you to where and what you got hooked into in that circle that you were in. Well, I mean, would you have. I mean, check. Think about some of the things that you did, Some of it, some of the chapters, some of the drug stuff.
[28:02] B: But some of the stuff I wouldn't have done.
[28:05] A: What did you need to do?
[28:08] B: Well, you know, I feel like I don't like having regrets, so I don't like to say, oh, I wish I.
[28:17] A: Wouldn'T have done this. Oh, no, it's not wishing that you wouldn't have done it.
[28:23] B: Yes, there's some things that I wouldn't have done.
[28:28] A: It's more that the context in how you were doing what you did was based on glitches and errors in your brain in the first place. So if the glitches and errors weren't there, if you had all the wisdom that you have now, you would have steered your course differently.
[28:48] B: Definitely.
[28:49] A: That's the whole thing. And I check that, because if somebody does have regrets, it's only because they can continue of having not done what they did and their brain trying to get them to do it.
[29:10] B: So I should have regrets?
[29:11] A: No, I'm not thinking. But the only time that somebody does is when they think that they shouldn't have done what they did or that they could have not done what they did. And so their brain will try to get them to stop doing it. You're saying, right, like, if I can conceive of having not shot up heroin, and I've got a lot of guilt over having shot up heroin, the guilt isn't there because I shot up heroin.
[29:33] B: Right.
[29:33] A: The guilt is there because I here can conceive of having not done it.
[29:39] B: Right.
[29:39] A: And if I didn't do it, that would be better. So my brain goes, well, shit, if not doing it would be better, then stop doing it quick.
[29:47] B: I'm not doing it.
[29:48] A: Right. Right. So the timing gets out of whack. That's why we want you to be, like, at peace with all of the stuff that you went through. Because it's best to be realizing that it couldn't have not happened. Even if some of what happened, we don't like it that it did. All of that stuff went down the only way it could have then. Now, though, you get to be all sorts of different ways. You get to be more of who you are. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So what else is going on? How else has it been at Selah? Do you still do horses?
[30:28] B: We're on a break right now.
[30:30] A: You're on a break from horses because it's too hot?
[30:32] B: I guess so.
[30:33] A: I think it is. If I was a horse, I'm not going. Oh, yeah, great. Let me go stand outside.
[30:38] B: Yeah.
[30:38] A: Want to be in the barn?
[30:40] B: Yeah.
[30:40] A: And hopefully it feels like. Yeah. Because it's hot.
[30:45] B: Yeah.
[30:46] A: It stinks.
[30:46] B: Oh, my God.
[30:47] A: The horses smell. Right? Because they're horses everywhere. Well, I mean, what do you want?
[30:53] B: We have to shovel it.
[30:55] A: Oh, you have to be a shit shoveler. Yes. That's fun. That's why I don't go to the horse things.
[31:01] B: Me neither. I don't go because they make me.
[31:03] A: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. How. What else. What else has been going on for you? There's.
[31:09] B: Oh, nothing. Just getting back with my kids, like, talking to my kids.
[31:16] A: Where are they?
[31:17] B: They're in Jacksonville.
[31:18] A: They're in Jacksonville. Okay.
[31:20] B: That's where I'm from. That's where my family is. So that's really it. I mean, nothing really going on. Just trying to, like, get through this shit.
[31:27] A: What was it that you leveled up? What does that then now let you do that you weren't able to do before?
[31:34] B: Well, it wasn't that I wasn't able to. I just chose not to. I just put drugs and street life above my family.
[31:43] A: Oh, no, no, no, no. What does leveling up in the program.
[31:46] B: Oh, I'm sorry. I misunderstood the question the first time. I don't understand. Start over.
[31:54] A: So what does. You said that I recently leveled up.
[31:57] B: Oh, I phased up.
[31:59] A: Phased up. Right. What kind of additional privileges do you get when that happens?
[32:04] B: Oh, I don't have to speak, talk on speakerphone anymore. On the phone.
[32:07] A: Okay.
[32:09] B: When we go to the grocery store, I can go off by myself. I don't have to have a coach, like, up my ass everywhere I go.
[32:15] A: Nice. Okay.
[32:18] B: That's about it.
[32:19] A: Okay, so more privileges. Independence.
[32:23] B: Yes.
[32:24] A: A little more space, Right? Yeah.
[32:28] B: Breathing room.
[32:29] A: Right. But also still done in a way that provides support around you. Any for you. Problematic thoughts, urges, cravings to use.
[32:44] B: Things remind me of things. I might see something and think of drugs, you know, But I don't know. I don't really get, like, cravings like that, you know? It's weird.
[32:59] A: What was the drug of choice?
[33:01] B: Well, for years it was heroin, and then it was crack, and then I didn't really care about heroin anymore.
[33:07] A: Okay, so it ended.
[33:10] B: Yeah.
[33:11] A: Right. Isn't that interesting? But, like, what are the things that now, like, will remind you of?
[33:19] B: Songs? Yeah, just like, songs. Songs will come on and I'll think of, like, the time that I was, like, having fun in the street. Well, that I thought I was having fun. I thought I was enjoying myself. Really? It's kind of fucked up, you know?
[33:39] A: But at the time, what was it that you were enjoying?
[33:42] B: I don't really know. I just. I've always been like a party girl, you know, I just like.
[33:50] A: So you're out on the street and you had done something and you're enjoying.
[33:57] B: Sounds really bad when I talk about it.
[34:00] A: Well, does it kind of. What's bad about it?
[34:03] B: I don't know. Because it's nothing. I don't know.
[34:07] A: I don't know. Well, as you think about that experience. Experience Right now, is it enjoyable?
[34:15] B: No, I just. I miss people sometimes.
[34:18] A: Oh. Some of the connections. And that's what you mean by, like, going out? Like you liked interacting.
[34:24] B: Yes.
[34:25] A: And being around and being with people. Well, good thing you're in a house filled with people.
[34:32] B: Yes. Not the same kind of people, though.
[34:35] A: Oh, they're not they. Same people, really.
[34:38] B: I don't like.
[34:39] A: They act differently.
[34:40] B: Yes.
[34:41] A: How so?
[34:42] B: They're female.
[34:44] A: Oh, it was just male.
[34:46] B: I have a lot of male friends.
[34:47] A: You Do?
[34:48] B: Well, they aren't really my friends anymore.
[34:52] A: They are guys.
[34:52] B: I have a hard time trusting females.
[34:54] A: Oh, how come?
[34:57] B: Just never had a very good track record with them.
[35:00] A: Huh?
[35:01] B: I just don't trust them.
[35:03] A: But better to trust guys because you had a really good track record with them too.
[35:08] B: I know. I don't really trust you either.
[35:10] A: That's such a good thing. You go, I haven't really had a good track record. Oh, so guys, is that a better track record?
[35:17] B: No.
[35:18] A: So you don't trust. Right. Isn't that a good idea? No. Oh, it isn't. It's not a good idea to not trust.
[35:26] B: It's a good idea to not trust.
[35:28] A: It is a really good idea to not trust.
[35:29] B: I feel like that.
[35:30] A: Do you think you should trust? I think, I mean, you know. Should I trust the hygienist? Yes, I should trust her.
[35:42] B: I mean, I don't know.
[35:43] A: I mean, I hope she's gonna do a good job.
[35:45] B: Yes.
[35:46] A: But if all of a sudden she starts jabbing in my jaw. Oh no, no, I trust what she's doing. She knows better than me. Or I want to like let her know. Right. Yeah. Well, I don't think trust is a good idea.
[35:59] B: Me neither.
[36:00] A: Yeah. Do you know why?
[36:01] B: No.
[36:02] A: Well, because we live in a crooked world, right? So here's the deal, people. When you and that other person have the same best interest in mind, you really feel like you're on the same page and together. Right. But as soon as your interest and their interest differs, they'll have their best interest in mind. You're not on the same team anymore. I get women frequently who are in the process of getting divorced and they always had it that their husband was always on their side, but now they're divorcing and they don't understand why he's like, you know, not like taking care of them anymore. Right. Because the interest is different. Right. So if I'm at a red light, I don't trust that nobody's going to be running the red. When my light turns green, I look, check the intersection. Oh, no cars. I go, right? I don't go, okay, three, two, one, done. Right. No, I don't do that. Right. Same thing with fire detectors. I have them. I don't pay a lot of attention to them. I notice them at 2 o'clock in the morning when they chirp and I go, shit, I gotta change that.
[37:12] B: So you trust that they'll let you know if a fire's going off?
[37:15] A: Why, isn't that their job?
[37:16] B: Yes.
[37:17] A: To let me know, Right. I don't trust. But it's their job. That's their purpose. But see, I don't have a fire detector in my house because I think my house will catch on fire. And I don't have it because I know it won't. I have it there just in case it does, and its job is to notify me sooner than later. Make sense? So then the other part goes to, like, trust. I don't trust my wife if she's doing something that's very unusual. Oh, yeah. No, I'm sure it's nothing. Kevin Costner in the movie Dances With Wolves. People go, oh, the wolf pack. They trusted him because he was able to join their pack, but they didn't trust him. They watched him. They watched him demonstrate the same kind of behavior over and over and over again, which allowed them to let him get closer. Because he continued to demonstrate the same behavior. It became familiar. But don't think for a moment if his behavior drastically changed that they wouldn't all attack and kill him and not one of them would have felt betrayed. Right. So trust. You don't have to have it. You just really want your eyes open and your ears tuned. You want to pay attention. You want to be in what we did the last time. More expanded awareness. Because part of why everything was close is that it was tunneled. We're going to be more nervous and anxious when all I can do is look at life through this because I have to move it a lot to see everything versus when I'm out here. I can see a lot more, right? Yeah. So just check. How's your body feeling now? It is so lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, and breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. Just like that. And then notice, Ashley, all the space that moves out towards the sides of the room. Notice the space in between you and me. Space all around me, all around you, up above, below, behind all that space. And then just kind of pay attention and make a connection to the space so that you see more. More space. Realizing that space isn't just what separates, but it is also what connects and how much more space and room there is when you're noticing it. And as you check with that, how does your body feel now? So you're moving in the right direction. What's the next?
[40:16] B: I have nine more weeks of this phase, and then I'll go up to another one and I can work then.
[40:24] A: You can work. Right. And that'll Be great. Yeah.
[40:30] B: Cause I'll get out the house.
[40:31] A: Right.
[40:32] B: And save money.
[40:34] A: And save money. Right. Which is always a good thing. Mm. Yeah. What do you want to do for work? Do you know?
[40:45] B: Well, I want to get my. I don't know exactly what I want to do. I want to get my certificate. Tell people.
[40:54] A: I don't know. Okay.
[40:56] B: Maybe like, I don't want to work with people. I don't know what kind yet.
[41:02] A: The people kind.
[41:03] B: The people kind.
[41:04] A: Right.
[41:05] B: Fucked up people.
[41:07] A: Who is it exactly? Right. I mean, we all are. You can't get born and not be.
[41:13] B: Right.
[41:13] A: Right. It's true.
[41:16] B: It is true.
[41:17] A: Right. Some are just more than others.
[41:19] B: Yeah.
[41:19] A: Some in different ways than others.
[41:20] B: Right.
[41:21] A: But we all are. If somebody tells you they're not, they're lying. They're even more. Right. Exactly. Stay away from those people because they're really. Woo. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So. So you also have like a powerful symbol. I believe it's a leopard. Yeah. Right. And when he notices you, just think about the leopard now.
[41:44] B: It just makes me happy just thinking about it.
[41:46] A: That's right. And so anytime you start feeling like in a crappy state, you can just think of the leopard, lower your jaw and breathe in a way that's a little slower and deeper. Expand your awareness, think of the leopard and it's going to begin to put you in an awareness state. And all we did was just do some rewiring because you came in with the problem already lit. Then we began to get you out of the problem by, you know, reassociating you to other things that you've noticed that are different and way better than they were and even ones that you had forgotten how bad they were because it's so much better now. Right. And then what we did was unplug stuff that had to do with mom and rewire how your brain thinks and then has you feel about that because now you're remembering and it's not causing you to feel bad about you. It adds another layer of you being outwardly focused so that things that people say are being read as info and they're not being taken to heart. Right. So that you've got that much more ease. And then you see where you're headed, knowing that you're taking the steps to get there and feeling really good about all the progress you're making. Because even if there's more to go, you can look back now to how it was and notice how different it is from that. Yeah. Cool. All right. Any other things left for you for today?
[43:13] B: No, I'm feeling much better now.
[43:14] A: You aren't. All right, well, then we'll stop with that. You can head on out and.
