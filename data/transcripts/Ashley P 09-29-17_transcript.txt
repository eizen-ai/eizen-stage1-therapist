[00:01] A: So today is the 29th of September. We've got one more day of my.
[00:05] B: Birthday month, and then it's over.
[00:08] A: Yes, but it's a whole month now.
[00:10] B: Yeah.
[00:11] A: As I got older, it's not just a day, it's a whole month.
[00:13] B: Gotta have the most fun.
[00:14] A: Yeah. Right. So actually, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. Steve's here observing, you know, all of that. Want to make sure all of that's okay with you. Our recording may be made available. In teaching and training people how to do what we do, I feel like.
[00:26] B: What are you doing when you do this? Are you just talking or is that like.
[00:29] A: I probably talk with my hands a lot, but sometimes I do things on purpose.
[00:33] B: I know, but that's not one of them. I didn't know if it was like a calming.
[00:38] A: Did it calm you? There might be an intention behind it, but not necessarily on purpose. Right. Because you're unconscious. Well, there. So the intention when I work with people is to do stuff that's transformative. So given that that's an intention, there may be things that my unconscious does that may cause certain things for people that I'm not necessarily consciously aware of. If I were to think about it after the fact, I could go, oh, yeah, yeah. But it's out of the intention. So who knows? There are other things that I'm doing intentionally.
[01:11] B: I know.
[01:13] A: And some of them you notice, and some of them you're not noticing at all.
[01:16] B: Right. I'm sure that's really cool. I'm sure.
[01:19] A: So how did our last session leave you? And what do you want our clients to do today?
[01:23] B: Much better.
[01:24] A: Oh, yay.
[01:25] B: I developed a Russian accent. So if I start talking crazy.
[01:28] A: You've developed a Russian accent?
[01:29] B: Yes.
[01:30] A: Well, that's great. That's good, because I think pretty soon we're gonna have dual citizenship with Russia. Yes.
[01:36] B: Why? Because they're gonna take over.
[01:38] A: Well, I mean, haven't they already helped get, you know, the election happening?
[01:41] B: Oh, yeah, I've heard about that.
[01:45] A: I tell people all the time, it's like, yeah, great. We're dual citizenship. It's awesome.
[01:49] B: Yeah.
[01:50] A: Hey, comrade. How are you?
[01:51] B: How you doing? I'm fine. How are you? Okay. So, like, I. Every time I come here, I'm like. You're like, what's going on? And I'm like, I don't know. But I. All through the month, I'm like, oh, I need to see dream. Oh, I need to see dream. And then whenever you ask me how I'm doing, I'm like, you know, So I took the liberty of writing down things that I really need to discuss with you.
[02:13] A: Okay, good. That's. Good idea.
[02:17] B: Okay, you want me to read them to you?
[02:20] A: I want you to tell me whether you read them to me or not. You can just let me know what we want to get done.
[02:24] B: Okay. I have a strong need to control.
[02:27] A: How do you know?
[02:29] B: I do well. Okay. This is how I know. When one of the counselors comes and does my temperament. Pillows. Can I hold this?
[02:40] A: Yeah.
[02:42] B: When she comes and does my temperament, she showed me like three panels. I'm a little bit melancholy. And then this is like how big the scale is. I'm like, all the way to the end of control. And then my need to be controlled is like one little square. And I do like. I do a lot of things, like with my face when people are saying something I don't like. I'm like, you know? And she's like, yeah, that's you trying to control them and tell them you don't like what they're doing. And I do notice that, like, I get mad when people do things, stupid things. Like, it gets on my nerves whenever we go somewhere. Every morning we go somewhere to take the kids to school. And then people change and get in the front seat and I'm in the back. Like, fucking. What is going on? Like, why are you doing that? If the person's about to get dropped off, why are they sitting in the front seat? They need whoever is going to just stay riding in my head. It makes sense. See how I'm getting aggravated about it? It really bothers me. And I don't know why. Because they're not doing anything to me. I don't ride in the front seat because I like to have my headphones in. And I don't like people to talk to me. Just leave me alone. Let me do me. I need my own time sometimes. And I'm probably sounding really crazy right now, but it's bothers me when like five different people switch to the front seat. Doesn't make sense to me. If you're the first person to get dropped off, why are you in the front seat? That doesn't make sense. You should be right in the back so that nobody has to move. The person who's gonna stay in the van should be in the front seat, in my opinion.
[04:11] A: Okay.
[04:13] B: Yeah. Okay. So there's that. And I personalize things.
[04:16] A: So you think that because this scale said that you were here and here.
[04:21] B: What does that mean? Oh, yeah, the scale Scale.
[04:26] A: Right. That's the reason that we know.
[04:28] B: Well, she's. She's.
[04:31] A: Could it be that you're particular? Could it be that you kind of have a way of common sense so that if things don't make sense.
[04:39] B: Yes. It bothers.
[04:40] A: Then you're like, how come we're doing it this way? So you might actually be more of a question, like, you're okay doing it if it makes sense to you.
[04:49] B: Right.
[04:50] A: But not quite okay doing it if it doesn't.
[04:52] B: Yes.
[04:53] A: Which may not have anything to do with control.
[04:55] B: Okay, that sounds good.
[04:59] A: I mean, it might not have anything to do with controlling.
[05:02] B: Yeah, well, that's why I don't like this, Lisa. But anyways, okay. My main thing is, like, my abandonment issue from my mom. I have abandonment issues. Well, we've. We've talked about that. That could be the root and, like, feeling, like, not good enough for people, like, I get jealous over things.
[05:25] A: Okay, so. Well, okay, what do you mean by that?
[05:32] B: Which part?
[05:34] A: Well, first of all, I don't know whether there is an actual route. I've kind of been thinking more about that, really. Like, in the world of worlds that we think that our system is set up like a tree, meaning that there's one main root, and if you chop that root, the whole tree's over. So in therapy, the idea is, let's get to the root of the problem. But what if we don't have a root? Do you know what a rhizome is? Have you ever heard of plants that are rhizomes? So they would be things like strawberries, mushrooms, things like ginger, turmeric that grow above. They don't grow above, but they grow. And you can chop off a part of it and it'll grow back and plant it over there and it'll start growing. So there's not a one root system, because with a tree, there's literally the main root, and if you chop that main root, the tree's dead. That's why when this hurricane came and trees were ripped out of the ground, we couldn't just put them back.
[06:38] B: Right.
[06:38] A: Because with that root ripped out, the tree's dead. So we've had to now chop them up, and we've all got all sorts of piles of branches and a lot of paper. Now we'll have a lot of paper.
[06:50] B: Thanks, Irma.
[06:52] A: Right, Exactly. I've now learned that hurricanes are actually Florida's way of pruning. Mother Nature's way of pruning. You know, like how palm trees, they kind of nowadays, like, chop Them so that they're not so much full of dead branches, so to speak. Well, when a hurricane comes, it knocks all that stuff down. What we forgot to tell Mother Nature is that we now have people that actually trim them. So we don't need the hurricanes anymore.
[07:20] B: Right.
[07:21] A: To do it. Yeah, because it was a really nice thing that the hurricane would do. Just, you know.
[07:25] B: And some people can't swim, you know, so they drowned. You don't like that either.
[07:32] A: Okay, so. So. Okay, so abandonment, meaning what? You get jealous. Of what? How do you know when to be jealous?
[07:41] B: Okay, like, I hate the way this sounds because it sounds. So let's say me and you, okay? And we're talking and we're getting along great, and we do this every day, right? So I start kind of feeling like. Like you're mine. And I don't want you to talk to other people. I mean, talk to them. But, like, I like loyalty, you know? Like, I want to be the only one that, like, really, like, we have inside jokes. And you understand me and I understand you. And then if I feel like you're pulling away from me and now I see doing it with somebody else, I'm like, the fuck. And then, like, I just. I don't trust you anymore at all. And so I just don't even talk to you. I just cut you off.
[08:34] A: Okay, so you're feeling then at times that them interacting with others means something about you or their connection with you.
[08:44] B: Right.
[08:44] A: Oh, so that would be better. By the way, could you be connected to more than one? Or is it only one that you get to be connected with that you really like it to have, like, bff. Only one bff.
[08:55] B: I can have many.
[08:57] A: Oh, you can have many, yes.
[08:59] B: But you cannot.
[09:02] A: So awesome.
[09:05] B: And, like, I. I love joking about it, but, like, I really get these feelings. Like, I.
[09:10] A: Where do you get them? Like, the feelings, where are they when you have them?
[09:14] B: I get knots in my stomach.
[09:16] A: Oh, you get knots? What if the knot was not there?
[09:19] B: I wish it wasn't.
[09:20] A: Oh, can you get it now? Is it there now? I mean, what if I started talking to Steven, not you anymore?
[09:25] B: No, no. It's not like a surface relationship. It's like a deep relationship. You know, like somebody that I really. I don't want to say trust somebody that.
[09:42] A: You really, like, shared, like, personal stuff.
[09:44] B: Yes.
[09:45] A: We haven't done that.
[09:47] B: No, we have. But I don't hang out with you, like, every day and get like.
[09:50] A: But if we hung out every day and then I started talking to Steve.
[09:53] B: It Would be like, well, not talking. But, I mean, if I felt like you were talking to him more than me.
[09:58] A: Oh, okay.
[10:00] B: Or like they were, like, saying, so.
[10:03] A: If that's the case and that goes on for you, how do you actually want to be? Like, if that wasn't going on, if that was no longer an issue for you, how would you actually be dying? Party?
[10:16] B: I don't understand the question.
[10:18] A: If you weren't having that jealousy, if you weren't feeling that them pulling away meant that they didn't want to be connected with you anymore, that wasn't running you, how would you actually be?
[10:28] B: I guess I would not be pissed off at people.
[10:31] A: I'm like, well, if you weren't pissed off, how would you be?
[10:34] B: Happy.
[10:34] A: Oh, happy.
[10:35] B: Yes.
[10:36] A: What's it like when you feel happy?
[10:39] B: I don't care about anything.
[10:41] A: You don't care about anything. Right? Yeah. And how does your body feel when you're happy and you're not really caring about anything?
[10:46] B: Relaxed.
[10:47] A: Oh, it's relaxed. Right. And as your body's feeling more relaxed and you're not caring about anything and you're happy, think about them talking to somebody else. What do you notice?
[10:56] B: I wouldn't care.
[10:56] A: Oh, you're not caring. Isn't that weird? Yeah. So check.
[11:01] B: Now I'm relaxed.
[11:03] A: I know. And try to get, you know, think about somebody that, you know, that you were really, like, sharing deep stuff with, and now they're, like, seemingly talking to somebody else more than you. And what's happening?
[11:15] B: I'm getting a little bothered.
[11:17] A: Oh, right. And we know that that's the problem. Right. But we know that the solution is you happy.
[11:22] B: Yes.
[11:23] A: And, like, you don't even care. Right. And that your body's relaxed. And what's it like when your body's relaxed and you're not caring and you're happy? What's that like for you?
[11:32] B: It's unknown territory.
[11:34] A: Oh, it is. You've never.
[11:36] B: I can't think of anything else to say.
[11:39] A: Right. But how's your body feeling now? It is. And think about them talking to somebody else. And what are you noticing? Got a little bit of that discomfort.
[11:50] B: A little bit.
[11:50] A: You do. Right. Now close your eyes and take that discomfort back, because that feeling is going to take you back towards another, earlier, other experience that may not have anything to do with them. Right. Then as it travels back, a particular moment will be brought to your attention. Now, what comes to mind?
[12:18] B: How I was acting.
[12:20] A: You got a time.
[12:22] B: I'm sorry?
[12:22] A: You've got a particular time that you had that feeling that has nothing to do with the thing that you just thought about.
[12:29] B: I'm thinking of a time that I got jealous.
[12:32] A: Yeah.
[12:33] B: Okay.
[12:33] A: Right. And that was how long ago?
[12:36] B: About two weeks.
[12:38] A: Oh, good. And you got that feeling, but that feeling is not new.
[12:42] B: No.
[12:42] A: Right. So now travel that feeling back to a different context, to a different time that you had that kind of feeling. And maybe a time when you were younger.
[12:52] B: Yes.
[12:53] A: Right. And you got that moment now. Good. And you can open your eyes. That one happened when?
[12:57] B: When I was a kid.
[12:58] A: Oh, good. And you were how old?
[13:01] B: It was an ongoing thing.
[13:03] A: Right. And we want to think of one time that it. Okay, Right. And you got it. You're how old? Where were you and what happened?
[13:15] B: 14.
[13:16] A: Right. So you're 14. You're where?
[13:17] B: @ my grandma's.
[13:18] A: Grandma's. Right. And like, it's daytime or nighttime?
[13:21] B: Daytime.
[13:21] A: And you're in the house?
[13:23] B: I was up. I was outside in front of the garage.
[13:25] A: So you're outside in front of the garage.
[13:26] B: Good.
[13:26] A: And then what happened next?
[13:28] B: My parents walked in.
[13:29] A: Right. Good. And then what happened?
[13:30] B: And they were, like, you know, mad at me because I told and. But I lied. And I had to stay at my grandma's, and my brother and sister had to go home and.
[13:44] A: Right. Good. So you lied about what?
[13:48] B: Molestation.
[13:50] A: Oh.
[13:50] B: You had said, dad molesting me.
[13:52] A: That he did, but he actually didn't.
[13:53] B: No.
[13:54] A: Huh.
[13:54] B: He said he did, but he said he didn't.
[13:57] A: Oh. Oh, got it. So actually, he did it. You told, and then they said, no, he didn't do it. You lied.
[14:03] B: Right.
[14:03] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[14:05] B: So my brother and sister got to go home and just, you know, so.
[14:09] A: They went home and you stayed at Grandma's. Right. Good. Then what happened next? Well, that time was over. They left. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun than that moment, you know, anytime from then until yesterday. Right, right. And what's that? Well, getting this tattoo was more fun than that, wasn't it? Yeah, that's right. So we got this tattoo.
[14:32] B: Yeah.
[14:33] A: And then before that, they left, and then, you know, they were upset, and he was upset because he said that you lied and then you had told. Right, Right. And then before that, you were at your grandma's, and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Right, Right. And as we run through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[14:51] B: How was it?
[14:52] A: Yeah, emotionally, as I went backwards, it wasn't bad, was it? You can remember that happening and then being that way and him acting like that. And mom, you know, believing him. Right. You can remember putting on your pants. Well, stop putting on your pants. Well, then stop him from acting like that.
[15:07] B: He's not acting.
[15:08] A: Well, then you stop putting on your shirt. I'm not putting on it. Well, stop mom from doing that.
[15:11] B: She's not doing that.
[15:12] A: Well, then where is it? Saint no longer exists.
[15:14] B: It no longer exists.
[15:15] A: Third piece. Right. Did that and him being that way have to do with you? Oh, see, this is where it's stuck so good. You think it does have to do with you.
[15:27] B: Right.
[15:28] A: Right. So the kid comes home and he has Ds on his report card. And his mom's like, you wait until your father comes home. Right. Kids like, worried. Dad comes home, dad takes out the belt, beats the living tar out of the kid. Now the kid thinks that dad beating me has to do with my poor grades. However, let's check. Isn't there about a billion different ways dad could have responded?
[15:52] B: Yes.
[15:52] A: To that situation, other than beating him with the belt? I mean, that's one out of a whole slew of different things dad could have done. So Dad's response, did it have to do with the kid, or did it have to do with what was going on with Dad?
[16:08] B: I mean, it had to go. It was the dad.
[16:11] A: It did have to do with the dad, didn't it? Right. It didn't have to do with the kid.
[16:15] B: Right.
[16:15] A: Cause dad could have responded a bunch of different ways.
[16:19] B: Yeah, he could have grounded him.
[16:21] A: He could have grounded him. Or he could have just, like, talked to him and like, hey, what's going on in the school? What do we need to do to support you better? I mean, there could have been a billion different things that dad could have done. Right?
[16:30] B: I know. I guess I am stuck on that.
[16:31] A: Because that's the kind of shit that.
[16:32] B: Happened to me when I got back there. Cause I got my ass beat.
[16:35] A: I just bought it. Right. But see, where we got stuck is when we're really little, we're trained to believe that I am make everybody else feel. And if it's bad, it's my fault. So it was my fault, and I made them feel that way. Therefore, I am responsible for what they did to me. It's my fault.
[16:57] B: Yes.
[16:57] A: But they could have done and handled it multiples of different ways. It's an interesting thing, right? The guy drives down the road and cuts in front of this guy. This guy pulls up next to him, pulls. Pulls his car out, gets out of the car and starts punching his car Window. What the fuck, man? Now. Yes. Did it have to do with the guy cutting in front of him? Yeah, but the guy getting out of the car had to do with what the hell was going on with that guy. Yeah, he was not the guy cutting in front of him. Because again, there's a billion different ways that guy in the car who got out and punched could have been like, oh my goodness, this guy's got some sick kid in the back. And that's why he cut. He could have handled it a billion different ways, but because of what was going on with him, he reacted the way he did. So back then when you were young, you thought that, that and mom being that way had something to do with you.
[17:52] B: Yes.
[17:53] A: And you telling and him saying that you lied and in. Did it have anything to do with you? Meaning on the flip side of it, would it have mattered whether it was you or anybody else? See, if your mom didn't have you and she had another girl your age who had had that experience that said the same thing that you said, isn't that how that mom would have handled it?
[18:15] B: Yes.
[18:16] A: Right. It wasn't like it had something to do with you. It wasn't. Oh, it was Ashley.
[18:19] B: Right.
[18:19] A: But if it was like, you know, Margaret, we would have totally believed her and not believed him. No, because of whatever was going on with that mom.
[18:27] B: Oh, you know, that's what I was trying to say. I was agreeing.
[18:30] A: Right, we know, but with whatever was going on with that mom. Right, right, because we know. And this is what we talked about the last time your mom and I don't know, how about now? But certainly back then she wasn't somebody who was mentally, emotionally. Well, right, yeah, because kids typically, you know, go, hey, you know what, I just wanted to let you know that stepdad was, you know, molesting me. It's a lie. Haha, I know, right? No, kids don't really do that. I remember this girl that I worked with the other day. Gosh, this was maybe last month when I was at First Step. This girl, like literally she's 15 and she tells her mom, by the way, stepdad's been molesting me and he got me pregnant. You know what her mom's reaction was? You.
[19:17] B: Oh my God, she's sleeping with my hand.
[19:21] A: Right. It's your fault.
[19:22] B: Oh my God.
[19:23] A: Okay, you're right. Because you know, 15 year old girls are totally into, you know, their mom's husband.
[19:30] B: Yeah.
[19:31] A: What? I mean, it's just like mind blowing worse when she goes to have the baby and mom's like all excited. I'm gonna have that baby and I'll hold that baby and I'll take care of that baby. And the baby's a stillborn baby. Horrible, right? Do you know what the mom does? She punches her in the face.
[19:49] B: Are you fucking serious right now? I am. In front of the people in the hospital?
[19:54] A: Yes.
[19:55] B: What did they do?
[19:56] A: Well, his mom got taken away and out but like, literally punched her in the face. Because I wanted that baby. Whoa. So now we're thinking, no wonder why this gal got hooked into using with fucked up shit like that that was going on in the world. Right? So, so good news. We're getting that lifted and cleared so that she gets to be reprogrammed, which is what's happening inside. Because you're getting that your mom being that way and him saying that had nothing to do with you and your brother or sister going had nothing to do with that there was something wrong with you. And it was really about getting you away from him, which was better than being there and him continuing to do that. Don't you think? Yeah, Right. Even if when you got to your grandma's, you went like, you know, wild. Right. That's okay. But still better than like staying there and just like having that happen with him.
[20:54] B: That's true.
[20:55] A: Right. I need to rethink about. I mean, come and do me a favor. Right, exactly. If we're really looking at it from like. Yes, no, we got that what you did afterwards wasn't. But if we look at it from the outside perspective with the options that we had available. Better option, worse option. Yeah, Right. And you hadn't been thinking of it in that way. Right. But now it's getting clearer. Yeah, that's right. And see, just back then it felt like mom didn't love me.
[21:22] B: Right.
[21:23] A: But see, it didn't have anything to do with mom's love. Mom doesn't love in the way that you and I would love because mom's not well. Mom's like, there's something off over there with mom. And it had nothing to do with your lovability or whether you were truthful or not. Had to do with their dysfunction. Yes, but you didn't know all of that, which you're getting now. Right. So now close your eyes and picture that earlier. You. And let that earlier, you know what? You know, now that that's over, finished, completed, that it had nothing to do with you and everything to do with their dysfunction. That in all actuality she did you a favor. Because the Options were either stay with grandma or be back there and have him continue to do it. Oh, wow. Okay, good. Let her know about all the positive changes you're making now. Right. And lightening things up. Right. Which is why you're here. And you actually wrote things down going, hey, you know what? I'm recognizing that I'm a lot better in a lot of ways, but this is something that's still a little off, and I'd like to be better with that. Right. And as all of that gets in, what do you notice in terms of how your body's feeling now?
[22:33] B: I feel like, relieved a little.
[22:34] A: You do, don't ya? Right? Yeah. Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[22:40] B: I never know when I'm supposed to open my eyes. Can you tell me from now on?
[22:43] A: No, I want you to guess.
[22:45] B: Really?
[22:46] A: Yeah. Cause you do it right.
[22:47] B: I know.
[22:48] A: Every single time.
[22:49] B: Well, I kind of peek sometimes. I'm like.
[22:51] A: And then I'm like, no, no, don't. But you've done it right every time.
[22:55] B: Well, thank you.
[22:55] A: I mean, you haven't not gotten it right. Right. Because you know what?
[22:59] B: You can't do it wrong. Oh, you can't?
[23:03] A: No, because you're like in the process with me, and one of us is directing it and one of us is going with it and we're doing it together. So you can't do it wrong. I could screw it up really bad.
[23:13] B: Well, don't. I'm trusting you.
[23:16] A: Don't trust me. Watch me. That's why you keep opening your eyes. Right?
[23:19] B: Yeah.
[23:22] A: Right. And that's okay, right? Because we don't live in like a, you know, trusting world. Should I go blind to everybody and go, hey, you know what? I have a four year old and she was, dad, don't open your eyes. I'm gonna take you somewhere. Is that a good idea for me? Not if I don't want to get banged into the wall.
[23:39] B: Right.
[23:39] A: Because she's not necessary. Come on.
[23:41] B: Boom.
[23:43] A: Right? I don't want to do that. Unlike this. Okay. Yeah, sweetie, Fine. Whoa. Hello. Right. And she's got all best intentions. But see, I think it's useful to keep my eyes open.
[23:55] B: Definitely.
[23:56] A: And my ears tuned because I don't want to believe or trust in that. Somebody's always got my best interest in mind.
[24:04] B: Yeah. But I don't feel like you would harm me, so I probably wouldn't harm you.
[24:12] A: But the still thing is we still want to keep our eyes open just in case. Not just in case, because we're apt to Handle things better. You ever heard the term being blindsided?
[24:24] B: Yes.
[24:24] A: Right. Do you know how you get blindsided?
[24:26] B: Because you ain't looking.
[24:27] A: Right. Exactly. Right. And if I've got eyes that work, I might as well use them.
[24:33] B: Yes.
[24:33] A: Right.
[24:34] B: That's what God gave them to you for.
[24:35] A: You go. Right. So now, as you're checking in with that, I'd like you to think about, you know, you've been talking to this girl, and you've been like, you know, connecting with her, like you guys are close, and then it seems like she's, like, you know, really getting close to this other person. Right. What's happening now?
[24:52] B: I'm relaxed.
[24:53] A: You are. Because what was really interesting is you went. Which wasn't a conscious thing. I mean, you didn't decide to do that. Your body did kind of. Well, you didn't decide to take the breath at the time that you did.
[25:09] B: Right.
[25:10] A: Your body did, though. Right, Right. And then you realized that you were actually feeling more relaxed because you were used to having that thing pop up. But then it didn't, did it?
[25:18] B: No.
[25:19] A: Huh. Isn't that weird?
[25:21] B: No, it's not weird. No. You could do it.
[25:26] A: Well, it's unusual then, for how it used to be for you. Right. But if you think about somebody, like, getting close to somebody else, does that mean, like, they don't want to be close to you?
[25:36] B: No.
[25:37] A: Because can't you be close to lots of different people? Right. And so can they. Huh. Okay, so check this whole, like, abandonment thing, because as we look at it now from the lens that we're looking at, wasn't that the best thing? And mom didn't actually abandon you. She actually left you in a better place.
[25:56] B: Right. With her mom. She knew I was safe with.
[25:59] A: Right. So that that thing wasn't happening to you. Right.
[26:03] B: Yeah.
[26:04] A: Isn't that interesting? Yeah.
[26:05] B: I feel like maybe she didn't want to lose either of us. Maybe. So she just kept him happy. And, I mean, we still don't really agree with how she did it.
[26:17] A: Well, we certainly don't agree with how she did it, but we're also realizing that. That mom wasn't well. And out of the two choices that she had, be at the home or be somewhere else, it was better to have you be somewhere else. Right. Yeah. So try to get that feeling of, you know, really being abandoned.
[26:38] B: I can't.
[26:39] A: Oh, okay.
[26:41] B: I never really thought I had abandonment issues.
[26:43] A: Somebody just told you that you did.
[26:45] B: Yeah. And the control thing, it's so good.
[26:49] A: You know, that's why I kept Asking you the question. How do you know?
[26:53] B: Yeah.
[26:54] A: Well, this scale told me that I was.
[26:55] B: Oh, good.
[26:56] A: Well, definitely trust it. It's like somebody who's an antidepressant. Well, how do you know you're depressed? Well, I take medicine. Oh, okay. So if you weren't taking that medicine, would you no longer be depressed?
[27:06] B: You could be.
[27:07] A: I mean, isn't it interesting, though, if the reality strategy is that the way that I know I'm depressed is that I take medication for it. Oh. So then we could ask the question. If you weren't taking the medicine, would that mean you'd no longer be depressed? Huh? Maybe. Maybe the depression has nothing to do with taking the medication. Or maybe you're not it at all. Maybe sometimes you just feel down.
[27:32] B: Yeah.
[27:33] A: And other times you don't. Right, Right. Maybe sometimes you like what's going on and sometimes you don't. And maybe sometimes things make sense and you're, like, free to go along with it. And then other times, like, why the fuck is this person getting out of the car and getting in the front seat when they gotta get out of the car again? Now another person.
[27:50] B: Right.
[27:51] A: But you don't actually care. Isn't it more uncomfortable to have people climb over you to get to the front seat to get out?
[28:00] B: Well, I sit in the back.
[28:02] A: You do, don't you? Right. So you don't have to be a part of any of it.
[28:05] B: Exactly.
[28:06] A: Yeah. Right. So you've learned how to handle it for you. Yeah, right. I think next time you should try to get in the front seat.
[28:12] B: Why?
[28:12] A: Because then you can sit there the whole time.
[28:14] B: Yes, that's true. Then I'd be responsible for the radio.
[28:20] A: And you wouldn't be able to listen to your own crap.
[28:22] B: Right, Right. So no.
[28:24] A: Oh, okay.
[28:24] B: I'll just stay in the back.
[28:26] A: You could, you know, just put the radio on what you wanted to listen to.
[28:30] B: That wouldn't be good for anybody.
[28:32] A: Oh, it wouldn't? Nobody likes what you listen to.
[28:35] B: No, they don't tell me to turn it off. I'm sure.
[28:37] A: Okay.
[28:40] B: I like urban music.
[28:44] A: Urban music?
[28:45] B: Rap music.
[28:46] A: I love that you said urban.
[28:48] B: I know. I don't know.
[28:51] A: I don't like Keith Urban.
[28:52] B: No. Well, I do. I like everything. I like country, I like rock. I've grown up on from Alabama, you know, I like old R banjos.
[29:04] A: No, no, no, that's not it. Well, I mean, everybody in Alabama has banjo on their knee.
[29:09] B: No, we don't.
[29:13] A: See, I thought everybody with Alabama had a banjo on their knee.
[29:16] B: No, it's not.
[29:17] A: You don't get born with banjos. No, no. See, I don't. I've never really been to Alabama or born there or. Yeah. And I clearly wasn't born there.
[29:24] B: Been born there. I always wanted to.
[29:29] A: I know it's either Roll Tide or Auburn. Right? That's. No, Auburn is War Eagle.
[29:35] B: Yes.
[29:36] A: Roll Tide, Alabama. Right.
[29:38] B: But Auburn is in Alabama.
[29:39] A: You either need to be one or the other if you. Okay. Which I don't really get the Eagle part because aren't they the Alabama Prince? Alabama Tigers? Right. Aren't they like. But isn't Alabama got a different thing? Not. They're not like the. The. They're not the Auburn Eagles.
[29:59] B: Right.
[30:00] A: They're.
[30:01] B: Right. They are Tigers.
[30:02] A: Right.
[30:03] B: And Roll Tide are Alabama. I mean, are freaking elephants.
[30:06] A: Right. Crimson Tide.
[30:08] B: Yep.
[30:09] A: Right. Yeah. So it's interesting, right? Do you know why they do the Eagle?
[30:15] B: No.
[30:16] A: Really Cool. If you ever go to an Auburn football game, before the football game starts, there's a dude that's got a bird that flies around the stadium, around the stadium and around the stadium, and then comes and lands on the dude's arm.
[30:30] B: Does he. On people?
[30:31] A: I don't know. Probably only on the Alabama side, right? Yeah. Kind of neat. That's where the whole word eagle came from.
[30:44] B: I just really. I don't like, like them like them, but if I had to pick one, I actually like them both because all my family, some like Alabama, some like Auburn. So I just love them all.
[30:53] A: Yeah. It's like Florida, Florida State, Miami.
[30:56] B: I'm a Cater, though.
[30:58] A: I'm sorry about that. It's too bad.
[31:00] B: I'm sorry. You don't. Yeah, we can eat you.
[31:07] A: We can spear you.
[31:10] B: Unless. Yeah, unless you don't zigzag when we're chasing you.
[31:13] A: That's not true, is it?
[31:15] B: I. I've just come to that realization.
[31:16] A: Someone else told me that it's better to just run in a straight line, fast, away from them because you're gonna be quicker than them. Zigzagging is.
[31:24] B: Oh, I heard they were really, really fast.
[31:26] A: They're quick. They're not fast.
[31:29] B: They're not like fast.
[31:30] A: No.
[31:31] B: I thought them little arms, like.
[31:33] A: Fair enough. They're quick. They go jump fast. Okay, but they're not fast. You can outrun a gator. Gator's not like. You're not in a race with a gator.
[31:43] B: The gator's, like, fast on my tail, nipping at my heels.
[31:48] A: You'd be faster. So the zigzag isn't going to do anything, because the gator is going to go straight when you zig and zag, then. He's right.
[31:56] B: Someone else told me to climb a tree. It's like, what if it's a tree? Like that, I'd be really scared, Right?
[32:04] A: Yeah. The gator is. It's quick out of the water. There's a fast jump mechanism. Not quick on land. You never see gators, like chasing things on ground. Oh, right. You ever seen a gator chase? No, that's not their thing.
[32:24] B: Oh.
[32:25] A: All this time, they're all about surprise, surprise. Yeah, all about surprise. So they lurk, they wait, nobody's watching, then they jump. And they got a quick jump thing.
[32:37] B: But they're not fast, so. Okay. Every Tuesday, I go to Convent park and I walk around the lakes and I get like, the water's right here because I'm looking. And we. We call it on the schedule alligator hunting. Because that's really what we're doing. We're looking for alligators. But that probably is not the safest thing we're going to do.
[32:53] A: Well, I mean, it's okay because they're not going to jump at you because you're bigger than them.
[32:59] B: Just don't bring your baby.
[33:00] A: Right. Or a little puppy. Walk the little puppy down the water. And the gators, like. See, all predators only go after weakness, not strength. Because if they go after something that's strong, they could get hurt and then their livelihood is over.
[33:15] B: Yeah. Somebody told me if a bear is chasing you that you shouldn't run. You should be like, you should act crazy.
[33:29] A: So if a bear. If you run from a bear, a bear thinks it's fun. All prey run away from predator. You don't want to do that.
[33:39] B: Okay.
[33:40] A: You probably don't want to fight it either because it's bigger than you. I mean, if you could scare it and go. And it actually goes. Goes away, that's fine. But if it's like.
[33:49] B: Yeah.
[33:49] A: Then you want to pretend that you're dead.
[33:52] B: Okay. Yeah.
[33:53] A: Because if you pretend that you're dead, it might leave you alone.
[33:56] B: But won't they just slap you around?
[33:58] A: Yes. But a predator is not interested in something that's already dead.
[34:04] B: Okay. Okay.
[34:07] A: So the best option for bear is to play dead.
[34:10] B: Okay.
[34:10] A: And hope that it thinks you are.
[34:12] B: Okay, I'll do that.
[34:14] A: But hopefully you're not in a situation that you're encountering bear very often.
[34:19] B: True. They don't plan to be.
[34:22] A: Right.
[34:23] B: But I did just go to the Smoky Mountains for the hurricane. That's right. We lived In North Carolina.
[34:27] A: Nice. That's cool. Yeah.
[34:29] B: And I was climbing mountains.
[34:31] A: Well, that would be fun.
[34:32] B: It was.
[34:32] A: But if you're making noise, the bears can kind of like, hang out. It's only when you startle the animal that they don't really like that.
[34:39] B: Yeah, you did that for.
[34:41] A: I mean, if you're a noisemaker, then they hear it and they're not gonna be near you.
[34:47] B: Okay, cool.
[34:48] A: Yeah. All right, so what's else on the list? Because think about that. You know, somebody that you got really close to, now they're talking to somebody else. Somebody that you get really close to, now we're talking to somebody else.
[35:04] B: I thought I was checking the list.
[35:05] A: Well, you are, but then I just asked you to do that too.
[35:09] B: Oh, it doesn't bother me.
[35:11] A: I know.
[35:11] B: Okay. Sorry. I had to register that. Okay, like, thanks. I do this thing where I do really, really good for a while, and then I do something crazy.
[35:26] A: How do you know when you do the crazy thing?
[35:28] B: I get in trouble and they're like, oh, you're doing so good. And I've done this since I was a kid. Like, I'll do it really, really good, and then I'll sneak out of the house or something crazy, like, you know.
[35:40] A: Well, how do you know when to start doing the crazy thing?
[35:43] B: I don't. I just start getting. I get, like, a lot of hair at my ass, and I'm just like, sorry.
[35:48] A: It's a lovely visual. What the hell is that?
[35:54] B: Wild hair. So, no, I just, like, I get in trouble and people are like, why are you self sabotaging? I procrastinate bad. Like, yeah, like, whenever. I have, like, a lot of things to do. Like, I have my fourth step that I took forever doing if I would just do it. But every, like, they're like, all right, self sabotaging. And I'm like, I don't know. Okay. I don't think so. I just don't really want to do this shit no more. And I'll just be like, fuck it. I just stop caring.
[36:39] A: Well, how do you know when to stop caring?
[36:41] B: I don't really know that I've done it until I've done it. And then I'm like, oh, shit. I haven't been doing this. I haven't done that.
[36:50] A: Okay, so you've given me, like, three separate things. Some one had to do with procrastination.
[36:54] B: Well, it's all kind of procrastination.
[36:56] A: It is.
[36:59] B: Well, I do procrastinate.
[37:01] A: How do you know I don't do.
[37:04] B: Things I'm supposed to do and I know I'm not supposed to do, I know I'm supposed to do them, but I'll be like, I'll do it later.
[37:10] A: Oh, can you do it later? Excited.
[37:13] B: Do it.
[37:15] A: Well, have you gotten it done? The fourth step?
[37:19] B: Oh, yeah, I did.
[37:23] A: Okay, so how do you know that you're procrastinating and not somebody that's just really good at time management? Hmm. Weird question, right?
[37:33] B: Yeah.
[37:33] A: Sometimes people think that it's procrastination, and other times it's like, I know how long it's going to take me to do it, and I wait to start until I have that much time left to do it.
[37:43] B: Okay. I'm really good at time management.
[37:46] A: See, isn't that an interesting thing? I had a mom that came in and she was telling me that her daughter had a procrastination problem. I'm like, how so? She's like, well, she, you know, wasted the last minute to do things. Okay, well, how is she doing? And she goes, well, she's a straight A student. Go, oh, how does she have a procrastination issue? Well, because she's not getting it done right away. Okay. She's a straight A student. I go, oh, huh. And she just got into Brown. Right. I would imagine that most students who are straight A students who can get into an Ivy League school, they definitely have a procrastination problem.
[38:26] B: Sounds like it.
[38:26] A: Right. Like, clearly it's not negatively impacting her.
[38:31] B: Right.
[38:31] A: It's negatively impacting mom. You know why? Because mom's type A. Mom, as soon as something comes in, gets it done. Mom is real particular. Daughters, no daughter waits. Daughter knows how long it's gonna take her.
[38:46] B: So what is she? Type B?
[38:48] A: She waits. I don't know. I don't know what type B is. I should probably know that.
[38:52] B: All you know is what type A is.
[38:54] A: Well, type A tend to be really particular in analysis.
[38:57] B: And so what's the other type? Not the opposite of that.
[39:02] A: Is there any other type? There is no other type. There is no other type. Yeah. So the idea goes for you, if you're getting stuff done, maybe it's just on your timetable and not somebody else's.
[39:22] B: I love that.
[39:23] A: Right, right. I mean, let's check it out. Like, if you're having to make breakfast, do you get the breakfast done? You do?
[39:34] B: If I want to.
[39:36] A: Well, I mean, if your job, if it's your role in the house, like your job is to get the breakfast done.
[39:41] B: Yeah.
[39:41] A: Do you get it done? You Do. Right. Okay. And not like by like 6:30 at night.
[39:47] B: No.
[39:47] A: Right. You actually get it done, you know? Right.
[39:50] B: Yeah.
[39:51] A: So you do things on your timetable. Isn't it interesting that the thing that I would say more about you is that you question versus that you're trying to control.
[40:00] B: Right.
[40:01] A: You question like, why should I be doing this?
[40:04] B: Yes.
[40:04] A: If it makes sense to me to do, then I do it.
[40:06] B: Right.
[40:07] A: If it doesn't make sense to me to do, then I don't do it.
[40:10] B: Yes. That really is.
[40:12] A: And don't you question most things? Mm. Okay. So maybe it's less control and more questioning.
[40:18] B: Okay.
[40:19] A: And you don't actually question if it makes sense.
[40:21] B: Right.
[40:21] A: Right. What's happening now?
[40:26] B: I'm a little confused.
[40:27] A: You are.
[40:28] B: I'm questioning.
[40:32] A: Well, what if it was more about questioning than it was that you don't get things done?
[40:39] B: Well, that would be. Okay.
[40:40] A: Okay. Because did you get the four step done? Yes. Oh. Did you get it done in somebody else's timetable? Oh, you got it done in yours?
[40:47] B: Well, my sponsors. Well, no, I didn't do it in her. Yeah. I got it on mine.
[40:50] A: You did, didn't you? Right. You didn't do it in the time frame that your sponsor set up.
[40:55] B: Right.
[40:55] A: Right. But you did get it done. Yes. Huh. On yours. Oh, isn't that okay? Huh. Isn't there a way that people progress through, like, steps?
[41:07] B: Yes.
[41:08] A: Like, aren't you going to, you know, go into another level? Right. And are you doing that on your timetable?
[41:14] B: Yep.
[41:14] A: You are, aren't you? Right. And do you question sometimes if this thing doesn't make sense to you, why do I need to do it that way? Okay.
[41:25] B: Yeah.
[41:27] A: So maybe you more question than you try to control.
[41:30] B: Okay.
[41:30] A: Oh, okay.
[41:33] B: I guess there's nothing wrong with questioning.
[41:34] A: Well, is there? Because if it makes sense to you, then you can do it. So it's just about people giving you, like, reasons that make sense?
[41:42] B: Yes. But I can't control other people.
[41:46] A: You can't.
[41:46] B: Right.
[41:47] A: Oh, you just know that.
[41:49] B: Yes.
[41:50] A: You can't control other people. Right. And you don't.
[41:54] B: Oh, so why am I letting them control me?
[41:57] A: They're not, are they? Because you're doing it actually on your timetable.
[42:02] B: But they're trying.
[42:04] A: They are. And if it makes sense to you, you actually do it.
[42:07] B: Yes.
[42:07] A: Right. And if it doesn't, then you question it and do it on yours.
[42:10] B: Right.
[42:11] A: Right. Maybe there's nothing wrong with me, then maybe there's nothing wrong with you and this whole notion of, like, self sabotage.
[42:21] B: Yeah.
[42:21] A: Right. So what is it that you've done that, like, has been sabotaging?
[42:32] B: I don't know. That's just what they say.
[42:33] A: Well, how. When do they say it?
[42:35] B: When you get in trouble.
[42:36] A: For what? Like, give me an example of something that you've done that you got in trouble for.
[42:39] B: Okay. I'm just. I'm on Internet restriction right now, right. Until Tuesday. I got it taken for two weeks because I. Okay. My daughter. My daughter Mercedes. I haven't really been in her life.
[42:56] A: Why didn't you name your Chevy?
[42:58] B: Because I love Mercedes. It's like that name. So I haven't really been in her life for the past, like, couple years.
[43:06] A: Okay.
[43:07] B: And so I was. I was starting to be, you know, be able to. To do that.
[43:14] A: Yeah.
[43:15] B: And. But I was waiting on my case manager to touch base with her dad and just be like, this is this, and this is that, even though it was already approved for me to call her. So since I was waiting on that, I was like, oh. They didn't say I couldn't email her. So I was emailing her, and she sent me some pictures. And I knew that I wasn't supposed to be doing that because I was supposed to be waiting on that, but they were taking too long, so I did it on my own. And so then I got some pictures from her of, like, me and her dad and me and her when she was a baby, and then all three of us and her and her dad. And I was like, I feel like Chris sent me those pictures, so. And because they had just asked me for my password that morning, so I was like, fuck, they're gonna see these pictures and I'm gonna get in trouble. So I told. I was like, well, this is what I've been doing. And they were like, okay. Was just stay off the Internet until the hurricane's over. I'm like, okay. Well, then when the hurricane was over, I got back on the Internet anyways, and Chris had wrote me, and so I wrote him back, but he was saying shit like, you're not. If you. If you still have, like, a couple years left in the streets, then, you know, don't write her back and this and that. Like, if you're gonna be there, be there and shit. I already knew. And I kind of got offended because I was like. Like, I don't know what you're talking about. And I wouldn't do that because there's a whole long thing. Like, his mom wouldn't let me see Mercedes.
[44:38] A: You got offended because he wanted to make sure that you were going to be present in your kid's life?
[44:42] B: Yes.
[44:42] A: What an asshole.
[44:43] B: Fuck him.
[44:46] A: What a jerk. Trying to be protective of your kid, man.
[44:50] B: Okay, I get that, but he's such an asshole.
[44:55] A: Of course he is.
[44:56] B: And he does shit.
[44:58] A: But where was he coming from on that one? At least as you're telling it to me.
[45:01] B: Yes.
[45:03] A: Hey, I want to make sure that, like, you're gonna, like, you know, stay in her life. Because what would suck is for you to get in and then be ripped out again.
[45:09] B: Yes.
[45:10] A: And that would hurt her, and I don't want you to hurt her. What a jerk.
[45:17] B: I guess not.
[45:18] A: But not on that. He might be a jerk in other ways, but in that one he's not quite being a jerk, he's being protective.
[45:26] B: Yeah, but then he was saying other shit like, oh, in the four years we've been broke up, I haven't let no other girls around her. And the one that I did, Mercedes told me she was mean, so we broke up. Like, bullshit. I can name two girls right now that I know of. As you are driving their car, like, coming to see me, like, well, he's.
[45:45] A: Just putting himself out there about how wonderful and great he is. Which you know isn't true.
[45:49] B: Right.
[45:50] A: Oh, okay.
[45:50] B: And making me.
[45:52] A: Well, he's trying to put himself out there. Look at how wonderful and great I am.
[45:56] B: Yeah. And what a piece of shit you are. That's what I felt like.
[45:59] A: Oh, but are you?
[46:00] B: No.
[46:01] A: No. Right.
[46:02] B: I have been.
[46:02] A: So do you have to. Oh, you know, see, I would say that you've done shitty things.
[46:07] B: I've done shitty things.
[46:07] A: But you're not a piece of shit.
[46:09] B: No, I'm a human.
[46:10] A: That's not like your identity. No, Right.
[46:12] B: That's right. Piece of shit.
[46:18] A: No. Right. I mean, you've done shitty things.
[46:21] B: Yes.
[46:22] A: Yeah. Right. And you're actually in the process of changing. Right? Huh? And isn't there a thing in the process of changing that sometimes, like in doing stuff, there's like, steps that go backwards, but it's all about moving forward.
[46:39] B: Yeah. And people don't always believe you.
[46:44] A: Right. And should he, given history of what's happened. Right. And of course he wants to parlay that, you know, I am like, wonderful and great, aren't I? Here. I know you're not gonna pat me on the back, but I'm gonna pat me on the back.
[47:00] B: Yeah. Better. I'm ready.
[47:05] A: Yeah, that's true. Oh, so what are you noticing now?
[47:09] B: I don't really care.
[47:10] A: You don't, do ya? Right. So Is that sabotaging you by writing to him?
[47:18] B: Well, I'm just. I'm, like, growing up in the program, and I'm doing really well. And then I literally was like, fuck, Zayla, I'm writing. I know I'm not supposed to be. I didn't mean like, fuck, Zayla.
[47:34] A: But I know you were questioning how come it doesn't make sense. Huh?
[47:41] B: Yeah.
[47:41] A: See, it's interesting because when you're in a program, there's gonna be things that they do that somebody who's a questioner is gonna question whether those things really make sense.
[47:49] B: Right? Yeah.
[47:53] A: Right. So it's just about figuring out, you know, whether they do. Because when they do make sense, isn't it easier for you to follow it? Yeah, it is, isn't it? Right.
[48:06] B: And then Beth was like. She's like, now you see why we don't want you to have direct communication with him? Because he kind of, like, tore my spirit down a little bit, you know? Like, I was, like, feeling all good. And then he's like. And then I'm like, no. Does that make sense?
[48:26] A: Yeah. Okay, well, is your spirit torn down now?
[48:28] B: No.
[48:29] A: No, it isn't.
[48:30] B: No. But I was vulnerable to, like, down talk.
[48:35] A: You were trying to. Like, you actually were believing him.
[48:41] B: No, but it upset me.
[48:45] A: Huh.
[48:45] B: Yeah.
[48:49] A: Mm. Wouldn't it?
[48:52] B: Mm.
[48:53] A: Oh, okay.
[48:55] B: Yeah.
[48:56] A: Right.
[48:57] B: But then I'm, like, focused on what him and what he said, and I'm not, like, thinking about, like, me and what I'm doing.
[49:02] A: Oh, but then you shifted that.
[49:04] B: What?
[49:06] A: Because now you're back to focusing on you and what you're doing.
[49:08] B: Yeah.
[49:09] A: Oh, okay. So that was actually an area that showed up that allowed you to grow learning experience. Huh? Right.
[49:17] B: Yeah. This is what shit that pisses me off. I trust these people to fix me or to help me fix myself, and they're throwing all these. But they are extra problems.
[49:31] A: No, they are.
[49:34] B: They're making me feel like I'm a hypochondriac.
[49:37] A: Well, interesting, because are you feeling that way right now?
[49:40] B: No.
[49:41] A: Right. What you're actually getting is, hey, you know what? Somewhat I question whether things make sense, and maybe I don't have the big picture. So with the picture that I have, it doesn't make sense if I have the big picture, which I got by going, here's why. Oh, that wasn't really clear to me before. Oh, now I get it. And now I've had the learning. Huh? Okay, now what there is for me to do is work on, like, getting me being the best Me that I can be. Which is what you're doing on your timetable. That's right. Isn't that cool? And you wouldn't want to feel really good about that. Don't you?
[50:24] B: Yeah.
[50:25] A: Already start to feel really good about it now I do. You do, don't you? Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. Cool. All right. So we're on our way, aren't we?
[50:36] B: Yeah.
[50:37] A: Any other stuff on your list? I love that there's an arrow. This one has to do with it. Not this one. Oh, no, that's a star.
[50:47] B: That's a star? Yeah. Okay. I need to. I don't know if this something you can help me, but it's just an issue that I'm having. I need to, like, tone down my bark. Or not bark at people. Maybe not tone it down. Maybe just get rid of it. I don't know if you can do that.
[51:09] A: Well, how do you know when to bark?
[51:11] B: When they say something crazy, I'm like, what? Or they act a certain way. I tell them how I really feel, and the truth are sometimes. But then I feel, like, bad about it.
[51:28] A: Well, is it the truth, or is it how you're feeling?
[51:31] B: Both.
[51:33] A: Really? You're smart enough to know the truth. Because I'm not. I don't know what the truth is. Like, if we go back down to, like, what is the truth? I don't have high enough pay grade to get to the truth.
[51:46] B: That's why I feel like I need to be more compassionate.
[51:49] A: Oh, okay. You can tell people how you feel, and that might be the truth for you in that moment. Yeah, but it may not be the truth.
[52:03] B: Correct.
[52:04] A: Right.
[52:05] B: Because I don't know. I don't have all the facts.
[52:07] A: Right. Yeah. I don't have the pay grade to get there. God might have the truth, but I don't have the pay grade.
[52:14] B: Yeah.
[52:14] A: I'm not smart enough to know. The truth is I'm just gonna have different ways of thinking about things.
[52:20] B: Yes.
[52:20] A: That might be empowering to me. So what's it like when you feel compassionate?
[52:26] B: I can understand where people are coming from. So I don't have such strong negative feelings. Yeah, People piss me off. They say stupid things, and I can't deal with it sometimes. Or they act crazy. I'm serious.
[52:50] A: So do you want them to control you that much?
[52:52] B: No.
[52:53] A: Oh.
[52:55] B: I just want them to stop doing things.
[52:56] A: But they're controlling you.
[52:58] B: I know.
[52:59] A: Cause you just said that they make me. Mm. Mm. I did.
[53:06] B: They make me what?
[53:09] A: People make me angry.
[53:11] B: Oh, yeah.
[53:12] A: You did say that they make me.
[53:14] B: They do.
[53:15] A: Oh. So do you want to give them that much power?
[53:18] B: No.
[53:18] A: Oh. Huh. Well, how do you know when to have them make you angry? What's something that they might do or say that then you're angry?
[53:30] B: Okay. One girl gets in the van after work, and she starts crying, and I'm like, oh, my God. Have you never had a job before? Like, you don't understand the things we go through in this house. I know. These things you don't understand. It's bad. There's a lot. I mean, there's a lot of emotion. Maybe I'm just being really hard on people. I don't know. Yeah. Like, when Megan comes in and she starts acting, like, entitled, like, and yelling at people and stuff, like, it pisses me off. And then they have, like, these outbursts, like, okay, we're having a discussion on how we should do things. And she's like, well, I don't really care. In the middle of the conversation, she's like, well, I don't really. I don't care how it gets done as long as I, you know, do whatever and I get to go back home and go to sleep. And I'm like, that's what we're doing right now. You don't see what we're doing? Like, we're having a conversation to see how that's what we're doing, how we.
[54:40] A: Can get it done.
[54:40] B: Yeah. So, like, what are you talking about? Why do you even say that? And I was like, I said that and I shouldn't.
[54:48] A: So you're actually going through. Through the really cool process of learning how to be with things and people that are different.
[54:57] B: Right.
[54:58] A: See, I think the biggest. Biggest learning that we get in education, like, going to high school, isn't what we learned in high school. I mean, my most useful class in high school was typing. Okay.
[55:08] B: Right.
[55:09] A: Big freaking. Right. Nothing else was very useful. I don't use any of my world history, American history.
[55:15] B: I know.
[55:15] A: I don't use any of that stuff.
[55:17] B: Right.
[55:17] A: Or do math because we got calculators now.
[55:19] B: Yeah.
[55:20] A: Algebra, I'm not doing, you know, long division. Right. Decimals, fraction maybe measuring stuff. But that's pretty easy.
[55:27] B: It's right there.
[55:28] A: I mean, there's all sorts of things that we didn't learn, but what we did learn, and the biggest thing about school is to learn how to interact with people that aren't the same as you, that you don't like and how to be okay. Huh. So I'm wondering what it would be like for you to be feeling more okay with others differences, because the things that upset them might not upset you, but the things that upset you might not upset them. And wouldn't that be okay if you had more compassion for their upset? Right. Because it's not the same as yours. But see, with being a questioner, when things don't make sense, you're like, fuck, I don't understand how this thing could be upsetting.
[56:12] B: Yeah, right.
[56:15] A: But the thing is, you're not in their world. What's upsetting to you might not be upsetting to them. What's upsetting to them might not be what's upsetting to you.
[56:30] B: That's true.
[56:31] A: Right, okay. So let's think of them saying one of those things or, you know, they're getting in and out of the front seat and you could just be thinking yourself, I'm really glad I'm sitting in the back listening to my music. I mean, you wouldn't want to actually feel really good that you picked the best seat for you.
[56:50] B: No, I would.
[56:51] A: Oh, right. So I'm wondering what it would be like for you to be feeling really good that you picked the best seat for you.
[56:57] B: Yeah.
[56:57] A: So you have to be involved in any of these.
[56:59] B: Right, Right.
[57:00] A: You can just listen to your music. Urban.
[57:02] B: Mind my own business music.
[57:04] A: You know, urban stuff. But you said the word urban.
[57:09] B: I know. Just trying to be professional.
[57:14] A: Exactly. That was really good. I liked it. So think about something that they might do that would normally annoy you.
[57:22] B: Yeah, got it.
[57:23] A: And what do you notice? Like, how do you want to be? First of all, like, if you weren't feeling annoyed, how would you be?
[57:29] B: I would not care what they're doing.
[57:32] A: And when you don't care what they're doing and your body's feeling relaxed.
[57:35] B: It's so good.
[57:36] A: It is so good. And you wouldn't want to feel really good.
[57:39] B: Yes.
[57:40] A: Right. With your body relaxed and you just like don't care. Right. Because it's not about you.
[57:48] B: Right.
[57:48] A: And see, that's the thing that you're going to be starting to realize more and more because that's the part that we changed first. That had to do with the upset. Because everything comes in and it feels like it is about me. Right. You're gonna be reading other people's stuff as being about them. And then you might even have gratitude that I'm not upset like they are. And with you being in gratitude, it'll be a lot easier for you to be compassionate for what they're going through. Because the deal with gratitude is that it is the antidote. Antidote? Yeah, the antidote for anger. So you can't be angry and in a state of gratitude, and you can just be in the state of gratitude that I'm not upset over that. Right. And then you won't be angry.
[58:36] B: Right.
[58:36] A: Huh. So think about them like, you know, doing one of those things, and you're thinking to yourself, oh, I'm really glad. This one me. Yeah. How does that feel now?
[58:47] B: Better?
[58:47] A: It does, doesn't it? Yeah. So that's certainly something that we can do more with moving forward, but that'll be the first step for you. Got it.
[58:56] B: Got it.
[58:56] A: Okay. You did great work today.
[58:58] B: Thanks.
[58:59] A: Yeah.
[58:59] B: Are we done?
[59:00] A: We're done for now.
[59:02] B: I'm done, actually. Well, my list is done, but it just doesn't seem like I've been in here for that long.
[59:07] A: You've actually been in here for over an hour. Can you imagine that? Yeah.
[59:14] B: I needed help.
