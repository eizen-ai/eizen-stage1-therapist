[00:00] A: So today is the 10th of September and B, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training others. And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:14] B: That's fine.
[00:15] A: Cool. So first question is, how did our last session leave you? Even as you think about the stuff that we talked about, where there had been that discussed.
[00:25] B: How did it leave me?
[00:26] A: Yeah. When you think about that now, what do you notice?
[00:29] B: I'm lighter.
[00:30] A: You are lighter.
[00:31] B: I'm lighter.
[00:32] A: Isn't that cool?
[00:32] B: I'm happier.
[00:33] A: Oh, and happier. How so?
[00:36] B: Yes. You're amazing. Whatever you've done, it's just. It kind of. It kind of scared me a little bit too.
[00:44] A: Yeah.
[00:45] B: Because I just wonder like, how did you do that in such little time?
[00:49] A: Yeah.
[00:49] B: It doesn't take forever to change.
[00:52] A: It doesn't?
[00:53] B: No, it can. It don't happen overnight either, but if you do the right procedures, it can happen in minutes.
[00:59] A: Well, I would say in slightly different. And you're right on target.
[01:03] B: Right.
[01:04] A: We are constantly, always changing. If you think every moment of every minute of every hour of every day, we are always changing. Everything is always changing. We freeze things so we don't always see it changing. Right. It's. The kid is with me. I don't see how much they're growing. Grandparent comes in. Oh my goodness, look, I'm a bigger.
[01:25] B: Right, Right.
[01:25] A: I didn't see it because I get acclimated to it every day. Habituated. Right. They haven't seen them. Oh, bigger. That kind of thing.
[01:35] B: Mostly my kids.
[01:37] A: You do? You have.
[01:39] B: Yes, since last.
[01:40] A: Good for you.
[01:41] B: That's another thing that I'm happy about.
[01:44] A: Yeah. Did they, did you go there? They come here?
[01:47] B: No, they came to me.
[01:48] A: Nice.
[01:49] B: So I had. I have to work on like right now I'm working on trying to have a talk with my kids cuz they're getting older.
[01:57] A: How old are they?
[01:58] B: I have a 1011, a 9 and 7.
[02:01] A: 1011. Oh my goodness.
[02:03] B: Yeah.
[02:05] A: I am so sorry.
[02:08] B: So my daughter is the oldest and I talked to her about women things.
[02:12] A: Yeah.
[02:13] B: In order for me to do that, I have to, I have to get right with myself to even have that talk with her. So that's why I was.
[02:20] A: Well, how do you want to be when you're talking to her? You want to be like an adult?
[02:24] B: Yeah. I don't want to be a child, you know?
[02:26] A: Sure. And if you're an adult, as you're talking to her.
[02:29] B: Yeah.
[02:29] A: And you're giving her what?
[02:31] B: Good advice.
[02:32] A: Yeah. And information.
[02:33] B: And information. Right. Accurate information.
[02:36] A: Right. So we want her to have information about. Hey, by the way, you might want to carry this bag with you just in case.
[02:42] B: Right.
[02:42] A: This thing might happen.
[02:44] B: Yeah.
[02:45] A: That nobody wants to happen, but it's gonna happen. So like, I don't know how to.
[02:48] B: Have that talk of her yet. I don't know, it's just. I'm not ready for that yet. But I have to have it.
[02:53] A: I get it. We have my. I. We did that with our 11 year old. I mean, our 15 year old's already there, but we did that with our 11.
[02:58] B: Yeah. Was it weird? No.
[03:01] A: Mom had the conversation. I know that the, the baggie is there with the thing that goes in the backpack just in case the thing happens.
[03:08] B: See, my dad had to have a conversation with me. It wasn't a female, so I don't know, I'm just got to get.
[03:15] A: So you want to be more comfortable in having that conversation.
[03:17] B: Right.
[03:18] A: Cuz you're just simply educating your kid, which is going to be helpful for her. Yes. And you want to feel really good about that.
[03:23] B: Right?
[03:24] A: Right.
[03:24] B: Right.
[03:25] A: Does that make sense?
[03:26] B: Yeah, it makes a whole lot of sense.
[03:28] A: Okay.
[03:28] B: So cool that that's. I went to the library and I got a. How to talk to your kids about anything. And it's really helped me a little bit, you know?
[03:37] A: Okay.
[03:38] B: I just had to be. I just have to put my grown woman on the undies on and be prepared.
[03:44] A: Big girl, grown woman. Okay.
[03:49] B: Cuz I'm not their best friend. I'm not their friend. I'm their mother, you know?
[03:53] A: Right.
[03:54] B: So I have to realize that.
[03:56] A: Did you not know that before? I mean, you birthed them, didn't you? Yeah. So you should have got it right then. Right then and there. Like should. I'm the mom, they're the baby. Yeah. Like that's when it clicks. I think probably a little bit in here too. But like when you're using, you have.
[04:11] B: A mind as a child. Right.
[04:14] A: You're not using.
[04:15] B: Yeah, I'm not using right now.
[04:16] A: I know.
[04:17] B: That's what. And that's, that's why you stopped. I did.
[04:20] A: Right. I know that doesn't work for you anymore.
[04:22] B: Right.
[04:23] A: Right. Isn't that really good?
[04:24] B: That is.
[04:24] A: Right. So you're different automatically.
[04:28] B: So the conversation should be different. Right.
[04:30] A: You're different automatically because you're not doing that.
[04:32] B: Right.
[04:33] A: Right. So when you're not at the effect at that you're not operating and acting that way.
[04:38] B: Right, Right.
[04:40] A: Okay. Right. And you just want to educate her.
[04:43] B: Yeah.
[04:43] A: So that she knows and that she's prepared. Because heaven forbid, that'd be awful if, like, she came home and said, mom, this thing happened. Yeah.
[04:50] B: I'm like, oh, God. Yeah, about that.
[04:53] A: Oh, right. I was gonna tell you, but I was waiting till you already had it.
[04:56] B: No, no.
[04:57] A: Right, right. Yeah. So we got that. Cool. Okay. So I have lots of ideas of what we want to do. Clearly, we want the effect that stuff has had. Right. Whether it be trauma stuff, grief stuff. We want all of that to be lightened and lifted. Right, Right. The idea is, how do we want you operating in now? Right. Like, so I keep thinking of things like, well, I want you to be much more emotionally present so that when you're dealing with stuff, your emotions are matching what's happening. Right, Right. I want the impact, of course, the stuff to be cleared and gone. I want you to be feeling good and your mind bringing to your attention the things that are beneficial and possible for you to do.
[05:57] B: Okay.
[05:58] A: So that when you're up and doing them, you're feeling good.
[06:01] B: Yeah.
[06:02] A: And when you think back about having done it, you're glad you did.
[06:05] B: Right. I'm starting to feel that way a little.
[06:07] A: Yeah. And free from the effect that that stuff has had. Right. Because that stuff that happened and the stuff that you did was never who you are.
[06:18] B: That's true. How did you know that?
[06:20] A: How do I know that?
[06:21] B: Yeah.
[06:22] A: Well, because I know that that's not you.
[06:24] B: Yeah.
[06:25] A: I get that. That's stuff that you've done and things in ways that you've acted, but what you do or how you act isn't who you are. Right. And we want you to be much more connected to who you really are. Yeah.
[06:41] B: I'm getting it. Okay.
[06:42] A: You are?
[06:42] B: Yeah.
[06:43] A: You are. Cool.
[06:44] B: So I started feeling that a little bit, though. Starting to feel more happier.
[06:49] A: Yeah.
[06:49] B: You know, and more knowing who I am, the real me, not the person who I used to be.
[06:57] A: Yeah. When I don't think that that's who you used to be, I just think that that's what you used to do.
[07:03] B: Right. Right.
[07:04] A: You were always you. You were just doing different things. And those things that you had been doing back then were counterproductive to you. Now you're doing more things that are in alignment with you. Do you follow me with that? See, like, that's a huge difference.
[07:23] B: It is a huge difference.
[07:26] A: That's what you get to start to feel good about. Like, what I'm doing. I'm actually aligned with doing. Yeah, yeah. And changing your life. And as yours changes, it goes both ways. Up and down generations. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So what we laid out before is a way to understand trauma stuff. Right? We're not troubled by any of this stuff. Whether I did it or they did it because it happened. We're troubled because the brain doesn't know it's over. That's really the main issue. And where therapy goes, you gotta process out. No, we just want to go in and let that part of the brain know that it's over. Over. Unplug the memory so it's read as data. Right. That's the first part of it. The second part we talked about that what happens with negative experiences is meanings are attached that make me feel worse about me. Because it was bad.
[08:26] B: Right.
[08:27] A: Because when I was little, I learned that good things happen because I'm good and bad things happen when I'm bad. So, of course, if that was a bad thing that happened, whether it was my fault or not, it still feels like it was. You know, when Grandpa was molesting me, you know, I still felt like that was my fault. It wasn't my fucking fault. But, like, it still felt like it was. You know, I spent the money that he gave me, like. Right. So all of that stuff when it's bad, because I learned good happens when I'm good.
[09:00] B: Right.
[09:01] A: That only happens if I'm bad. So that's stuck. And then the third thing, because those two things are on, it's looking for it all the time, triggering and responding to it and confusing. Similar as identical. Makes sense.
[09:15] B: Makes sense.
[09:16] A: So when those things are separated. Right. And that the troubling part of the experience wasn't the name of the rock band, but was what the person was doing. And they're separated now, the name of the rock band is not tied to that. The brain is able to distinguish something that's similar, but read it as different. When the trauma is active, anything that's similar is read as identical. Does that make sense? So that's what we're getting. Unplugged. Got it. So then be what. What we talk about is we tend to walk around thinking that I am this body, that my body is me. But what if you're not your body? But you haven't. It's yours. Right. It's totally you. Your body is totally yours. Right. But it's not you.
[10:14] B: It's not who I. Yeah, well, it's.
[10:17] A: Not you, which is Weird, right? We know that because my mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident. And when she visits friends, they don't say to her, hey, Susie, I'm glad almost all of you could come over today.
[10:35] B: Okay.
[10:36] A: Right. So you have a body. It's totally yours. But what if it's not you?
[10:40] B: Right?
[10:40] A: And then we go, well, if I'm not my body, it must be my thoughts. But what if you're not your thoughts?
[10:45] B: What am I?
[10:46] A: What if you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? Your brain is, and you're not your brain. It's an organ, like your heart and your lungs.
[10:52] B: Right.
[10:52] A: Yours, not you. Weird. So now we go. Okay, if I'm not my body and I'm not my thoughts, I must be how I feel. But you feel different ways at different times, so you can't be a feeling. Oh, I get it. It must be what I do. But you've done this and then that and then that and then this. And when you stop doing that to do this, did you stop existing?
[11:13] B: No.
[11:13] A: No. So the weirder question goes, if I'm not my body, my thoughts, my feelings, if I'm not what I do, then what the heck are you? That's weird, right? Okay, so play along with this. Think of a time when you were outdoors in nature and you see something that's just beautiful. Like, you're looking at it in the moment, like it's captured your awareness. You're, like, in the awe of it. You're like, wow. What is it that you see?
[11:38] B: Birds.
[11:39] A: Yeah. Isn't there a moment that as you're seeing the birds, you're feeling that peace that all that wonder, and some people might tell you will be. Of course, seeing the birds in that way is going to give you that kind of feeling.
[11:49] B: Right.
[11:50] A: But if we looked at it differently, we could say that seeing it simply drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited? Kind of like if I'm at the campfire and I'm freezing, and I bring my hands closer to the flames, and as they get closer and closer, I go, holy, the fire is getting hotter. And you would look at me and go, no, it's not getting any hotter. What's happening is you're becoming more aware of the heat.
[12:24] B: Right?
[12:25] A: Right. So we know that in your life there have been lots of occurrences where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Times of hurt or pain or anguish or upset or guilt or grief. Right. But no matter where awareness has been, what if always at your center, you're peaceful and excited in the same way. You know, two of us are in here. How do you know it? You look around your senses, bringing data, right? We call that intellectual knowledge. Some people call it knowledge of light. We'll call it light of knowledge at your center, it's a brighter light. It's light of wisdom. So we know we've got knowledge and wisdom. And as you know, I work with lots of people about awful stuff happen to them, right. I remember one person, older brother, used to take GI Joe figures and run them upper leg. And a lot of bad. But we worked together, cleared it, gone, right? And I was looking at her, I said, you know, all that discomfort, I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone, right? I go, but where was it? She goes. I go, was it at the surface? She's like, no. I go, was it at your center? She's like, no, where was it? She goes, oh, it was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I said, what happened? She says, the lights have joined, the shadows are gone. Right? Right. So that's the whole thing that when we get screwed up all the time. Because, you know, if I go to the dentist and I'm pissed when I come out and you're like, why are you so upset? And I go, well, the guy's an asshole. You can't believe what he did to me. And you go, what did he do? I go, well, the first thing he did, he brought me into the office. He'd sit me on this thing, and immediately my legs are going up and my arm, head is going down. I'm like, very uncomfortable. You're like, you're at the dentist. I go, well, then the next thing he did, he's positioning this big overhead light right in front of my eyes. I'm blinded. I can't see a damn thing. And you're like, yeah, no, you're at the dentist, right? And I go, well, then the next thing he does is he takes this cold instrument and he shoves it right inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness. In your what? And I go, beat my mouth at the dentist. But see, that is the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother in the GI Joe figure. I said, when you were little, he messed with your stuff. And she said, he did. And for a long time, that hurt my feelings and screwed up my thinking. And then she looked at me, she says, but you know what? I go, what? She goes, he never touched me. He messed with my body. None of my cells are the same as they were then. He never touched who I really am. I can't be touched in that way. And I went, whoa. That is pretty powerful, right? So as we're organizing towards a you who's free and present and clear and light, all you want to do is slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, and begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper than normal, and then out a little bit longer. Right? So you're breathing in and out. Right. As you breathe in this way, see my nose and me? See my fingers? Stay looking at my nose. My fingers move out. Sides of the eyes. Pick up the fingers. Wiggling. No, sides of the eyes. There you go. So perfect, right? I can get it.
[15:56] B: You said size isn't that perfect, though.
[15:59] A: Because what we know is activated or at a higher set point. Right? Right. We want to lower the set point, but the higher set point, the anxiety, is that darting makes sense. What we want to bring in is more spaciousness. We're literally moving your brain waves from beta waves down into alpha waves. Waves. So think of alpha as flow states or what surfers think of as zones, or where you're alert but relaxed at the same time. Right. Think of the professional athlete, and it's, you know, goal line stand. And they've got one thing, and he's gonna throw it to the wide receiver. That guy's not out there. Right. He's focused, he's calm, he's clear. He's gonna do his thing. He's gonna do. Right. That's that state. And it's correlated with expanding awareness. Right? So as you slightly lower your jaw and you rest your tongue and you breathe in. That's right. Slower and deeper than normal. Out longer than the inhale. Right. See my nose and my fingers? Notice the sides of your eyes picking up the wiggling. Notice this. That's right. The space towards the windows and doors. And how you see more of the space now, that's between us or beyond me. Under and behind you and even above your head. Right? And then just for a moment, consider that the space goes beyond the room, like literally all the way out in every direction in an unending way towards outer space and beyond.
[17:43] B: Okay. Okay.
[17:45] A: That's how much space there. Isn't that crazy?
[17:47] B: Yeah.
[17:48] A: As you're noticing the space, check inside your body. How's your body feeling now?
[17:53] B: Relaxed.
[17:54] A: It is relaxed. And then just for a moment, close your eyes and imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling in the room so that you rise up above it all in the sky. You're having a bird's eye view. You're seeing it all as being underneath and below you because you're above and over it. And like a bird free to soar, fly, glide and move through the space of the sky in any direction and in all ways. Maybe with big arching turns and curves, wide angles, you're free to fly and glide through the space of the sky. That's right. When you're ready, bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you. That's right. And eyes are open. In those short moments your eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself?
[18:58] B: I was loosening up.
[19:00] A: You were loosening up. Right. And what's it like in your body as you're loosening up?
[19:06] B: Relax.
[19:08] A: It is relaxed, isn't it? Right. Because we're organizing towards you becoming more free and lighter. Right. As your bodies, you know, loosen enough that other than conscious part, can travel back down the timeline of moments of things that have happened that would be useful to unplug and clear. Yeah. What experience comes to mind? That one happened how long ago you might have been how old?
[19:45] B: Thirteen.
[19:46] A: Thirteen. Good. So we know how to clear it. You want to intend to be with me because I'm more fun.
[19:50] B: Right.
[19:53] A: This is. And that isn't.
[19:54] B: Right. Right.
[19:55] A: We're working on the goal that we want for you. Right. And we know that there are things that happen later. Now we got to add that you got to see your kids.
[20:02] B: Right.
[20:03] A: Into the cooking. Right. And getting clean on your own. Right. All of those things happen after. Right, Right.
[20:12] B: Right.
[20:13] A: So and the problem is that that part, that younger 13 year old you doesn't know that that ended. Right. You do?
[20:23] B: Yeah, I do.
[20:23] A: Right. The 13 year old you doesn't. So don't we have really good news for her?
[20:27] B: Yeah.
[20:28] A: Yeah. And that you move through it and you're okay. Right. That'd be really. And you're here now, right? That's right. That's what we want her to know. Make sense? So that thing happened at 13, when it happened, you're where.
[20:44] B: In the streets?
[20:45] A: So you're in the streets, right. In nighttime daytime. Nighttime night time. And like on a major road or in the back roads or on a block. Right. And like you're standing there. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[20:58] B: I'm selling drugs.
[20:59] A: So you were selling drugs. So you had different drugs with you and People were stopping and you were selling them. Right. Good. And then what happened next? I don't know.
[21:07] B: Then I moved to another area.
[21:10] A: Right, you moved from that block to a different block and continued to sell drugs. Right. Right. And then what happened next?
[21:21] B: And then I go to casino.
[21:24] A: With the money. Right. That you made at 13, you're going to the casino.
[21:29] B: Yeah.
[21:29] A: Right.
[21:31] B: It's crazy.
[21:32] A: Right? Right. So then you go to the casino. Right. Then what happened next?
[21:37] B: I lose all money.
[21:38] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right. Then what happened next?
[21:45] B: I go home.
[21:45] A: You went home. Right. Good. And then what happened?
[21:48] B: Oh, go to bed.
[21:50] A: Right. Then what happened next? Then I wake up and start my.
[21:53] B: Day all over again.
[21:54] A: Right. Uhhuh.
[21:56] B: And then I'm back on the block.
[21:58] A: Right.
[21:59] B: Same thing.
[21:59] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right.
[22:01] B: And then now I'm in the store.
[22:07] A: Now you're in the store. Right.
[22:09] B: Buying clothes.
[22:10] A: Okay. Right.
[22:12] B: For the day.
[22:13] A: Right. Good job. Right. And what happened next?
[22:16] B: I don't know.
[22:17] A: Well, as you're telling me about it, what are you noticing?
[22:20] B: Memory's gone. It's not. I'm not remembering anymore.
[22:24] A: Hmm. It's not really troubling though, either, as you're telling me about.
[22:28] B: No, it's not.
[22:28] A: Right.
[22:29] B: It's not like it's easy.
[22:30] A: It's easy. Right, Right. Because your brain is getting that that's done. What if the 13 year old realized that that's done. I'm not doing that. It is done. It is. Right. I know. What if she knew that? Oh, right. Close your eyes. Let the 13 year old you know that that's done. And over that experience no longer exists. That you're through it. Let her know about you being here now. Let her know about access to her kids. Let her know about seeing them. Let her know about being clean. Clear. Let her know right as she's getting it, what do you notice?
[23:08] B: It goes away.
[23:09] A: Oh, what goes away?
[23:10] B: The memory.
[23:11] A: The memory? Well, you can still remember it. I mean, you know that it happened.
[23:16] B: Right? Right. Right.
[23:17] A: I mean you can remember being on the street selling drugs.
[23:20] B: Yeah.
[23:20] A: You can even probably remember the kinds of drugs you sold.
[23:22] B: But I don't. I don't remember the. The other trauma like the selling my body and.
[23:28] A: Huh.
[23:29] B: And jumping in and out of cars and just. I don't remember that stuff.
[23:37] A: You do remember it. You just do.
[23:39] B: I do remember, but like I don't remember the details, so.
[23:41] A: I bet you do.
[23:42] B: I don't want to.
[23:44] A: Well, no, I bet you could.
[23:45] B: Yeah.
[23:46] A: Remember more of the details. Right. About what happened. Because it's not troubling you. Why is it not troubling you? Isn't that a weird thing? It was troubling you. Now it's not troubling you. How come it's not troubling you?
[24:04] B: I'm not letting it.
[24:06] A: No. There is nothing b that you're doing to either let it or not let it affect you.
[24:13] B: What?
[24:15] A: There's nothing you're doing.
[24:17] B: My body's doing?
[24:19] A: Yeah. Or you're unconscious.
[24:22] B: Oh, I heard that before.
[24:24] A: Right. The part of you that's beating your heart and breathing for you, that turns on.
[24:29] B: It's unconscious.
[24:31] A: Is the background back brain. Different ways to say it.
[24:37] B: That makes sense.
[24:38] A: Right. That's why now you're thinking of it. The back brain is experiencing it as information about shit that I did and shit that happened to me.
[24:52] B: Okay.
[24:53] A: Do you follow me with that? That's why you can remember it happening. Right. You can remember turning a trick. Right? Right. And we haven't even done a lot with that. Right. Do you follow me with that? We've done periphery things and it's already turning that down. Isn't that cool? And we want you to be totally free. Not because you're having to do something, but because your brain is reading it as historical data.
[25:27] B: What do you mean by historical data?
[25:29] A: It's historical data.
[25:31] B: Old data.
[25:32] A: Yeah. It's information about stuff that happened or stuff I did.
[25:38] B: Right.
[25:38] A: It's historical. Right. Different way to say it's past, but it's not like past that it's in the past. Because the problem with the language of it's in the past is our brain hears it the same way it hears, I have money in my wallet. And we know that that literally means you could open up my wallet and pull some cash. Yeah. Yeah. That's true.
[26:01] B: Follow me.
[26:02] A: Different than it's in the past. So it's historical data. Right. It's information about something that happened. And that's the key component that we want in all the way around. Make sense? Yeah. So again, slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue. Begin to breathe a little bit slower and deeper in. Exhale a little bit longer. As you're breathing. Breathing in this way, notice more space. Notice that you can sense the space around you, whether you have your eyes opened or closed. That's right. As you're noticing the space, go ahead and close your eyes. Notice you don't see me anymore or what's out in front of you, but what you actually see is just the backs of your eyelids. And when I see the backs of my eyelids. Depending, it's different hues of colors. Darker, brighter. Go ahead and open your eyes. Notice how you can look out and see me and what's out in front of you. When you close your eyes again, you no longer see me or what's out in front of you. But you see the backs of your eyelids. And so the cool part is without using your imagination. Right. So you're seeing me. Go ahead, close your eyes. You no longer see me. You see your eyelids. Keep your eyes closed. What do you actually see behind you? Without using your imagination, what do you see behind you? It might surprise you that what you actually see behind you is nothing. That's right. You see nothing behind you.
[27:32] B: Nothing is black.
[27:33] A: Right. There's nothing behind you. What would it be like to drift into nothing?
[27:38] B: Awesome.
[27:39] A: It would be so. Close your eyes and imagine just drifting back into nothing. That's right. No thing is, because here's the cool part. B And nothing. Everything exists as a potentiality.
[27:53] B: I open my eyes now.
[27:54] A: You can.
[27:55] B: Okay.
[27:56] A: Right. And again, check with your body. How's your body feeling now?
[28:01] B: Relaxed.
[28:02] A: Yeah.
[28:03] B: Still.
[28:03] A: Yeah.
[28:03] B: More relaxed than normal, though.
[28:05] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[28:06] B: Yeah. And it feels empty. A little bit.
[28:08] A: Yeah. Right. Things are getting emptied out.
[28:10] B: Yeah.
[28:10] A: Right. So that you can feel yourself as already whole and complete. Right. Because it wasn't that I needed stuff to fill here that was missing. It's that there's been shit in the way of me feeling me as whole.
[28:24] B: Right. That's all I've been asking, is to feel who I am. You know, who I am.
[28:29] A: Yeah.
[28:29] B: I've been praying for that.
[28:31] A: Yeah. Right. And we're on our way to you. Knowing more of you and connecting to more of who you really are. Beginning to lighten up on you. Right. So again, your brain is going to travel back and even think about one of those times where you had to turn a trick. It could be one that I don't like because it's disgusting. But think about that now. And what do you notice? Yeah. What do you notice? Knowing that they never touched you.
[29:00] B: Good.
[29:02] A: Good. Right? Watch. Take your hand, hold out like that. Look at that spot right there. I'm gonna slide my chair. As you look at that spot, I'm gonna take my hand, I'm gonna move it towards your hand. You're gonna see it moving in. As it gets closer, you're gonna notice that you can feel my hand before it ever touches your hand. You're gonna notice. Right. You can feel my hand. Isn't that interesting? See this is me showing you that I'm coming closer to touching who you really are. Sensitive, you're alerting me than anybody that ever messed with your stuff or hurt your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with respect and the love that you allow in. Right? That's how it works. See? Notice how different it is. Isn't that cool?
[29:48] B: Yeah.
[29:49] A: So that's the part I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings. Right? So take a deep breath in. Exhale. Eyes remain closed. That arm drops down, but only at the same rate. In which you drop deeper inside. Down towards that calm, peaceful, light, easy, flowing energy. Right? Deeper and deeper inside. That's right. Resting down all the way towards that easy, flowing energy. The light is you. That's right. There you go. Isn't that an interesting. Right, so repeat this after me. I have a nose.
[30:59] B: I have a nose.
[31:00] A: I have two elbows and I have two elbows. I have ten fingers. I have ten toes.
[31:05] B: I have ten toes.
[31:07] A: I'm not my toes. I'm not my nose. I'm not my elbows. I'm not my fingers.
[31:13] B: My fingers.
[31:14] A: I have a vagina. I'm not my vagina. It's mine. It's not me.
[31:19] B: It's not me.
[31:20] A: Right? So notice that stuff may have got touched and messed with, but they didn't get you.
[31:25] B: Right. Cuz I'm still here.
[31:27] A: Right? And there's no cell in your body. That's the same as when that stuff was going on. Because they've all been replaced millions upon millions of times.
[31:38] B: I believe that.
[31:40] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool? Right? Notice how that's changing, Right? Have you ever had to say prayers? Like when you were a kid? You have to say prayers. You remember the prayer that you had to do at the end? Well, ours was always at the end. Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take on that. And then my mom would kiss me on the forehead, walk towards the door, turn the light off, say, night, sweetie, and shut the door. Of course I'm laying there thinking about my death. Like, really, why do we say this one at the end? I'd have horrible, horrible nightmares of hands breaking through my window, ripping open my dead body, grabbing it from me. Weird. When I got older, instead of thinking of it as a thing, I have like my nose or my fingers. What if I think of the light at the center, which we Call soul. What if it's me and not something I have, my nose and my clothes? The soul. We tend to refer to it as something I have my soul, like my fingers. But what if my soul is me, not mine? It's me. I am the light at the center. And the light that is me can't be touched in that way and cannot be destroyed. Einstein's really smart. You know how I know he was really smart? Everybody after him who's really smart is called an Einstein. So he had to be really smart, right?
[33:18] B: Okay.
[33:19] A: Einstein said two things that are very important for our conversation. One is energy plus matter equals the physical, tangible existence that we can touch, feel. And then what became the second law of thermal dynamics is energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms that. Interesting, right? So I liken that to, you know, when people pass away, when they die, we get stuck with that sometimes because who they are is their body. But we're learning that whole they are isn't their body. They weren't ever their body. And that when their body stopped, they didn't stop, but their body stopped, they exited it. We don't pick them up in the same way we used to, but it doesn't mean they're not here, right? In the same way, I don't feel the radio waves going through us, but if we turned on the radio, we could listen to the music, I can blow the whistle, and we don't hear any sound. And the dog is going, right? And I had no idea that that guy had a kilo of coke, but the dog sure did, right? So there are things that are beyond what our five senses allow us to experience make sense, right? So the idea goes, what if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop working, it's that their bodies don't, they're no longer needed. But they exited. We don't pick them up in the same way we did, but it doesn't mean that they're not here. In the same way, if we have a glass of ice and we put it out on the patio and an hour goes by and somebody comes by and says, holy cow, somebody stole the ice and replaced it with water. We of course would get laugh like that and say, nobody stole the ice, it melted, right? Went from solid to liquid, but the molecule of H2O is the same. How we experience it totally changed.
[35:06] B: Ice is still there, right?
[35:07] A: Well, ice isn't there. It's water now.
[35:09] B: Yeah.
[35:10] A: We leave the glass of water, week goes by, somebody comes out and goes, hey, somebody stole the Water. We'd say, nobody stole the water. Nobody drank the water. What happened is the water evaporated, which means what? It went from liquid to gas. The molecule of H2O. Totally the same. Our experience of it is completely different. And a kid looks at us and goes, huh? But if I don't see it, how can I feel it? We go, right? You live in Florida. It's all around you. And then we put them in the desert of Arizona. We go, you don't feel any of it here, do you? And we bring him back to Florida. And you'll see. Don't you feel it? And we can show them the rain cloud. We can capture the water. We put it in the freezer. What do they discover? It's all the same thing. So when people's bodies stop, it's not that they stop us, that their bodies stop. We're no longer needed. But they exited. We don't pick them up in the same way we did. Got it. What happens for us human beings is the shock of knowing them the way I did. Blocks access. So that moment blocks access. But the second part is we know that what we really gain from being with people that matter to us isn't the trinkets or the things, but it's the experiences, right? Once you've acquired an experience, you can't actually lose that experience. Like, nobody can take away me going to Disney the first time we went, right? So you can't take away something that you've acquired, but you also can't lose something that you never had. Because how can you lose something if you never had it, right? And you can't lose it you've acquired. So the weird thing goes, then where's the loss? What if it's when people's bodies stop? It's not. They stop. I'm losing access. Because what's in the way is that shock of loss. So I had this woman tell me the other day, she goes, and she starts in this really low voice, she goes, my parents are in my closet. Yeah, I'm looking like that, going. I go, what? Your parents are in your closet? I don't know what remain. The remains of my parents are in my closet. And then I said to her, I go, but that's not even what remains of your parents. That is what remains of their body. What remains of your parents are in the experiences that you acquired in being with them. And you can't lose them. Just like your love for them is as strong as it's always ever been, they fully feeling their love for you is as strong as it's always ever been. You haven't been fully feeling it. Why? Well, because that shock of knowing them the way I did blocks access. Makes sense.
[37:56] B: Makes sense.
[37:57] A: Yeah. Right. Yeah. So what's happening now? What are you noticing for yourself?
[38:06] B: Things are clearer.
[38:08] A: Things are clearer. Yeah. It's easy to make better decisions when things are clearer. Right, right. I agree.
[38:20] B: Oh, man.
[38:21] A: Yeah. Isn't that an interesting thing? Right. So again, as we're getting all of this, think of it at moment, a time, a thing that comes to mind that would be useful to.
[38:38] B: I don't know. That'd be cute.
[38:40] A: You don't know.
[38:49] B: Kids picking on me when I was younger.
[38:51] A: Oh, that would be a good one. You might have been how old?
[38:55] B: Nine or ten.
[38:56] A: Nine or ten. And this one might have happened where? We're gonna think of a time it happened even though it happened more than one time. We just want one time at school. So you at school where you in a classroom? A hallway.
[39:06] B: Both.
[39:07] A: Well, think of classroom. So you're in the classroom. Right. Good. And you're, like, sitting or standing?
[39:12] B: I'm sitting.
[39:13] A: Sitting. Like. And with, like, other people sitting. Yeah, right. And you're like, towards the front or back of the room or middle?
[39:22] B: The front.
[39:23] A: Yeah. Right. And then what happened next?
[39:25] B: The teacher tells a story of my mom passing.
[39:28] A: So the teacher says to the class, hey, by the way, we just need to. Laro, the beach's mom has passed away, and, you know, be a little bit nicer to her.
[39:35] B: And then one of the students raised their hand. Xy.
[39:38] A: Right.
[39:38] B: And she tells them how and why. No, no, X is how.
[39:42] A: Well, how'd she die?
[39:44] B: Yeah.
[39:44] A: And then the teacher says, hiv. Hiv. Great.
[39:48] B: Not everyone thinks I have hiv.
[39:50] A: Right. So then they're all like, E cooties. Right. So then they sell. Right. And then she says that. Then what happened next?
[40:02] B: Everybody. Not everybody thinks I have it. Because everybody's like, do you have it?
[40:06] A: Right. You're like, no.
[40:07] B: I'm like, no.
[40:08] A: Right. Good.
[40:09] B: How do you know that?
[40:10] A: Right. How do you know that? You don't.
[40:11] B: Right?
[40:12] A: Right. You didn't have a good answer.
[40:15] B: No.
[40:15] A: Right.
[40:16] B: How do I know I didn't.
[40:17] A: Right.
[40:17] B: So.
[40:20] A: Then what happened?
[40:21] B: Now I have it. Now I have it. Not everybody's saying I have it.
[40:25] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[40:28] B: Now we're on a bus. A school bus.
[40:29] A: Right. Then what happened next?
[40:31] B: They're making a song, right? B has hiv. B has hiv. Whatever.
[40:38] A: Right. Not as good as the Pharrell Williams.
[40:40] B: Right, right, right. Okay. And.
[40:44] A: And so they sing it on the way home. Right? Good. And then what happened? Off the bus, right? Then what happened?
[40:50] B: I lost my best friend.
[40:51] A: What happened?
[40:52] B: She, she's like, you have hiv, I can't be your friend.
[40:55] A: Right. Good job. Good details. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[40:58] B: Now I'm crying, right?
[41:00] A: Good.
[41:00] B: No, she's my only friend.
[41:01] A: All right, good. Then what happened next? I go home, right. Then what happened?
[41:07] B: My dad's asking what's wrong, right? See me crying, right?
[41:10] A: And I'm like, you tell them that. What? All that stuff.
[41:14] B: The kids think I have hiv, right. And he's like, what? B.
[41:17] A: Right.
[41:17] B: So two weeks later.
[41:18] A: Yes.
[41:19] B: He makes me a doctor's appointment.
[41:20] A: Right. Good job with detail. Right.
[41:21] B: To get tested.
[41:22] A: Right. And it comes back negative. Right.
[41:25] B: But it's still the thing I show the class, right?
[41:27] A: Here you go. Right, Good. But they're still going to make fun of you. Yeah, they still.
[41:31] B: Oh, you want that?
[41:32] A: And then, and then that was over.
[41:34] B: That was over.
[41:34] A: And then later on you did something more fun, you know, anytime from, you know, 7, 8 until yesterday to yesterday.
[41:41] B: Yeah.
[41:41] A: What's something you've done that was more fun than that?
[41:47] B: I could tell my story. I don't know. I can't use that.
[41:51] A: Well, something you did recently. Well, I mean, you were cooking. You got to see your kids. Yeah, right.
[41:56] B: Okay.
[41:56] A: That was more fun than that, wasn't it?
[41:57] B: Yeah.
[41:58] A: Getting clean. Getting clean, right?
[41:59] B: Getting clean. Yeah, I use that.
[42:01] A: Right. Way, way more fun than that. Yeah. Right. Coming here. Coming here, Right?
[42:06] B: Yes.
[42:06] A: So we got. Coming here, we got, you know, getting clean, we got cooking, we got. Seeing the kids. Yes, right.
[42:13] B: Growing.
[42:14] A: Right. Then before that, like, you know, they were still making fun of you and then they. You had showed.
[42:20] B: Some people still think the same thing. The ones I went to school, they still think that to the thing, right?
[42:24] A: Of course. Right.
[42:25] B: Ignorances.
[42:27] A: Well, good thing you've never had to use the anti rejection resins, Right.
[42:30] B: Oh my God.
[42:33] A: You've done pretty great without him. And that's pretty amazing. A case like that to last as long and look as healthy as you do. I mean, like, that's pretty darn amazing. Right? But see, you can remember all that happening, right? And you can remember them saying all.
[42:53] B: Of that whispering, Right.
[42:55] A: So the weird thing is, would it have mattered whether it was you or somebody else whose mom had died and the teacher had said how? How? Probably Also not the greatest thing with teacher.
[43:11] B: Right?
[43:12] A: Hey, I'm gonna, you know, hang out to dry. You ready for it by the Way, we're just, like, letting the class know because, like, this is a heavy and hard thing. You know, we're trying to have sympathy for you. Oh, by the way, what was the.
[43:26] B: Point of her telling the class that?
[43:28] A: Right?
[43:28] B: Like, she didn't ask for my permission or nothing?
[43:32] A: Right. That was fired. That was impertinent. She got fired.
[43:36] B: Yes, she got fired.
[43:37] A: Yeah. My dad went to school because that was not an okay thing to do. Right, Right. But again, would it have mattered whether it was you or somebody else in the same situation?
[43:48] B: Would it matter?
[43:49] A: Yeah, Like. Like, think about it. So I'll give you a different example. Think of a kid in the cafeteria, just picked up his, you know, grilled cheese and tomato soup. He's got his little carton of milk, a bag of chips, tiny little cookies walking towards the table. It happens to trip and fall. Right now he lands, makes a loud noise, the tray.
[44:07] B: I'm not gonna laugh.
[44:08] A: It splatters. Right. The cafeteria, which was once bustling with lots of loud noises and kids talking, is completely silent as everybody turns to look to see the kids fall down. And of course, the group mob mentality, they're all going to start laughing. Some of them are, right? Whatever. The kid is mortified. Like, absolutely mortified. Like, everybody's laughing at me. Where is Harry Potter's invisibility Cook? Right here. So that's going on. So that kid, when it's all happening, is totally feeling like it's about me. And it is.
[44:49] B: That's how I feel about you.
[44:50] A: Right. But would it have mattered whether it was that kid or any other kid in the school having that same accident? Isn't that what they would have done in the cafeteria with group? Right, Got it. So that earlier you felt like it had something to do with you. Had nothing to do with you. It had everything to do with that teacher. Because here's the other part. Canaries are beautiful birds, right? And they all get along flawlessly. So if they're all in, like, a big place where they will get along great until one gets sick or one gets injured, do you know what they then do to it? Pack it to death?
[45:37] B: How do I know that? I don't. I think I.
[45:40] A: So you got that. What was going on in that had to do with the mob, not you? Does that make sense? So when the teacher did that, it was all then group mob mentality. Just like there was a. A injured bird and they all pecked it to death. Okay, Right. The mob. And then it was a really difficult thing. And you didn't have a. And that's a scary thing.
[46:21] B: Okay, I get it. I get it.
[46:23] A: Makes sense.
[46:24] B: Yes.
[46:25] A: So that's why they all came at you. And it wouldn't have mattered whether it was B or David, whose parent died of aids. And the teacher said that. And the kids would have been that way with them. Makes sense. You didn't know that when you were that young. So close your eyes. Picture the younger you first. Let her know that moment and that though that experience is over, finished, completed, no longer exists, that that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with the mob mentality and that teacher. It's not about me. Because it wouldn't matter whether it was you or somebody else in the identical situation. That's what they would have done. Right. So that she gets. It's not about me. Let that you know that you turned out okay. Right. Let her know about her kids getting back in contact with them, being a mom. Let her know about getting clean and sober. Let her know about cooking. Let her know so that she's getting it. And as it's happening. What are you noticing now? Hmm?
[47:44] B: A release.
[47:46] A: A release? Yeah. Uh huh.
[47:50] B: Emptiness.
[47:52] A: Yeah. Try to feel really hurt.
[47:58] B: Try to feel hurt.
[47:59] A: Yeah. By that.
[48:02] B: That's over and done with.
[48:03] A: Right. But try to feel really hurt by it.
[48:06] B: I can't.
[48:07] A: Yeah, Right.
[48:12] B: I can't. No.
[48:13] A: Right. And even that friend was about the mob. Not you.
[48:17] B: Not me. Yep.
[48:19] A: Right. Okay. Right. H. Isn't that cool? We love HS because they're curious.
[48:35] B: Right?
[48:36] A: Right. Because curious means I'm noticing something that's changed. I'm noticing what's changing. And I can only be curious in the present moment. Yeah. What are you noticing for yourself?
[49:02] B: Oh, I'm lighter, not heavy.
[49:06] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[49:15] B: I'm not dwelling on nothing.
[49:18] A: Notice how that's not hurting. Right? Yeah. Because you're doing the right thing. You keep checking in with it. No, you do. You keep checking in with it. Yeah.
[49:33] B: Like, am I gonna feel somewhere about it or.
[49:36] A: Right. So keep checking in with it and notice what you're noticing.
[49:40] B: I don't feel. No way.
[49:41] A: I know. Notice how that's different than it's ever been.
[49:44] B: Right. Easy going.
[49:48] A: Yeah. We like it when that happens. When it's different than it's ever been.
[49:51] B: Right?
[49:56] A: Yeah.
[49:57] B: It's like I feel. I feel like the noodles that were stuck to me are now falling off me.
[50:03] A: They are, aren't they?
[50:04] B: Yeah.
[50:04] A: Yeah. Right? Yeah. That's a good breath too. Like, how are we doing this so fast?
[50:22] B: Yeah. Like, what's Happening here.
[50:24] A: Right. How is it happening so fast? You have a really resourceful unconscious mind. You're really interested in life working better for you.
[50:35] B: Of course I am.
[50:36] A: Yeah. Right.
[50:41] B: Because I want to be. I want to be something better.
[50:45] A: Right.
[50:45] B: Than the same.
[50:46] A: Right. So think about, you know, one of those times where you really had to turn a trick because you were like really jonesing to get the most money because you needed the drugs, because you were like really like at the effect of it.
[50:58] B: So think of a time, right?
[51:00] A: And it was a guy that you wouldn't have really wanted to do it with, but like you could not do it with because you really needed the money, because you really needed the drugs or maybe even had the drugs that you got high with them and then had to do the thing with them or whatever it was. And as you think about any one of those times, try to feel the.
[51:21] B: You know, I don't know, was I supposed to laugh just then or what? But that it was just funny to me just then.
[51:33] A: Right.
[51:34] B: Because I named all my people Tom or Joe.
[51:37] A: Tom or Joe. Oh, good. Perfect.
[51:43] B: Cuz I never knew their names.
[51:45] A: You're Tom. You're Joe.
[51:46] B: Yeah.
[51:46] A: How'd you decide which one was going to be Tom or Joe?
[51:49] B: Depends on the size. Joe was fat, Tom was skinny.
[51:52] A: There we go.
[51:57] B: Seriously? Seriously, man.
[52:00] A: It's just. That's a great way to do it. Categorize.
[52:06] B: I used to have time, number one, number two, number three, number four. It was just crazy.
[52:10] A: Yeah.
[52:11] B: I remember one time me writing down my list when I was 14 years old, of all the people I had.
[52:16] A: Sex with and was not good, it was not good. That meaning that there are many.
[52:22] B: It was many times.
[52:24] A: It was just. Or just not good sex.
[52:26] B: It was just not good. Period. Period. It was just. Oh man, I wish this is over with, you know? But I just thought of a time when it was just with somebody that I did not want to do it with. I needed the money.
[52:39] A: Yeah.
[52:39] B: I know the money's gonna be good.
[52:40] A: Right.
[52:43] B: And I don't feel disgusted, I just feel like.
[52:47] A: Right, well, check. Is it appealing?
[52:50] B: Is it appealing?
[52:51] A: Yeah. No. Right?
[52:52] B: No, it's not.
[52:53] A: So notice how it's not disgusting because it's not about that. Doesn't have that thing anymore. It's not disgusting because it's not happening. Because there's nothing to do.
[53:02] B: Right?
[53:04] A: Right. But I'm also not having feelings.
[53:11] B: I'm just having like not happy feelings, but whatever.
[53:17] A: Right. Indifferent. Yeah, Right. It's my favorite line. I may, I may have told it to you before, But. But whether politics or not, I thought it was funny when Donald Trump said that Camila Harris was, you know, first saying that she was Asian. Now she's saying that she's black. Okay, so that's a great line.
[53:36] B: Yeah.
[53:37] A: And Camila Harris's response to that was, that's nonsense.
[53:42] B: Right?
[53:42] A: It's nonsense. Like, I'm not even answering that. This nonsense, like, I'm not even gay. It's nonsense. So. So that's the thing. Like, oh, well, think about, you know, like, going out and getting some money from some guy. Maybe you only have to give, like, you know, a little. You don't have to do a whole thing. But, you know, like, the money might be good. Right. And trying to be like, oh, no, that's really what I want to do. No, that's nonsense.
[54:04] B: Yeah. Yes, I get it.
[54:06] A: Yeah.
[54:07] B: Okay.
[54:08] A: Right. Because that's not me. Even though that had been stuff that I did for a good chunk of period of time, that's not me.
[54:15] B: So somebody come to me and be like, remember when you used to. I could just say, that's not me. Yeah, that was the body.
[54:24] A: That's not me.
[54:25] B: I could just say, that wasn't me.
[54:26] A: Yeah, yeah. That's not me. That's not who I am now.
[54:32] B: Right.
[54:32] A: Yeah, I'm done with that part.
[54:35] B: Been done with that.
[54:36] A: Yeah. Right.
[54:38] B: Cool.
[54:40] A: Right. And that's really more about creating a new network, because all the old network will see you the way you were and aren't going to be supportive of who you are now and who you're becoming. Right. So it's about creating new networks of people that are my supports, that are more healthy, that are all of them. Right. I know. At least my experience in working with survivors is the women who do best are women who create connections with other women, with advocates, mentors, other volunteers. Right. They create connections. So they're creating a community that's supportive of who they're becoming. Right, right.
[55:36] B: That's like my mentor.
[55:38] A: Right. We grow up and we grow up in our country, not like other countries where we're like, you know, nuclear family, small kind of thing. I don't have, like, the extension. But then we all have the sayings, it takes a village. So we want to put the right, you know, community around us by creating connections with people. Right. And connection is literally the opposite of addiction.
[56:06] B: That's true. I read that somewhere.
[56:08] A: Right. It's the opposite of addiction. There's a great Jonathan Height, he's a researcher that did a YouTube or TEDx talk about that. And it's fascinating about that.
[56:20] B: Nation's opposite of addiction.
[56:22] A: Yeah.
[56:22] B: Do you mind if I eat my lollipop?
[56:24] A: Eat your lollipop.
[56:26] B: I have a lollipop.
[56:30] A: Who comes into the office and eats a lollipop? Me.
[56:36] B: I don't know who comes in the office.
[56:40] A: I'm the first to ever eat a lollipop.
[56:43] B: For real? For real?
[56:44] A: I think so. I mean, like, how do you eat a lollipop? A lollipop is something that you don't eat. Right. You're not gonna be like, I am.
[56:53] B: I want to show you.
[56:56] A: All right. I gotta.
[56:57] B: I'm gonna get a few licks out of it.
[56:59] A: You're like the owl. How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Poppy? Licks it three times and chomps it. I guess it takes three.
[57:11] B: You're funny. So I like that.
[57:17] A: Yeah. Right. So come on. Keep checking in with all that stuff, right? Because that's what really. What we. We're just doing multiple iterations to continue to check in with what you notice that's different in terms of how you're feeling.
[57:45] B: I don't know, Dr. Q.
[57:51] A: Oh. As you're checking down right. In the feelings, what are you noticing?
[57:58] B: My mind's erased a little bit. It's. It's blurred, right?
[58:05] A: I don't know.
[58:06] B: I'm telling you, that's what it is.
[58:07] A: But, yeah.
[58:09] B: I don't know.
[58:10] A: It's blurred.
[58:11] B: Yeah.
[58:11] A: It's not so sharp.
[58:12] B: Right. Is not.
[58:17] A: Not so meaningful.
[58:18] B: Yeah.
[58:19] A: It's becoming more distanced.
[58:21] B: Yeah. Way.
[58:23] A: It's changed locations.
[58:25] B: Yeah.
[58:26] A: You don't see it in the same place you used to.
[58:29] B: My mind is blank right now, actually.
[58:31] A: Isn't that interesting?
[58:32] B: Yeah.
[58:32] A: Yeah. Well, that is because you're present.
[58:37] B: But when I leave, it's not gonna be there anymore. Because when I left the last time, it wasn't there. I didn't feel the way I felt when I first came in. Like I had so much weight on my shoulders.
[58:50] A: Right. You know, I do. I remember.
[58:52] B: Yeah.
[58:53] A: Yeah.
[58:54] B: Even my psychiatrist doctor that I've seen today, he was like, wow, I see a glow. I see a bit. I see something better in you. I don't know if it's the medication or what. I'm like, no, I think I see Dr. Q just that one time.
[59:08] A: Yeah.
[59:09] B: He's like, well, keep it up.
[59:13] A: I'm going back. If they ever bring me.
[59:15] B: Yeah, Right. I knew my music was today too. I knew it was, but.
[59:20] A: And I come up. I'm like, where's B? What the hell?
[59:23] B: Yeah, I knew my B was today. I thought it was, but I actually really did think it was tomorrow, but I knew it was today. Does that make sense? Like, my gut feeling was telling me it was today, but then my mom was like, my mind was telling me that it was tomorrow.
[59:36] A: Yeah. Yeah. Right. So those kinds of things feel really different. What does it feel like to, you know, think of you as the mom, you know, ready to provide some accurate education and maybe even some, you know, pads in a Ziploc so that she can have that in the side of her backpack when she goes to school?
[59:57] B: H. I'm ready for it.
[60:00] A: Yeah.
[60:00] B: This weekend. They come in to see me this weekend.
[60:02] A: Well, there you go.
[60:03] B: And I'm going to sit her down. I'm going to take her to the bathroom.
[60:07] A: That's.
[60:07] B: This is how I sit. This is how I plan in my mind. Take her to the bathroom. I'm already going to have a pads in a. In a Ziploc bag. And I'm like, here, I want you to take this. I want you to take this. And. Because you might need it in the future and I'm sure how to use it, and talk to her. And she asked me why. I'm like, well, because this is what girls.
[60:29] A: Right.
[60:30] B: Yeah. I feel more confident telling her that now than I did before I walked in here.
[60:37] A: Right.
[60:37] B: You know?
[60:38] A: Right.
[60:42] B: It has to happen now or never.
[60:45] A: Well, it's an opportunity.
[60:47] B: Yeah.
[60:48] A: It's not a have to. It's an opportunity to educate your kid. That, you know, will be really helpful for her to know. True. Right.
[61:00] B: Then I gotta talk to my son about his anger. I don't have anger issues anymore. So the best thing I could tell him is to breathe when he's angry before he becomes angry. I don't know. That's the best thing I could tell him.
[61:20] A: Well, you can teach him some things about breathing, Right? The stuff that we talk about. Lowering the jaw, resting the tongue, breathing a little bit slower and deeper, opening up when the vision is no longer narrowed and tunneled. Because that's what happens when I'm angry, right? And it's expanded. It settles my system down.
[61:46] B: That's what happens to me, though. That's weird you said that. Because it's so hard for me to get angry now. I don't see this. I see this.
[61:55] A: Yeah.
[61:56] B: You know, and I see that. I try to see the bigger picture of everything, you know, and I'm trying to just see what's right in front of Me.
[62:05] A: Right.
[62:05] B: You know, so maybe that's what I could tell him. Don't look for what's right in front of you. Look for the outside.
[62:12] A: Yeah, well, when he's starting to get frustrated, he's got to open up his field of vision.
[62:18] B: See, he's 10, but I think he's in therapy, too.
[62:22] A: I don't know whether he's getting any of this.
[62:24] B: No. Yeah. I don't know if he's getting what you're. What you're telling me, so maybe I can pass that on. But I know my dad said he's in therapy.
[62:29] A: Yeah.
[62:30] B: So.
[62:32] A: Huh.
[62:34] B: All my kids are in therapy.
[62:35] A: That's probably good.
[62:36] B: Yeah.
[62:37] A: Where. Who are they all with? Are they with dad?
[62:40] B: All my dad.
[62:41] A: Okay.
[62:42] B: My dad has one.
[62:43] A: Does dad have a significant other?
[62:45] B: No, he's single.
[62:46] A: Okay.
[62:46] B: So he's taking care of four kids by himself. Damn, he's doing a great job. Yeah, he's doing a great job. Especially when I've seen him. Yes, ma'am. No, ma'am. Yes, sir. No, sir. I mean, they were saying that when I had them too, but now it's like they don't miss a beat on it. Yeah, they're growing. They're doing more things that kids are doing. You know, they look healthy.
[63:13] A: That's good.
[63:14] B: Yeah.
[63:15] A: So that gives me relief.
[63:17] B: Yeah, they give me a big relief, like. Yeah, I don't have to worry about them anymore. Yeah, I can focus on me. On me.
[63:24] A: Yeah.
[63:24] B: What I need to work on.
[63:27] A: Yeah. Is there any stuff, residual stuff for you with that at all?
[63:35] B: Well, I just wish he would have told me selling my body was wrong instead of encouraging it. Well, he didn't encourage. I don't think he knew. Maybe he didn't know. But then I go back and think, like, he's 60 something years old. Of course he knew I was getting his money and bringing it to him. I'm in a car, not trying to be racial, but in a car with an older white dude. Older. I mean, this dude is 73 years old, you know, so he has to know something I'm not just. He knows.
[64:04] A: He saw you in a car with.
[64:06] B: The older dude, pull up and drop money off to my dad when I was in jail all the time. And I wish he would have just like, hey, B, what you doing with this old man? No, that's wrong. You know what I'm saying? And maybe I would have looked at it differently, you know, but instead my dad was encouraging it because he was like, oh, call Keith. You know this. Maybe Keith would do it. No, because he would do everything for me. Like my kid's birthday, Christmas, any holiday. He took care for me. Cause I was in jail, you know? And I just wish my dad would be like, b, that's wrong. You know, whatever you're doing with that man is wrong.
[64:43] A: But that wasn't until later.
[64:45] B: Right. That's. I was 22 years old.
[64:49] A: Right. When you already had kids. Right, right.
[64:51] B: But with the other guys, I would never bring my. I would never bring guys around my dad.
[64:55] A: Right, right. That guy was different.
[64:58] B: Right. How was he different? What do you mean different?
[65:01] A: Your dad didn't know all of what was going on when you were growing up.
[65:06] B: He could have. Oh, yeah, yeah. You're right.
[65:07] A: Right. He didn't know all of what was going on. Right, right. He did know some.
[65:12] B: He thought I was smoking dope.
[65:15] A: Right.
[65:15] B: But I wasn't.
[65:16] A: Yeah.
[65:17] B: I wasn't.
[65:18] A: No sucky to go to the casino and gamble all your money away, by the way. They wouldn't let you take the winnings anyway.
[65:26] B: I had to have somebody else do it.
[65:28] A: Yeah.
[65:30] B: And I had a fake ID at one point in time, so.
[65:32] A: Perfect, Right?
[65:34] B: Terrible. Terrible.
[65:37] A: Yeah, but so the older guy was. When you were an adult. Right, but. And that guy would give. And gave money for support for your kids or presents or.
[65:51] B: Or Right.
[65:52] A: While you were in jail.
[65:53] B: Right.
[65:53] A: I see. Okay.
[65:56] B: And when I. When I got out of jail, he would. Anything I needed, like clothes or, you know, cars. He bought all my cars. He bought my first house. You know, all I had to do was one thing, and that was make him happy, you know, so why not? You know, that's how I looked at it. But then I was like, damn, I'm taking advantage of this guy, you know, this older guy. I'm not really giving him what he.
[66:21] A: Wants, but what does he want? Of course.
[66:26] B: So 73. I would never guess a 70. Maybe he was 74. He's 74 now. Yeah, 70. He's 74 now. We'll want that, you know, but, hey, what would you. For millions of dollars, you know what I'm saying? It's not just little chunk change. He buying cars. He bought a house like the. The house that my dad was standing. Before he bought. Before my dad bought this house was the house that was mine. You know what I'm saying? That. That this guy bought. So, yeah, I gave him up. Before I came to Sailor. I gave him up to somebody else. I passed him on because I know I don't want to do that.
[67:06] A: You said Keith here's Jenny. Jenny, here's Keith.
[67:09] B: You guys, I don't want to explain. I explained to Jenny that I'm done with that lifestyle and this is not what I want.
[67:15] A: Keith's kink is this little thing and.
[67:18] B: And really, I mean it wasn't good but you know, hey, I mean if that's going to keep him happy and alive. Cuz he had cancer three times since he been in my life, you know what I'm saying? So if that's a girl's going to keep you happy, why not? Here you go. So I kind of held a resentment with my dad for that.
[67:38] A: But how about right now? Is there a little bit of it still?
[67:41] B: A little. It's not a whole lot, but it's a little bit.
[67:43] A: Yeah. So would it be okay to get that gone?
[67:46] B: It would be. Maybe I could love my dad more.
[67:48] A: Because you were thinking that dad should have been a better dad earlier.
[67:51] B: Right now.
[67:54] A: No, not now. He's being a good dad.
[67:56] B: Well, not when he says you should call Keith and tell Keith to get you this and that. That's not being a good dad.
[68:02] A: Right now.
[68:03] B: Right now.
[68:03] A: He's saying that now.
[68:04] B: He's saying that when I was in jail before I got to say now.
[68:10] A: Right now he's being a good dad cuz he's taking care of your four kids.
[68:14] B: Yes, he's been an awesome dad. He's been awesome dad.
[68:16] A: Right now.
[68:17] B: Right now.
[68:18] A: When you were in jail, you hadn't finished the life, right?
[68:22] B: That's true.
[68:23] A: So that's. Why go to the guy that's into life. That's the whole point of it.
[68:27] B: That's true.
[68:28] A: Don't get it from me.
[68:29] B: Why not Tell me B. Get out that lifestyle, you know?
[68:33] A: Yes. How long did it take you to.
[68:37] B: Get out the lifestyle?
[68:38] A: How old are you now?
[68:39] B: I'm 31.
[68:40] A: Huh.
[68:40] B: I started when I was 13.
[68:41] A: Yeah, that's some years, right? So the resentment is in dad having been a better dad and maybe had prevented or stopped me or told me that it was wrong.
[68:54] B: But what I would have, I asked myself, would I would have listened to him if he would have told me to stop, you know what I'm saying? And myself says no. So I can't, I really can't hold my dad accountable. But I am, you know, because he had to know something was going on. He had to know I was doing something like my mom, you know, and he always said you're gonna be just like your mom. You know what I'm saying?
[69:17] A: So your mom had been.
[69:19] B: She Was a trick. Him and her were tricks. That's how they had me, you know? And. Yeah, that's what she was. That's how she died. She had hiv, so her aids, she.
[69:31] A: Had four dad was the trick. Her tom.
[69:35] B: Yeah, her tom. Yeah.
[69:37] A: Got it. And then she got pregnant with me.
[69:40] B: And my dad was in prison. My mom found out she was sick. My dad was in prison, and he found out that I was his child.
[69:48] A: Your dad was in prison. Okay, so that's was weird.
[69:52] B: Right? Right.
[69:53] A: So good. All right, so let's get this laid out, clear. Because we can look back and we can have all sorts of resentments towards dad for having not been a better dad then because I can conceive of, if he had been, maybe I wouldn't have gone this way. Right. Like. So that's where that comes from. So the first question is, if you're no longer resentful, does that in any way, shape or form excuse dad's behavior, her dad's absence in that.
[70:27] B: No.
[70:28] A: Does it mean dad not being there was okay?
[70:33] B: No.
[70:33] A: Right, Got it. So you being okay right now, B. Doesn't mean how he was and what he didn't do was okay.
[70:42] B: Right.
[70:42] A: It's not like he gets off.
[70:44] B: Right.
[70:45] A: We still get that that wasn't okay. Right. Him not being more involved. Right. But you being okay, no longer troubled by his lack of or shitty parenting.
[70:59] B: Right? Right.
[71:00] A: That doesn't mean that his shitty parenting was okay. You just get to be okay now. Got it. So the third thing is, in human beings, we can conceive of alternative outcomes to stuff that's already over. Right. So I can. You are like the owl. There's a garbage right over there. You don't have to put it in there. So I liken it to. If we can conceive of alternatives to something that's already over. Think of this guy. A year ago, his brother had asked him to go on a motorcycle ride. He never went, and his brother died. So he's got a tremendous amount of guilt. And he thinks he's feeling the guilt because he should have gone on the ride, but he's not actually feeling the guilt because he should have gone on the ride. He's feeling the guilt because intellectually, he can conceive of having gone on the ride. And if he had, his brother might still be alive. That would be better. So here's where the problem is. His intellectual part can do that. His emotional brain works more like an animal. And an animal can't conceive of doing something it can't do. It's why porcupines aren't trying to build hang gliders to fly. Got it. So for an animal's brain, they live that if I can think it, that means I can do it. So where the problem arises is his intellect is conceiving of having gone on the ride a year ago. And if he had, right? So his emotional brain goes, well, hurry. Go on the ride a year ago. Do it. What are you waiting for? Can he actually do it? Got it. So when our brain gets either A, that the experience no longer exists, or B, that there's nothing to be done, it stops causing the feeling. Got it. So that's what we want to get in. Because I could simply say to you, well then, hurry. Get your dad to be a better dad when you were nine, quick. And you could say back to me, there's nothing to be done. So say there's nothing to be done. No. Get him to be a better dad when you're 11. Hurry. Say there's nothing to be done. No. Hurry. What are you waiting for? Get him to be a better dad at 14.
[73:32] B: There's nothing.
[73:32] A: Come on, we'll go.
[73:33] B: Let's get him to be a better night.
[73:34] A: Hurry.
[73:34] B: There's nothing to be done.
[73:35] A: Why? Cuz it no longer exists.
[73:37] B: Yeah, right.
[73:38] A: Now, Chad, what do you notice?
[73:42] B: There's nothing that can be done.
[73:44] A: Right? And the last part to this is that you back then thought that dad was well and then would be more capable of doing something. But if we look at dad, Dad's not a guy who's 100% mentally emotionally stable and well, right? He went to prison, he a prostitute and had a baby. Like dad had his own, right? Like whatever.
[74:11] B: He was in recovery.
[74:12] A: He was in recovery, right? Dad had his own stuff, right? Dad was doing all he could to keep his own together, right?
[74:20] B: That's true.
[74:20] A: Do you follow me with that? Like dad didn't have a huge capacity. Dad's life wasn't like, boom, great for him. So he had a lot of capacity to help others. Dad was fucking holding on, trying to get his own straight.
[74:31] B: That's true.
[74:32] A: Makes sense.
[74:32] B: Now he's a deacon in church, right? Cuz he got his together, right?
[74:39] A: Yeah, he didn't have it then, he's better now. That had nothing to do with you. That had everything to do with him. Had nothing to do with his lack of love, care or concern for you. Had everything to do with him being screwed up then, Right? Got it. You didn't know any of that. So again, close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You. And let her know that's over and finished. That that no longer exists. That it's not about me. It's about him not being well. Right. Let her know that you turned out. Let her know how he turned out. Better now. Taking care of your kids. A deacon in the church. Let her know. Right? That's right. What are you noticing now?
[75:30] B: He's going away off my shoulders.
[75:33] A: It is, isn't it?
[75:34] B: Yeah.
[75:34] A: Isn't that nice?
[75:44] B: And Dad's okay with me? He's okay? Yeah.
[75:49] A: He's okay with you?
[75:50] B: Yeah. Like, he's. Like he's all right with me.
[75:53] A: He's all right by you?
[75:54] B: Yeah.
[75:55] A: Yeah. Yeah. Right. And although we wish he had been a better dad then, we're really glad he's a better dad now.
[76:07] B: Right. Because he had little kids.
[76:09] A: Yeah. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah, that is cool. Yeah. Right. You can notice how things are changing inside. Right. It's not feeling the same. Right. All these new insights. All these new things keep popping. Yeah. Were you living with mom when you were little?
[76:55] B: I was.
[76:56] A: You were? Until she got really sick. Or until she got really sick and then you went to live with dad. Okay. As you think about mom now, is there stuff there?
[77:12] B: She did the best she could. Yeah. She did the best she could. I mean, she was strict on us. She had boundaries with us, you know? Yeah. She did the best she could. My dad did the best he could have, too.
[77:28] A: Yeah.
[77:29] B: You know, so I can't really. That's why I keep telling myself I can't really fault him for whatever. I'm probably resenting who I was.
[77:37] A: Go check. See if there's resentment now.
[77:39] B: There's not. I already checked it. That's all I did.
[77:44] A: Right. What was that?
[77:46] B: I even gave my dad a hug for the first time.
[77:49] A: Wow.
[77:49] B: He brought the kids.
[77:50] A: Yeah.
[77:51] B: Because I seen my kids and I seen the glow in their eyes, you know? He's not telling my kids nothing bad about me.
[77:57] A: Right.
[77:57] B: You know what I'm saying? He's not turning my kids away from me. Even though he adopted my kids.
[78:02] A: Yeah.
[78:03] B: Like when he's going to adopt him this month and they still love their mom, you know, no matter what. I don't care how far, how long I'm gone. They still love me no matter what.
[78:14] A: Yeah.
[78:14] B: And he's. I like that he's not. Because, you know, most parents. Well, I've seen parents in the past, they'll turn the kids away from their parent, their. Their original parents, you know, and my dad doesn't haven't done that.
[78:25] A: Yeah.
[78:29] B: But with my mom, I just feel like she should never gave us up, you know. I feel like she should have pushed a little harder for us. Like me and my brothers. Oh, I just met my. By my mom's son Sunday.
[78:49] A: Wow.
[78:50] B: Haven't seen him in years.
[78:51] A: Wow.
[78:52] B: And the last. Last time I seen. I was so bitter to him. So bitter. Like I was better than him, which I wasn't. I was on drugs and looking a hot mess. But I still like I was better than him because I had a car, I had a place. He stayed on the streets. But I feel like that was his life. That's what he chose to do because he's easier to have to. Because I gave him places to stay and he was still from them or whatever, you know, not wanting to bathe and just poor hygiene all over.
[79:20] A: That guy wasn't well either.
[79:21] B: No, he wasn't. And guess what? He's in a program just like me. He's eight months clean. I'm six months clean, you know. Yeah. That's all I got is him. And I want to have contact with him and it's going to hurt me if they say I can't have contact with him.
[79:39] A: Who is he?
[79:40] B: He's my brother. That's my. My mom's son. Not on my dad's side, but my mom's side. So I don't know how I. I just. I haven't seen him in years. But when I seen him, he looks exactly like me. I'm the.
[79:53] A: Where'd you see him at?
[79:54] B: Celebrate Recovery.
[79:55] A: Oh, fun.
[79:56] B: Yeah. So he's actually not even like he's turning his life around. He's into God. He's doing what the program said. He has a job, he has a phone, you know. He's doing good. Yeah, he's doing very good. I'm proud of him.
[80:10] A: Yeah.
[80:10] B: He's older. He's 34. I'm 31, so.
[80:13] A: Okay.
[80:14] B: But I talked to him like he's my little brother.
[80:17] A: Yeah.
[80:19] B: But yeah. So.
[80:20] A: Huh.
[80:23] B: So that is something that happened. Excited.
[80:26] A: Yeah.
[80:26] B: Very exciting.
[80:27] A: Yeah. So he would be somebody that you're interested in becoming a safe contact?
[80:34] B: Yes.
[80:34] A: Okay.
[80:35] B: Yes. I'm going to talk to Deb about it tomorrow.
[80:39] A: Okay.
[80:41] B: See if she allow. Cuz he's in recovery.
[80:43] A: Yeah.
[80:44] B: So let's see if she's allows it.
[80:46] A: Yeah. I don't know how they make those rules.
[80:49] B: I don't think she's going to allow it.
[80:51] A: I stay my lane.
[80:52] B: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
[80:54] A: I take the Lane that I'm in. I do the stuff that I'm good at doing.
[80:57] B: Yeah.
[80:57] A: And everybody else can do the other stuff, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So what, what else are you noticing for yourself now, Pete?
[81:07] B: I'm happy. I. I used to be like a stuck up. Not stuck up, but stuck in my ways. Stubborn. That's the word. Stubborn. I used to be a stubborn person. Now in the mornings, I. I'm not so angry. I'm more happy going, hey, good morning. Good morning. You know, I'm that type of person in the mornings where I used to be like, good morning, good morning. You know, I'm more open. I'm open minded now. I'm very open minded. I'm open to anything now. Anything that's going to teach me.
[81:42] A: Yeah. So you're interested in learning.
[81:47] B: Yeah.
[81:47] A: And becoming a better version of you.
[81:49] B: Yes, I am trying to be a better version of you. I'm not trying. I am.
[81:53] A: You are. Yeah. Right. You're doing it.
[81:55] B: Yeah.
[81:55] A: Right? Yeah.
[81:58] B: And I think it's part of me coming to therapy too, with you and with Aaron.
[82:03] A: Yeah. She's great. She is great. Yeah, she is.
[82:06] B: She just sit there and just look at you and wait till you start talking. Because I'm not a talkative person, but I'm willing to listen.
[82:16] A: Sure.
[82:17] B: You know?
[82:17] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So kind of scan back through the experiences. They be grief, loss, whether they be hurt, pain, whether they be resentment, whether they be abuse, neglect, whether they be violent sex stuff, whether they be.
[82:39] B: I remember me using, used to fight for no reason. I used to pick a fight for no reason, you know, for no reason at all. Just cause. Just because. Yeah.
[82:53] A: You ready to go down?
[82:56] B: You want to do it? What you looking at?
[82:58] A: I ain't no holler back, bitch.
[83:04] B: But I look back at it now and it's like I can laugh about it.
[83:08] A: Right.
[83:08] B: You know what I'm saying? I'm not so like, oh, who was that person? But I can laugh about it, you know, I'm not tearing up about it no more.
[83:17] A: Right.
[83:18] B: Whereas before this all. Before all this therapy stuff, I would tear about every little thing.
[83:23] A: Yeah.
[83:23] B: Oh, my God.
[83:24] A: I just used to be so bad, you know, like.
[83:27] B: Just can't believe myself.
[83:29] A: Notice how you're not down on you now. I was just like, okay, because that wasn't ever you. It was just stuff that you had been doing.
[83:37] B: And I knew that too, you know that I knew that because I knew it. Because people would tell me that's not true, you know? And it wasn't just More than one person. It was a couple people telling me, yeah, this. That ain't you be. You need to find who you are. And once you find who you are, then you find the root of everything. So.
[83:59] A: Hard to believe it, though, right?
[84:01] B: How's it hard to believe?
[84:03] A: Well, when people are telling it to you.
[84:05] B: Oh, yeah, yeah. You're right.
[84:06] A: You might hear it, but you don't fully feel it. Right. And then you might even think to yourself, I'm just really good at snowing them. Right. Because if they actually really knew what was going on in here, then they wouldn't be saying that to me.
[84:18] B: Right.
[84:21] A: That's. Yeah, that's what it goes. Because that's what we first go to, where people are like, oh, well, it can't be really true. It must be an imposter. And I'm just really good at snowing people because if they really knew, then they would like snowing people.
[84:37] B: I like that word.
[84:38] A: Yeah. Yeah. But notice how it's now, like, not that at all. No, it's, like, authentic and. Okay.
[84:50] B: It is. Okay.
[84:52] A: Yeah. Cool.
[84:57] B: I like it.
[84:58] A: Me, too. So good, right?
[85:06] B: Yeah.
[85:06] A: Yeah. No more lollipops.
[85:11] B: No more love. So much. Told you I would just char our ligator first a few times and chomp chop.
[85:17] A: Yeah. Gotta do that with those back teeth. You can't do this with those front teeth.
[85:24] B: No, I gotta do it.
[85:25] A: Do it with the front teeth. You might ruin your front teeth.
[85:29] B: That's true.
[85:32] A: Cool. All right. Any other stuff for you that we wanted to do that we haven't gotten to?
[85:41] B: You know, I think we cover the main things. You know, I can't think of nothing off my head right now.
[85:48] A: Okay, cool. All right, then one last time. Just go ahead and slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue. And breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale, exhaling longer than the inhale. And bring your awareness into your breath so that you notice how you're breathing in a way that's a little bit different than how you automatically breathe. That's right. As you're breathing in this way, notice what you can notice with the sounds around you or how it feels to be seen seated in the way you are. Because what we know is that your unconscious knows how to heal and integrate the learnings that have happened in today's session so that it continues to expand and expound in multitudes of different ways. Better now and on the way to so much better, more. And all there is for you to do is just have some awareness of the small little nuance changes that you're noticing in response to stuff. Right. Feeling more free, light more and more. Okay. Fully comfortable in your own skin. That's right. All of this begins to filter and integrate through all of the cells in the body. Healing is occurring at the deepest unconscious levels. So whenever you're ready, and you can absolutely take your time to slowly find your way back up and. And up and up, and then eyes can open. There we go. That's right.
[87:55] B: You know what I seen? I seen a ball spinning.
[87:58] A: Yeah.
[88:00] B: You know the ball I'm talking about? Like, my eyes are closed. I see ball spinning like this.
[88:05] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool? You did great today.
[88:09] B: Thanks.
[88:10] A: Good job.
[88:10] B: Thanks.
[88:11] A: All right, we'll stop with that for now. All right.
