[00:00] A: So today is the 18th of October. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And again, given what we do is useful and valuable, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:14] B: Yes. Okay.
[00:15] A: Awesome. So give me an update. How did our last session leave you? What have you noticed for yourself? How have things been?
[00:21] B: I'm happy.
[00:22] A: Okay.
[00:23] B: For the most part.
[00:24] A: Okay.
[00:26] B: Yeah.
[00:27] A: I mean, we have had a couple hurricanes.
[00:29] B: Yeah.
[00:31] A: Who's that?
[00:32] B: Yeah. New resident.
[00:33] A: Is that hard for you?
[00:34] B: It's hard for me.
[00:35] A: Oh, she's younger. Okay.
[00:36] B: She's 18 years old.
[00:38] A: Oh, yeah. So that's a young, young girl.
[00:41] B: Yeah. So, like, her maturity level is down and it's. It. It bothers me. So I want to talk about it.
[00:49] A: Okay.
[00:49] B: And see if we can work on it.
[00:51] A: You would like to get it so that her maturity level doesn't bother you as much.
[00:55] B: Yeah. And I want to know why it both me as much.
[00:59] A: Well, what if you knew why? Then what?
[01:01] B: Maybe it won't bother me as much.
[01:03] A: You think? So here's the reason that you're bothered. It's because of this. Is this. And then she's still. Right. Seeing that. Weird. Right? Like, you could know why.
[01:13] B: Yeah.
[01:13] A: But it's not really going to change whether you're bothered or not.
[01:16] B: Right.
[01:17] A: Isn't that weird?
[01:17] B: Yeah.
[01:18] A: Yeah. So maybe we don't really care as to how come or why she bothers you. We just want to get it so that she doesn't. Well, her being, however she's going to be, doesn't do this to you.
[01:29] B: Yeah. Like the. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:32] A: Because that's really where the error is. Right. We could say it's her that makes me feel this way. And that's not wrong.
[01:38] B: Right.
[01:39] A: Right. But we can't really do anything to change her.
[01:43] B: Right.
[01:43] A: And it's kind of the kind of person that she is.
[01:47] B: It might not even be her. It might just be the inside of her.
[01:52] A: Well, it could be the kind of way that she does life, presses the buttons in you.
[01:58] B: Right.
[01:59] A: So even if she's gone, there could be a different person that knows how to press those same buttons.
[02:05] B: Right. Right.
[02:06] A: Because in life we can X out all the people we want to, but there's a long line of people ready to press the same damn button. So we want to get it so that the button don't get pressed? Well, no, because we can't prevent them from pressing it.
[02:20] B: Yeah, you're right. You're right. You're right.
[02:22] A: Right. We want to get it so that even if it's pressed, it doesn't cause the response in you. Because the lens that we're going to look through is. It's not her doing whatever she does that causes this in you. It's something your brain does to you in response to that in the same way we said a long time ago, it's not the lion that makes the zebra scared, it's the zebra's brain. Yes. In response to the lion approaching, but it's zebra's brain.
[02:54] B: Right, right.
[02:55] A: Got it. So what do I need to know to understand how this has been for you? And, like, how do you know when to get, like, by her?
[03:06] B: When, when, when I'm. Okay, I'm using. When I'm talking and she tried to make. And I'm talking to you and she chimes in to make herself the spotlight. That makes. That aggravates me.
[03:24] A: Okay.
[03:24] B: Because it's an everyday. It's okay to do it sometimes, but it's every time thing.
[03:30] A: Okay, well, so who might you be talking to?
[03:33] B: You. Me.
[03:34] A: So you're talking to me, right. And she's where?
[03:38] B: She's at the end of the table.
[03:39] A: Okay.
[03:40] B: Okay, I'm gonna use. We're at a dinner table.
[03:42] A: Yeah. So you're at the dinner table. Right. You guys have made dinner.
[03:44] B: Right.
[03:45] A: And there's you and some of the other residents and some of the advocates.
[03:48] B: Right?
[03:48] A: You're all having dinner together.
[03:49] B: Right.
[03:50] A: Breaking Bad.
[03:50] B: And I'm talking to me, and you.
[03:51] A: Are having a conversation. We're having this conversation. Right.
[03:53] B: I'm not involving nobody else.
[03:54] A: Right. So you and me. Right. So you and whoever are having the conversation. Then what happens?
[03:58] B: And then me and you talking.
[04:00] A: Yeah.
[04:01] B: And she chimes in.
[04:02] A: Oh, so she chimes in. Right? Oh, right.
[04:05] B: It makes her satisfied. Spotlight.
[04:07] A: What does that mean?
[04:08] B: Like, makes herself include herself into the conversation.
[04:12] A: Right?
[04:13] B: Like mix it all.
[04:14] A: So think if we're doing that.
[04:15] B: Okay.
[04:16] A: And kind of telling you about, like, well, this is how I. Right. And this is what I was thinking. Right. Good. And as you're seeing her do it right now and hearing that, where are you feeling it in your body?
[04:29] B: All over.
[04:30] A: All over.
[04:32] B: I don't know. It just irks my soul.
[04:35] A: Yeah. So where do you feel the urk?
[04:37] B: Right here.
[04:37] A: Yeah, you feel it here. Good. Now, what we normally do is we don't like these feelings, so we try to get rid of them.
[04:43] B: Right.
[04:44] A: What we want to do is we want to stay with them. Right. Now I Want you to think about those feelings right there where you feel the urk and notice the sensations. Right. Notice them in a way that has you be a little bit curious about how these sensations are going to change. Change. Because sensations are like a wave. They can't stay the same, right? So notice that feeling and notice what you're noticing about how it's changing, even if it's not changing in the way you want it to. Yet. What do you notice in terms of how it's changing?
[05:22] B: It's moving.
[05:23] A: Yeah. Where is it moving?
[05:24] B: To my stomach.
[05:25] A: Oh, now it's dropped down. Right. So now notice it in your stomach. Notice those sensations, right. Get curious about them and even use the sound of curiosity. Go, hmm, Like I'm wondering how the sensations are going to be changing and I'm wondering how I'm noticing them changing. And what do you notice happening? The sensations in your stomach now go.
[05:52] B: Going away.
[05:53] A: Oh, they went away. Where'd they go?
[05:56] B: I don't know.
[05:56] A: Oh, you just don't feel them anymore, right? Oh, isn't that weird? And that a good news thing? So that was our first pass. Let me explain something else to you, okay? So what happens with us human beings is we have a vagus nerve. Vagus nerve is a key nerve because it's a brain nerve. But it also connects only one of the brain nerve that does it to all of the vital organs in our body, so heart and liver and lungs. And it's really interesting, right? When the vagus nerve, when we're in a regular state like we were just in before all that, we were having a conversation, we're talking, you're like, you know, I'm good for the most part, blah, blah, blah, right? That's when you're in the ventral state of the vagus nerve. So that's good for, you know, some communication and regular conversation and all the stuff and your typical self talk is, you know, I'm good, I'm capable, I'm competent, I can handle things, I can do stuff, right. If we get triggered. Like when she jumps in, right? Makes it all about herself, puts the spotlight on her, right? When I get triggered, I get triggered down what we call the dorsal branch of the vagus nerve. When I get triggered down the dorsal branch, that's what activates my fight flight freeze mode. But it also activates the fawn and fold modes, the negative talk, because it becomes a negative talk is all about or I'm a new ditch. Like lots of negative crap.
[07:26] B: Yeah, but I don't have.
[07:27] A: Okay, right? So it's just negative stuff that goes on, but it's all determined by our physiology. Because when that kind of stuff happens, how do we actually want you to be? Because what's the likelihood that the 18 year old isn't going to make whatever's happening about her?
[07:51] B: It's gonna happen.
[07:52] A: It is going to happen.
[07:53] B: Yeah.
[07:55] A: Right. And she doesn't even know that she's doing it.
[07:59] B: I had to point it out to her.
[08:01] A: Right. Because that would be one of those spots that are blind.
[08:05] B: Yeah.
[08:05] A: Like you go, hey, there's this thing behind you. What do you mean.
[08:13] B: It'S true? It's true. Because I had to like point it out to her. She's like, I didn't know, but I see what you're talking about, you know, so.
[08:20] A: Right. Which is the first step of being able to change something is having a little bit of awareness to it. But again, she's 18, so she doesn't have A, a lot of life experience. B, a lot of frontal cortex. Right. Engaged. Right. There's not a lot of long term thinking with 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 year olds. Right. That's why we signed them up to go to the military.
[08:47] B: Right, right.
[08:49] A: Ah, they don't know what they're really getting into.
[08:50] B: Yeah.
[08:51] A: But we'll make you a strong soldier. Okay. Right. The older guys are in the background, the younger guys are out there on the battlefield.
[09:02] B: That's true.
[09:06] A: Got it.
[09:07] B: Okay.
[09:07] A: Okay. So you were gonna say you don't have the negative thoughts? Thoughts. No, It'd be the self talk.
[09:14] B: Yeah. It'd be the subtle.
[09:15] A: Yeah. Like you get like frustrated.
[09:17] B: Right.
[09:17] A: Irritated, annoyed.
[09:19] B: I'd be quiet.
[09:20] A: Right. That's the talk. Right. But that dorsal branch, when we get really triggered can do it. It's all the negative stuff. So if it's something that I've done, then it's gonna be negative about me.
[09:32] B: Right.
[09:33] A: If it's something somebody else done, it's negative about them. Right. So when that kind of thing happens, how do you actually want to be?
[09:44] B: Like when I'm. When you start happening.
[09:47] A: No, when she jumps in.
[09:50] B: I want to be able to handle it. I want to be calm.
[09:53] A: How would you be if you were handling it?
[09:56] B: Calm.
[09:57] A: Calm.
[09:57] B: It won't even bother. I wanted to be where. It don't even bother me. Like I want to be like, say, say she jumps into the conversation. I want to be like where. I don't even. It doesn't even bother me.
[10:08] A: Like. Right.
[10:09] B: Yeah. I can continue on with the conversation, but like now it's Just when she chimes in, it's like, I wasn't even talking to you. You know what I'm saying? And that's kind of rude, and I don't want to be rude.
[10:19] A: Ah, got it. Right, Right. So she jumps in to something that she wasn't involved in.
[10:25] B: Right.
[10:26] A: And then you're annoyed that she did.
[10:28] B: Right.
[10:28] A: And then you're kind of like, I wouldn't even talk to you.
[10:30] B: But right then I stopped myself. I was like, dang, that's kind of rude. And I'm trying to be rude. But it's every time, you know, it's every. It's. Every conversation is like she had to compare herself. It's like a comparing contrast, you know.
[10:44] A: Like you might be sharing something and then she's sharing how hers was or. Or better. Or better.
[10:50] B: Right.
[10:50] A: Any of those.
[10:51] B: Right. And it's just. It's.
[10:54] A: It's like, dang. Oh, you mean she's trying to relate to you.
[10:57] B: Right. Like everything I. Everything I've done, you've done.
[11:01] A: Right. She's trying to relate to you.
[11:03] B: Yeah. I understand. You're 18 years old. I'm 31.
[11:06] A: You can't relate. She's trying to relate to you.
[11:08] B: I understand that. I get it. I get it.
[11:15] A: Yes. But what you're not getting is this other part.
[11:17] B: She's trying to relate to me.
[11:19] A: No, I mean, I could say that Again, say the same thing. I got it. Right. When people are like each other, they like each other.
[11:32] B: Okay?
[11:34] A: Right. The people that you're most tight with as friends, you're most alike.
[11:40] B: Our friends? Well, I mean.
[11:42] A: No, no, not her. I'm saying I want you to get that in general.
[11:45] B: Okay.
[11:45] A: The people that like when you meet, when you're more alike somebody, you like them more. Right. Think about it. Does a Republican talk to a Democrat right now? No. Because we're different people. I don't like you just because you have a different view on who should be president or not.
[12:02] B: Right, Right. That's true.
[12:04] A: Right. I'm pro life, you're pro choice. Okay. Can't have a conversation with you anymore. Right, that's true. Right. But I'm wearing my bucks hat and my buck's jers and you got your buck shirt on. Oh, box. Right. So when people are like each other, they like each other. Got it. So she. Yes. What we said is trying to relate. What we get is that how she's been doing it has been off putting to you, and then you catch yourself going, well, I don't want to be petty and rude back. Right, Right. Even though I know that she doesn't know any better.
[12:44] B: Right? Correct.
[12:45] A: Because she didn't even know that she was doing it. Right. So what's happening now? You're doing good.
[12:55] B: I'm understanding.
[12:56] A: You are, aren't you? Yeah. Yeah.
[13:00] B: Okay.
[13:01] A: Yeah. Right. So let's check. Think about again. Put a scenario together. You might be talking with, like, a coach, or you might be talking one of the advocates. You might be talking one of the volunteers. You might be doing whatever you're doing, and you're having, like, a conversation. You're, like, really in the conversation. As you say something, she, like, jumps in.
[13:23] B: Yeah. Come. She come all from left field.
[13:25] A: Right. All the way from left field. Right.
[13:27] B: And jumps in the conversation.
[13:28] A: Jumps into the conversation. Right. So see, you're coming from my fears now. She's jumped into the conversation. What do you notice inside? Where are you feeling it? Oh, you're not feeling that now? Isn't that weird? You used to be feeling it there, right? Now you're not feeling it and that.
[13:46] B: Weird until it happened, baby.
[13:50] A: I don't know. Because we're doing the same thing.
[13:52] B: Yeah.
[13:53] A: What if you jump from right field? I mean, would it be better if it was from. Instead of being over there? It came from over there.
[14:01] B: No, it wouldn't make a difference.
[14:03] A: It wouldn't. Are you sure?
[14:04] B: Positive.
[14:05] A: No. What if it came from centerfield? What if she just came out of the dugout? No, that wouldn't make a difference. What if she was on first base? Huh?
[14:16] B: Okay. All right. I'm just gonna have to see.
[14:21] A: Isn't that good that left field doesn't just mean left? Right. So think of her. Right? We want you to do the thing that normally happens that gets you annoyed with her, all right? So you can vividly imagine, like, you be in a really good conversation with somebody and you're sharing something about how, like, you did this thing at one time, and then, like, she jumped and said something that's, like, kind of close to what you did, but really not me.
[14:47] B: I got front seats. How do you call it? I got. When you call in the front seat in the car, what do they call it? What do you call it?
[14:56] A: Oh, man.
[14:58] B: Dang.
[15:00] A: Shotgun.
[15:01] B: Shotgun. I got shotgun. Nobody cares about the shotgun but her. You know what I'm saying? Nobody cares about. She'll be waiting in the bathroom, and we'll be getting ready to go get in the car. We know that this is a daily routine. She gets the front seat. You know what I'm saying? But She's. I understand that. She's young. Oh, my gosh. I'm the only child. Okay, Just remind me.
[15:21] A: You're an only child.
[15:22] B: I'm the only child. I was raised just me.
[15:25] A: Okay, I get that.
[15:26] B: So it kind of irks me.
[15:30] A: Good. That's what we want to get to. Right?
[15:32] B: Irks me. You know, when it. When this. When stuff like this happens.
[15:36] A: Yeah.
[15:37] B: Shotgun.
[15:38] A: So that's what she's yelling.
[15:39] B: Way to the bathroom. We already know that this is a daily routine.
[15:43] A: She not. She not out. Outside. You can't call shotgun until you're outside.
[15:46] B: Right. You know what I'm saying? Wait a minute.
[15:48] A: If we're gonna play the rules, we gotta play the rules. You can't call shotgun until you're outside. If I get outside before I call shotgun, I already know.
[15:54] B: We're. We're adults. We know.
[15:56] A: You don't care that you do this every day. You don't care whether you sit in the front seat or not.
[15:59] B: No, I don't care.
[16:00] A: You don't care.
[16:01] B: And we already told her this.
[16:02] A: But she really does. But she really, really clearly. She's calling shotgun from the bathroom.
[16:06] B: Right. And. And we already told her that. Hey, listen, you don't have to call shotgun. We know you want the front seat. You know what I'm saying?
[16:13] A: It really irks our nerves. This is.
[16:15] B: We told it just like that.
[16:16] A: Who. Who's we?
[16:18] B: The girls. Me and the girls.
[16:19] A: You and all the girls.
[16:20] B: All the girls.
[16:21] A: All the girls.
[16:22] B: I'm not the only person that has a problem with this. Okay. But I seem to have the problem the most.
[16:27] A: Okay.
[16:28] B: And I think.
[16:29] A: I think. But so think about her really irking. You feel irked. Shotgun.
[16:37] B: I think I'm traumatized by this.
[16:42] A: Okay. All right. So thank you for doing it.
[16:46] B: I'm already irked.
[16:47] A: Right.
[16:48] B: She just did it coming here.
[16:49] A: Where do you feel it?
[16:50] B: Right here.
[16:51] A: Good. So again, notice the sensations. The second loop. Notice the sensations. Get curious about how the sensations are changing, even if they're not changing in the way you want them to. Right. You can make your eyes big. You can go as it breathes. What did you notice? Notice how it went down?
[17:13] B: Yeah.
[17:14] A: Right. Now you can notice it in your stomach. Get curious about it. Hmm. Right?
[17:23] B: It's still there a little bit.
[17:24] A: It is there. Notice how it's there a little bit. Right. But it's a little bit. And just wait for it. Get curious about how it's changing. Because it's a wave. It can't possibly stay the same. How am I going to notice it changing this time? Is it changing in the same way it did last time, or is it different?
[17:54] B: Okay.
[17:55] A: What do you notice? Oh, it went away. Right. Because how do you actually want to be different? Indifferent. You want to be in different. So it doesn't matter to you what she does or calls out, Right. What would it. What's it like when it doesn't matter to you?
[18:16] B: Awesome.
[18:17] A: It is awesome, right?
[18:20] B: Easy.
[18:21] A: It is easy. So I'm gonna interlock my fingers, right? So I did it where my. This thumb is on top. Okay. But I could do it where this lemon's on top.
[18:32] B: Right.
[18:32] A: Do you care?
[18:33] B: No, it doesn't matter.
[18:34] A: But what if I do it this way?
[18:36] B: What does it matter?
[18:42] A: You got a preference?
[18:44] B: Why does it matter?
[18:46] A: Right. Why does it matter?
[18:49] B: Right.
[18:50] A: That's right.
[18:50] B: That's the difference.
[18:51] A: See? What? See, all we're doing is getting. Why does it matter? It doesn't matter. When you're indifferent, you don't care. Right. What if today I go home and I kiss my youngest daughter first, and then I kiss my oldest daughter right after? But then the next day I kiss my older daughter and then I kiss my younger daughter? Do you care?
[19:16] B: No.
[19:17] A: What if I come home and I don't kiss either?
[19:19] B: Oh, then my.
[19:23] A: Not right away, but then I do later.
[19:26] B: Okay. Okay. Okay. What could you do?
[19:31] A: Right? Like, do you care?
[19:33] B: No.
[19:34] A: What if I'm gonna go eat something? You care which restaurant I go to? Right. I could go to Chipotle or I could go to Panera. Oh, and you might have a preference on which one you like more.
[19:47] B: Panera.
[19:48] A: See? But you don't care which one I go to. Right. Because you're indifferent. Right. You get to be caring about the things that matter to you, and you want to be less caring about the things that don't. Right. A little more in different. Right. So think of her shotgun. I got front seat.
[20:19] B: Who cares?
[20:21] A: Right. But check. I want you to get irked.
[20:24] B: I can't.
[20:24] A: What's something else that she does? You're, like, in this deep conversation really, like, intently listening to what the person's saying. Oh, yeah. Well, I visited. Come right out of left field.
[20:39] B: All the way out of left field.
[20:40] A: Right. All the way out of left field. Like, I mean, it was a deep, deep shot. And all the way from out of left field. Right into my conversation. That's right. Well, I also, you know, I. I've lived on a street before, too. Yeah, that's right. I've also lived in an apartment and a house.
[21:03] B: Okay.
[21:04] A: You know, sometimes I wear blue, but sometimes I wear white. Sometimes I just wear black or gray. And did you know that if one person is black and one person is white and they come together, it's gray. But if the person who's black changes to red and the person who's white stays white, it becomes pink? Because that's the cool part that we're doing. We don't have to change the whole system. All we have to do is change one part. The other part can stay the same. It changes the whole dynamic.
[21:34] B: Right?
[21:40] A: Right. So think of her. What's something she might do? Again, it's my turn to be doing laundry. Why do I have to cook?
[21:50] B: Whining.
[21:52] A: Right. It's so hard. You have to go to a meeting again. Had to read Bible. Now, whatever it is.
[22:02] B: Yeah.
[22:03] A: When you were doing one of those things, feel that irkness.
[22:12] B: Okay.
[22:13] A: Got it. Good. Where are you feeling it?
[22:15] B: Right here.
[22:15] A: Right. Is this how you want to be feeling?
[22:17] B: No.
[22:18] A: No. You want to be in different. Right. So again, just notice the sensations, knowing that you want to be indifferent. Get curious about how they're changing. That's right. Wait for it. Wait for it to drop because, you know, it's just a matter of time before it drops down.
[22:40] B: Right.
[22:40] A: Right. And then there's just a little bit. Get curious about that. Hmm. Right. You might notice a little. What happens to it?
[22:58] B: It's gone.
[22:59] A: Oh, it's gone, isn't it? Right. And notice how it's speeding up and not getting as intense. Isn't that weird? What's one of the things that really, really bothered you about her?
[23:13] B: That. Was it the first one.
[23:14] A: Was it coming in from left field?
[23:16] B: Yes.
[23:17] A: It's way better if she comes from right field.
[23:19] B: No.
[23:19] A: Or the first base side.
[23:20] B: No. It's just. Don't come from no field. Just.
[23:23] A: Yeah, but what she's gonna.
[23:26] B: I know it. So I gotta know how to deal with it.
[23:28] A: Yeah. So you know she's coming from left field, maybe sometimes right field, maybe center field. Maybe she's playing rover. You know what? Rover.
[23:37] B: That's why you just taught me that good technique. I want to use it.
[23:47] A: Right. Because sometimes it's rover. Well, just check. Thank you for coming from left field because this is where it comes from. Like the representation is all right here. And it comes right into the thing. Right? Right. How do you actually want to be indifferent? Right. So we know what it's like when you're indifferent. Right. Isn't that interesting? So then all we're gonna do. I'll show you. This is interesting, too. This is a fun little thing. It's weird we haven't done this before. I'm gonna have you follow the pattern. So we're gonna go from up here with your eyes to there to there, right? And then up here again to there to there. Good. Here. There.
[24:28] B: There.
[24:29] A: Good. Keep it. I know. Watch. Keep going. Are you doing great? Good. Now watch. Just go back up here to there to there. Right there. There. There. Good. There. There. There. Good. There. Right, right, right.
[24:59] B: That.
[25:04] A: This is a process called access alignment. But I want you to think of her coming from left field, right? No, she right in that. What do you notice?
[25:13] B: Nothing.
[25:14] A: I know. Is that weird? What if she came from right field now?
[25:16] B: I don't even care about that.
[25:17] A: No, you don't care about that. It was only when it was coming there.
[25:20] B: Yeah, right.
[25:21] A: Because you're in this conversation. Like, you're might having a really good conversation. You might be sharing something personal, and.
[25:27] B: I can just be like, not right now. Maybe not. Not. Not like that, but not right now. Can. Can you please not indulge in my conversation right now?
[25:38] A: You might say that, but you might just jump in.
[25:41] B: Yeah, but not right now, Isabelle. Not right now. Calmness.
[25:49] A: Yeah. What's it like when you're calm? You're saying, hey, Isabelle, not right now, Isabelle.
[25:53] B: Just up right now.
[25:55] A: One. One second. Just let me finish this up. Yes, right. Because she's like, my kids. You know what happens when I have my kids? You know, they're with me, right? My wife and I are having a conversation, then they jump in because they got something they needed to share because we had said something, and they deserve it.
[26:10] B: If I don't say, excuse me. Oh, before I endure somebody conversation with my dad.
[26:15] A: Oh, not a good thing. See, that's what you learned. See, that's what you want to teach her. Oh, see, that's what she never learned. The thing that you learned from your dad. Oh, yeah, that's right. That was the thing that she never learned. She just jumps in. My kids just jump in. And then you know what happens? They say whatever they say, and they stop. And I'm like, the heck was I just saying? No idea. It's gone. Like, oh, so it's the same thing. No, no, hold on. Say, excuse me.
[26:48] B: Mm.
[26:49] A: Because it's my job to teach them. Because they never learned it. Right? She never learned it. Right, Right. And she doesn't even know that she didn't learn it. She didn't even know that there's a thing that's called excuse me. And even when you say excuse me, doesn't mean that they stop.
[27:09] B: Mm. They keep on. But listen, I have to. Hold on one second.
[27:16] A: That's right.
[27:17] B: Because my kids.
[27:18] A: Hold on one second. Let me finish the conversation. Your kids do it, too.
[27:21] B: My kids. But they know when I say, hold on one second, I give them that look. They know the hold on one second.
[27:27] A: That's right. And see, that wasn't how they were always. That took time for them to understand. That's right.
[27:40] B: You're the best.
[27:44] A: So think about her. Right. And she might come right out of left field. Yeah. Hold on for a sec.
[27:53] B: Finish this, then come back to her. Like, what was you about to say?
[27:59] A: Yeah. Right. And then you come back to her just like you would with your kids. Because. Not like I'm not. I'm shushing you.
[28:04] B: But I don't want to treat her like she's one of my kids. I want to treat her like she's.
[28:07] A: A young adult, but she's not.
[28:09] B: Yeah. She's not acting like it.
[28:11] A: Right. So. So the first thing you have to do is you have to educate her on how to be coming into the conversation. Excuse me. Oh, hold on. Or hold. I'll be right with you as I finish. Because I don't really want to lose this train of thought, which, if you start talking now, I don't remember what I was saying. That's a problem.
[28:41] B: That's so true.
[28:46] A: Right. So it's not treating her like your kids. It's teaching her how to interact with you. That's very different. Right. You're not treating her like your kid. You're teaching her how you want her to interact with you because she's trying to have relatedness. When you say something that she's got some background of relatedness to, she immediately wants to say it in to fit in.
[29:19] B: I heard one of the girls ask her, do you think before you speak? And she's like, you know what? I actually don't. I just speak in my head. I'm like, okay, that explains it all.
[29:32] A: It does, doesn't it? Right. So what you're doing is just teaching how you want to be interacted with.
[29:39] B: Right?
[29:40] A: Right. I say that to women all the time. You have to teach the guy how you want to be treated.
[29:48] B: Right. That's true.
[29:50] A: And the guy will treat you how you want to be treated because you've got the goods.
[29:53] B: Yeah.
[29:54] A: The guy is interested in you. He liked the goods. So here's the deal. The person who's got the Goods gets to have the say. That's right.
[30:09] B: That is so true.
[30:10] A: Right. So just check that out. Thank you for coming from left field again.
[30:16] B: Hold on one second. Isabelle, hold your thought.
[30:20] A: Right, Right. And you're just teaching her. Right. Shotgun.
[30:29] B: See, I don't know what that one yet.
[30:36] A: Right. Well, what did it do to you?
[30:38] B: It just made me laugh.
[30:39] A: It did, didn't it?
[30:40] B: That's probably what I'm gonna have to do, is laugh.
[30:42] A: It just made you laugh, right?
[30:44] B: Yeah.
[30:46] A: Right. It just made you laugh. Is that troubling? No, no. It's okay to laugh, isn't it?
[30:50] B: Yeah.
[30:50] A: Right. Like it's really important for her to be in the front seat.
[30:57] B: I don't know why. I guess she said she gets sick. Car sickness.
[31:01] A: It could be car sickness. Or it could be that I'm 18. I didn't get to ride in the front seat a lot.
[31:04] B: Yeah.
[31:05] A: Where all of us have driven. You've been driving for a long time.
[31:08] B: Yeah.
[31:09] A: Right. You know what it's like to be in the front seat.
[31:12] B: Right?
[31:12] A: Right. You had your own kids.
[31:13] B: Yeah.
[31:15] A: Right. Think about as a kid, how much of a big deal it was.
[31:19] B: How my kids get in the front seat.
[31:21] A: Can I get in the front seat? Right. The first time that they ever got to sit in the front seat. Oh, man, it was so important.
[31:28] B: Yeah.
[31:38] A: Like my 11 year old got in an argument with my mom about. But dad lets me sit in front. My mom's like, I don't care what your dad does. This is my car and my rules. And then you sit in the back seat and you're a little snot. So. No, if you want me to come and get you, you're gonna sit in the back seat and you need to not be a little snot about it because I don't have to come and get you.
[32:01] B: Right. That's true.
[32:03] A: Oh, man, oh, man.
[32:05] B: I gotta deal with this. Oh, man.
[32:07] A: I don't know if you gotta deal with it.
[32:09] B: I do. I'm there. I have to deal with it.
[32:14] A: You gotta educate.
[32:15] B: Yeah.
[32:16] A: How you want to be treated. And part of the learning is I'm around lots of different personalities and lots of different people.
[32:25] B: That's what I have to get used to. A lot of different personalities.
[32:28] A: Right. Because you're an only child. And I know what it's like growing up like an only child. There are times, because I've got, you know, my wife and two girls that I need space.
[32:44] B: I go in the same room and block everything out, you know?
[32:49] A: Right. There are times that I need to focus on something, and there's everything going on, and I put headphones in. Mm. And I listen to music loud enough that I can't hear anybody talking.
[33:01] B: That's me. That's me. That's what I do. And I don't try to be rude. It's just.
[33:06] A: It's not being rude at all. It's just because I need to focus. And if I got all that distraction, I'm not focusing.
[33:11] B: Right.
[33:13] A: And I got stuff to do. Right. That I want to get done.
[33:19] B: That's true.
[33:23] A: Right. Because that's how bad she came from.
[33:26] B: Right field when she come from left field.
[33:30] A: Oh, check it out now. Thank you for coming from left field.
[33:34] B: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hold on one second.
[33:38] A: Right. Notice how you're not being rude. Right, Right. She never learned.
[33:48] B: I'm about to sit you that.
[33:50] A: Okay.
[33:52] B: I can do that.
[33:53] A: And it's not teaching her that. It's teaching how you want to be interacted with. Doesn't matter so much. She does to other people. You're not in the conversation. You already got indifferent. You don't care which restaurant I go to or whether I have this thumb over the top or the other thumb over the top.
[34:06] B: Right, Right. That's true.
[34:08] A: You don't really care. You're not up thinking, oh, my goodness, why did he put the right thumb over the left thumb? Right. There's no thoughts about that at all, ever. Because it doesn't matter. Right. So it's about having people interact with you in the way that you want to be interacted with by those people. That's right. Yeah. How else are things going?
[34:41] B: Great.
[34:42] A: Like, even when you think about some of the stuff that we talked about, like mom, hiv, all that other kind of thing, what do you notice about that now?
[34:48] B: I can talk about it without tearing up.
[34:50] A: Can can't you?
[34:51] B: Yeah. I told my story to the Advocate, and I didn't tear up.
[34:56] A: Isn't that cool?
[34:57] B: Yep.
[34:58] A: Good job.
[34:59] B: And usually I'm talking about my mom. Did I say I see my brother?
[35:03] A: No. When did you see your brother?
[35:05] B: At Celebrate Recovery. Yeah, I've seen him. I haven't seen him in years.
[35:08] A: Wow. What was that like?
[35:10] B: Scary. Scary. Oh, so scary. And my brother on my mom's side, My sister had two brothers, one that died and one that was alive that didn't know where he was. So I finally seen him at Silver Recovery. He's in the program, and he's been staying at Salvation army in Sarasota.
[35:31] A: Okay.
[35:32] B: He's in Project 180 program, and I Just bust out crying. I haven't seen him in so long. And I just know it's my brother because he looked just like me. You know, he's my older. He's what? I'm 31, he's 34.
[35:50] A: Okay.
[35:51] B: So, yeah, that was like, pretty awesome. Ever since I seen. I haven't seen him again. Well, I seen him two other times and I haven't seen him since then. But just praying that everything's okay with him. I just been dealing with, like, missing my kids a whole lot, you know, like. Because it's like I'm free, but I'm not free. You know, I'm free, but I'm not free. And I see my kids, but I don't see my kids. And my kids are like.
[36:21] A: They come like on the weekend.
[36:23] B: Yeah. But you know, hurricanes been going on, so I haven't seen them in like three, four weeks.
[36:28] A: Yeah.
[36:28] B: A month probably three weeks. And my daughter's in fifth grade. I feel like I should be there right now because she's in fifth grade and she's about to graduate.
[36:40] A: I'm pretty sure we got until the end of the school year.
[36:43] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[36:44] A: But still not graduating in January.
[36:46] B: Right? I know, I know. Well, I guess I'll be there. I'll be almost there.
[36:55] A: You might be able to go see it.
[36:56] B: Yeah, of course I will be able to go see it. I'm pretty sure they'll let me go see it.
[37:00] A: Right.
[37:02] B: So.
[37:02] A: Well, you could make sure that you're not working. Yeah, that's an important. Yeah. Right.
[37:10] B: So I've just been like. It's just been bothering me a little bit that I should be there right now, but my dad helping my dad with the kids and.
[37:19] A: But it's not true.
[37:21] B: Yeah, I know. Aaron told me the same thing and.
[37:24] A: She did.
[37:24] B: Yeah. She's like, it. She was like, it's not. She's like, don't stop beating yourself up, you know?
[37:30] A: No, you want to get there. Right.
[37:35] B: But not healthy enough to be there.
[37:38] A: Because it's not about being there for the short term. That's. That's the real key thing. Could you go and be there now? Sure. But what you're really interested is in long term change, right?
[37:55] B: I'm interested in staying.
[37:58] A: Yeah.
[38:01] B: So I guess I gotta hang on tight.
[38:07] A: But the cool part is dad brings them by. Right.
[38:10] B: And at as of the 16th, I get to go on passes, so I need to go home beautiful and, you know, spend a couple of hours with them and stuff. So.
[38:19] A: Right.
[38:20] B: I'm just building myself up for them. Not ready for it just yet, but.
[38:24] A: Right.
[38:25] B: Christmas on what mean Thanksgiving.
[38:27] A: I'm gonna start because it's hard.
[38:29] B: Yeah.
[38:29] A: Kids are not easy.
[38:31] B: So I can't just go ahead first. I gotta do bits and pieces and.
[38:35] A: They need that too.
[38:36] B: Yeah. I'm gonna take them to the park and go out to eat with them first before I.
[38:40] A: Right.
[38:40] B: You know, and do stuff like that. And then I'mma go to the house and spend a couple hours with them.
[38:46] A: Yeah.
[38:46] B: I'm not going to just go and you know.
[38:48] A: Right.
[38:49] B: Head first and take it step by step.
[38:51] A: That's beautiful.
[38:52] B: And I'm in parenting class.
[38:54] A: Nice.
[38:54] B: Yes. I assign myself a parenting class.
[38:56] A: Good job.
[38:58] B: Cuz I need it. Cuz I. It's been a minute since I've been a mall. It's been about, I'm gonna say five years.
[39:05] A: Yeah.
[39:06] B: So. Yeah.
[39:09] A: So that's big.
[39:10] B: Yeah, it is. It is.
[39:12] A: Yeah. And that's where like we look at how far I have to go. Right. That's what people do when they're climbing the mountain. They go, oh my God. But we never turn and look and go, whoa, look at how far I've come.
[39:29] B: Right, right, right.
[39:32] A: Because that's the problem with the amusement park. That's the problem with a long trip. We're on a nine hour drive somewhere. We get to our six, the first part of the drive, we're like, good. Yeah. We get to our six, we feel like we're never gonna get there. But we're 2/3 of the way there. What do you mean? I've only got a third of the way left.
[39:54] B: That's how I exercise.
[39:55] A: But it feels like I'm never gonna get there.
[39:59] B: I said I'm 15 minutes into my exercise. I'm like, Dang, I got 15 more minutes to go. Let's do it, B. You can do this.
[40:06] A: Yeah. And what I try to do is I try to. Okay, I'm gonna go to the next minute and then I'm gonna go to the next minute. Like I did stairs today. Stairs are not fun. You know, Stair climbing.
[40:19] B: Right, right, right.
[40:21] A: I started doing stair climber because. Because I wanted to go back to. I can do hard things.
[40:27] B: Oh man.
[40:28] A: Cuz there's nothing fun about stairs. Right, right. But I get to it and I'm like, okay, I'm going to try to do 20, I'm going to do 20 minutes and I get the first five minutes and okay, I got that done. Because the next five minutes. Okay, get that done. When I get to like minute 12 I'm like, I don't want to do this anymore. I really don't want to do this anymore. So, like, you don't have to get to 20, just get to 13. Then I get to 13. Then I keep going. I go, you don't have to get to 20 to get to 13 and a half. That's it. Because it's about the small step that's right in front of you. Get you to the end result.
[41:09] B: That's true. It's true.
[41:13] A: Yeah. Cool.
[41:15] B: Yep. So that's where I'm at with my life. Trying to get it on the right track. Yeah, we're not trying on you.
[41:23] A: You are.
[41:24] B: Yeah.
[41:24] A: You're doing the right thing. So missing your kids is good fuel because you want to be a better version of you, a better mom.
[41:35] B: Right. That I do.
[41:38] A: And what you know is that they're with a loving family member.
[41:44] B: Right. They are.
[41:47] A: Right. And that's the short term.
[41:55] B: Right. He reminds me of that.
[41:59] A: So that in the long term, you're ready. Cool. Where are you working?
[42:07] B: Not yet.
[42:08] A: Not yet. Where do you want to work?
[42:10] B: I want to start. I don't know. Yeah, I'm. I'm gonna do a fast food place.
[42:14] A: Okay.
[42:15] B: Probably like at Chick Fil A or Culver's. You know, something like that.
[42:24] A: Okay.
[42:24] B: Something's fast paced. I don't want. That's too slow. I need something fast paced.
[42:29] A: Yeah.
[42:30] B: I'm gonna try to do this online bar.
[42:32] A: Braiding school, neat.
[42:34] B: Yeah.
[42:35] A: I like doing hair, so do you really?
[42:36] B: Yeah. Braids.
[42:38] A: Like, not real braids, fake braids or real braids? Both. Both.
[42:41] B: Both. So I want to do braids. I want to do dreadlocks.
[42:44] A: That's a good business.
[42:46] B: Yeah.
[42:46] A: Because one, it takes a long time, and they're amazing, and I'm fast with it. Are you really?
[42:52] B: Yes.
[42:52] A: Nice.
[42:53] B: So I look, I looked online, and it's like a 500 class.
[42:57] A: Okay.
[42:58] B: Two days, 16 hour class, huh? Yeah. So it's in St. Pete, but it's. It's only 34 minutes away from the place. 34 minutes? Yeah, 34 minutes away.
[43:07] A: So nice.
[43:09] B: For 500 bucks. That's not bad.
[43:11] A: Yeah.
[43:12] B: You get your b. Your braiding license.
[43:15] A: Nice.
[43:16] B: Yeah, so I'm looking into that too.
[43:18] A: Yeah. Okay. Well, that's something that you'd be. If you already like it and it's fun for you.
[43:24] B: I love.
[43:24] A: It's a good side job.
[43:25] B: Since I was 9 years old, that's what I like doing.
[43:27] A: Nice. Just put beads and all that other kind of fun stuff.
[43:32] B: Yep. I used to do back to school hairstyles for the girls and.
[43:35] A: Oh cool.
[43:36] B: Yeah.
[43:39] A: That'S fun. Y. Yeah. All right. So fast food. Cuz it's fast.
[43:47] B: Or, or serving. I do serve a serving job too.
[43:50] A: Like.
[43:52] B: Like. Wait, you're saying. I know my roommate, she works at Peaches. You know Peaches is Peaches restaurant. So she said she could probably get me a job at her job doing. Serving, waitressing.
[44:04] A: So. Okay. They're a morning cake. Morning and lunch. I don't really do seven or three. Yeah, right. So morning and lunch, that'd be good. Breakfast.
[44:13] B: Yeah, that'd be great. And did she say that the people they bring home like 150 to 200 a day.
[44:19] A: Holy cow.
[44:20] B: Yeah, if it's true, I'll go. But if it's not true, then I'm not going.
[44:25] A: Yeah, I'm so that's not bad, right?
[44:30] B: Yeah. All right. At peace. The H. I made some good, good tips. So.
[44:36] A: Yeah, tips matter.
[44:38] B: It do matter. It do matter. But I think I rather work at fast food restaurant instead.
[44:44] A: No tips.
[44:44] B: No tips. No. Cuz that mean my pay is not going to be that great. It all depends.
[44:54] A: Yeah, I work. I think service is good. I think service you got an opportunity to do well in always. That was. I. I worked as a bellman at a hotel for a bunch of years and that was a great job because if you hustled, you did well.
[45:14] B: Right, Right. I wish we could work at hotels, that housekeeping would be great.
