[00:00] A: All right, so today is September 15th, and, Brandy, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. Given what we do is useful, valuable, and transformative, that recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes. Yes, it is. Okay. So the first thing that you kind of shared with me that's been problematic is there was a message that you got when you were younger about how to be in the world that still creates conflict now, and we want to get that thing cleared and gone so that you have more ease in allowing others to contribute.
[00:40] B: Yes.
[00:41] A: Yeah, that would be useful. Okay, so I follow you with that. What. What other things do we want to get better? Right. Like, if we could really change problematic ways that you've been thinking or feeling or acting or reacting, what do we want our time to do for you?
[00:56] B: I would like to be able to. I don't know if control my anger is the correct word, but I would like to be able to not go so severe. I had an incident where I had been transitioned to long term. One of the residents there was having a time. Anyway, she and I got into a verbal confrontation. I established a boundary.
[01:19] A: What does that mean?
[01:20] B: I told her to stop talking to me because the conversation was going into a conflict.
[01:24] A: Okay, so you guys were heated and you said, stop talking?
[01:26] B: Yeah, stop talking to.
[01:27] A: That's what you mean by said about me? Yes. Okay.
[01:29] B: So I didn't exactly expect her to.
[01:32] A: So she immediately.
[01:33] B: Yeah, no, it didn't happen.
[01:35] A: She continued.
[01:37] B: I then again established it and I guess.
[01:39] A: So again, you said, stop talking to me.
[01:41] B: Yeah, I was like, what part of shut up did you not understand? It wasn't polite, but that's how I said it. And I assumed that I would have help from the advocate that was there. The advocate didn't step in. I learned later that that was my fault because I didn't ask for help. But. So anyway, it got to the point where she had violated my boundary.
[01:58] A: Meaning she continued to talk to you?
[01:59] B: Yes.
[02:00] A: Okay.
[02:00] B: She wouldn't stop. I got to a point.
[02:02] A: Did you leave?
[02:03] B: I. I did, but before I got to that point, I was going to violently hurt her.
[02:09] A: So you were going to violently hurt her?
[02:11] B: Yeah. I was gonna say what was in my head is, I'm fixing this.
[02:15] A: Here's the funniest part as you're telling me this. Like, I can see you seeing it all happen and getting into some of that state of ready to just, like, Right. And even notice how just the recalling of this, there's some of the tension going on. What we're going to be able to do is get that stuff that goes on with you to. And lengthen the fuse. Right, right, right. And even just in the thinking about it, not to the same extent, but. But you're kind of feeling a little bit of getting ready to like, okay, violently hurt her.
[02:55] B: Yeah. And I don't have a level of severity, but I don't think that I know what that exactly means.
[03:01] A: So what do you mean level? When I said level of severity?
[03:05] B: No, no, no. I don't have a. Like when she, When I. When she wouldn't shut up and leave me alone, I took it to the level of I was gonna smash her head into the counter. And that is not okay.
[03:15] A: Okay. Like there's a few steps in between that you could have done. Like maybe the better step would be.
[03:21] B: I should have walked outside.
[03:23] A: If they're not able to regulate themselves because that's what happens in life. We think the other person should be better at regulation and they're not. Yeah, but we're thinking the regulation is over there. What we're forgetting is. Oh, wait a minute, it's in here. Like I got absolutely no control over what goes on over there. Right. In the same liking past shit, I can't get awful bad shit that's happened to me to have not happened. Right. I can't get that person to not say those things. I can't get that person to not do that stuff. I can't get me to have not done that other thing. Right. Like we look at life through that lens. That those things cause this in me and that I need to adjust those things out there. Always too many of them, never gonna be able to adjust them. And life is so unpredictable. It never goes exactly the way I thought it was anyway.
[04:18] B: But I need to be able to control me. That's what I want.
[04:22] A: I would say that we not control like, you know, I'm a joystick. We want the part of your brain that directs that automatic to become more responsive so that other people's shit stops feeling so heated, intense and personal make sense. It does. Right. Like that's what's going like here. We want you to experience situations like that with more of distance. Right. Just like right now, you can look at me and also with the other parts of your eyes, see the space between you and me. Right. You can stay looking at me and see the space beyond me. Right. And even space over to the sides Right. Even though you're staying looking at me. Got it. When we do, that face also starts to soften some. We want you to be able to experience situations like that instead of an excuse me being more like in my face. Right. Because that's how when that was going on with her, even if there was. She was over at the door, it's feeling like she's like literally on top. That's why you use the words I set up boundary. And then she immediately went, oh, over it again. Right. That's the way that our brain works, the way that stuff gets represented. When somebody says something like they're in my face, the person could be over there. But how it's represented and felt is in my face. Because the closer something is, the more intense I feel it. Right. If I'm right over the fire, I'm really feeling the heat, you know, If I go 20 steps away, not so much at all. Right, exactly. We want you to have more space, more room, more distance from that reactivity. Not that I don't have things that piss me off, because there will be shit that pisses you off. But my emotions more match the situation. Right. That they decrease in intensity, frequency and duration. That's where we're at. Yes. Cool. I know how to do that. Awesome.
[07:03] B: Yes.
[07:04] A: Right. Not good.
[07:05] B: Yeah.
[07:05] A: Good. Alright. So what else would be useful for me to know? What else do we want to get better?
[07:16] B: I don't know. I think that's about as far as I've got. Like, I just started opening up with Christine. She's my therapist there too.
[07:23] A: What does that mean? I don't.
[07:25] B: Like, I don't. Well, yeah, like, I wish it was that easy. I could just be like, this is all the stuff I need fixed and they just put it back. But I don't. I don't know. You know what I mean?
[07:38] A: You're doing it already right now. Yeah. That I'm trying to notice how there's the discomfort in whether I'm going to get it right or say it or be able to convey it.
[07:52] B: That's the problem I have is communication.
[07:54] A: I don't know if that's true. You've done a really good job so far. I got both of those pieces really well.
[08:00] B: I know there's a lot of things I need help with.
[08:05] A: How do you know you need help with them?
[08:07] B: Because they don't make me feel good whenever I get a response from it.
[08:14] A: Well, it might be an example of something that doesn't make you feel good when you get a response from it and be here when you think about it.
[08:22] B: Because I'm more funny my how like how I've raised my kids and I just. How do I say this? I'd like to be a healthy role model for them.
[08:34] A: Okay. Because you haven't been.
[08:35] B: No, I have. I have six kids total.
[08:37] A: Six? Holy.
[08:38] B: Yeah. Yeah. I had four are adopted as far as like I got with the boyfriend, the boyfriend left, the kids stayed, which I'm. I have four that way that are grown. I have two grandchildren and then I also have two biological children.
[08:50] A: You were 35 with two grandchildren.
[08:51] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[08:52] A: Okay.
[08:52] B: I know, right?
[08:54] A: My grandma I think was 42. 42, I think when I was born. So yeah.
[09:01] B: Oh, okay. And then I have an 8 year old and a 1 year old.
[09:04] A: Oh my. All right.
[09:05] B: That are mine biologically. So my first four kids are. They've become very productive and they're very much so not like me as far as they're productive members of society. But I would like to be able to be in their life in a healthy way. Like I haven't been able to meet my grandkids because of past decisions with drugs and my lifestyle. So my kids, they love me from.
[09:28] A: A distance, which is probably good for them.
[09:31] B: It is very good for them. Actually. My oldest is in prison. Unfortunately that's the best thing that could have happened to her because she's gotten her ged now she's going through college classes and she's not the same person. She's grown up.
[09:42] A: Yeah.
[09:42] B: But now I'm not in my youngest 2 kids life. I had to sign my rights over to my youngest daughter and then I'm still in case.
[09:51] A: Oh, so it still went with family.
[09:52] B: Yeah.
[09:53] A: Isn't that cool?
[09:53] B: Yes, I'm very thankful for that.
[09:55] A: Oh my. That's like. Not just very thankful. Like that's really cool on her part, but really cool for them and really cool for you in rehabilitating.
[10:06] B: I'm just not until I can prove or show them that I'm not that same person, I don't get to be in their life.
[10:13] A: Doesn't that make sense?
[10:14] B: Yeah, I mean. And I'm okay with that. And that's something that I asked for, you know, So I just. That's where I want to be.
[10:23] A: So we want you to be more. Well, but we also. I'm thinking it's not going to be beneficial for you to feel guilty.
[10:29] B: No, I don't. It's not that I feel guilty. I just.
[10:32] A: Shame.
[10:34] B: Yeah. I feel bad because I did the best I Could for my first four, but then the last two I haven't done crap for, and that's just being honest.
[10:43] A: Right. Well, you weren't in the throes of addiction and lifestyle for the first four.
[10:47] B: At the same way.
[10:48] A: No, I was not in the same way.
[10:50] B: What do you mean?
[10:54] A: So you would have been much younger.
[10:57] B: Yeah.
[10:58] A: Right. That world is a younger person's game.
[11:02] B: Yes, very true.
[11:04] A: Right, right. Like in all arenas, right? Football, you don't see the 52 year old. Right. You know, running back. Yeah.
[11:13] B: It doesn't happen. You might see him once, but they don't get taken out.
[11:16] A: That guy's not playing. Right. He was done at 34. You know, like, he got. He had a good maybe run. If you get lucky of like, you know, 10, 20, 10 years in something.
[11:27] B: Yeah, that's it.
[11:28] A: Yeah.
[11:31] B: So with them, I just like to be able to. Even if I don't be able, or even if I'm not able to have them in my life until they're grown as far as, like turning 18, whenever they do come around, I'd still like to be able to.
[11:42] A: Well, you want to. You want. You want your life to be different than it's been. Yeah, big time.
[11:49] B: Because in the past, I've done literally.
[11:51] A: Anything that needs to. What was the drug of choice?
[11:53] B: Opiates and methamphetamine together.
[11:57] A: Well, I mean, if you're gonna go ahead, might as well throw them in at the same time, because it's not a one plus one equals two. It's an 11 complex. So. Yeah. Right now. Boom. Boom. How long have you been clean and clear?
[12:11] B: Since February 11th.
[12:12] A: Yay.
[12:13] B: Yes.
[12:13] A: Awesome. Congratulations. That's so cool. Good for you.
[12:17] B: Thank you.
[12:18] A: Yeah.
[12:18] B: Thank you.
[12:20] A: Yeah. Okay, so. So. So there's been the crap and not feeling like you were a good participant in the younger two's life. Yeah. Right. Useful that she's with youngest. That they're with youngest daughter. Oldest there was.
[12:39] B: My youngest daughter is with my cousin and my youngest son is with my sister.
[12:43] A: There you go. Yeah. Yeah. That they're with family. Right. And that's really cool for all parties involved. And they're also wanting you to get well. Yes. Right.
[12:53] B: But they're also tired of the oh, I'm not gonna do this again crap.
[12:57] A: Of course. I mean, you're the little boy that cries wolf.
[13:00] B: I just vanish and then pop up.
[13:04] A: Right. That's what I mean.
[13:06] B: Okay.
[13:06] A: The little boy that cries wolf says, there's a wolf out there and there's no wolf, and they. All right. And then goes back out there and says, no, there's a wolf. There's a wolf. And they all run out there. And there's a wolf and a wolf. They all run out there. What do we have? You. This time I'm really gonna get better. No, this time is gonna be different. No, this time's gonna be different. What happens to the townspeople? They go, well, I'm not going out to. Look, he lied to me so many times. I'm done. And then the real wolf's there. Shit. Right. We want to get it so that this time you are truly different. But not in an up here and not just in a behavioral way. In an in here way.
[13:42] B: And they don't know the. They don't know the extent of it either. Like, when I explained to my sister that I was going to this program, she was like, oh, well, that you don't qualify for that. And I'm okay with her not knowing things that I've done, but. Like what? I guess, yeah, what you just said, the crying wolf crap. That's what I've done. So she just thinks that this is another way to get attention.
[14:07] A: I think she's not sure yet whether you're capable of changing, which is her right to be feeling that way. Based on. There were multiple times that you said you were that you didn't. Right. So it's not like she's like. Right. So she is supposed to. Because she's also involved in taking care of people that you care about that matter. Right. She's supposed to be more aloof, protective, distanced, to really see whether something's actually changed.
[14:54] B: Very true.
[14:54] A: Right. And she needs to wait a long enough time so that it's been demonstrated. Right. And that's what the world of worlds. I get a lot of people, Brandi, that have concern about trust. Like, I need to be able to trust somebody in order to open up. I need to be able to trust in order to be, you know, in a connected or committed. I need to learn how to trust other people. And I always tell them that if they're trying to trust other people, that's a really bad idea. Because to think that somebody that's not you will 100% of the time have your best interest in mind. Bad idea. They will when yours match. But as soon as they don't, they have theirs. Right. So the world of how we know that is we start watching. Watching not what people say to me, but what they do. Do they walk their talk right now? I don't. Right. No, you haven't been. I think right now you actually are, because you are engaged in a process, both in residential, getting confronted with all sorts of shit, I'm sure while you're there. That is confronting.
[16:18] B: Yeah.
[16:19] A: And uncomfortable. Okay. After that. Well.
[16:22] B: And I thought that I was doing right. It's not that I. I'm not. I'm not sure how I feel. I told on myself. Nobody knew what my intention was of harming the girl. I told them because I wanted help with it.
[16:36] A: Yeah. Right. So get it. Like you're in the process of changing you. That's different. Like, knowing how far I got triggered and recognizing that that level of being triggered about this situation is way higher than it needed. And I don't like that. And I don't know how to not do that.
[17:01] B: Yeah. Because it wasn't her fault. Like, when I sat back, it really wasn't. It was literally. She just put the cherry on the cake. And then she's the one that it got. I blew up on.
[17:11] A: Right.
[17:11] B: It wasn't really anything to do with her.
[17:13] A: Well, that's what we're talking about. What we want is what has been happening is that there's a whole bunch of things that get piled into a particular incident. So if we watch two business guys arguing over something, and I ask you, scale of 0 to 10, where is it? And you're like, I don't know. It's a one or a two. It's not a big deal. But we look at them and their faces are red. They're screaming at each other. One guy's fists are pounding the table. Their emotions are like seven.
[17:42] B: Yeah.
[17:43] A: They're not dealing with that solely. They're dealing with that plus all of the past similars that have gotten mapped into it. That's why their reaction is that much higher. So that's why one of the things that we're wanting to do is we want to unplug the effect that past things have happened. Whether there be feelings of anger or hurt, jealousy, resentment, whether they're of disgust, whether they're of sadness, pain, shame. We want the impact that those moments have had cleared. Right. And notice how there was a little bit of discomfort even thinking about it. But what I can tell you is we know how to get that stuff better without you ever having to go there. Because all that there is for you to do is to stay here with me. And I know I can be way more entertaining and at least a little more fun than that ship was. So all there is in my job, in all of it, is to keep you here with me. Because if I notice and I pay attention to that, that you're going there, I'm going to do all I know how to do to get you here. And before we ever go there, we want to have an understanding as to how come that's continued to bother us and how we get it better. Right. Then we know exactly what we're doing because we go to clear it up. Right. I'm going to explain all of that stuff to you. We're also going to go through processes that get your body into the right states for healing, which are more processes of resting.
[19:17] B: Okay. Yeah, it does. I'm just like, oh, crud. Resting again. But I understand.
[19:22] A: I don't think that, you know what the heck I'm gonna do. Right. So you just took that and went somewhere other than what I'm doing because it's so great. Right? Like, oh, no, it's not gonna be anything like what you just did.
[19:35] B: Because I think I automatically. I went to there. Everybody's telling me that I need to rest and be still. Arresting me still. Yeah. I sat for a year in jail and then got to the program, did the blackout stage, and then went to residential, and they're like, okay, just rest and be still. And I literally have eight hours in the day that I can do nothing. And it drives me insane.
[19:52] A: I don't know whether that's true. What do you mean? Yeah, we're gonna reframe that.
[19:56] B: Okay.
[19:57] A: And we're gonna reshape it so that it's not. I have nothing to do. Right. Cause we do want to have aspects of time that there's stuff for you to do. Right, Right. But we also want to have times where it's okay and not doing, meaning this thing's not running so much. That's.
[20:14] B: I need to say.
[20:15] A: Got it. Right. So that's what we're going to do. It's never. So we have to remember. Right. I was going 100 miles an hour. I've started to slow down, but are there moments that I need to speed up? Right. Like, even if I'm driving down the road and all of a sudden this person, like, slammed on their brake, and I've got to swerve and there's a car, and I got to hit the gas and. Right. We want to have what we call more range so we don't take away doing energy. Right. But most of the doing has been out there. Right. So that this doesn't keep running. We have a thing. It's called the default Mode network. And when I'm not focused on things like I'm doing a math problem or I'm reading something or I'm watching something on TV or I'm talking to somebody or that default mode network is on. The default mode network is the talking to myself. And most of us, because we had shitty stuff happen along the way, have shitty ways that we talk to ourselves. Right. We're never, wow, you're really great. And I love you so much. And you look so pretty and like, like, that's not the voice that's going on. You idiot. You shouldn't have done that. Why are you saying that? What are they thinking there? I wonder what's happening there. What's happening? I don't know what that, that. Right. All of a sudden I drive by something. Oh, no. Now I'm back into that. Awesome. I'm so glad I went by that place. I didn't know that was going to trigger me into that. Okay, fine. Right, Right. Somebody says something that sounds like a word that, oh, now write in that thing again. All of that stuff happens because of errors in the way that the brain works. Right. So how we walk around in life, we tend to think of I am the person who's sitting on top of the elephant, and the me is the person who's on top thinking that I'm in control. You know, because when the elephant is doing what I want it to do, we kind of have a really good symbiotic relationship. Right. If I want to go this way, elephant goes this way. If I want to go that way, elephant. If I want it to stop, I want to go a little faster. Right. But in all actuality, who's really in control. Yes. Because if the elephant gets spooked and takes off, I'm just going along for the ride. Right. So that's the same kind of thing that keeps running in you and you're trying to control it from being the guy on the elephant. That's why I don't have real good results. Right. That's why in past attempts, I haven't fully gotten all the way there. Right. I've gotten space from using. But then life circumstances and programming, and I'd go back into that loop again, and then I've got time away and then back in the loop. That's why family is going, oh, okay, yeah, we like that. She's got. Okay, we're not. Okay, we're not doing that anymore. We'll just wait to see. Because she could go through a few more iterations of that, Right. And we're hoping that like she gets to the other. Right. That's what we want to change. We want to change the automatic way that your brain responds to stuff. So same stuff going on doesn't produce this response. Right. I can't get rid of everything that presses my buttons in life. There's a shitload of it. Even if it's a person, I get rid of that one. Damn. There's a whole other long line of them. Right. So instead what we want to do is we want to unplug the buttons so that even when they're pressed, it doesn't do that in me. Right. The lens that we're going to shift from viewing life from, because the common lens is what I said earlier, that guy doing that thing makes me feel that way. That stuff happening causes this in me. When this person does this, I feel like this because I did that, I felt that way. Right? That stuff causes this in here. That lens isn't wrong. The problem is we've got this much power. Change it. We work hard too. Avoid it. Get away from it is the other option. Right? But you've already discovered there's some stuff I can't change. I can't completely, maybe don't fully want to get away from lots of stuff. I can't get that to what not happened. What we're going to do is adjust how brain responds to stuff. So when lion approaches zebra, people say, lion makes zebra scared. We go, duh. But no, we look at it a different way. No, it's really zebra's brain making zebra alert, motivated and stronger, scared. When zebra sees, senses, smells, feels, thinks lion's coming, zebra's brain is doing it, not lion. Very true. It's doing it in response to lion approaching. But it's zebra's brain, right? So, Brandy, there's ways in which your brain has been working that has been problematic, Right. They've been causing you to feel ways that you don't want to feel or react to things more intensely than you want to or be affected by stuff. Right. Whether they be memories of shit that happened, locations of stuff, other things. Right. We want to adjust the way that your brain has been responding to stuff, so the same stuff doesn't produce this response. Right. And even notice, just as I was talking, there was a little bit of.
[25:36] B: It, that feeling, because I was thinking of, I think that I should feel bad for how I've treated people or do treat people whenever they push me to that level. But I don't. And I tried talking to With Christine.
[25:57] A: About it, you think you should feel a way you don't feel. Right. Yeah.
[26:01] B: That makes a whole lot of sense.
[26:02] A: Right.
[26:03] B: I know. Like I should have. I should feel.
[26:06] A: If I should feel more remorse.
[26:08] B: Yes. Yes.
[26:09] A: Well, don't. When you did it, you're justified in having done it because. Right. You wouldn't do it if you didn't think the person wronged you in such a way that they deserved it. How are you supposed to feel bad about that?
[26:22] B: I don't. I don't. Like at all.
[26:26] A: But why would you. See, this is the part I'm wanting to understand more. Brandi, is what about you? Not feeling bad about having done it isn't okay with you because you said, I think I should. So what is it about not feeling bad that seems to not be okay with you?
[26:49] B: I don't know. I think because of what I'm being told. For instance, whenever I got back to assessment and I explained the situation, I understood what everyone was telling me as far as what my part in it was. I understood that. But then I didn't feel bad because it got that far. I still don't feel bad because it got that far. Because I just. I feel like I shouldn't have got pushed that far. But I don't. I don't feel like I was wrong.
[27:14] A: If that makes sense. Notice how you said the perfect thing, which is why you can't feel bad. I shouldn't have been pushed that far. Where is the locus of control? You know what that means? Locus of control is? Who has control in that statement, you or them?
[27:38] B: I guess it would have been me because I could have got.
[27:40] A: No, no, not in that statement. They shouldn't have pushed me so far. Who? Yes. They had control and power. No, no. Flip it around. Watch. The reason that you can't feel bad is that it's justified in. They shouldn't have done that. If they hadn't have done that, I wouldn't have done this. I only did this because they did that. Right. I can't feel bad because I only did this because they did that. If they hadn't done that, I wouldn't have done this. Got it. That's why I can't feel bad, because my behavior is valid based on what they did.
[28:29] B: But I also realized that that's something I was taught. And I don't know if that's actually how I feel about it or if that was.
[28:35] A: It seemed good. So you just did the other part that's really useful for you.
[28:38] B: Like, I don't I don't know if that's me or if that's just what's been programmed. And I know a lot of my problems are what my dad has programmed.
[28:46] A: So to speak, which we're going to change the program. Yeah, yeah. Which will be really cool. I know how to do that.
[28:51] B: Okay. I need the new model. I need Windows 10 or something.
[28:55] A: We just need to update it. Right? Like there's a. There's a part of the brain that needs. Needs some updating. Yeah, yeah. So. So, Right. So then that's why it's conflicted. So think of that. If we were to separate, you know, you kind of into different parts, Right. This is a different part than this, than this and this. But if we separate you into different parts, there's a part of you that feels very warranted and justified and perfectly okay with how the whole thing went down based on what they did. Got it. There's another part of you that goes, huh, well, like, I don't really wanna. Like, I kind of like, maybe there's a part of it that goes. Maybe I should take a little bit more ownership in my own behavior.
[29:45] B: I think that's I'm seeing.
[29:46] A: Right. Like that's where the conflict is. Right. Which is really, really cool because that's the halfway point to changing it. Right. First, having some conflict about whether I should or shouldn't internally is on the way to changing it. Because prior to that it's no conflict at all. Justified. Because they were that way. Right? So the halfway house and changing it is already going, oh, wait a minute, maybe this isn't how I want. I get that. This is how I've been in life, but maybe because I'm literally in a process of kind of co creating how I want to be in life, how I want my life to go distinctly different and better than it's been, maybe that's not how I actually want to be in life.
[30:29] B: Yeah, it isn't. Isn't that cool how my parents are really. Like, I've sat back and looked at it. My dad has nothing because he's stuck in his ways and his. I've seen throughout the years that his way is not. It's not productive. It's not. Right. It doesn't get him anywhere. So I. But I don't know how to change it either.
[30:51] A: You don't have to change his. No, mine. Oh, right. How could you know how to change it? Again? You are in it. Right? You're in it. How can you change it even if you knew how? Right? So the heart surgeon knows how to do heart surgery. And if you needed to have an ablation, the heart surgeon knows how to do it 100%. Would he be doing it to himself? Even though he knows a lot, maybe even more than the guy who's doing it. Right. But is he gonna do it to himself? No, he doesn't have that. So again, one of the things that we're starting to unpack and unravel is how come this stuff is going on in the way it does. It's a error, misfire, malfunction, glitch in the way the automatic, emotional, preconscious part of your brain is reacting to stuff, right? What we're understanding, brain, is that your brain has been making you feel bad, right? In response to stuff. First question, do you really think it wants you to feel bad? Do you think it would want you to feel good? Yeah. No. No. That's the fucked up part about our brain. It doesn't give a rat's ass how we feel. That's not right. That's not because it doesn't concerned about our well being. But it's because that's not the purpose of feelings. What we've discovered in working with thousands of people. You're a bright gal, I'm a pretty bright guy. But most of our brain emotionally works like an animal. Animal brain doesn't cause animal to feel because it's concerned about its mood or its affect or its level of self worth or self esteem. Whether it feels good enough, or lovable, or smart, or pretty or tall or gorgeous or lovely. It causes emotions to motivate the animal. Do something, get something to stop solve problem. That basic, that simple, right? Rabbit sees fox approach brain. All of rabbit fear run away fast. Not because it wanted it to have a bad day, right? Squirrel's tail, fire, pain. All of squirrel feeling immediately. Not because brain of squirrel wants squirrel to hate itself for being careless, dumb, getting too close to the fire. Now it's marred. All the other squirrels are gonna laugh at me.
[33:40] B: I like that.
[33:41] A: I'm sorry, right? No, simple. Get tail out of fire. Yeah. So the screwed up part for human beings is all the negative emotions we experience. Hurt, anger, sadness, sorrow, grief, guilt, shame, angst, upset, worry, pain, all that kind of stuff. The disgust that hurts, the sad. All that is being caused by the part of our brain that works like an animal for the same purpose. To motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. That's it, the crazy part. The really good news is that many of the Problems that our brain tries to get us to solve are in time periods either A, that haven't happened yet, or more so, B, are already finished. That's what I love how it is, right? So we don't actually have to solve the problem. What we want to do, Brandi, is update the timing. Timing is the error that happens in our brain. And the reason why timing malfunctions is we have another part, the intellect. Right. The intellect gives us the concept of time, past, present, future, here, now, back then, later. No other animal has that. I can't say to my dog, well, let's go to the dog park later at three and expect the dog to get it. What's three now? Okay, let's go. Right. So the problem is that because we've got this intellectual brain that has access to past, knows now, has access to future, that isn't an error on a positive moment. Because nobody actually gets trouble by kind of bringing back some. Some joy, emotion about something they did. But it's not as if they're reliving it, right? So if somebody's telling us about a great trip that they took with their family, they went out on a hike, they went on a canoe ride across the calm lake, they camped out, they made s'mores, they tell us about the experience. We kind of get a little bit of the smile. But we also know that they know the difference between the memory of doing it and doing it not at all the same thing. But experiences that have a negative tinge to it. A bad, an awful, a sad, an upsetting, a scary, a horrific, a catastrophic. A traumatic brain, confuses memory, thinks it is experience. Right. This guy is telling us about how, you know, when he was in his early 20s, he's in his 50s now, there was a time that him and a buddy went out and they were out late, and they kind of got lost in where they were going. And then they ran into this, like, gang of guys that beat the shit out of him, and they broke his arm. And as he's telling us about it, even though his arm is finally noticed, he's, like, really kind of like, back in that moment. And we all think, oh, my goodness, he's reliving it. But what's really happening, Brandy, is that a part of his brain is confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience. So when we go through troubling moments that are awful, the brain freezes. The moment when it got frozen, it also got chopped off from the rest of my nervous system that moved forward. There was a part of my brain, therefore, that never got the good news. The negative experience stopped. I survived it. I made it through it. I'm here now. There's a part of the brain that doesn't know that certain negative moments are over. Even though where I'm bright and logical, I totally do, right? That guy, as he's talking to us, knows that he's not in the inner city of Chicago. He knows he's not being surrounded by that gang. He knows he's not getting hit with the pipe, right? He knows that his body is completely experiencing it as if he is, right? He knows it's over. But there's another part of his brain that never got updated. And at that level, the memory lives as if it is the experience and it's on all the time and it's ongoing because we know that moment was affecting the guy when he talked to us, because we saw it on him. But it also affected him even over the weekend when he was watching football with his best friend. Under the surface up here, he knows safe. He was with us. He's okay. He survived. Part of his brain never got the good news. That's why it stays stuck, right? So for all of us, we have multitudes of moments, some more recent, some longer time ago. Sometimes they're one incident moments, Sometimes they're a conglomeration of moments. Sometimes it's a long period of time, sometimes it was just a short period of time. We all have those emotional wounds that haven't healed, right? And we have a world that says time heals all wounds, but not those, right? If I told you about breaking my hand because I fell skateboarding, that happened when I was 14. I'm 48, so there's a lot of years, right? If I was as emotional as when that happened, you'd look at me like I'm crazy. What is wrong with this guy? His hand is fine. But if I told you about what also happened when I was 14 at my uncle's house and I started to get all emotional, you'd be like, yeah, yeah, of course. Why isn't that fucking weird?
[40:04] B: Yeah, right?
[40:06] A: So it's not that the emotional wound can't heal. The reason it hasn't is only because that part of the brain doesn't know it's over, right? So what does therapy think about it? Therapy think. Thinks we bury repressed, locked behind closed doors, put in the closet. Strong and painful emotions, right? The coping mechanism. If something bothered me, I figure out ways to not think about it. That doesn't bother me, right? Like I remember working with a guy who came home from war in a really wooded Grenada area, and he's like, you know, I just learned that I don't go camping, hiking, or hunting.
[40:48] B: I mean, that's one way, I guess, right?
[40:50] A: Like, like avoid those triggers, all that, Right. But he couldn't avoid puddles, and that's when they used to shoot right after a rain. So again, we can't avoid all this stuff, but we can adjust how our brain automatically reacts to the stuff so the same stuff doesn't cause it. So that's the first part, is that part of the brain doesn't know that it's over. Therapy thinks we've got to use the painful way of throwing it all up, getting it out of me, which I know after throwing up, I've done it a few times, I feel a little bit better. Right. In particular, one time I ate something that was spoiled and didn't know was spoiled, and oh my goodness, that was so much better after that. Right? But we can get re triggered by the same stuff, right? How many times have people talked about something, felt a little bit better, and then went by boom, right back in it again. Right? So instead of trying to get bad emotions out of you, we truly want to get good news in to the parts of the brain that don't know certain awful moments are over. We literally want to unplug the memory so the brain for the first time can read those moments of awful things that happened as data about something that's over make sense. Once your brain emotionally reads that it's over, it has no purpose to continue to produce those distressing sensations, because the only reason it actually was is that part of the brain thought it was still happening. It causes all of that disruption in us, trying to motivate us to get the moment to stop. That's why it's doing it. When it realizes, oh, that stopped, it goes, okay, never mind. And literally, like that light switch turning on, feelings go away. It's really cool. I like doing that with people. That's like, really cool. When somebody has something that they tried their darndest to never, ever, ever, ever, ever think about. Because anytime they even get a little bit, they are all in it to get that to be completely unplugged. So that when we're done, I go think about it right now, Remember all of what happened, try to feel bad, and it's not there. That's the right. Like, that's where we're headed. Okay. So then there's two other pieces for you to Kind of have in a understanding. But before I go into that, like, I got the over reactivity. Right. We got the stuff that we talked about when we first came in. Right. What other things kind of go on that you would want to get better? We got family stuff and bad feelings over shit that happen. I'm sure one of the things is there's stuff that I've gone through that underneath the surface affects me. We want to get that impact cleared.
[43:53] B: I didn't. I didn't realize that it did. It's something Christine brought to my attention, actually. I have childhood trauma. I was molested by both my grandparents. And I say both not from maternal.
[44:04] A: And paternal side because that would have been really fucking weird.
[44:07] B: I mean, it's just as weird though, more weird honestly, because my. My dad's biological father and my dad's stepfather, when one stopped, the next began.
[44:19] A: Oh, good. So they. It was like a. Yeah, like a wrestling match. Yeah, right. Like, you know, okay, I got done. It's your turn to go in.
[44:27] B: Yeah, pretty much.
[44:27] A: Oh, that's great.
[44:28] B: My dad was the only one that actually took up for me. He wound up going to prison for it. And all because they didn't do anything to him, to my grandfather. Anyway, so when dad got out of prison, dad taught me how to.
[44:44] A: Dad went to prison to. Because he attacked grandparents.
[44:47] B: No, he shot at the doctor that lied during court.
[44:51] A: Oh, he shot at the. In court?
[44:53] B: No, no, at the hospital.
[44:54] A: So he went to the after.
[44:56] B: Yeah, my.
[44:57] A: Wow. All right.
[44:58] B: The doctor that performed the rape kit lied during court because my grandmother paid him. This is what I was told. So. And this is something that they did with my grandfather previously as well with other people that he had molested. They paid them to not say anything. So. Yeah.
[45:15] A: Yeah.
[45:15] B: My family's great. So they did that. My dad.
[45:20] A: I thought you just said that.
[45:22] B: I mean, it was great, right? I don't know how else to. That's just. So dad didn't. I guess. I don't know if he got screwed up on meth one day and just thought he was going to take it under his. His.
[45:32] A: Yeah, but he did what he did what he did.
[45:34] B: He went and he shot at the doctor. They put him in.
[45:37] A: Not a good shot, huh?
[45:38] B: Yeah, no, no. I don't. I don't even know.
[45:41] A: Dad was. Not a good shot.
[45:42] B: No, he took my mom's gun. So I don't even understand.
[45:44] A: Have you ever seen. There was a long time ago YouTube video about like guns and when there was the second amendment of right to Bear arms. We had muskets, which were horribly inaccurate and took a really long time. So there's a guy that goes in to workplace violence, and he's got a musket, and he fires it, and then you see him, like, taking the powder out. Yeah.
[46:06] B: Yeah. I don't understand.
[46:10] A: Okay, so there's a bunch of stuff with that. That's got stuff attached to it. We want that going.
[46:17] B: So when my dad got out of prison, we moved in with grandma and grandpa, which is his stepparents.
[46:22] A: Same people that did the same stuff.
[46:23] B: Yeah.
[46:24] A: Oh, good.
[46:24] B: Yeah.
[46:26] A: So after jail, we moved back in with them.
[46:29] B: We moved into the step grandpa and grandmother. We moved in with them. So we left one grandpa, moved into the new grandpa. And I didn't tell my dad because I didn't want dad to go away type thing, so. Because.
[46:41] A: So then the new grandpa was doing it.
[46:43] B: Yeah. Again, I wound up getting. I wound up just leaving. My dad wound up kicking me out when I was, like, 15 because I got the boyfriend and found a way to get out of there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Literally. So I found a way to get away from it. That was my way to go away from it.
[46:57] A: And I'm sure that boyfriend was a prey guy, actually.
[47:01] B: He was like. I say. I say that. And I mean. I mean that because.
[47:06] A: No, he was. Because he would be the rescuer.
[47:08] B: Yeah.
[47:08] A: Right. Rescuers tend to be good guys. That doesn't mean that later on in life I continue to get rescuers. But in that moment, at that age.
[47:15] B: Right.
[47:16] A: And he was around that age, too. Yeah.
[47:18] B: He's a year older than me.
[47:19] A: Okay. So that would make sense. And he was a decent guy.
[47:22] B: Yes, very decent. His family was health. What I saw was healthy, and I still see them as healthy.
[47:27] A: Way healthier than yours. Definitely.
[47:30] B: It was like, my hell is at my house. And then I went to their house, and they love each other and give hugs, and I'm going, these people are weird. You know, literally. So they. That was probably the first experience I had with an actual. An actual family.
[47:43] A: Yeah.
[47:43] B: And they helped me, and we got married and all that great stuff. And then I went back. Back to my family and screwed the marriage up.
[47:49] A: So.
[47:50] B: Yeah, it's not a, you know, thing, but I mean, that's literally what happened in a nutshell. So.
[47:55] A: Yeah. Yeah. Got bombed by them again. Damn it.
[47:59] B: Yeah.
[48:00] A: Yeah.
[48:00] B: Because my dad pulls the I'm the oldest, it's my responsibility card. And that was something he always instilled.
[48:06] A: Oldest of siblings.
[48:07] B: Yeah.
[48:07] A: Oh, okay.
[48:08] B: Yeah.
[48:09] A: And it was because you had five kids? Six.
[48:11] B: Six. Yeah.
[48:12] A: And how many siblings?
[48:13] B: Just one. I have a younger sister, she's two years younger.
[48:16] A: That's it?
[48:16] B: Yeah. No, I have an older brother. I've just never met him before. He's from some other marriage with my dad, so I'm the oldest with this that he's raised.
[48:23] A: Yeah. Too bad you couldn't say that to dad. No, dad, I'm actually the middle, so it doesn't rely on me.
[48:28] B: Right.
[48:29] A: That would have been so much better.
[48:30] B: That was really screwed up. Is my dad. And I don't know if this is true or not, but my dad is gang affiliated. So he instilled in me that I was going to carry out his legacy. I didn't learn until I was older that that legacy is non existent because I'm a female. I don't, you know, it doesn't happen. So that was something that I was brought up with. Him doing and dealing with things like in a very violent way.
[48:53] A: Yeah.
[48:54] B: And I see that that's okay. And it's. I saw that that was okay. I know that it's not okay now.
[48:59] A: I mean, isn't that cool?
[49:00] B: Yeah.
[49:01] A: Yeah. Good job.
[49:02] B: Yeah. So I just, I need to.
[49:06] A: So we need to detangle and unravel the crap that got stuck with family.
[49:12] B: Yeah.
[49:13] A: So that you get more freedom there.
[49:14] B: I think so.
[49:15] A: That would be useful. Okay. I know how to do that. Right. Because here, that plays right into the next part. Because not only do we have bad shit that happens that gets stuck, brain doesn't know it's over. Meanings get attached to the bad stuff. So our brain immediately. When we're little children, we're lied to by all people in authority. Right. They tell us, first, life is good. If I'm good, life will be good. I get to live happily ever after. Stories, movies, TV shows, books, all engineer the same messaging for children. Good happens because I'm good.
[49:49] B: Yeah, but they lie to you your first 10 years of life and tell you Santa Claus is real and all this shit.
[49:53] A: Correct. But here's the problem with that. If we tell kids life is good and that good things happen when they're good, the opposite also has to be true. Bad things only happen when I'm bad. No.
[50:06] B: Bad things happen even when you're good.
[50:08] A: Yes, but that's not what we learned when we were little. Bad things only happen when I'm bad. I was drawing on the wall with a Sharpie. Mommy saw it. Mommy was pissed. Mommy grabbed me. Mommy spanked me. Ah. I was doing something I wasn't supposed to do something bad happened to me. Bad things happen when I'm being bad, right? We learned that when we're little. So now we go through moments. Oh, and then we add layers to it. Because it doesn't just be what we learned. It literally goes back to the two creation story, Adam and Eve. You know it's Eve's fault, right?
[50:42] B: Yeah, I do.
[50:43] A: I mean, Eve talked to the snake, got the dim apple. I mean, it's totally fucking Eve's fault. I am a guy if Eve says to me, brandy. If Eve, you know, covered up with some leaves, right?
[50:57] B: They hadn't got that for you. She's just naked.
[50:59] A: Well, even better if Eve goes, hey, man, you want some of this? You gotta have some of that. I'm going, I'll eat the apple. I want some of it. Right? Like I'm a guy. That's why guys don't get blamed. Well, you know, she was wearing the revealing top. She did drink a lot, right? Oh, so that made it okay to rape her?
[51:18] B: Well, well, yeah. And then that's what she said, but that's.
[51:22] A: Yes, it totally made it okay. She was drinking, she showed her cleavage. Isn't that what it means? No. Totally her fault again. Right? So we live in the world that it's always the woman's fault, right? Always her fault.
[51:32] B: My dad has actually put that in my.
[51:34] A: A lot in my head. Got it. And that when bad things happen, it's because there's something wrong. Wrong in me. So it must have something to do with my lovability or whether I'm good enough. Right? Even with things that don't make sense, right? Like my mom and dad were crackheads and I got adopted into a decent family. I didn't get that looking, right. No, not everybody does.
[52:02] B: Yeah.
[52:03] A: But even if I did, I'm still thinking, well, if they really love me, if I was truly worth it, maybe I wouldn't have been adopted. Even though I know that the adoption is the best thing that ever happened, I'm still going. But if they really love me, if I truly mattered, maybe they wouldn't be, you know, crackheads.
[52:23] B: Mine's a little more complicated.
[52:25] A: I'm not talking about you. Okay, Right, So I'm not talking about you. But I want to give you the example. Example of something other than you. Because when we look at it over here, we get distance. Distance provides clarity. It's harder for me to see something that close if I get it further away. Of course, now, at a certain age, I do a Trombone. When I reach it.
[52:44] B: Right, yeah. Because you get to see where it's focused at the best. I understand. I just got these glasses, so like if it's up close, I have to pull them out.
[52:51] A: Yeah, right.
[52:52] B: Yeah, I got it.
[52:54] A: Yeah. So. So. So that's the part that all of the bad stuff that happens on an internal level feels like it has something to do with me. Maybe I deserved it, right? Nobody's shocked when the girl who got the ride home from the guy that she knew from work and then he raped her. Nobody's shocked when she blames herself for having been so stupid. She should have known better, I think. Like that, right? Like, so those messages are stuck. If it's bad, it's about me and not me, my behavior, me. Like identity, right? That's where the unworthy, unlovable, not good enough. I deserve, like all that shit shows up once those two things are stuck. The brain is now hyper, vigilant and super sensitive, looking for things that are similar or anything that occurred at the same time as it confusing it all the same, right? The soldier dies on the ground. Firework bursts. Well, he's the guy that lit the firework. Yeah. A whole other part confused the sound. Right? Somebody goes out on a date and the guy seemed to be a decent guy. They had lots of great conversations, but when they met for the first time, he was wearing the cologne that stepdad who used to molest me wore.
[54:21] B: Yeah, that's a creepy situation.
[54:24] A: Right? But the issue when I was 11 wasn't what he smelled like, it was what he did to me. Right? But because it co occurred, it gets stuck together. Right? Different times of day, I drive by a hotel that's got a similar name. I'm in this environment, I go by that road. All can be triggers, make sense only because aspects of my brain don't know earlier awful events are over. Right. Once that happens, my lens opens up more. Instead of being this narrow, trying to navigate through life in an over agitated, anxious way, I settle down, I open up. I see things with distance and space. I'm more settled inside. My brain is no longer confusing similar as same. It's seeing the difference. It's similar, right? So the guy's making out with the gal, he's turned on, she's turned on, he's into her, she's into him. They've been dating, this is their time. They're really wanting to. She touches and he does this and he's like, what the hell's wrong with me? Right? This girl who I'M totally into. Who's totally into me is one and I did. Yeah, but is there any similarity to uncle at 1110 hand? Yeah, but this is nice. Dainty female hand. That was grubby sausage finger, man. Yeah, it doesn't matter. It's a freaking hand. Got it. So all of that stuff can get confused only when the brain emotionally doesn't know events are over. When the brain knows that it's over, it no longer sees similar as identical. It sees the difference in the similarity. Okay.
[56:21] B: So it's being attention to instead of the similar.
[56:23] A: Not you, but in the background. So think of it more like we all have fire detectors in our house, but not because we someday think it'll catch on fire. But we're also not naive enough to think it never would. Right. They're there to let us know if it does at the earliest sign of smoke. That's what it's supposed to let us know. We don't typically pay attention to. So how we're interested in organizing your system is that it's on in the background. It's not something that you consciously have to pay attention to or tell yourself, or I need to think this way or do that thing or act like this or snap the rubber band so that I can find my happy place and pray it's none of that. Okay. We want the automatic preconscious part of your brain to be more responsive. What that means is naturally work more in the way that you want it to. Got it?
[57:21] B: Yes.
[57:21] A: Right. So I noticed multitudes of different times as we've been talking. As different things have popped. There were different emotions that you were experiencing as you expressed stuff. So I bet watch. Think about any of that negative stuff. Feel just a little bit of the bad feelings now. Right. Notice how it doesn't take a long time. Right. But you did it on purpose. And the interesting thing is, Brandy, that wouldn't be a problem if that kind of stuff only happened when you chose to do it. Got it. Problem brain's been doing it to you at times that you're not choosing. That's the error. That's the major malfunction. Therefore, the you that I'm seeing when we're done, that kind of stuff. This you, she remembers having all of it. But if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't know how to get it. It's clear and it's gone. The you that I'm seeing is much more emotionally present. She's much lighter. There's much more comfort inside. She reads emotionally other People's garbage as being about them and based on the situation and scenario and who it's with, based on context. Right. She might be more compassionate, caring and understanding. At other times, she might be more firm and directive or dismissive. At other times, she might just go off. At other times, it just might slide by. Right. But it's all context dependent in terms of where she is and what it's about. Makes sense. So it's a little more nuanced than all on, all off. There's room to flow. Right. So this is where we're headed. Got it. The impact of the prior stuff, that over reactivity, that more negative, critical around, that's all cleared and gone. So think of it more like you're much more uptime, outwardly focused, present. Right. Where there's flexibility at times to simply be still getting things done. See, what would it be like for you to be still getting things done? I know you don't, do you? Right. But as we think about that being still getting things done, it's not about not doing right. It's about us doing things at an automatic level that begins to quiet the thoughts that you're not even choosing to think, they're just popping. Right? Right.
[60:06] B: That's what happens when I sit.
[60:08] A: You haven't been choosing those thoughts. You're not even the thinker of them. Your brain is. Your brain isn't you. It's yours. We want your brain to be working more in the way you and I want it to. That would be more optimal for you. Right. So you're not your brain, which is a weird thing, but you're also not your body. You have a body. Your body is totally yours, but it isn't you. Right. My mom lost the tip of her index finger when she sees people. Now they don't say, suzanne, I'm glad almost all of you could come over.
[60:45] B: I'm sorry.
[60:47] A: Right.
[60:52] B: Right, right.
[60:53] A: She's all there, even if part of her body is missing. So you have a body, totally yours, but it isn't you. Right? So you're not your body or your thoughts. You also aren't your feelings, even though you have them. Because you feel different ways even though you're you. Right? You can't be what you do. Because when you stop doing one thing to do something else, you don't stop existing. So the weirder question becomes, if you're not what you do, your thoughts, your feelings are your body, what are you?
[61:29] B: I like how you say it, but.
[61:31] A: Let'S think for a moment. Remember a time in your life, when you were outside in a natural setting and you look up and out and you see something that's just beautiful. Like the moment you're looking at it, it's like captured your awareness. You're like, what is it that you see?
[61:48] B: Landscapes.
[61:51] A: A specific one.
[61:55] B: I don't have one that actually exists. It's just in my head. Oh, it's my sacred space.
[62:00] A: Oh, beautiful. And as you see that landscape, right. What's in it in your mind's eye.
[62:07] B: It has big elephant ears.
[62:08] A: Yeah.
[62:09] B: There's wisteria.
[62:10] A: Yeah.
[62:10] B: I have a bench I sit on.
[62:12] A: Yeah. Beautiful.
[62:13] B: And I can see the sky.
[62:14] A: Right. And as you're seeing it, are you seeing you sitting on the bench or is it more looking through your own eyes?
[62:20] B: I'm seeing me sit there.
[62:21] A: Yeah. So wonder what happens when you see. See it through your own eyes.
[62:25] B: I gotta plan it first.
[62:26] A: Well, no, I don't think you do. You see the wisteria and the elephant ears in your mind's eye. Not seeing you seeing it, but literally you just seeing it, Right. Notice what starts to happen there. Begins to have more of a sense of calm and peace. See, when people see things out in nature, or whether it's in their mind's eye that beautiful. There's a moment that in that moment, their awareness is drawn down and in towards their center. Because most people say it's that location, it's that place that causes this in you. That's not wrong. But again, what if we looked at it differently? That what makes my hand hot, right. Isn't the fire. The fire doesn't get any hotter. It's my hand moving closer to the flames. And if I moved it closer and I said, boy, Brandy, the fire's hotter, you'd say, it's not any hotter than it was. You're closer to it. Right? So in those moments when you're in that peaceful moment of seeing that landscape where the elephant ears in the wisteria, right. In the sky, in the patch you're sitting and you're seeing, there's moments where you're feeling. Feeling a sense of more peace and excitement in that moment, again, awareness is drawn in and you're experiencing more of a capital S sell, Right. I work with people all the time and they have lots of stuff that happen, Right. I remember one kid that I worked with, her brother's best friend used to do stuff to her, right. And there was a couple times he was a drummer that he took his drumstick, right? And so there was a lot of Yuck. Around all of that, as we worked together, we cleared all the discomfort, the pain, the yuck, it's gone. And I asked her, I go, all that. I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone. I go, I know, it's cool, right? I go, but where was it? We're like, well, was it intellectual? No. Was it here? No. Where was it? Oh, it was hiding behind shadows, that there's a light of knowledge. But in that moment where I'm experiencing that peace, that calm, there's a light of wisdom. And when the shadows move away, the lights connect. They join. Shadows are gone, right? We know that you have a body, but your body isn't yours. It's you. No, sorry, flip it around. You're not your body. Your body is yours, not you. Your thoughts are also your thoughts, but you're not the thinker of them. Your brain is. And your brain sometimes produces problematic thoughts, not because it's out to get you, but because of errors in the way it's been programmed. Got it. So if you're not your body and you're not your thoughts and you're not your feelings and you're not what you do and who you are more is what you become aware of as you see that landscape and the bench and the wisteria and the elephant mirrors and just that pretty sight of the sky, right? That what's happening is awareness is being drawn in, right? So I frequently say, you know that to that girl when you were little, your brother's best friend, he messed with your stuff. And she said, he did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and feeling, so it felt like it was, you know, about me. But then she goes, you know what? He never touched me. He actually never got who I really am. And I said, what do you mean by that? She goes, well, the light at the center. What you talked about that when I'm seeing the beauty and awareness, that light can't be touched in that way. And I said, that's true. That's right. That light can't be touched in that way. They never touched you. They messed with your stuff. They didn't actually get you. And we both went, cool, right? So now, as we do this, we're interested in getting your body, which is already moving. Notice how less nervous and anxious you are now than you were when you walked in, right? So we're moving. We're collaborating. This is a mutual, worthwhile goal, right? So I see a. You where that kind of stuff, it's not going on. She's present. She's uptime. She's outwardly focused. There's more of a sense of comfort and ease and knowing she has what she needs and not at all up here level, but she has what she needs to deal with what might show up so that she's got flexibility in how she navigates her course. She's intentional, but think of water running down a hill. Very rarely is it just the straight line, but the terrain, it moves. It's still intentional. Right. But it's got a flow. Sometimes it might move up and back down. Right. Like, based on this is the you that I'm seeing. More of that peace, that flow that he gets. Got it. You don't have to see this. You, by the way, just like me. Right. The question, Brandy, isn't how it's going to happen that we get you here. It's would it be okay with you?
[67:59] B: Yes.
[67:59] A: Notice how with it. Okay, we've already got a green light. Brain starts to organize. Now we put body into the right states. Even more states of rest. We've got really cool brain levers that neuroscientists have shown put body in states of rest. First lever, coolest lever ever. Slightly lowering the jaw just a little. When you slightly lower your jaw, maybe the width of an index finger, what it does is it stimulates and activates the vagal nerve in our body, Beginning to put the body in a more parasympathetic response. So you slightly lower your jaw. Then second lever is you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. When you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, it starts to turn down some of that internal talk dialogue and begin to satiate the body. The third lever is shifting how you breathe. So now we're going to breathe in a way that's just a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale, so that when you exhale, you can exhale just a little bit longer. Right. So go ahead and slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, and now begin to breathe in a way that's just a little bit slower, a little bit deeper on the inhale so that as you exhale, it's a little bit longer. Right. And as you're starting to breathe in this way, check inside. How's your body feeling now? Right. Notice how it's calmer. The next lever we did a little bit of. But we're going to move us from highly anxious states and agitated states of narrowed vision, Highly elevated beta waves down through beta, which we have for conversation. And communication down into alpha. Alpha is a pipeline that opens up to other deeper brain processes. But alpha is this state of flow. Alpha is this state of what athletes call being in the zone. It's alert, relaxed, but it's wide open, right? So how it works is you look at me, you lower your jaw, you rest your tongue, you breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. As you do this. You see me in my nose. You see my fingers, but stay looking at my nose. As my fingers move out, as they move all the way out, notice with the sides of your eyes, you can see the fingers wiggling. That's right. You are connecting now to more of the space in this room. The space that's between us and beyond me, the space behind you, the space that's to your right, into your lap. But the space that's underneath and up above towards the ceiling. And as you, brandy, connect to more space, notice what's happening in your body, right? How's your body feeling now? It is, isn't it? And then the last one. Because we tend to get under a lot of stress, right? People say that all the time. I'm under a lot of stress. We know that the stress might must be above and on top of me. That the reversal is to get out from under it and rise up above it, right? Having a bird's eye view, seeing it under and below me. So one last time, your jaw is slightly lowered and you rest your tongue. You breathe in this way that's a little bit slower and deeper. That's right. Exhale. Keeps getting slightly longer than inhale. You see me, you see my fingers all the way out. They're wiggling. You notice space, space in this room, Space between us. Behind me, behind you. Under, up above, to your right, to your left. Space also goes beyond the room. Like literally all the way out in all directions. That the space is truly unending. Right. Now go ahead and close your eyes, and you'll notice that with your eyes closed, you can sense probably more of the space, Hearing the sounds behind you. Imagine what it's like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof so that you rise way, way, way up above it all in the sky, you're having a bird's eye view. You see it all as being underneath and below you because you're above and over it. You're free like the bird to fly, to glide with the wind, to flap and soar in any direction, to move, to just be free. Soaring. Flying. Big turns, arching angles. Flying free. Gliding. Soaring. Flapping. That's right. Bring awareness back down and into your body so that you re associate inside you. Take a nice. That's right, deep breath in. And then when you're ready, exhale and open your eyes. Right? And again. In those short moments eyes were closed, what were you noticing within yourself? You are, aren't you? So your body is going to stay more and more in this calm and neutral state. Your unconscious is going to start now, scanning back through moments in life of things that were negative. One, you remember ones that have been long time forgotten. Ones that I never. It's going to group and categorize moments. Then when we request it, it'll bring a moment to your awareness for us to unplug. But before we do that, I want to explain two things. The way you unplug trauma. One, when it happens, all the energy that was being used is released. That released energy is recycled for renewative, restorative, healing energy. Two, when the glitch is rewired and the program's working right, the same situations that normally would aren't running bad in me anymore. Got it. Three, we want you to be present. So the easiest thing about clearing anything that was troubling is be here with me. Because this is and that isn't. We're working on a mutual goal, right? I'm a happening guy. This is what's happened, right? So we want you here. Second, with all negative experiences, there have been moments after it that had to have been at least a little more enjoyable. Whether they be moments right after it or moments years or decades later. There are moments that happen later that were more enjoyable wherever a moment froze. That part of the brain doesn't know about any of the more joyful moments. So that's part of the good news. And then the last little thing is really stupid and silly, but I'm going to say it anyway. There's a way to unplug stuff. Because if the brain, right, is reading the memory as if it is the experience, they're glued together. We need to have a way to separate the experience from the memory about the experience. Because the memory about something is not the same thing as the something. Got it? Part of the brain doesn't. You do. So we have silly games that we play that get it in to that part of the brain with a pattern of association, right? Because it's not logical. If it was logical, it would have already gotten it. It's not logical, but it does get patterns. So a silly pattern is putting your sandals on. You did it somewhere earlier today, and you can probably remember where you were when you did it. But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your sandals on, and then I went, brandi, stop putting on your sandals. That's what you would say. But you would also say, not putting on my sandals. Right? Because they're already on. Right. You know, there's a difference between the remembering, you putting on your sandals and you actually putting them on. Right. Just like if I said to you, remember putting your glasses on, Brandi, stop putting on your glasses. You'd go, I'm not putting on my glasses. Because, you know, there's a difference between the memory of the experience and the experience itself. So it's more of a. I'm not. You're not. It's not. It no longer exists. We want that part of the brain to realize, I'm not putting my shirt on. You're not putting on your glasses. It's not happening, whatever the bad experience was, because again, once the brain gets that it no longer exists, feelings go away. Like, it's awesome. Which reminds you, I have to write something down for a while because I forgot this. I'll do it in this. Remind me to get magic tricks out tonight at 5pm Sorry. We are going to a Great Gatsby, whatever that is. Roaring 20s.
[77:58] B: Yeah.
[77:58] A: Party. And I play around with magic, so I wanted to bring, like, a half a dozen things that I could.
[78:08] B: You haven't seen the movie the Great Gatsby?
[78:10] A: Ah, Jesus. I don't know.
[78:14] B: It's.
[78:15] A: Is Leonardo DiCaprio in it?
[78:17] B: Yes.
[78:18] A: I've not seen that one. Maybe I should watch that tonight. Maybe.
[78:21] B: At least do the rundown on Google. He takes on the identity of another person who he looked up to as a role model. And this person is very successful, and he isn't. So he takes on that person's responsibility and becomes somebody that the love of his life could actually be with.
[78:39] A: Oh, wow.
[78:40] B: And they live across the lake or the bay or something like that.
[78:43] A: So, yeah, it's pretty impressive.
[78:46] B: Elaborate parties to try to get her, who is now married, to come to him and.
[78:52] A: All right, I'll watch that tonight. Okay, cool. So we're doing one of those parties. So I got my outfit. I'm good. We'll see what happens. I'll watch that. I don't know. But anyway, I'm gonna have, like, a jacket. So I'll put, like, some magic stuff. That'd be fun to remember to do that. I was supposed to do that. Last weekend I forgot to pull it all out. So I gotta practice a little bit tonight before I go tomorrow. Okay. So notice the silly game that we want to play is we're really just doing stuff to get that part of the brain, emotional part, to know it's over. Right. So watch. You can know where we're headed. That other than conscious part can travel back. It'll travel back. Back, back, back, back. It's already gathered. It'll bring a moment to mind, one that we tend to not like to think about because it makes me uncomfortable. Right. What moment comes to mind? When my dad found out you got that moment. Good. That happened how long ago? I was five. Five. Right. So you were five. Right. And it was when dad found out. Good. So how we clear something? One, you stay with me. Two, we say just the facts so quickly. That happened. That happened. That happened. That happened. That happened, that happened, that happened. That was done. Three, if that happened when you were five, what's something after that? Anytime from five until yesterday that was more enjoyable than that.
[80:21] B: Having a daughter.
[80:22] A: Yeah. Having your daughter, way more fun. Good. Something else. Yeah. Right. Good. One other thing.
[80:27] B: Graduation.
[80:28] A: Yeah. Graduated high school. All those things happen after that. Part of your brain doesn't know they have good news to get in. So when that moment happened. You're five. You're five. You're where? So you're at your dad's house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[80:40] B: Nighttime.
[80:40] A: Nighttime. Anywhere in the house? In the living room. Like on a couch or a chair. You were standing up. Right. And he was where?
[80:49] B: Standing up too.
[80:50] A: Right. So dad was standing. So you were like down here and they were up there?
[80:53] B: Yeah, he was laying down. We were giving goodnights.
[80:56] A: So dad was laying on the couch Maybe.
[80:57] B: Yeah.
[80:58] A: Right. So you were going over to say goodnight. Right. And you were with who?
[81:04] B: I think it was just he and.
[81:05] A: I. Yeah, just he and you. So you were going to say goodnight. Right. Then what happened next?
[81:09] B: I went and given a kiss, but my mouth was open. And that's how he realized there was something wrong.
[81:13] A: So your mouth was open. Right. And he'd like what?
[81:16] B: He was like, why are you kissing me like that?
[81:17] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right. And then when I happen next, he flipped out. Well, he did what?
[81:23] B: He started yelling. He wanted to know what happened. He had a kiss like that.
[81:27] A: All right. Good job, good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[81:30] B: He called my mom.
[81:31] A: Right.
[81:32] B: And she come in and said some. Something about attention.
[81:35] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[81:37] B: Punched her in the face.
[81:38] A: And then you punched mom in the face.
[81:39] B: He did.
[81:39] A: No, he punched mom in the. Right. And that was weird and scary. Right. And then what happened next? How you doing right now?
[81:44] B: I'm good.
[81:44] A: Yeah? You're here. That cool? Yeah. Right? Yeah. Then what happened next?
[81:49] B: He threw her out of the house.
[81:50] A: Right. Good. And then what happened? I don't remember. Right. Because the mind likes to stop the story at shitty spots. Eventually, mom might have come back ever, you know, from five until.
[82:01] B: No, actually.
[82:03] A: Well, we do know something that did happen later. Do you want to know what it is? You had your daughter.
[82:08] B: Yeah.
[82:08] A: And your son. Right. And you graduated high school. Right. So we got noticed. You got graduating high school. Right. The mind stops the story at bad moments. Worst part, Mom's gone. What happened next? I don't know. Like horror movies, stopping at worst part.
[82:24] B: I think the next part I remember is being a doctor.
[82:27] A: Right. Right. And then what happened next? I don't know. Right. I know. Our mind stops storing shitty spots. So then that moment ended later on. You had your daughter and your son, and you graduated high school. So the crazy part about memory, Weird, weird, weird. We never go backwards. We only go forward with the memory. We never go in reverse. But when you do, it literally unplugs it and takes away the charge. So we go backwards, right? So we've got, you know, having son, having daughter, graduating high school. Right. Then we'd had that whole rape kit, and he had somehow gotten there. And then mom left, and then dad. Then she'd gotten up, and then dad had punched her in the face. And then she said, it's probably just attention. And then dad was like, screaming, yawn. How this happened? Who the hell told you? Who showed you that? And then you had. And then he was like, what the hell? Right? And then you went to kiss him. Midnight. And then before that, you probably got ready for bed. Then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing, right. As we go backwards compared to forward emotionally. I wasn't.
[83:28] B: I think it was okay.
[83:29] A: Yeah. Notice how it was a little bit less going backwards. Right. Because your brain is beginning to go, oh, that's data about something that happened. Oh, that's not happening. Oh. Oh, that's not. Oh, that's cool. That's not happening. Your brain is turning to get that. Right? So then the second part, right, is what we just did, the silly thing. Because you can remember that happening. You can remember dad screaming, yelling, mad at you, mad at what happened, mad at mom, mad. Right. You can remember all that happening? Right. You can also remember putting your sandals on today, right? Brandi, stop putting on your sandals. Say, I'm not putting on my sandals. Right. You can just say, I'm not putting on my sandals. Right. Well, stop putting on your glasses. I'm not putting on my glasses. Right. Well, then stop dad from screaming and yelling. Say dad's not screaming and yelling. Well, then you stop trying to kiss him with your mouth open. Say, I'm not trying to do that. Well, then you stop putting on your jeans. I'm not putting on my jeans. Well, stop dad from punching Mom. Say he's not punching Mom. Well, then stop that from happening, though. It's not happening. Right. So then where does it say it doesn't exist? Right. Right. It's not happening now. Right. And as you're getting that it's not happening, what's happening inside? You are, aren't you? Right. Last little piece. Did that have anything to do with you? Notice how it's taken a long time to figure that out?
[84:42] B: Yeah.
[84:43] A: Because all that feeling is like, yeah, no, fucking did have a lot to do with me. Notice how it didn't have anything to do with you. Dad's reaction. Dad punching Mom. Mom's reaction. None of that had anything to do with you. Right. Had everything to do with whatever was going on with dad, with mom, whoever that person was at the time. That. Right. Had nothing to do with you. Dad's anger was like, who did something to my kid? Knowing that that would be weird, that my kid would be kissing that way unless somebody showed my. Right. Right. So where it felt, I'm sure, a little bit dad was mad, and it felt like dad was mad at me.
[85:21] B: He was mad at mom and mom because mom didn't believe me.
[85:26] A: Yeah. But he was also a little bit mad at me because he was upset that it happened.
[85:31] B: Yeah.
[85:32] A: Right. So there was a part of it that would have felt dad being angry is because of me, even though he's angry at Mom. Right. And for a different reason. Mom didn't believe me, but dad was also mad at me for what happened to me. Right. We know that dad wasn't mad at you for what happened to you, but in that moment that dad was being mad, I don't really distinguish me from an action that happened to me. Right. Like, if the enlightened parents is, I'm not really mad at you.
[86:06] B: I'm mad at what you did.
[86:08] A: Feels like you're really mad at me.
[86:11] B: I didn't understand that until I had kids either. I was like, I don't get that.
[86:13] A: But.
[86:13] B: Okay.
[86:15] A: Follow me. So that you felt like it had something to do with you. That you were bad, that you did something wrong. Yeah. It wasn't that something wrong happened to me. Right. There was some of that. But it was more that I did something wrong because something bad happened to me. I shouldn't have had something bad happen to me. I was being bad. Even though, as an adult, you can realize, well, that happening had nothing to do with me. It wasn't like I volunteered.
[86:44] B: I did.
[86:45] A: No, you didn't.
[86:47] B: Instead of going to my sister.
[86:49] A: See, it's so good. But you didn't volunteer. That's not volunteering. Volunteering is that you have the choice whether you do it or not. Right. So either you come and do this thing with me, or I cut your kid's foot off. Well, then I'll volunteer. Right? No. That's not volunteering. Follow me. Like, there's no freedom to choose whether I do it or not. Like, volunteers. I go volunteer at the soup kitchen. That means I can or I can't. Yeah. I don't have to if I don't want to. Right. There was no volunteering. There was protection. Right. I've already had this thing happen. I know how to get through it. Right. It's why we have people who have gone to war, lead others going into war. Not just have they already done it, they also made it through it. Right. They don't have the people that didn't come back leading.
[87:51] B: Right. Make it through. Got you.
[87:56] A: Right. So that's what there was. But there was no choice.
[87:59] B: Okay.
[88:00] A: Right. There was no volunteering. Right. Have you ever watched Hunger Games? I have. Right. Don't they do the thing where, you know, she takes the role of the little kid? I'll. I'll step in for her. Yeah. That's not volunteering.
[88:14] B: Right. That's true.
[88:18] A: It looked like. Wow. He was volunteering. No, There was no volunteering there. It's like, I can handle it better than you can.
[88:25] B: Yeah.
[88:26] A: Right. And Katniss definitely could handle it better than the other kid.
[88:29] B: Yes.
[88:29] A: Got it. Same thing with you. Makes sense. Right? So, again, what we want to do is we want that younger you to know, a. That moment's over. That it no longer exist. That dad being upset had nothing to do with you. That mom not believing had nothing to do with you. Right. Had everything to do with what was fucked up with them. And we now know that there's a shitload of stuff that was fucked up with them.
[88:53] B: Yeah.
[88:54] A: Right. That I didn't know when I was five. Yeah, right. I didn't have the access of going to this other person's house and go, wow, look, they actually hug each other. Huh? And they say love you when you walk out the door. What the. You know, weird, man.
[89:08] B: That's literally.
[89:09] A: They're way too touchy feely for me.
[89:11] B: Why is your mom hugging me?
[89:12] A: Yeah. Right?
[89:13] B: Yeah.
[89:14] A: My mom doesn't even hug me. Right. So we didn't know how screwed up they were then that you felt like it had something to do with you. Did you do anything wrong? No. Even in how it came out. Did you do anything wrong? No. You didn't even know you were doing something that wasn't okay. Got it. In kissing dad. Right. You didn't know all that then. So we want you, the adult, to re educate. Right. Because you didn't get good parenting. We can give you the opportunity to do good parenting to the younger you. So that she begins to learn it wasn't about me. Had nothing to do with me. That it's over. That I'm okay. That for the first time I'm really at choice. I'm really at a co creation of a new way of living distinctly different from how it was that I get to co create how I want to be. Right. I don't want to be the woman that has that kind of reactivity to stuff. Right. Got it. So we want to add these four words because they're powerful. You're going to say them after me. Ready? It's. It's not about me. Right? It's not about right. Now close your eyes. Picture the younger you. Let her know, of course the moment is over, finished, completed, defeated. It no longer exists. Let her know that that stuff happening had nothing to do with you. It had nothing to do with me. It wasn't about me at all. Dad's anger, Mom's not believing the guy had nothing to do with me. Right. And nothing to do it wouldn't matter whether it was me or somebody else that same age in that same situation. That's the fucking shit that would have happened. So she gets it's not about me. Right? Let that you know that you're okay. Let her know how long you've been clean. Let her know that you're really taking an active role in co creating a new and better life for you. So that she gets it. Let her know about having her daughter or son. Let her know about graduating high school. Let her know so that she's getting it. What's happening to the earlier you notice how the tearfulness that's showing up right now isn't of sadness. Check it out. Is it? No, no. Notice how it's more relief. Yeah. So that maybe we could lighten up a little bit on you. You didn't choose to have the experience happen to you that led you to do all sorts of things that later on you wish you hadn't done, got you got groomed and led down a path that you couldn't not do certain things based on what happened to you. Right now you're in the driver's seat. We're doing work to heal those emotional wounds so that you get to be a co creator and more directive in how you want life to go. That sometimes in certain things, because this is what I want, I do things that are less than desirable. Like, not every basketball team loves to do wind sprints, but they gotta run to half court and run back and then run 3/4 court and run back and then run all the way down to the end and then run back. Right. They'd rather shoot hoops. They'd rather play five on five or heck, even one on one. They'd rather just shoot a layup or a free throw. But they get that part of being a part of this team is I gotta do the other stuff too. Because it fits what we want, what I want for me, which is to get better at this, to become more conditioned to. Right? That's what you're doing now. You're in the process of co creating how you want your life to go that's distinctly different and better than it's ever been. Right. As that earlier you is getting it all. What do you notice happening to her face? Well, is she looking so sad? She doesn't, does she? Right, Right. And see, it's also why, Brandi, you're okay in this moment of not seeing kids because you also want to be the best version of you. And know that you've changed in ways that are beneficial. Know that you've done the things that actually shift. Right. You can open your eyes and again, just check inside side. Okay. Checking from your head down chest and heart, down belly, from your throat to your tail. What are you noticing now? Okay. Right. Notice how this is very different than it's ever been when you've thought about that. Right. Isn't that cool?
[95:12] B: Very cool.
[95:13] A: Yeah.
[95:14] B: Scary, but cool.
[95:15] A: What's scary about it?
[95:16] B: Because it actually worked. Oh, I mean, like, I didn't. I don't mean that in a rude way. That came out probably wrong.
[95:22] A: But like, God, I thought you were just like this charlatan that I was gonna leave.
[95:35] B: I was just skeptical on if you'd be able to help. And you did.
[95:40] A: Thank you. Yeah. We're not done. Right? We're not done. We're on our way. Right. But notice how your body's still staying. Right. Because where are you? Here. Yeah. Notice how that's a little quieter. Right? Why? That's right. You're here. We're gaining more practice in being here. Now, not past. Back then, not future. Might. My highly sensitive daughter has a lot of forecasting the future, bad scenarios.
[96:24] B: I understand that.
[96:25] A: Right. And what we're getting her to do is when we get her to forecast and her stomach starts getting all upset about that, what if this thing happens and then we get her back to being now? Because even if it does happen, there's nothing for her to do about it now. And then when we get her back to being now, her stomach stops burning. Right. So we're doing probably processes again. That other than conscious part is going to travel back to another moment, an experience, and it'll bring another for us to clear what comes to mind. Now.
[97:08] B: Dad's at prison and me and my sister.
[97:10] A: You got it. You're about how old? Six.
[97:16] B: First grade.
[97:17] A: So, like you're in first grade, right?
[97:18] B: Yeah.
[97:19] A: And you and your sister was it after school?
[97:22] B: Yeah, we were home.
[97:23] A: Right. So you're home after school. Right. And then what happened? And it's your younger sister.
[97:27] B: Yeah.
[97:27] A: Right. And she's like two years younger.
[97:29] B: Yeah.
[97:30] A: So it's like six and four.
[97:31] B: Yeah.
[97:31] A: Yeah. Right.
[97:33] B: I don't know that anything. I think mom just wasn't there.
[97:36] A: Right.
[97:36] B: Realized mom wasn't there, wasn't gonna be there.
[97:38] A: Right, right. And then you realized it was up to me to do what we needed to do to get fed.
[97:44] B: Yeah.
[97:45] A: And you know, get to bed.
[97:47] B: Yeah.
[97:48] A: Right, right. You can remember that, right? As you were remembering it? There's discomfort. Right. What you don't know after that is that you handled that and managed it. Right. Second thing, what you don't know is about your daughter and your son, how to graduate in high school and actually coming to a program where you're valuing you. Right. Because we have to value you in order to be okay. And allowing others to contribute, which actually brings joy to them. My mom said a thing when I was a little kid, whenever I was feeling bad or depressed or angry or upset or frustrated, she'd go, go be a contribution to somebody else. Go do something for somebody. It'll make you Feel better. Go open the door for the lady at the grocery store. Interesting.
[98:40] B: Yes.
[98:41] A: Right. So we know all of these things now, right? That you back then 6 thought you needed a mom in order for you to be okay. That you needed her there in order for you guys to. Did you. Right. Did you need moms to be okay in order for you to be a loving mom? Right. So much so that I'm becoming even more at peace with where my kids are, knowing that that's what's best for them now, which is all based on how much I love them. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah, that's amazing. So we want to get this news in to that earlier you. Because you can remember realizing that mom's not there and probably not coming back. It's on your shoulders to take care of a four year old at six. Yeah. Right. You can remember that happening, right. You can also remember putting your glasses on. Well, stop putting on your glasses. Yeah. And stop mom from doing that and go. She's not doing that. Right.
[99:56] B: Where is it?
[99:57] A: It doesn't exist. Right. I'm not. She's not. Where is it? It isn't. If it isn't, where is it? It isn't. It was, it isn't. Now it's done. Right. And as your brain gets that it's done, that it isn't, it no longer exists. What happens to those feelings? Right. Let the you know how capable and competent she is. Right. That she was able to handle that really scary, difficult situation at six. Right. And that independence, meaning not relying on anybody, serves her well then. So we don't want to get rid of independence, self reliance. We keep that in place, Brandi, but we do it where we extend the range that I can also be okay with others contributing. Right. Like it might be okay that, you know, my best friend's dad got me a job at this place. They helped me. It's still up to me to be a good employee. Right. But they contributed. I'm still self reliant, get there early, do the work, stay a little late. Good employee. Right, Got it. Yeah. So as we're looking at this, right, we keep your self reliance, but I'm wondering what it would be like to allow others to contribute. Oh, and I bet you don't realize that you're doing it right now.
[101:49] B: I was just thinking about that actually. I was like, oh, I think I'm trying.
[101:54] A: Like you're literally doing it now because you're totally in this with me. Right. Which requires you allowing somebody else to contribute. Right. What's it like? How's it feel? It's nice. Yeah. To know that you've got like partners and things.
[102:14] B: Yeah.
[102:14] A: Uh huh.
[102:15] B: It's nice. Yeah.
[102:16] A: Still self reliant, right?
[102:19] B: Doesn't change how I am, it just helps me be just okay with it.
[102:26] A: Which changes how you are, changes how you interact, changes how you feel, changes future stuff. Right. That's what's beginning to happen. So again, slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper. Allow awareness to open and notice more space. Right. Close your eyes. Sense the space without seeing the objects. Begin to realize not only did the space go well beyond the confines of this room, that it's always unending in all directions, but you're always made up of mostly space. That's right. As you're noticing more and more of the space as body settling down inside, imagine you floating up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof so that you are way up above it all in the sky. Bird's eye view and free. You're becoming more free to be much lighter and okay in you. Peaceful, clear. All new sorts of seedlings getting planted, lots going on under the surface. You've already seen some manifestations of what it sprouts. Even more is underway because your unconscious will travel back and put bring another moment to your awareness as you find your way back down and inside towards delight at your center. Delight is you peaceful, calm, clear, unconscious travels back, brings a moment now to your awareness. Right. What comes to mind? Landscaping. Landscaping. It's a piece of it, isn't it? Right. I'm going to show you something I think is weird but interesting. Take that hand just a little bit like that. Slide my chair. Take that one like that. You're going to look at that spot right there. Right now I'm going to take my hand, I'm going to move it towards your hand. You're going to see it as you see my hand moving in. And you'll begin to feel the energy from my hand as it moves closer. Notice how you can begin to feel the energy. Isn't that weird? You can feel my hand without it touching your hand? That's right.
[105:37] B: It's creepy.
[105:39] A: So here's the neat part about it. I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body, hurt your feelings or screwed up your thinking. Because who you are, Brandy, can really only be touched with respect. Right. And with your allowance allowing that's Right. Collaborating. Right. As you feel the energy, you're also maybe noticing small little twitches. That's right. Within the fingers. That's right. All of that is going on. Then take a big deep breath in, exhale, close your eyes. And that hand will just drop down and down and down, all the way down at the same speed. You drift down, down and inside. That's right. On the next inhale, go ahead and open your eyes. Notice what happens when we just take this dropping down and this hand just kind of gets looser. And you once again close your eyes and just sink down, melt down, drift down deeper in towards that calm and easy energy. That's right. Because as all of this is happening, bathing your nervous system with new resourceful neurochemicals, changing wiring inside, becoming more okay and at peace. When you're ready, take a deep breath in, exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And what are you noticing now? You are calm. And as you're calm and we're organizing towards the future you again. Another part of the brain is traveling back back down through that timeline. And we'll bring another moment to clear what's coming to mind.
[108:28] B: Now, when we moved into my grandma's.
[108:32] A: Yeah. So you might have been how old? 10. 10, right. Yeah. Dad had gotten out of jail.
[108:39] B: Just got out of prison.
[108:40] A: Right. Or out of prison. Right. There's a difference.
[108:43] B: Yeah. We had to. He come. We didn't know he was getting out.
[108:48] A: Right.
[108:48] B: Showed up with my grandma.
[108:50] A: Yeah. And you were staying with whom then?
[108:52] B: We were at the same trailer my mom had got.
[108:55] A: That's right.
[108:55] B: She hadn't been there in a long time.
[108:57] A: Right. So you and your sister were just hanging up, doing whatever you need to do to survive at the trail. Right? Yeah. Self reliant. So we don't get rid of that. Do you follow me with that? We don't get rid of being self reliant. We keep it. We just add that sometimes it's nice to have a. It's kind of like for women. I always think like, a woman doesn't need a man. A woman needs a man about as much as a fish needs a bicycle. Not at all. The penis wasn't even designed for, you know, fully her pleasure. It was the clitoris. So, like, she doesn't need a man. She doesn't need a man to get groceries. She doesn't need a man to, you know, clean. She doesn't need a man. No. It's nice. She doesn't need a man to take care of her. It's nice for her to feel taken care of by her man. Got it? Not because she needs it. Right. And on the flip side, when a guy does a really good job of taking care of his gal, she takes care of him. Got it? That's the kind of thing that we're organizing. Right. So you didn't know dad came, said, you and Cisco, we're going to. Right? You and dad got in a fight, going, bullshit. I'm not leaving. You can't make me go.
[110:15] B: Yeah.
[110:15] A: I'm 10. Yeah, right. That's right, man. You get it? You get it? I'm 10.
[110:22] B: Literally, that's what happened.
[110:23] A: I've been living on my own since I was six.
[110:25] B: Shit. I slammed the door in his face and he come through the door. He snatched me up, we whooped my ass.
[110:33] A: Right.
[110:33] B: Put us both in the car.
[110:34] A: Right.
[110:36] B: I think he bitched about how much the house was dirty.
[110:39] A: Right? Yeah.
[110:39] B: Wasn't important to me.
[110:41] A: Right.
[110:41] B: So. And then when we got to Grandma's, she put us in a bathtub, right? Took bath, Right.
[110:50] A: Got clean, ate supper. Right.
[110:53] B: When we went to bed.
[110:54] A: Right.
[110:56] B: Dad went downstairs.
[110:58] A: Right.
[110:58] B: And then grandpa came in.
[110:59] A: Grandpa came in the room? Yeah. Were you and sister in the same room? In the bed? Yes. Right, Good. So then he got in the bed. No.
[111:05] B: He come. He put his hand. Put his hand under the sheet.
[111:09] A: Right.
[111:10] B: She said something and called my name.
[111:13] A: Yes.
[111:13] B: And I told him he could come over to me.
[111:15] A: Yes. Right.
[111:16] B: And just leave her alone. And that was.
[111:20] A: And then he came over to you?
[111:21] B: Yeah.
[111:21] A: Right. And then he might have touched your body.
[111:23] B: He touched me? Yeah, he touched me.
[111:25] A: Right. Did he put his finger in your vagina?
[111:26] B: Yes.
[111:27] A: Right. That was all weird.
[111:28] B: Yeah.
[111:28] A: Some of it might have felt good, but still weird.
[111:30] B: Yeah.
[111:30] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[111:32] B: Flipped me over. He put his finger in my butt.
[111:34] A: He put your finger. Right. Good. And that was weird.
[111:36] B: Yeah.
[111:37] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[111:39] B: I don't know.
[111:40] A: Right. Because our mind likes to stop the story at the worst moment.
[111:43] B: Yeah.
[111:44] A: Right. So he's got. Then what happened? I don't know. It just freezes it there. Great. Thanks. Mind.
[111:48] B: Yeah.
[111:49] A: So glad you left off there.
[111:51] B: Crappy. But it's good, I guess.
[111:54] A: I'm glad that you said crappy.
[111:55] B: Yeah.
[111:55] A: Uh huh. Don't get. Right. Exactly. There you go, Grandpa. Right. So then it must have stopped at some point.
[112:05] B: Yeah.
[112:05] A: Right. And then you got up and maybe had breakfast.
[112:08] B: Yeah.
[112:09] A: Right.
[112:10] B: I think we went and got clothes.
[112:12] A: Yeah. Probably got clothes. Right. Which was better than when that was going on. And then later on you had your son and your daughter. Brighton graduated high school. Right. So we had graduated in high school. Having them. Right. Getting clothes. Right. Probably having breakfast, then getting up, and then him stopping. And then he had his finger in your butt. Finger and vagina. He touched your body. Then you had told him to come over, and then she had said something, and then he touched her, and then he'd come in the room, and then you guys had gone to bed, and then you had gotten food, and then before that, bathed, and then you got to Grandma's. Right. And then before that, you're driving there. Dad was driving back. Dad was bitching. And then dad had put you in the car, then he whooped you, and then he had gotten into the trailer, and then you had slammed the door on him. And then he's like, you guys are coming with me. And then he had showed up. And then before that, you and your sister were doing whatever you're doing. Right. And as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, I wasn't.
[112:59] B: It wasn't bad.
[112:59] A: Right, right. You can remember all that happening.
[113:02] B: Yeah.
[113:02] A: Right. You can remember Step Grandpa, whatever, doing all that stuff. Right. You can also remember putting your sandals on. Right. So say he's not doing that.
[113:12] B: Right. Say that he's not doing that.
[113:14] A: Well, then where is it?
[113:15] B: It's not there.
[113:15] A: Right. It's not there. It isn't. Like, is there a place that we can go to to watch it happen? No. Why? Because that experience no longer exists. Right. So then where is it?
[113:24] B: It's just there.
[113:25] A: It isn't. Where is there? Oh, you have a memory of it. Right. Is the memory the same thing as the experience? No. So then where is it? That's right. That's right. Which you didn't fully know that then. And again, that had nothing to do with you. Right, Right. Makes sense. And again, it wasn't volunteering.
[113:47] B: Right.
[113:47] A: Right.
[113:48] B: I think I didn't understand that part of it.
[113:49] A: You follow me with that?
[113:50] B: Yeah.
[113:51] A: Okay. We're gonna shoot your sister. Okay. I'll go.
[113:55] B: Yeah. Right. I didn't think of it like that. Makes a lot of sense. Where'd my common sense go on that? Thank you.
[114:04] A: Right. But look how brave she is. And courageous. Right. Vulnerable is courage. There's no act of courage without it. Right. We say the guy is amazing because he ran across the battlefield and saved his best friend. He's courageous. He's brave. He was really vulnerable as he was running across.
[114:34] B: Yeah. I was gonna say it just makes him an easy shot.
[114:37] A: Right. He was really vulnerable yeah. Right. Right. So look how strong she is. And brave. Right? But what she doesn't know is what you're gonna know, which you already know. But you're gonna get in with a silly game again. Ready? Here we go. I want you to repeat this after me. I have a nose. I have two elbows. I have 10 fingers. I have 10 toes. I'm not my nose. I'm not my elbows. I'm not my fingers. I'm not my toes. I have an ass. I'm not my ass. I have a vagina. I'm not my vagina. They're mine. They're not me. They messed with my stuff. It hurt my feelings, screwed up my thinking.
[115:17] B: Screwed up my thinking.
[115:18] A: But they never touched who I really. There's no part of me that's the same as it was back then. There's no part of my body. Right. They never touched me. He never touched me. Right? Check it out. He never touched me. Did he mess with your stuff?
[115:34] B: Yeah, he touched my stuff.
[115:35] A: Right. Did he get you? Right. Is there any part of that stuff that's the same as it was then? No. Right. That's right. So they never got me.
[115:43] B: I never got me.
[115:45] A: That's right. So what happens when you close your eyes and you picture the younger you letting her know, of course, that moment is over, finished. That it no longer exists. Letting her know how strong, brave, powerful, courageous she is. Right. And how she's so much of a take care of. Right? Right. Let her know that he never touched me. Never got who I really am. What I experience is I see the landscape with the elephant ears, wisteria bench, sky. Never gotten where I really am. Never touched me, messed with my stuff. There's no part of my stuff now that's the same then, right? All cells have been replaced millions of times, yet you're still. You never touched me. As that younger you realize it never touched me. What do you notice happening to her face? It's okay, right? Right? It's okay. Yeah. What's happening inside you, Brandy? Now I'm okay with it. You are, aren't you? We're not okay that it happened? No.
[117:00] B: It sucks that it happened.
[117:01] A: Right? There we go. Good. And you could open your ey. Right. We're also getting that it couldn't have not happened. Even though we don't like it that it did. Because again, we, me, sister, didn't get born right. We got born into certain circumstances that led to certain things happening that then led to other things happening. And all of it was just in Trying to survive. Yeah, makes sense. And you survived. And now that you're totally getting to the other side and that you made it, now you have the opportunity to be a co creator. You didn't get to co create that then tell me with that. I do. You got kind of bounced into certain things that led to other certain things that led to other certain things might have been seemingly that I chose certain stuff. But no, it's because it led to that. To lead to that. That led to that. Got it. Now you're doing the things to change life for the better. Right. You're in co creation with however you frame it, God, universe, inner being, however you want to. Spirit, source, essence.
[118:35] B: I think that's why I'm having an issue with not liking how I am. Because it's not how God wants me.
[118:45] A: I think it's not liking how you sometimes react. Feel is very different than not liking who I am. Because the who I am is the part that's not okay with me reacting and feeling like that. Right. We actually really like that part.
[118:59] B: Yeah, I like how you put it.
[119:03] A: You follow me with that?
[119:04] B: I mean, yeah, you're right.
[119:05] A: Versus me saying I don't like who I am. No. Right, got it. I don't like how I feel and react at times. And I want that to stop. And the part that doesn't is the part that I really like, which is the real you like who you really are. Essence, core, they're all different expressions. But not you. Right. So when people go my anger, they relate to it in the same way. My index finger, they're different. Right. One is always there. One is a way I feel sometimes one changes one always. Even if we cut it off. Well, there's my severed finger.
[119:58] B: Yeah, it's still going to be there.
[120:00] A: It's mine. Still my. That's my severed finger though. Right. So we're getting things to be shifting. And again we want that other than conscious part to travel back through different experiences. Again, I got popped into certain stuff in another moment. We'll be brought to your awareness to clear. Right. Because again, that moment back then, did it have anything to do with you? No. Right. Notice how that's more clear. Clear that I'm not reading it like it had something to do with me or like somehow I just volunteered because you know what I really like, you know, weird older men touching my body. Right. But notice how sometimes throughout what you had been doing, encourage weird older men to touch my body. Like what the fuck, man? I got primed and groomed. That that led to behaviors that I thought I was choosing, but I really wasn't choosing. It was a controlled choice. Right. If I hold out two outfits for my kid and I go, which one do you want to wear? And they pick. They feel like they chose. Did they?
[121:18] B: No, he chose two options.
[121:21] A: Yeah, I chose. That's what magic tricks are all about. Yeah. Pick any card you want. You know the one that I want you to pick? Yeah, that one. The one that I already know.
[121:32] B: Yeah.
[121:32] A: Right. Because you don't know that all the cards are the same. So go ahead, pick any one of them. Right.
[121:37] B: Yeah. Makes sense.
[121:39] A: Right? So this is the part that we are starting to unwind and again, shift. Makes sense. So your brain is going to travel back and another time is going to be brought to your awareness to clear. Right. What comes to mind now?
[121:56] B: Getting elected.
[121:59] A: Yeah.
[121:59] B: That would happen before my dad. Mom wasn't there. The lights were getting shut off.
[122:05] A: Right. So his power is going to get shut off. Right.
[122:08] B: The neighbor was mowing our yard.
[122:10] A: Right. And I had him read it to me. Right. Because you couldn't really read.
[122:14] B: Yeah.
[122:15] A: Right. So you went out there and he read that. Right. And then what happened?
[122:19] B: I asked him where mom was.
[122:20] A: Right.
[122:22] B: He didn't know.
[122:23] A: Right.
[122:24] B: But he said he could pay. He would pay the bill.
[122:27] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right.
[122:28] B: Yeah.
[122:32] A: You're like, wow, that's really generous of you. Yeah. You're just doing that without any conditions. That's so cool. Right. Got it. So what happened?
[122:41] B: He come in the house.
[122:42] A: Right.
[122:43] B: He put me on the couch.
[122:44] A: Yes. Good job. Good detail. Right. And be here. Right.
[122:47] B: Yeah.
[122:48] A: Notice how you're here.
[122:49] B: Yeah.
[122:49] A: Right. Hi.
[122:50] B: Hi. Sorry.
[122:51] A: No. Remember, my job, when I know that you're going there, is to do stuff to get you here. Right. Because this is more fun than that was. Right. Definitely. Right. So he put you on the couch. Right?
[123:01] B: On the couch. He put his fingers inside out of me.
[123:04] A: Right. Well, inside your vagina. Not you.
[123:06] B: Yeah.
[123:07] A: Right.
[123:07] B: Right.
[123:07] A: Very. Right. Because you have one.
[123:09] B: Yeah.
[123:09] A: It's not you. Hello? Me? No, that's not me. Right, Right. Yeah.
[123:16] B: He put his fingers inside my vagina.
[123:17] A: Right.
[123:19] B: I remember he tried to put himself in.
[123:21] A: Tried to put his penis in.
[123:22] B: Yes. But he couldn't fit.
[123:23] A: Right. Good job. Good job.
[123:25] B: He wound up jacking off.
[123:26] A: Right. Good job.
[123:27] B: And it was all over me. My sister came out.
[123:29] A: Right. And she saw that. That was weird. She went right back inside. Yeah, Right. Good. Then what happened?
[123:36] B: Then he left.
[123:37] A: And then he left. And then you got cleaned up.
[123:39] B: Gosh. Yeah.
[123:39] A: Took a shower, right? Yeah. And then you guys had electricity.
[123:42] B: Yep.
[123:43] A: Right. And then later on you did something more fun.
[123:45] B: Yeah.
[123:46] A: Like graduate high school. Yep. And have your kids.
[123:49] B: Yeah.
[123:49] A: Which is pretty fucking amazing that you could graduate high school.
[123:52] B: Yeah.
[123:53] A: Do you get that? Yeah. Like some people go, oh, well, you know, wow, that's really amazing that they, you know, have gone on and they went to college and then they went to grad school and then they got their. Okay. Do you know that it's pretty fucking amazing that with all the shit that was going on in your world that you were still able to graduate high school?
[124:12] B: Never really looked at it like that.
[124:13] A: I know, I just did it. But just check it out. Okay. Like right now.
[124:21] B: It wasn't hard. It was just happened.
[124:23] A: It wasn't hard. Oh, so that's how smart you are, huh? That with all that shit that was going on. Uh huh.
[124:32] B: I didn't think of it like that.
[124:33] A: No, I know. Right, Right.
[124:36] B: Yeah.
[124:38] A: Right. Like you got a lot of education in shitty ways, but you were able to finish schooling. Uh huh. That's pretty remarkable based on all the stuff that was going on. Right. And even better that you said, well, it was easy.
[124:54] B: Yeah.
[124:57] A: Thank you. Right. That's really cool. And even as you're getting it and even saying thank you, what's it like.
[125:04] B: Inside, the realization is different. It's nice.
[125:08] A: Right. Notice how it's not. Yeah. But if you really knew.
[125:12] B: Yeah.
[125:13] A: Notice how it's actually coming in and you're feeling it and hearing it. Right. Right. Isn't that cool? Because it's also not being read as if it means stuff about you.
[125:31] B: It's.
[125:31] A: While this guy thinks this. Oh yeah, that actually is pretty. Well, I never looked at it. Yeah, that's.
[125:38] B: Yeah.
[125:39] A: Right. No, Right. See again, that's why there's this whole thing of I don't like how I think and feel. Sometimes I want to get that better. I don't like how my life was going. I'm really now in the process of changing it. Right. I didn't have to choose to be in this program. In choosing to be in this program, there are certain things that I have to do as part of being in the program. Just like the guy who goes out for the basketball team chooses to be on the team. He didn't have to try out, he didn't have to go, didn't have to match. Right. But given that he does, guess what he's got to do sometimes? Sprints, suicides, push ups. Right. I don't want to do the Push ups today, kind of off, you know, we have to. You should have made your free throws. Right. That's where we are. And not all of it I like, but it's towards a bigger, broader goal than just that momentary thing. Makes sense. Which makes it easier to do it when it's connected to the why I'm doing it. People need to have a why, but what's in it for me? Right. And sometimes when I get confronted with stuff, I stop seeing the what's in it for me.
[127:05] B: Yeah.
[127:06] A: Why am I even here? Well, part of why I'm here is to get confronted. Cuz, shit, if I keep doing it the way I've been, I don't really want it to go that way anymore for me in life. Yeah.
[127:14] B: I think that's another problem I'm having is I'm actually being confronted. And I'm not. Like, where I'm from, the only one that confronts me about stuff is my dad. Nobody else does.
[127:24] A: My dad doesn't really confront you.
[127:26] B: No, he just punched me in the face. Like that's the confrontation. And that's how I've handled other confrontations. But I like that. I like being held accountable when I screw up. I know that probably sounds weird, but.
[127:42] A: That'S not how it's ever been for you. Yeah. Got it. That's. That's why it provides that structure. Right. So consistency. Doing something repeatedly. Structure that equals regulation. Okay.
[128:04] B: So I have to redo my pyramid foundation.
[128:09] A: I don't know.
[128:09] B: That's what we were talking on the way here. I don't know why they just popped them in.
[128:12] A: But what we want to be thinking of is its consistency. So something done the same over time, that's the structure creates the consistency. So I know what I'm doing. I'm doing the thing. That's what helps me regulate. Right. So I don't fly off the handle. But what we're doing within all of this is we're rewinding, wiring things. Right. So messages that got installed are being reprogrammed to be working with today. Right. One of the major things you're starting to get is how. Wait a minute. A lot of that stuff wasn't about me. I didn't actually volunteer. Like, I kind of wanted it. No, I kind of didn't want it to happen to them. Very different. Very different guys. Right. I'm realizing with all the stuff that was going on in my life, I was still able to graduate. Right. Like, that's huge.
[129:19] B: Thank you.
[129:19] A: Right. And even when you think of that guy Right. All that stuff had been transactional. So why would it not be okay to allow somebody to contribute? Because I know that if they do something for me, then I'm gonna have to go and do something back for them. And a lot of the shit that I had to go do back for them, I didn't want to have to do. I got numb to it for a while, but I still didn't want to have to go do it. Right. Just like in the world we know, like with all sorts of people that have had trafficking stuff, there are going to be people that it's easier with temperament. Look how they are, how I am. Right. And then there are gonna be other people that is like, oh, God, I really don't want to get, like.
[130:09] B: I think that's where the drugs came into play on that.
[130:12] A: You think?
[130:13] B: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
[130:16] A: I gotta do that with that. Okay. But unfortunately, that kits me in a loop process because now I can't not have the.
[130:22] B: Yeah, yeah.
[130:25] A: That kind of thing. Yeah. So that's what we're starting to shift. That's what's changing inside. Right. Because when you realize, again, that thing happening with the electric bill, that guy doing that. Right. Had nothing to do with you. Right, right. That's because. So what was off is that it felt like all relationships were transactionally based. Make sense. That's where this has been off. So what would be off about allowing somebody to contribute while you're eventually going to want something from me? You can't just be doing this out of the kindness of your heart. That actually couldn't be what you get out of it. I mean, it couldn't be that you actually get joy out of helping somebody. Because it's not. Here's the cool part, it's not that they're not getting something from it. It's just not transactional. The person who donates, you know, $10 million to the charity anonymously, he still gets something. He doesn't need the, you know, admiration, the acknowledgement. He still gets to feel good that he did it. Got it. That means it's not transactional. Right. Another guy goes, well, yeah, I'll donate $10 million if you put my name on the building. Oh, that's transactional. I'm getting something transactional because, like, it's an exchange. The other guy gets internal joy out of helping, knowing that he made a difference. He doesn't need acknowledgement, he doesn't need a transaction. He doesn't need to get something from it. Right. So now as we're looking at it, why would it be hard for me to get help from others? Because help was conditional on a transaction. I had to exchange goods or services. Lots of times it was services. Right, right, right. I'm in something now where it's weird that I'm getting stuff without, like, having to exchange it for, you know, goods or services. Right. That. Wait a minute. What the person gets is actually feeling good that they've made a difference. Huh?
[133:10] B: Yeah.
[133:12] A: Right. But see, I get to feel good when I've done something for somebody else that I know they've really wanted. I know that makes me feel good. Right. You got that in your own life when you've done something that you know, you know, brought joy to somebody, like it made you feel good that you were able to do that thing that brought joy. Right. Got it.
[133:33] B: Yes.
[133:34] A: What that younger you didn't know is that there are other kinds that aren't transactional.
[133:40] B: And that just clicked today.
[133:42] A: Got it. So now close your eyes and let her know that there's more than just transactional relationships. Let her know that, you know, she got groomed into the way that she was. There was no choice. So that you lighten up on that earlier you. On the things that she did, both when she was a little girl and then into her teen years and then into her 20s and early 30s. Let the you know that there wasn't choice, freedom, volunteering. Right. So that she gets it. Let her know now what's happening both inside of you right now and what you've already done. Done the time, done the assessment, see a different future for you, becoming a better version of you. Healing, lightening up inside, lightening up on the earlier you so that you're not so upset over the stuff that she did that you think she shouldn't have done. Because you're clear, she couldn't have not done that stuff. Right. Based on what she. Right. So that the earlier you is getting it. Getting it in a big way. All sorts of neural networks lighting up at the same time. Widespread change, widespread activation. Because now in knowing that there's other kinds of assistance, help and support that isn't transactional, just kind of check. How much easier would it be to know that you're allowing somebody to feel good by helping. That's right. Whether it's a mentor or a volunteer or even staff that, yeah, they may get compensated not by you. But why are they there? Nobody gets into this profession because they want to make a shitload of money off of women who are trafficked. Oh, wait a Minute. That's not true. There's a whole other group of people that want to profit off of women trafficking, but that's not this. Okay.
[136:18] B: It's okay. I didn't take it that way.
[136:22] A: Wait a minute. I met one time, I met the woman, she said. She goes, I am the. I am the human trafficking coordinator for the state of Florida. I'm like, wow. So do you, like, meet with, like, pimps and traffickers, like, to kind of know.
[136:43] B: I was like, wow, okay.
[136:45] A: So get to know where the we. We are combating. I'm like, well, you may want to add that in tight.
[136:50] B: Yes, that's exactly. I was like, oh, okay. Yeah. Dang.
[136:56] A: Where do you meet? Like, at a Denny's. Like, how does it go?
[136:59] B: Waffle House at 2am wow.
[137:06] A: Hang out at the courthouse. Right.
[137:09] B: So again, just check.
[137:10] A: Brandi, what are you noticing now in you?
[137:11] B: I'm okay.
[137:12] A: Yeah. And even just thinking about something, somebody like, you know, wanting to do something.
[137:18] B: That it doesn't have to be transactional. They have to do it just to do it.
[137:21] A: Right. And they get to feel good. Oh, and by the way, me being in the allowance of it helps me, but also because it has them feel good. Right, Right. Just like me thanking somebody for giving me a compliment has them feel good about giving me the compliment versus me saying, oh, no, not that. Because then that would make them feel stupid that they even thought that about you. Right. Like, if you had come back to me when I said, oh, my goodness, it's amazing that you're even able to graduate high school. Oh, you know that. That I'm not. That. No, you went, oh, yeah. And it was easy. Right, Right. Which mean it came in.
[138:07] B: Yeah.
[138:08] A: Right. Yeah. Yeah. So what are you noticing for you? You are pretty chill, aren't you? Even though we dealt with a lot of stuff already.
[138:20] B: Yeah. You didn't make me cry and stuff. I mean, like, got a little teary, but I'm go.
[138:24] A: The only time that you got really teary, that we allowed that happen. Right. That we went along with it was why. But what were the tears of getting.
[138:35] B: Up like, just being okay with it.
[138:38] A: Yes. They were tears of relief, not sadness. I'm okay with you having tears of relief.
[138:46] B: Okay, thank you.
[138:49] A: Because those tears actually feel good.
[138:51] B: Yeah.
[138:52] A: Got it.
[138:53] B: Yeah, I like that.
[138:54] A: It's not about not having tears. It's about not feeling bad.
[138:58] B: Yeah.
[138:59] A: That's what I like. Right. That's what I like too. I like people feel good when they're with me. Right. So even think about Stuff that we haven't talked about. Like anything that happened while you were out on the street, whether you had a trafficking person or whether you were online or however it got connected or whatever with different guys. Think about drinking, use within that or any kind of physical stuff. Because you're thinking about that stuff now. What are you noticing?
[139:30] B: It's just something that happened. It's not just something. It's not me. It's just something that I went through.
[139:36] A: That's right. It's not you. It never was you. You aren't it. Or like, I had somebody that told me, you know, they were out and, you know, they'd been out of the life for a while. Some guy at a convenience store, kind of the whisper kind of thing. Can I spend some money with you? And her response was, I don't do that anymore. That's not the response we want her to have because she was confusing what she did as if it's part of who she is. That's why we already started to identify your feelings, aren't you. What you did isn't you. Yeah. You were doing that stuff, but it was never you. Right. You're not that. You never were. It was just stuff you were doing then. Right. Not you. It wasn't ever part of who you are. Right. Got it.
[140:31] B: I do.
[140:32] A: Right. So it's not even. I don't do that anymore. Like, that doesn't even warrant a response. I don't even know what that means.
[140:40] B: When you said that, I was like. Would have punched him in the nose. See, that's where I.
[140:46] A: That one might have been. Again, we want the emotions to match the situation. That might have been a good one. Where it matched the situation. Got it. But see, you're. You've got the same thing going on. I've got to be interested for you to approach. Right?
[141:05] B: Yeah.
[141:05] A: That's how it is with the female panther. Don't approach a female panther when she doesn't want it.
[141:11] B: I was gonna say, otherwise you're gonna get scared, right? Yeah, definitely.
[141:14] A: Even when she's in heat, she lets the male know that I'm approachable. You gotta work to get me.
[141:19] B: Yep, yep. Very true.
[141:22] A: Right, right. And so you become much more solid, much more clear, much more present, much more. Okay. When you're not using, the using is what opens up susceptibility to that kind of stuff. Because I'm not in my right mind. Yeah, Got it.
[141:46] B: Yes.
[141:47] A: Yeah. So we're moving further and further away. And that way of being doesn't serve who I am and who I'm becoming make sense. Doubling down on that shit is not in the same direction as who I'm becoming. Right. It just doesn't fit. It's not a part of it. Right, right. And that's also becoming more clear. Yeah. Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[142:25] B: It is, very much so, yeah.
[142:27] A: Yeah.
[142:30] B: I think the jokes were just something that was introduced. My dad introduced them to me.
[142:36] A: Oh, good.
[142:37] B: I was only 10.
[142:37] A: No big deal, right? Right. Well, they're useful ways to. And he didn't start with math.
[142:43] B: He did. I was 10, first time I started.
[142:45] A: A lot of math. Jesus Christ. Tell.
[142:48] B: I told you I got great parents, man. I was serious.
[142:51] A: Well, you know, he was being a good parent. At least he was sharing, I guess.
[142:55] B: I mean, he wanted me to help him watch the people in the bushes that didn't exist. Crazy. I'm telling you, they're out there.
[143:03] A: Yeah, but again, you didn't know that. I didn't. And that's what's starting to happen. You're realizing I got put into situations that led to what I did. What got you to Sayla?
[143:17] B: My best friend convinced me.
[143:24] A: He saw.
[143:25] B: What I was doing again and he let me come stay at his house for a little bit. And he's actually just got out of. He's been clean for probably close to two years now. But he went through a program called Men. And I knew him before us using. I knew him while we used and then seeing him after. He's not the same person he was before. He's better.
[143:49] A: Yeah.
[143:49] B: And so he was just trying to help me.
[143:53] A: Come here. Oh, so you already started allowing people to contribute.
[143:57] B: Right. I just thought about that when you said that.
[144:01] A: That's the marker, though. Do you know? That's the. That's the shift. That was the first time you truly went with somebody that wasn't because of what they were gonna get from you.
[144:13] B: That was the thing that was different with him is there wasn't.
[144:15] A: He didn't want shit out of it. Right. So that was the first opening that. Wait a minute. Somebody can actually be interested in contributing that doesn't want something from me.
[144:26] B: Yeah. He was interested in me without getting anything.
[144:31] A: Yeah. Just me. Isn't that cool?
[144:34] B: Scary.
