[00:00] A: Today's the 14th of October, Brandi. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful and valuable, that might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:13] B: Yes, it is.
[00:14] A: Okay, cool. So first, let's get ourselves into the right states, right? Because we know that when we automatically breathe and when we're anxious, we actually stopped breathing. So both when somebody's anxious, angry, or upset, they stop breathing, Right? It's why, like, if you've ever seen the ugly cry, right, they've got to like, literally breathe it in because they've completely stopped breathing. So we want to begin to breathe so that we can settle. We know that we've done processes before where we. When you slightly lower your jaw and you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, right? And then you begin to automatically but consciously breathe a little bit slower, a little bit deeper, and a little bit longer on the exhale, that breath process starts to settle things down. If we breathe in and then at the top, and then exhale, it also starts to settle. But if we add to it, like when we need to take our glasses because they're dirty, and we go right a on the exhale, it works even better. So it's a breath in at the top and then. And just notice what happens as you did that. What did you notice happening in your body? It did, didn't it? Isn't that kind of crazy how that works? Like, who would think that's something that actually starts to settle us down? Right? So, okay, so now we just want to again continue to settle. So one more time, breath in at the top and then. Right, and this time that we breathe, we're going to kind of breathe like we breathe to belly, mid chest, upper chest, exhale, upper chest, mid chest, belly. So. Right. Isn't that kind of cool? So now we can actually have a conversation and not our brain running. What the hell was I thinking? Okay, so we had an anaphylactic reaction to something.
[03:01] B: Yeah, we don't know what. It happens a lot, actually. I mean, I. I know it's. It's ridiculous to just be, like, so nonchalant about it, but it really does. I mean, it's shitty. It is. I don't. I have no idea what causes it. They've done a million. A million.
[03:14] A: Not something easy like peanuts.
[03:16] B: No, no. I wish, like, I really wish they could tell me. Okay, you can't eat spinach. Darn. You know, because I put spinach in all my smoothies that I eat. But you know, like, I don't know.
[03:26] A: Okay.
[03:26] B: They've done all these allergy tests and.
[03:28] A: Put stuff on, like the pin prick.
[03:30] B: Stuff on the back. Yeah. Checkerboarded me up and I had one doctor tell me that it was stress. Whenever I stress too much, then it's my body's reaction to an anxiety attack and I'm like. So I'm out in the yard doing exactly what I love. Putting grass on the. On the dirt of the fire pit we literally just dug up. And that was too much stress. Like, I'm happy they let me outside after I got shingles one day, you know, like I don't know.
[03:56] A: Well, it may not be immediate, but.
[03:59] B: I have no idea.
[04:00] A: Right. But clearly if I get shingles, I'm pretty fucking stressed.
[04:06] B: Well, actually the shingles comes from my immune system being down, which can be caused from stress of the body because I'm not taking care of myself. Right. So I guess that's what the thing said on the Internet.
[04:19] A: Definitely believe everything you read on the Internet, by the way. I mean. Cause Dr. Google knows fucking everything.
[04:25] B: I was like, so there's 50 million different things on here. Which one do? I just quit. I just stopped reading because I was like, fuck this, I'm sorry. I just, I was. I just. Whatever. And I found out that you're not supposed to eat half a cup of turmeric. Nobody like explained that to me. Turmeric's supposed to be an anti inflammatory and pain reliever because all I can have is ibuprofen at the program, which works great. You know, not so I tried to get a more natural approach and I didn't. I've learned that turmeric is anti inflammatory and all, but, you know, nobody. There was no directions on how much to use.
[04:58] A: So half a cup is.
[05:00] B: It's way too much to drink it all.
[05:05] A: Thinking maybe like a teaspoon.
[05:07] B: Yeah, Yeah, I learned that afterwards. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's been definitely a learning situation this week. For real. I'm not real sure I've learned anything except for what not to do.
[05:20] A: But I mean, that's always good.
[05:21] B: It's progress, right? Somewhere. I don't know.
[05:23] A: Right. Because here's the deal. When I was a little kid, there was a cartoon and action figures because boys don't play with dolls but action figures. We play with action figures. They're not real dolls, right? I mean, they are dolls, but no, they're action figures. I'm a boy.
[05:37] B: You're a boy? Yep.
[05:39] A: GI Joe action figures. And they had a cartoon on Saturday mornings, which was a GI Joe cartoon with cobra and, you know, all the different people, Snake eyes, all this stuff. Right.
[05:51] B: Yeah.
[05:52] A: And at the end, they would always have a lesson, and after the lesson they would say, and knowing is half the battle. GI Joe.
[06:02] B: Right.
[06:03] A: So there you go. You've got the learning. Knowing is half the battle. So we got the shingles, we got the anaphylactic stuff. We've got dad.
[06:18] B: Yeah. That happened in between.
[06:19] A: Calling probation officer, trying to figure out where you are.
[06:23] B: Right. Yeah.
[06:25] A: Okay. And then you've got. Because you're not in Tyler, you've got a different version of probation.
[06:33] B: So. Yeah, so with my probation, I have to. I have to check in every month. I have to see my officer face to face. She has to. He or she has to be able to make a report. I am not a probationary candidate. Whoever screwed up and put me on probation should have gotten fired. But God blessed me and I was put on probation. So I get this chance. So I automatically know from previous experience, me not checking in, it's an automatic violation. Three days, there's a warrant out and I gotta go to jail. So even if it's the probation officer's fault, I still have to sit in jail for 30 to 45 days. Go in front of the judge, Judge says, okay, they screwed up here, you go to jail. So I haven't checked in since July. So I finally explained to my caseworker the importance that I'm not in Tyla. I have to go see this woman. And this woman is saying, no, she's in Tyler. They don't have Tyler court where I come from. So we finally got.
[07:24] A: Where you come from?
[07:25] B: Lake City.
[07:26] A: Okay.
[07:27] B: Yeah. Columbia. Well, I'm from Columbia County. I got arrested in Alachua county, which is Gainesville. So.
[07:31] A: Okay.
[07:32] B: Yeah. So they. I finally got the communication across it. It's very important.
[07:35] A: Yeah.
[07:36] B: That I have to check in. I probably have a warrant. So I was stressed about that a little bit. I get there, the lady has no idea why I'm in Tyler Court because I was classified as Tyle Court, but at my request, requirements are totally different. So she didn't know what to do. So we have to go back Monday. But then in the middle of all that, she tells me that my dad is looking for me and I need to contact him. It's not happening. Yeah. Then I got to see my son today. That's the greatest part about today. Like, I haven't seen him since he was two weeks old. He's 17 months now, so I got to see him on the zoom.
[08:10] A: Okay. So that was cool.
[08:12] B: Yep. That was good news. My sister actually had a conversation with me and didn't just, you know, like, cuss me out, tell me how shitty I am. It was about my son, but it was good. Yeah.
[08:23] A: She was telling you how shitty he is.
[08:25] B: No, usually she tells me how shitty I am.
[08:26] A: I know that's what I wanted. But you said it was about my son, so she was telling you how shitty he is.
[08:31] B: Yeah, no, she. He actually. I watched him pull an okie doke on my mom. My mom, they were at the laundromat and my son got the buggy that they put clothes in and he's pushing it, and my mom is watching the buggy. She's not looking completely down at him because he's like. He's 30 inches, so he's like that tall. So she's not looking completely down. She's watching the buggy. He literally shoves the buggy and turns around and runs to the door to try to get out the front door. And my mom is still walking forward, looking at the top of the buggy. Yep. That is my kids.
[09:02] A: 100% apples.
[09:04] B: Yep.
[09:04] A: They don't fall that far from the tree.
[09:06] B: No, he didn't. That is for sure. That's. Yeah.
[09:09] A: Okay.
[09:12] B: Yep. That's my week.
[09:18] A: Well, welcome.
[09:19] B: Thank you. Thanks for listening. It's been a week.
[09:25] A: Yeah. So it's been a few weeks since we got together.
[09:29] B: Yeah.
[09:29] A: How did our last session lead you?
[09:32] B: It was cool. You definitely gave me a different perspective on how I was viewing things, especially with the volunteering for things. Like, I've really thought a lot of the things that I've done I volunteered for. But you give you. Actually, definitions are key. Vocabulary is key, and I know that. And I didn't pay attention to what it actually meant until you brought that to my attention. So that was.
[09:53] A: Isn't that interesting?
[09:54] B: Yeah.
[09:55] A: Like, a lot of yours was controlled choices. They're not really choices.
[09:57] B: Right. Yeah. I didn't. I wasn't. I wasn't putting two and two together on that. So it was. That was really eye opening on that. Really?
[10:04] A: Yeah.
[10:05] B: Yeah.
[10:06] A: When you think about some of the things that we talked about, experiences that happened.
[10:11] B: Yeah.
[10:11] A: What do you notice in terms of how you feel about those now?
[10:14] B: I really don't. I mean, I don't really have a feeling toward. I mean, it happens you know, shit happens. But, I mean, there's really. There's nothing emotional with it.
[10:21] A: Isn't that cool?
[10:22] B: Yeah, it really is.
[10:23] A: I notice how that's different than it was.
[10:25] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's cool. Yeah, definitely.
[10:27] A: Cool. Awesome. I'm excited.
[10:29] B: Thank you.
[10:32] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And what we talked about is your. Your choice is here in choosing you. And. Yeah. I don't know how I got to this position and that probation because I shouldn't have had, but, like, you're here. Right. And you're interested in life being vastly different than it's ever bed.
[10:56] B: Yeah.
[10:56] A: And in that co. Creative process of how you want to be. Yeah, definitely. Right, Right.
[11:07] B: We're working on it.
[11:08] A: We are.
[11:09] B: Oh, yeah. And I moved the whole house. The whole house got moved yesterday.
[11:14] A: Moved.
[11:15] B: Mooned. Like I was. I had to go to the shower for this whole. This whole hive breakout. And apparently I passed out in the shower sitting on the floor. And then. It is what it is. So now I have to. I don't have to, but I feel like I need to apologize for. The full moon's not for a couple days and they got it early.
[11:39] A: Actually. You missed the full moon. It was.
[11:41] B: Did I? It was an extra set. Oh, man.
[11:46] A: We had a full moon over the weekends, so if you've done it like last weekend, you might have been. Right on.
[11:51] B: Sorry. My eyelid is still swollen, so it's like in my eye still.
[11:55] A: Yeah. That's fun. I like it when that happens. That's great. They call that blepharitis.
[12:00] B: Blepharitis.
[12:01] A: Yeah, when it's swollen because it's also dry and then it gets too heavy. It's like. It's blepharitis.
[12:07] B: Yeah. The whole eyelid is down on my eyelid. My eyelashes. It's literally holding my eyelid up.
[12:12] A: Yeah, whatever. Yeah.
[12:17] B: That'S nice to have. Blepharitis.
[12:19] A: Yeah.
[12:20] B: Okay.
[12:20] A: It's a fun name.
[12:21] B: You're not bluffing me. It's really blepharitis. Okay. All right. I'm just making sure.
[12:30] A: So given the week that you've had, which has been like, you know, just exhilarating. Top notch. What do you want our time today to do for you?
[12:40] B: I honestly, Dr. Q, I have no idea where to start. Like, I just. I don't know. I didn't know I was coming until yesterday, to be honest, so.
[12:49] A: Okay. Yeah. And you just passed out.
[12:53] B: No, I found out after I passed out.
[12:55] A: Yeah.
[12:55] B: I've got to come home and.
[12:59] A: Yeah, well, in the conversations that You've had with Christine.
[13:04] B: I haven't seen Christine.
[13:06] A: You haven't?
[13:06] B: No.
[13:07] A: Okay.
[13:07] B: I haven't been able to. I've. I had a dentist appointment where I got two teeth pulled out the day she came to assessment. And then she was there yesterday. And, you know, I had to go in the ambulance, so I didn't get to see her. I have a meeting with her Monday.
[13:20] A: That's a good way to avoid her.
[13:21] B: No, I like talking. It screwed me up. And it's been Saturday.
[13:26] A: Going to the hospital. See, I don't want to see her. I'd rather go do those two.
[13:30] B: No, I was mad because, like, I didn't get to do my check in. I don't know what's going on. Like, my save contacts or mentors or.
[13:35] A: I.
[13:36] B: Like, I finally got a sponsor for aa and, like, she wanted to schedule something last night at our meeting, but I couldn't because I don't know if she's a safe contact or not because I haven't been able to have my check in. So. Yeah, I'm just lost on that.
[13:51] A: Okay, so this whole thing about you kind of what happened to get into the ambulance. Right. That's not a new thing. Okay.
[14:02] B: No, it happens.
[14:03] A: It happens periodically. Sporadically.
[14:07] B: I would say sporadically. Both. Usually. Usually I can control it. Like, I notice things that happen. Like, my body kind of goes through a process, so to speak. And because it has happened so much, I've learned to pay attention to it. I can usually get it at the beginning. I go take some Benadryl. I sit down for about an hour. I'm cool. I still have hives, but once the itching stops, I know I'm good. This was. It was similar, but very different. As fast as it happened, we were moving the fire pit, dug some grass.
[14:38] A: I wonder if there's an ant bite that does it.
[14:41] B: I don't know.
[14:42] A: There were ants, but that would be a curious thing, and I wonder what would be. It might be advantageous for you to get one of those EpiPens.
[14:51] B: I have one now. Yeah, they. That's actually why I'm like. Yeah, they gave me one at the doctor.
[15:02] A: It was crazy, right?
[15:04] B: I did. I did have a bad. No, that. Maybe that's something I should talk about. I don't know why I reacted the way. Yes, I do. I've been an IV user from, like, 17 till 35, so I was kind of in and out. I didn't come to until they. They had me wrapped up in this sheep something. And it freaked me Out. When they put me on the gurney, I understand that I was out, and that's probably the only way they could get me up. But that's how I came to. To the whole situation. I don't. I don't remember. I remember sitting in the shower, and then. Next thing I remember, I was in this blanket getting on the journey. So then they put me in the ambulance, and we were in the yard for a good amount of time because they couldn't find a vein, which I don't understand how they couldn't find a vein, maybe because I. How bad I was swollen, but the lady hit my hand and missed. Yeah. And he. The other guy didn't even try to look anywhere else. He just said, okay, we're going to hit her in the neck. And I automatically sat up and I took the thing off and I was getting out because I don't. I don't know why. Maybe. I don't know. I just wasn't cool with it. I cussed him out, told him where I'd stick the needle, and I was getting out of the. The ambulance, but he w. Up, hit me in the arm. And I don't know. I was just. I was a complete to him. I was like, all you got to do is follow the scar. There's. There's two veins there. I'm sorry for saying it like that, but that's exactly how I said it to him. And, like, I've just been, like, not cool with it ever since that. I don't know. It didn't bother me when he hit me in the arm. It didn't bother me sh. Me in the hand. But, like, when he wanted to do my neck, it just screwed me up. Didn't screw me up. It just pissed me off. Probably. That's what it was.
[16:40] A: All right, but who wants to have. First of all, out of all the places that I can get an IV Foot, hand, arm. That's the last one.
[16:53] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's something. Like, even in my needle, me using needles, I've never hit myself or anybody else in the neck. Just. It freaks me out. It's creepy. I mean, not that the right of the ways aren't creepy, but it's.
[17:05] A: It's creepy.
[17:05] B: Creepier than the creepy. I don't know. It just weirded me out. And then they put me in an elevator today to go up to the top floor of the cella. I guess the office. I don't know. It's been exhilarating. Like.
[17:28] A: What about the elevator?
[17:29] B: I don't I don't do my papa corner me in elevator one time, so. And, you know, I just haven't. There's one way in, one way out, and I can't be safe there. So that's how in my head it is. I deal with them.
[17:44] A: Okay.
[17:45] B: Usually I take stairs.
[17:47] A: Okay. So did you know that you were going into the elevator? No.
[17:53] B: I found out when I got there. Yeah.
[17:58] A: As we were walking towards it.
[17:59] B: Yeah. Like, open the door, the elevator's right there. And I was like, I'm just going to take the stairs. And they're like, no, it's eight floors up. Okay. It's just eight floors of stairs. It's not a big deal. But I got in and made it up, and I took a stair. I mean, I took the stairs down. I didn't give it an option. I just went down the stairs. Yeah.
[18:19] A: So, okay, so the idea for me wouldn't be that you would either have to go or not go in an elevator. I'd want you to have the freedom to go in it if it makes sense, not have to if it doesn't. But, like, right now, there's not a lot of freedom to go, even if it were to make sense. Right. We're going to have this wonderful view at the top of the Empire State Building. I'll take the stairs. Okay. Flights. Okay. Yeah, I'll be there in an hour. I mean, right.
[18:56] B: Like, I guess. Right.
[18:57] A: Like, no, I mean, but, like, the thing. So the issue isn't truly whether you go in an elevator or not, it's that you don't actually have the freedom to go even if you wanted to. Right. Because it creates all this kind of discomfort. Right. We want to get that shifted. And remember, the issue with that experience wasn't the elevator.
[19:26] B: That's what happened in that.
[19:28] A: Yeah. And remember, what our brain does when we go through something negative is anything that was happening at the same time gets merged as if it's part of the issue. Right. I think I gave you this silly example. If I didn't, you laugh. I had a woman who was completely distraught and angry at Nilla Wafers and had no idea why. Like, literally, like, they're on the bottom shelf of Publix. She would go three quarters of the way down and turn back around and not walk by him. She didn't ever want to see him if she had to walk by him, kick him. Can you imagine, like, you're in Publix and you got the. And she's like, 62 years old, you know, walking down the Thing you know, you're walking behind, all of a sudden you see this 62 year old walk by and kick.
[20:22] B: Right? Okay. I mean, yeah, I would laugh.
[20:25] A: Right. Like what the hell is going on with her? Why is she kicking the null awaker box?
[20:33] B: Tourette's.
[20:34] A: Right. Come to find out. When she was 9, mom and dad sat her and her brother down to tell them they were divorcing. She was eating a Nilla wafer.
[20:48] B: Oh.
[20:50] A: Now we know that Nilla wafers don't cause divorce. But the part of our brain that's not logical if it co occurred, it's part of the problem. Make sense. So that's part of what's going on with these kinds of things. Is that because there are still, I'm going to call them active wounds. I've got a lot of distance from them, but they're still active. Active simply means not how often do I remember it, think about it until troubled by means that if I do think about it or if something reminds me of it, it still has a charge in me. Right. That's where that's going on. Make sense. So what we want to do is when the brain reads negative moment as data memories unplugged, the pain that was attached to it goes away, the discomfort goes away. So the woman who was mugged by the 19 year old wearing a hoodie, now the old grandfather is walking through the mall and she's got a panic attack because he's walking towards her, he's wearing a hoodie. The hoodie wasn't the issue. Getting mugged, that was the issue. Yeah, but they co occurred. Right. Those things happen to us all the time. Sometimes we're consciously aware of it. Like you are. I'm going there cuz like that's when that happened. And I get there's one way in, one way out. Look, I'm not going. But there's a lot of spaces also that pretty much have one way in, one way out. Yeah, like the bathroom may have a tiny window but like how easy is it to get out of that one?
[22:46] B: There's nobody else in there. I mean like I know that's, that's right.
[22:51] A: Got it. But I got what you're saying right. There's nobody else in there. But there have been times when you might be in a bathroom and somebody else is in the bathroom. Maybe not this house, but at other times in life and that's not right. So, so the, the same thing goes on for human beings that when stuff is still active, my brain is confusing anything that Co occurred. As if it's the problem. Right. As you just said, the issue when I was in the elevator with Papa wasn't the elevator. That isn't the part that troubled me. The shit that he did that really fucking troubled me. But because it co occurred, my brain merged it and then views elevators like the woman views Nilla Wafer.
[23:40] B: Gotcha.
[23:42] A: Got it. So again, the issue isn't whether you take an elevator or not. I don't care. You might, for health reasons, want to do the stairs. But what I would want is if it made sense, you would have the freedom to and feel. Okay, got it. That's a lot of what we want to be doing. Because this is all new. Like, you're newer into programming. You're newer in this stuff. Stuff. You're newer. We've met one time. Right. So where we're headed, like, the bigger, broader picture of things is we want to unplug conscious, the ones that I'm aware of, and unconscious triggers. Because we want your brain to read negative experiences as data. When they're data, I have more wisdom. When they're active, it shrinks. So that's the problem. When I have open wounds, I'm more susceptible. Right. If I've got an open cut and I'm at the hospital, I'm more susceptible to MRSA than if my body's healed. Right. Sharks smell blood.
[24:53] B: Yeah. So you don't go on your period.
[24:55] A: I mean. Right. So, like. Right. I mean, that's that. That's the. So I'm more susceptible. If I have open wounds, I'm more susceptible to other bad things happening. Right. There hasn't been a single woman that we've worked with through programming in all of the world of sex trafficking that didn't have some childhood sexual abuse. Well, that doesn't mean that all women who have childhood become trafficked. Right, Right. But it's a vulnerability which makes them more susceptible to other stuff happening. Make sense? We want to heal it because when it's healed, I'm less susceptible. And flip it around. The kid who gets bullied more is the kid who shows how much it bothers me to be bullied. The kid who could care less and is indifferent is like, whatever. So what? That kid, they don't pick on as much.
[25:59] B: Yeah. Because they don't get a rash.
[26:01] A: That's right. It's the susceptibility by being more. That's why it happens. Right. Like, my daughter really wants to be liked, which is really hard when you're in eighth grade.
[26:15] B: Yeah.
[26:15] A: Because Kids are just freaking me. And if they smell it, they go, oh, all right. And then it becomes mob mentality. Right? Think of. Correct. Because think of the canaries, which are beautiful birds, and they get along marvelously together until one gets injured or one gets sick, and then they peck it to death. Isn't that crazy? So by having that susceptibility, even things that aren't predatorial become predatorial. So we want to heal those wounds, right? They're not open wounds like I can see on my body. Right. But they're underneath the surface stuff. So let's just think of the you who's free from those. Let's think of the you who's much more emotionally present. Because once it's data, I gain wisdom, I become stronger. Nobody goes through that kind of adversity to get stronger, Right? Except Navy seals, because those guys are fucking nuts. But it's a whole different world. But they have their own set of issues, right? We all get stronger by fully being on the other side of an adversity. Make sense? So that's what we want. We want you to have space and freedom from that. We want you to have space and freedom from stuff with dad. Right. We even want you to emotionally be reading whatever sister might throw at you as info about her. And maybe it's her upset over something you did or didn't do or said or didn't say, but it's still info about you, not I made piece of shit. Yeah, follow me with that. Like, that's the part. Because when we're little, the thing that keeps getting layered in is everybody else's emotions mean something about me. Because when I'm very little, I'm a narcissist. It's my world, and everybody else lives in it.
[28:13] B: Yeah, of course, Ted still is, but that's a problem. I know.
[28:18] A: Work it up.
[28:19] B: That's why I'm here.
[28:20] A: We want to get it so that we read other people's crap more as being about them. And if it's about them, we might be learning that they were upset over something I did or didn't do, say or didn't say. But based on the context, then I have more freedom in how I respond, which could be in a way that's caring and compassionate and understanding. Could be in a way that's more firm and directive. Could be in a way that it goes by. Okay, that's not. No, stick. Because I get it. That it's not about me. Make sense. We have a crazy.
[28:57] B: Yeah, I think it's a bird or something.
[28:58] A: What is a bird? We've had two. One was a dove and now we've got a woodpecker that keeps flying into the different windows and pecking it.
[29:05] B: I'm like, because there's bugs out there.
[29:07] A: I don't think it's because there's bugs.
[29:08] B: These, the little like from where I'm sitting, you can see cocoons up there.
[29:13] A: Yes, but that's not why they're flying into the windows.
[29:16] B: Okay.
[29:17] A: They fly into the windows cuz they don't realize that it's a window.
[29:20] B: Oh, like Alfred Hitchcock.
[29:21] A: Sound like birds. Yeah. So again, would it be okay for you to be free to. Or not get in the elevator, but just be free? If it made sense, yeah. Yeah. And if that was no longer troubling you, does that in any way, shape or form mean that what he did was okay?
[29:42] B: No.
[29:43] A: Got it. Yeah. You get to fully be okay, even though that wasn't okay. Right. Because the other conflictual part that people have sometimes is that if I'm okay, it means what happened to me. Right, right. But. But a lot of times people are like, you know, well, I was raped and I should be hurting. Because if I'm not hurting, then it means what happened to me was okay. No, Right, You've got that already. Right. So now we think of a you who's free, who's present, who's lighter, who's clear. And then we go through that same process where you slightly lower your job and you rest your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper and you see me in my fingers and with your peripheral vision. That's right, you notice how it expands. You see more space as you see more space. That's right. There's always more of it. Space is the thing. We disappear, but it's all around us. And there's always more of it than things. And see, the problem with that problem is that it didn't end well, except it froze at the worst parts of it. So that part doesn't know about things later. Like the elephant ears. Yeah, right. That's right. Doesn't know about other things you've done later that were more enjoyable. Doesn't know how you like being out in the yard. That's right. Doesn't know that you're a grown up.
[31:20] B: Yeah.
[31:21] A: Right. So we've got that good news to get. So now go ahead and close your eyes and imagine floating up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof, so that as you do, you rise way up above it. All you have A bird's eye view. You see everything under and below. You think of being free, like a bird who's able to soar through the sky. Sometimes just gliding on the breeze. Big curves and turns, sometimes flapping. Directed seeing. Everything is under and below you because you're above and over it. Free to be becoming even more of who you really are. Beginning to lighten it up on the inside. That's when I bring your awareness back down and into your body so that you re associate inside you. When you're ready, take a nice, big deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Right, Right. And just check. How's your body feeling now? So cool. Right. I think it's the neatest thing. Yeah. So that moment that happened in that elevator back then happened when you might have been how old? 1112. Right. And you might have been where?
[33:13] B: Courthouse.
[33:14] A: So you're at the courthouse. Right. And it would have been like morning or afternoon.
[33:19] B: We were going to court. So maybe morning.
[33:22] A: Yeah, maybe morning. Right. And it was you and whom going to court?
[33:28] B: It was my grandma. Grandpa and me going to see my dad because he was in jail. So he was.
[33:34] A: It was his court. Right.
[33:36] B: I had to go. Grandma was in the courtroom. I had to go down to get Papa because they took in different cars.
[33:41] A: Good job. Good detail.
[33:42] B: Yeah. So when I got Papa in, we got back in the elevator.
[33:46] A: Yes.
[33:47] B: He shoved me down.
[33:48] A: Right.
[33:48] B: Put his dick in my mouth.
[33:49] A: Right. Good job, Good detail.
[33:51] B: Oral sex.
[33:51] A: Right.
[33:52] B: And he stuck. But he stopped the elevator.
[33:54] A: Right.
[33:55] B: I remember. I didn't want to do it.
[33:56] A: Right. And he started jumping. Right. It would fall. Right. Good job, Good detail.
[34:00] B: So I went ahead and I did what he wanted.
[34:03] A: Right. Good job.
[34:04] B: And didn't do it. That's. I remember getting on the elevator, but that's about it.
[34:08] A: Then it stopped.
[34:09] B: Yeah.
[34:10] A: Right. Doors open. You got out. Right. And then went into court. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[34:18] B: Yep.
[34:19] A: What's something you've done later that was more fun than that moment? Congratulated something else that you've done that was more fun?
[34:26] B: Landscaping.
[34:27] A: That's right.
[34:28] B: Going to college.
[34:29] A: That's right. Right. So we got landscaping and going to college. Right. We got graduating.
[34:35] B: Yep.
[34:36] A: Right. And then before that, you guys probably left court, and then you were in court, and then the elevator doors open. Then he had stopped. And then you did it. And then he was jumping, and then he tried to get you to do it, and you're like, I didn't want to. Right. And then he had shoved you down. Right. And then you guys got in the elevator and then grandma said, go get him. Right. And then you were up with grandma. Right. And then before that, you guys had gone to court. Right. And again, as it goes backwards compared to as you told it to me, what did you notice happening to the feelings and notice how they get less? Right. Because the reason that you've stayed troubled isn't because that was such an awful moment. Even though it was. It's because your brain didn't know the awful moment ended. Got it?
[35:26] B: Yeah.
[35:27] A: Yeah. So. So now we want to get that fully in because you can remember him doing that. You can remember him jumping and scaring you, that it was going to fall. You can remember all that happening. You can remember putting on your shirt. Brandi, stop putting on your shirt. I'm not putting on my shirt.
[35:42] B: Good.
[35:43] A: Well, stop putting on your flip flops. Right, well, stop me from putting on my shoes.
[35:46] B: They're already on there.
[35:47] A: Right, right. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. So you're not putting on your shirt. Well, stop him from putting his penis in your mouth. Say he's not doing that. Yeah. Cause check.
[35:55] B: Yeah. It's not there.
[35:56] A: It's not there, is it? Right. Yeah, check. Right. Right. Good. That's right. Good. So then where is that moment? Say no longer exists.
[36:04] B: It doesn't exist.
[36:05] A: That's right. And as that starts to get in, what do you notice happening to the feelings? That's right. Right. And again, that happening, did that have anything to do with you?
[36:16] B: No.
[36:17] A: No. Did it have anything to do with being in an elevator? Got it. Had everything to do with whatever was fucked up with him.
[36:24] B: Yeah.
[36:27] A: Right. And see, again, you didn't know that you were born into a fucked up situation. Right. That led you to, quote, unquote, certain choices that weren't really choices. They were controlled choices. So I thought I had freedom, but I didn't actually have freedom. Right. So close your eyes. Picture that earlier. You let her know that that's over, finished. That it no longer exists. That that happening had nothing to do with you. Had everything to do with what was off with him. That's right. Let her know that you got born into a fucked up situation. That's right. Let her know how you're choosing you now. Let her know all the changes you're making. That's positive for you. That's right. Let her know about the elephant ears. Graduating. Learn about going off to college. Let her know. That's right. And as she gets it, what do you notice now, happening to the earlier you. It's okay, right? Yeah, Just check. How's your body feeling now?
[37:42] B: Relax.
[37:43] A: Right. And so that she gets that earlier part, that unconscious part. Realize it had nothing to do with the elevator. Right. And again, as it starts to get in, what do you notice now? Yeah, you can open your eyes, right. So you can just think about, like, there might be a time they might have to go back to the main office. Right. And it might be one of those times you're like, you know what? I'm actually interested in getting some exercise because we want you to take the stairs, not because you can't take an elevator, but because you wanted to get exercise.
[38:21] B: Yeah. We didn't get to go to the gym this morning.
[38:24] A: Right. So as we think about it, it's absolutely okay to skip the elevator if the purpose for you is to get exercise. Okay, got it, got it. Which is very different than, oh, no, I can't go in that place. Right, Right. So as you check and you think about an elevator now, what are you noticing?
[38:45] B: I have a choice.
[38:46] A: You do, don't you?
[38:47] B: Yep.
[38:48] A: Right? That's right. And heck, I might take the elevator on the way up and I might not take it on the way down and it still might just be for exercise. Right. Or I might walk the stairs on the way up because that's more exercise and take the elevator on the way down. That's right. Got it. Yeah, absolutely. And see, these are the things that we're going to begin to unravel and unwind and clear. Because when a baby is born, even if they're born into a fucked up situation, the birth of the child, the child doesn't come out of the womb going, gosh, I am fucked up. There is something really wrong with me. Right. Even if they have loving parents, their parents might do something that then has them feel like it was me. Yeah, right. You could have a really loving parent do a really fucked up thing. Because there was a long period of time, in particular in the Deep south, that corporal punishment was the way to show love. So if you did something you weren't supposed to do, go get the switch and let me whoop you with it. And then, and then you need to not be upset over it. You need to smile afterwards. Of course.
[40:12] B: Yeah.
[40:13] A: Let me just swallow it.
[40:15] B: I think that's why I have issues with my dad, honestly, because I respect him and I love him for taking the time to raise me, but the way he did it was pretty up. Not he never touched me or nothing like that. And he always protected me. But there was never a level of severity. It was all or nothing type deal.
[40:32] A: So say more. What does that mean? How so?
[40:35] B: Like I have teeth because of braces. Without braces I probably have no teeth. Cuz like I had a smart mouth and it. I got knocked in the mouth quite a bit.
[40:46] A: Okay, so he punched.
[40:47] B: Yeah.
[40:48] A: Yeah. Cuz you were being smart.
[40:49] B: Yeah. I told him he could kiss my ass one time I went through the wall. You know, just stuff like that.
[40:55] A: Yeah. Cuz that that would warrant it. Just saying, I mean like, I know, but notice. Notice how you get it. Right. Yeah, but back then part of you felt like maybe I deserved it.
[41:11] B: Yeah, yeah. Cause you know, if I hadn't even been smart enough, then I wouldn't have got hit and stuff like that.
[41:16] A: Right. But you know what? That discounts him.
[41:20] B: There's also times where like I got drunk out of bed one time, I got my ass beat because I looked like my mom, which had nothing to do with me. You know, like there's depending on his using and stuff like that. It was a lot depending on the level.
[41:35] A: Right. But so again, even if you had done something, I don't know if I gave you the example, the kid comes home, he's got two Ds and two Fs.
[41:43] B: I would have been dead.
[41:44] A: Mom is pissed. Mom says you wait until your father comes home. Dad comes home, dad sees mom's face, dad looks at the grades, Dad's freaking enraged, storms into the kid's room, yanks the kid out of the chair, throws him over the bed, yanks his pants down, takes the belt off buckles side first, and just starts going at him. The kid is going to feel at 11, it's happening because I got bad grades. But is it?
[42:19] B: No, it's happening because dad has a problem.
[42:21] A: Right.
[42:23] B: Does I view it then?
[42:25] A: Because you know now as an adult, as a parent, there's a lot of other ways to handle bad grades.
[42:32] B: Yeah.
[42:33] A: Than hitting the kid with the buckle of the belt. Y. Right. So even when you were being smart and said you can kiss my ass, isn't there a multitude of other ways dad could have handled that situation?
[42:54] B: Oh, definitely. That's why I said there was no level of severity with him.
[42:57] A: It was just right. But again, even back then you didn't know how not well dad was. Yeah, makes sense.
[43:08] B: Yeah. Yeah. You know when it clicked, honestly, is a few years ago I got out of jail and he actually said I could come stay with him. Which only lasted four days before we Got a fist mite. When I got out of jail, I found out that he was in a nursing home, rehabilitational, because him and his friends were out. This man is 73, by the way. He and his friends were so high on meth driving around that aliens abducted them, and he told his doctor this. So the doctor put him in a nursing home to be rehabilitated. Yeah, that's. That's my dad. Oh, man.
[43:49] A: Isn't it so good?
[43:51] B: I know. I mean, I'm serious. Like, I'm. Like. I used to hate my mom because she left him, but, golly, she was a smart one. That's just facts. It sucks, but it's life.
[44:02] A: Yeah. Yeah. I got lucky because I had one good parent, and it wasn't my dad.
[44:09] B: You lucked out.
[44:10] A: I did.
[44:11] B: Yeah.
[44:11] A: I got lucky because I got one good parent.
[44:13] B: Yeah, Both of mine are one's better than the other, but that's not saying a whole lot.
[44:20] A: I know, right? Right.
[44:24] B: Oh, man. But, you know, that's when I realized that he was.
[44:31] A: Right. So you didn't know that. So you can even remember him slugging you, maybe breaking a tooth?
[44:37] B: Broke my jaw.
[44:38] A: Breaking your jaw. Right. You can remember him doing that? You remember putting your glasses on?
[44:43] B: Yeah.
[44:43] A: Brandy, stop putting on your glasses. Say, I'm not putting on my glasses. We'll stop him from breaking your jaw. He's not breaking my jaw. Right. So where is it? Say it doesn't exist.
[44:52] B: It doesn't exist.
[44:53] A: Right. And him doing that, did that have anything to do with you?
[44:57] B: No.
[44:58] A: Right. Is there anything that a daughter could have done that would have warranted getting punched so hard that it would break her jaw?
[45:06] B: No.
[45:07] A: Got it.
[45:08] B: Yep.
[45:09] A: Right. Right. So as this starts to get in, what do you notice now?
[45:18] B: I'm okay.
[45:19] A: You are, aren't you?
[45:20] B: Yeah, I graduated.
[45:23] A: That's right.
[45:24] B: Yeah.
[45:25] A: That's right. And you're on your way to creating a distinctly different life than you've ever had before. When the emotional wounds heal, my brain stops triggering. I'm able to see things more clearly. I'm able to take the wisdom gained from going through difficult situations. That's why Native American cultures were trust your elders. They're more wise because they've gone through more life. Make sense. So as we get these emotional wounds healed, and you begin to lighten up, and you become more okay in you and more at peace. And. And any of the anger or resentments or guilt or shames over your own stuff also starts to dissipate because you couldn't have done it. Back then, any other way than the way it went down. Even though we don't like a lot of the ways that it went down, you couldn't have done it any other way than that. And again, as that starts to get in, that reorganizes and restructures your brain so that it's more optimized to work more in the way that you want it to.
[46:53] B: Yeah.
[46:54] A: Yeah.
[46:54] B: Can I ask you a question?
[46:58] A: No questions.
[47:01] B: I have a. I don't. I have a verbal contract with my dad. Because of his affiliations, I have to uphold that. Where just based off of what I've seen him do, repercussions will be dealt with with my sister. So how do I deal with not.
[47:23] A: What's a verbal agreement?
[47:25] B: He is a gang member. I am not. But I'm tied to him. So whenever he's an enforcer. So when he called, like, if he wants something done, I'm obligated to listen to whatever he says.
[47:46] A: You were obligated then.
[47:50] B: Yeah, but now I have a kid. Like, that's what screws me up is at the time I didn't have kids, so I didn't have any vulnerability.
[47:56] A: Correct.
[47:57] B: Now I do.
[47:58] A: Okay. And you're thinking that dad would do something to your kid?
[48:02] B: He already asked my daughter. Not like sexually, but he did keep her from me on a Christmas. And I wound up smashing his head through the wall or the window to get her back and quit talking to him for a very long time. Actually seven years, until I had my son.
[48:20] A: And then the son is the little 17 month old.
[48:22] B: Yeah. I screwed up and named. I didn't screw up, but I named him after my dad, which until. Gives my dad a legacy or something is what he called it. I don't know what that means, honestly, because I'm not in his little affiliate. It's not little and his. I'm not affiliated with him, but that's kind of what bothers me with.
[48:46] A: Oh, good. So you gave dad a legacy, Meaning he's got somebody with his name that's family after him. That gets you out of obligation.
[48:56] B: My kid pays for that, right?
[48:57] A: No, your kid doesn't pay because your kid's never been in. The legacy is the name.
[49:03] B: Okay?
[49:04] A: The name is what carries on, not the actions.
[49:09] B: I mean, like the legacy of following him and his.
[49:12] A: No, the legacy. Legacy would have been following him and his gang, regardless of the name. Right. Following him in the gang is a different thing than I've named somebody after you because you're an important figure in my Life. Even if you're fucked up.
[49:30] B: Okay. No, that's cool. That's what I wanted to do.
[49:33] A: You follow me with that Brandy. So even though you're fucked up, I name somebody that gives. That's my check. That doesn't put my son indebted to him to follow dad's life. Because the longevity of the legacy is on the way. To the next generation.
[49:53] B: I don't qualify because I'm a girl. Dad just found that out.
[49:57] A: Right. But to the next generation. Like what, dad? What would it be like for your name to carry on which is different than your actions?
[50:08] B: Okay.
[50:10] A: I didn't name him after you so that he could have the same actions as you.
[50:16] B: Yeah.
[50:17] A: I named him after you so that your name carries on.
[50:22] B: Well, it wasn't that deep.
[50:24] A: It doesn't have to be.
[50:25] B: I was just gonna say cuz I.
[50:26] A: Didn'T know who his daddy was. Again, it doesn't have to be that deep. You can say that to dad. Okay. If it ever comes to pass. Cuz that's the purpose, not the actions. Cuz I could have named him a different name to get him to do the actions.
[50:45] B: All right. Okay. So do I just not contact him?
[50:57] A: I mean, well, there isn't a reason to contact him now. Even if he's looking for you. You're in a program in a safe house.
[51:08] B: Yeah.
[51:18] A: You're in the process of rehabilitating you. What I would say is it's not that we will never have a conversation with dad. We're not in the place to have the kindest conversation I would want to have with Dad.
[51:32] B: I don't like that's the whole thing. I don't even feel an obligation to talk to him.
[51:37] A: Correct. So not only do you not feel an obligation, you're not even in the right space headspace to have a conversation. The kind that you would. That would be useful to have with him. You're just not there yet. Doesn't mean that that won't ever happen. But we have other things that we want to prep you around and get you centered whole and well before you ever do. Got it?
[52:11] B: Yep.
[52:12] A: Cool. You did great today. Thank you. Really good seeing you.
[52:15] B: Thank you. I was like, oh, man. I.
