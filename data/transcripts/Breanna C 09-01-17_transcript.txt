[00:00] A: Okay. So today is September 1st. It's my birthday month. Isn't that exciting? I get a whole month now that I'm an adult. It's not just a day. It's a whole month. It's really cool. So anyway, it's September 1st, Brianna. This is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that that recording, given what we do, is transformative. May be made available in teaching professionals how to do what we're doing. We're also sitting here with Steve, who's also observing how. How all of this is done. So we got that out of the way. Wanted to make sure all of that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:32] B: Yes.
[00:32] A: Okay, cool. So given that you're here and we've got, like, a chunk of time, what do you want our time to be doing for you? Meaning if we could change for you problematic ways that you feel or think or act or react, what is it that we want to get better?
[00:54] B: I guess being negative would be somewhere.
[00:57] A: To start being negative. So how.
[01:00] B: So what does that mean, like, about life in general? I guess. I don't know.
[01:07] A: Well, what is it that you mean when you say be negative?
[01:11] B: Like, not thinking the worst is gonna.
[01:13] A: Happen, thinking the worst is gonna happen. But that's useful. Don't you think that people would be better off if they walked around thinking that life isn't good?
[01:23] B: Do I think it would be better?
[01:24] A: Yeah. No, you don't. See, I think it would be. You ever see that guy with the shirt? You know, it's a little stick figure, and he's, like, playing Frisbees with his dog, or he's bicycling or he's walking or he's jogging. He's always got a big smile on his face, and on the top it says, life is good. And for those people who are walking down the street, I want to run and clothesline him and knock him to the ground and then kick him a couple times in the ribs and ask him, how about now? Is it still good? And if they say yes, I'll stomp on their chest a couple times. How about how? Because I think people would be better off thinking that life isn't good. That way they're not disappointed when bad shit happens and they get to be pleasantly surprised if something good comes along the way. I mean, you wouldn't want to be thinking that way sometimes, because then you're more prepared.
[02:12] B: Yeah.
[02:14] A: Yeah. So about life. But do you have negative thoughts about you?
[02:17] B: Yeah, all the time.
[02:18] A: Oh, like what? What do you say?
[02:21] B: What don't I say?
[02:23] A: Oh, I don't know, anything. I'm not in there.
[02:28] B: True.
[02:28] A: That's right.
[02:32] B: That I'm not good enough.
[02:33] A: Okay, how do you know when to say that?
[02:37] B: I don't know. How do I know when to say?
[02:39] A: Yeah, like what was it that you were seeing happening that then you would say, oh, I'm not good enough?
[02:44] B: I guess the fact that I'm a drug addict.
[02:47] A: Okay, so when you think of having used, then you go, I'm not good enough.
[02:50] B: Yeah.
[02:51] A: Okay, what else? How else do you do it?
[02:55] B: I don't really know how to answer that.
[02:57] A: I know it's weird, but what are the other things that you see happening or envision going on that then you go, I'm such a.
[03:07] B: Maybe the fact that my dad wasn't around.
[03:10] A: Okay, so there's probably where it started. Bad feelings about you feeling that dad being not around had something to do with you or your own lovability or whether you were good enough. Even if logically you can go, well, that probably had more to do with dad and whatever issues were going on with dad and not about me and my lovability. It hasn't felt that way. And since. So we want that to change so that you actually feel that inside. What? You know, like, wouldn't you want to be more peaceful with all of that? So that it never stopped hurting? Yeah, because it feels like it has something to do with you. Even if it isn't kind of like in. This is one of my favorite examples. Steve's heard it before, you know, kids in the cafeteria. He's 13, he's got a tray, it's got some soup on it and grilled cheese. And he's walking to his table and tripped and he falls and it splatters everything all over the place. Tomato soup. Awful, right? The cafeteria, which was loud, goes completely silent. Everybody turns and look at him and they all start laughing. Loser. Haha. They all make fun of him. The kid wants to like shrivel up and like disappear, right? He's feeling like they're all laughing at me. And they are. But would it have mattered whether it was that kid or any other kid in the school having that same kind of accident? Isn't that what the kids would do? So it had nothing to do with the kid. It had to do with what happened. Right. And when we're little, the problem is that we're lied to when we're kids. You didn't know that because you were little. You didn't know that you were being lied to. You know, when they told you things about, you know, fairies and, you know, princesses and, you know, magical things and, you know, tooth fairies and, you know, Santa Clauses and all sorts of lies that tell you that if you're good, your life will be good, which makes you feel like then if something bad happens, it's because I was bad, or I'm unlovable or there's something wrong with me or maybe I'm not enough. We want that to hold. Be shifted because those weren't actually accurate statements that we learned back then. Right. You know, as an adult that that shit can happen to good people without them doing a thing wrong. The problem is what we learned first as what kind of sticks. So we want to get that thing turned around so that you're at peace, that you're free from the hurt and the pain. Over that. That would be useful. Okay. We want to be getting it so that you feel, well, good about what you're up to and where you're headed. I don't think it would be useful for you to feel good about you. Do you know why? No. I know that sounds weird, right? Why wouldn't you want me to feel good about me? Right? No, but, see, I kind of think of it more like, when people feel really good, they're not thinking about themselves. They're not walking around. Oh, Joss. I'm like, I feel so good about me. Aren't I just so wonderful? Right? That's not how they walk around. They walk around more like good, but outwardly focused. So that's why I would be saying feeling good about what you're up to, where you're headed, what you've come through and now are on the other side. I'd be wanting you to feel good about that because you're much more than just the actions that have happened or the things that you've done. You're not even those things. They're just things that you've done. They're not actually you. So we want you to have access to more of who you are, becoming more peaceful inside. That would be useful. Okay. What else do we want to do for you?
[06:43] B: I don't know. I'm kind of. Kind of have a hard time when put on the spot, so.
[06:48] A: Oh, I don't think so. You've done two things already, and there's no spot.
[06:56] B: That's true.
[06:58] A: That's right. We're just having a conversation that's like, hey, you know, if I could change things for me by the way, does it ever seem, other than, like, the spirit stuff with dad, that there are other things that you've gone through that although they're over, they still kind of bother you? Not that you always think about them, but if you do, there's still attached to it.
[07:16] B: Yeah.
[07:17] A: Okay.
[07:18] B: My family member, actually.
[07:21] A: So we want to get that cleared.
[07:23] B: Yeah.
[07:23] A: So that. That doesn't bother you anymore because that also feels like it meant something about me. Yeah. So we want that going.
[07:32] B: Yeah.
[07:33] A: Okay. I know how to do that, too. We can't get that better. Cool. What else are we wanting to do for you?
[07:40] B: I was in, well, several very abusive relationships.
[07:46] A: In both a physical and a verbal way. Okay.
[07:51] B: Yeah.
[07:51] A: Well, good thing you're not in those now.
[07:53] B: Yeah.
[07:53] A: Yeah.
[07:54] B: That's for sure.
[07:55] A: That's right. Good news thing. Good job. Yeah, exactly. That's a really good news thing. Right? Yeah. Okay. So the effect that those things have had, again, we want that gone so it doesn't impact who you are and how you, like, know yourself to be. Yeah. Okay, cool. What else?
[08:23] B: I guess I'm dealing with, like, dcf.
[08:32] A: How so?
[08:33] B: Well, my mom wants to adopt my daughter.
[08:35] A: Okay.
[08:36] B: And I don't know. I'm just kind of a mess about it.
[08:40] A: Do you want your mom to adopt your daughter?
[08:42] B: It's not that I don't want her to. I was kind of scared at first. I went to mediation yesterday because I thought that if I did go through with the adoption, that she would maybe keep her from me. But learning that there could. There's stipulations that she has to let me see her and be in her life and stuff if I'm doing good, so I feel better about it. But I didn't sign anything yesterday, so.
[09:06] A: Okay. So you got some more information? That kind of.
[09:11] B: She's agreed to let me see her once a week, bare minimum, so that's really good.
[09:18] A: What's the purpose of mom adopting her?
[09:21] B: I got kicked out of. I was staying with my mom, with also my daughter, and DCF came into my life and kicked me out because I was using around her. Yeah.
[09:36] A: Okay. And what was the drug of choice?
[09:39] B: Mostly opiates.
[09:40] A: Okay.
[09:41] B: Also meth.
[09:42] A: Okay. But, I mean, how long have you been clean and sober now?
[09:48] B: Since May 10th.
[09:52] A: Awesome. Way to go.
[09:54] B: Thanks.
[09:56] A: That's awesome. Good job. All right.
[09:58] B: I don't really. I don't know if it's that I don't give myself enough credit for it, but I'm pretty effing proud of myself, you know?
[10:08] A: Yeah.
[10:08] B: And it didn't hit me until yesterday. Like, this is a big deal because, I mean, even though, even though I'm like court ordered to Sayla, I could leave, I could walk out the front door anytime I want, but I'm not going to because I want better for myself.
[10:25] A: Isn't that cool? Yeah, me too. Yeah. Okay, so we want to get that whole thing, the conflict, the confusion about what's best to do now and in the big picture of things, we want that stuff to be settled so that you're more clear and know what makes sense to do. Yeah. How old?
[10:50] B: She's three.
[10:50] A: She's three. Okay. I have an eight and a four.
[10:56] B: Daughters.
[10:56] A: Yes. That's fun sometimes. Sometimes it's not. But I think that's part of being a parent, right?
[11:08] B: Yeah.
[11:09] A: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So there's that. There's the stuff that's happened. There's this. Sometimes you feel like kind of down. Depressed. When you're feeling depressed, how does that impact you?
[11:25] B: It's always different.
[11:27] A: But like, do you feel low? Do you feel lack of energy? Do you feel tired? Do you feel sad?
[11:34] B: Do you feel like all the above.
[11:36] A: And you're getting a little bit of it now, aren't you?
[11:37] B: Yeah.
[11:38] A: Okay. Which is really good. You know, why not? Because I like people who feel bad in front of me. Because in order to make that change, we need to light up the problem. So we just got it activated. Now we can start taking your attention away from the there so that we can change how that's wired. Yeah, because what was it that you were thinking about or saying to yourself as you were feeling? A little bit of it.
[12:04] B: I feel, I don't know. The main thing for me is like, I don't know if shame or guilt, but I feel like I like just abandoned my daughter.
[12:20] A: Okay.
[12:20] B: You know, because when, when DCF got involved, I kind of went off the deep end. That's when I started shooting up.
[12:28] A: And it made it worse.
[12:30] B: Yeah, and it made it worse. And I just kept numbing and numbing and numbing because I didn't know what else to do, you know, I didn't have a stable place to stay. So how could I see my daughter if I don't even have a place to lay my head at night? You know, I didn't want her to see me like that. Yeah, it was rough.
[12:52] A: Yeah. So you've got a lot of bad feelings over having done that.
[12:57] B: Yeah.
[12:58] A: Okay. So would it be okay for you to no longer feel bad about that? Because if you stopped feeling bad over what you did. Would that mean that what you did was okay?
[13:09] B: No.
[13:09] A: Oh, okay. So it would be okay now, Right. It would be now okay for you to no longer feel bad about that. Right. Okay. Because we know that you being okay now doesn't mean that what you did back then was okay. We just also know that you feeling, like, at peace and good with you is gonna have you do better moving forward.
[13:32] B: It's like the saying, accepting is not the same as agreeing.
[13:37] A: Yeah. Right. Okay. So we want to get the guilt, the shame, the bad feelings over things really going off track after you were kind of thrown out in that. So that you're no longer feeling bad about that. Cool. Anything else?
[13:52] B: That's pretty much it for now.
[13:54] A: For now. Okay. So if we, like, in the, you know, next hour and a half, get all that better for you, would that be okay? Yeah, I think that would be okay. Cool. Because that's where we're headed is like, you being more at peace, free from the effect of that stuff, so that you experience more ease and comfort a lot lighter, a lot more up, a lot more ease in moving through stuff that would be useful for you outwardly. Focus, Feeling good about what you've gone through, where you're headed, what you've already done, and on your way to even more. So, like, there's, like, that sense of, like, joy in what you're up to. That would be really good. Right. Because that's where we're headed. So the question isn't, Brianna, how that's gonna happen, that we get you there, because you don't even have to see the you like me, but you can see me and know that I'm seeing that you that I'm describing just as clearly as I'm seeing the you in front of me. And I know how to get you to be there. Got it. So the question isn't how it's gonna happen, just would that be okay? It would be cool. So if it's okay, then let's symbolize you that way. Wild animals, something up in the sky, natural formation of the earth to symbolize you that way. What comes to mind?
[15:07] B: Like what?
[15:08] A: Wait. Light and clear and free and peaceful, no longer troubled by what happened, feeling really good about what you've already accomplished on the way to doing even more. And if we were to symbolize that way of mind, working as a wild animal or something up in the sky or a natural formation of the earth, what comes to mind.
[15:31] B: As an animal?
[15:32] A: Yeah.
[15:35] B: I don't know.
[15:36] A: You don't know. But we're gonna make it up. Nobody knows. There hasn't been one yet, so we just make it up. But if we were to symbolize you as an animal, you, that's clear, that's peaceful, that's free, that's present, that's feeling good about what she's up to and what she's done on her way to doing even more. If we symbolize you that way, as a wild animal or something out in nature, what comes to mind? What comes to mind? An eagle. Yeah. As you see the eagle, is it moving or still and is it soaring or flapping?
[16:08] B: Soaring.
[16:09] A: Yeah. So now we've got that soaring eagle that's symbolizing that you. We're gonna do a process that activates, increases your mind's response towards what the essence eagle symbolizes. Very simple. You're going to look up towards the yellow path. You're going to think eagle and take a slow breath in. So look up, think eagle. Breathe in. That's the first part. That was simple, right? You did it great too. So the second will be the exact same thing as that. This time though, after inhaling, you exhale and close your eyes. So look out, think eagle. Deep breath in. And then exhale and close your eyes. Eyes. And now you can open your eyes. Good. Same exact thing as that. This time though, when eyes close, they remain closed. You bring awareness into your breath. So look up the eagle breathing in. That's right. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. And with your eyes closed, they rest. You can notice your breath and that as you do, it's happening in a way that's just a little bit slower and deeper. That's right. Than how you automatically breathe. And then when you're ready, you'll take another slow breath in. That's right. And then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. And just check in. How's your body feeling now?
[17:40] B: Calm.
[17:41] A: It is, isn't it? So that's the thing that we're interested in doing, is we accelerate healing when our body's at rest. It's why when somebody has a cold or a flu or after a major surgery or even a little surgery, we tell those people to do the same thing, which is get rest. Because the changes that we're doing for you are all preconscious and inside reactions to stuff. We want your body to be at rest so it accelerates the healing. Makes sense. So again, you're going to think about the eagle. Take a slow breath in and then exhale and close your eyes. Good. With eyes closed, they rest as your eyes rest closed, you also rest. Notice how you can be aware of your breath, the sound you hear, how it feels to be sitting in the way. You are noticing all of that. At the same time, the unconscious parts are organizing towards what that soaring eagle symbolizes that you clear, quiet and peaceful. That's right. And free from the effect that that stuff has had. So that you're feeling really good about what you've done, where you're headed, on your way. All organizing towards that eagle as you rest. Which means the next time you close your eyes, it'll be even easier to just drop inside even more and experience even more of that calm, peace, easy, flowing energy. And then when you're ready, you'll take another slow breath in. That's right. And then exhale and open your eyes. And again, those short moments that eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself?
[19:46] B: It's just the calmness keeps getting more and more.
[19:50] A: Yeah, your body's responding to what we're doing. Change is beginning to happen at a deeper level. And just like if we were planting seeds in the soil, right? We take the package of seeds, we know that there's a picture on the outside, but it doesn't look like the seeds on the inside. But when we plant the seeds in the soil and we cover it up and maybe we water it, we know that a lot is going on before we ever see any of it. Much of what's happening happens at a deeper level inside of you. Now, just as you're resting makes sense. So we want to do one other thing. And I'm going to show you this because I think it's kind of interesting. If we just took this hand like this and kind of turned it like that and had that flat like that, and you were to look at that spot there. Now don't do anything at all. Just look at that spot to move that hand or those fingers. But just kind of begin to realize what happens as we begin to notice that you don't have to do anything to move it, but you can begin to become aware of small movement happening. I don't know whether it's gonna be. That's right. Twitches. That's right. Wiggles within the fingers. That's right. On its own. That's your unconscious, Brianna, Letting you know that it's responding to you already having the resources inside to reorganize how your brain has been responding to this stuff. So that. That's right. You don't have to do anything at all to notice it happening. But the More that you realize it's you responding now to your mind which is responding. Responding to you. That's right. Which means your body will become more and more peacefully resting. And you probably haven't been noticing that your eyes haven't been blinking. That's right. But as you do now, notice that when you. Your eyes blink, they'll close. That's right. And you can notice what's happening in that hand, but also realize that you weren't paying attention to this hand. Which is catalytic. That's right. Weird.
[22:08] B: What does that mean, catalytic?
[22:10] A: Just kind of wax, like kind of almost frozen, not really moving at all. That's right. But again, just check. How's your body feeling now?
[22:17] B: That's cool.
[22:18] A: Yeah. So I'd like you to think of a time when you are outdoors in nature and you see something that's beautiful. What is it that you see?
[22:26] B: The sky.
[22:27] A: There's a moment that you're looking at the sky and the hues and the colors, and you're feeling, like, peaceful. And some people might say it's in seeing that that gave you the feelings. But if we looked at it differently, we would say that in seeing that, it drew awareness in towards your center. Because at your center, you are always peaceful, excited. Kind of like if I'm at the campfire, I take my hands towards the frames and I say, oh, it's getting hotter. Are the flames getting hotter? I'm becoming more aware of it. So we know that with life experiences, your awareness has sometimes been anywhere but at your center. Stressors open. Right? But the way we're going to think of it is that no matter where it's been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited. Got it. And just like there are three of us in the room, and you know it because your senses bringing data, intellect organizes it. That's knowledge. We call knowledge light. Sometimes we also refer to the light at the center, wisdom. And so we've got light of knowledge and light of wisdom. And I remember working with a girl one time. We had lots of crappy stuff happen, different things. But one of the things earlier is when her brother was like, she was five, he was nine. He would take Matchbox cars, drive them up her leg and park them. And so there was a lot about all of that. But when we worked together, cleared it, it was gone. She was present, feeling great. So I had to ask her the question. That pain, I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone. I don't feel it. I go, I know. Isn't that Cool. She goes, yeah. I go, but where was it? She goes, huh? I go, well, like, was it at the surface level? And she's like, no, it wasn't a thinking pain. I go, oh, well, then maybe it was at your center. She's like, how could it survive in light where I'm peaceful, excited? I go, well, then where was it? She goes, clearly, it was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I go, well, what happened? So the lights, they're not touching the shadow. The distortion's gone. And it's kind of like this way, you know, you have a body, but you're not your body. It's yours, but it isn't you. Right. Like, we can know that you have elbows and toes, but you're not your elbows or your toes. I saw that. How did that one happen?
[24:28] B: Well, it started as an abscess, and it got really infected.
[24:33] A: Yeah.
[24:33] B: And my options were either stay in the hospital for six weeks with a chance that it might not heal right, or get it cut off.
[24:42] A: Right. And that made the better decision. Right? Exactly. Yeah. My mom, when she was 18, she was working at an ice cream store that sold snow cones, and the ice got stuck, so she stuck her finger in and chopped off it. So. But when she goes over and just like you to, like, friends houses, they don't say they're wrong, but almost all of you could come over. They don't say that. Right. Because you're all there, even if that part is missing. And did you know that if we actually thought about the part of her body that's really solid, you have to go out five decimal points. Literally, it's 0.00001% of our human body solid. The rest of us is space. If we took an atom, small, tiny, tiny little particle, and we blew it up to the size of a marble, the electron that floats around it would be more than a football field away. That's how much space there is. Right.
[25:34] B: It's insane.
[25:35] A: It's insane. Why do we feel freaking solid? It's because when a ceiling fan is on high and spinning really fast, doesn't it feel like a solid blade?
[25:45] B: Yeah.
[25:46] A: We are made up of tiny subatomic particles that are constantly vibrating and none of those subatomic particles that make you up right now. I mean, even if we came back a year from today, 99.9999% of them would not be here. Isn't that weird? So we know that you have a body. It's yours, but it isn't you. You also have thoughts they're your thoughts. They're not yours. They're not you. They're your thoughts, right? You have emotions, feelings that you experience, you feel, you express, but you're you, regardless of how you feel. There's things you do and stuff you've done, but you're not even those things that you've done or the things that have happened to you. Which leads us to the weirdest question of all. If you're not the things you've done or the things that have happened to you, if you're not even what you do, if you're not your feelings, if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not your body, then what the heck are you? It's weird, right?
[26:38] B: Yeah, it's weird.
[26:40] A: Yeah. So, I mean, for our purposes, with what we're doing, let's just say, like, the who you really are is what you became aware of as you see the sky. That who you are is that light at the center, and the light that is you. It can't be touched, it can't be hurt or harmed. It only experiences love that it allows in. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. So, like, you know, I mean, we can kind of think of, like, all sorts of stuff, like, never touched me, mess with my body, hurt my feelings, but never actually got who I really am. And I'll show you something that's really weird. So take that hand again and just hold it for, like, this good. Look at that spot right there. As you look at that spot, I'm going to take my hand, I'm going to move it in as it moves. And you see it moving in, getting closer, closer, closer, closer. Before it touches, notice how you can feel it. Isn't that weird? You can feel my hand right here, different than when it's way over there. And you can see my point, that with it here, you feel it. You feel my hand touching who you really are. Essence Light. That's right. Which means I'm coming closer, Vienna, detaching who you really are than anybody that ever hurt your feelings or messed with your body or changed the way you were thinking. Because who you are can really only be touched with respect and love. That's right. And as all of that is beginning to transform, think eagle soaring. Take a big, deep breath in. And now close your eyes. Drop down. Down, down. Deeper, deeper. All the way down, down, down, down. That's right. All the way down towards that calm. That's right. Peaceful, light, easy, flowing energy. That's right. So much more to you than any of that stuff becoming more free to be more of who you really are. Light. Clear. That's right. And then when you're ready once again, you can slowly take your time to find your way back. Up and up. Take a big deep breath in. Exhale and open your eyes. There we go. That was nice. Now the last little thing to explain to you is the reason that the crap that we've gone through still bothers us isn't because of what happened, isn't because it was wrong or I shouldn't have done it or they shouldn't have done it. It's because when it did, it short circuited the emotional brain. Which means that brain doesn't know negative experience stopped. The rest of us do. But that's stuck on what happens. In essence is the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening got glued together and are reliving ongoing. That's why anytime I think about it, anytime I'm reminded of it, there's still all the yuckiness. Makes sense. So the first thing that we're going to do is your unconscious is going to pinpoint particular experiences for us to clear. As they get clear, the emotional effect is unplugged and they no longer have any pain in their attached to them at all. Your unconscious knows more than you. You probably have an idea of some, but it's going to kind of pick the ones that it thinks would be best for us to get cleared up and better. Right? Because it knows how to heal better than you or I. I mean that's what heals the cut. We don't have to do anything. Why we get put into a cast is so that we don't heal up, screw up the body's ability to heal, right? Exactly. Same kind of thing. So that's, that's one of the things that we're going to be doing. The second thing, once we go through a negative experience, our brain attaches a meaning to it. And because it was bad and because we learned when we were little, bad things only happen when we're bad. Then the meaning that gets attached has something to do with it was my fault or I should have known better, I shouldn't have done it, or it's because I'm a loser or because I'm not good enough or there's something wrong with me or I'm unlovable. All that stuff kind of gets stuck to that make sense. Once it's stuck in that way, our brain goes whoop whoops. Like searching, scanning for anything that's similar to anything that was painful, but confuses. It confuses similar to same. So, you know, the guy's driving down the road, he's feeling really great. He's listening to music. All of a sudden the song comes on. And that was the song that his girlfriend that was playing with his girlfriend died. Now he's like, well, the song wasn't the issue. That wasn't the problem. What happened with his girlfriend was what the problem was. But they happen at the same time. So the mind confuses it. So that's why we get triggered sometimes we're consciously realizing, oh, I get that why I'm feeling this way is because of this other. But other times it just runs us and we're already hooked and we're in it. We don't huh. Then it takes a period of time before we're ever out of it make sense. So what we want to do by unplugging those memories, the brain will stop the meaning thing and then stop confusing similar as same. So you're gonna find yourself having a lot more ease in dealing with stuff. You're gonna find yourself experiencing you being more peaceful and feeling good, lighter. That's where we're headed. Got it. Okay, so one last thing. You're going to do this for me. Sleep slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. And now breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. That's right. As you're doing that, notice what happens as you pay attention to my nose. And then allow your gaze to open so that you can see more of the space. That's right. That's all the rounds. Space. Wide open. Space towards the sides. The space in between, the space up above and past the space behind you. All that space. More space and room. And notice how much more calm your body's feeling now. That's right. Now close your eyes and imagine what it would be like to be the eagle way up above, soaring in the vastness of the sky, seeing all that you can see all around big Y curves, turns S curves organizing more and more towards what that eagle's symbolizing body becoming more and more resting. So that when your unconscious in a few moments scans back to identify an experience for us to clear your body, stay nice and calm. That's right. So you can begin to find your way back up, up, up and up. As your awareness moves back into your body, take a big deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Good job. And so you, the unconscious as you're organizing towards. Towards what the eagle symbolizes, just scan back through Brianna's history to experiences that have happened that were negative and bring one to mind for us to clear. Yeah. And what comes to mind?
[34:27] B: Rape.
[34:28] A: Yeah, that would be a useful one. So the feelings, by the way, that come up when you think of that.
[34:35] B: What are the feelings like?
[34:37] A: Is it anger, hurt, or pain or guilt or shame? Combination. Okay, so would it be okay to get that going? Okay, so how we clear it? Simple. You're gonna a intend to be with me because I'm fun and this is what's happening and that isn't. And we're working on the mutual goal, so we got all of those things for us. So you're gonna intend to be with me. You're gonna tell me the facts of what happened. It'll go, this happened, this happened, this happened, this happened, this happened. Then it was done. Done. Got it. 3. How long ago did that happen? You might have been how old?
[35:07] B: 18.
[35:08] A: 18. So that happened several years ago now. Right. There have been things you've done after that that were more fun than that moment. Good. What's one thing that you've done after that that was more fun than that?
[35:19] B: I had my daughter.
[35:20] A: You had your daughter? Way more fun than that moment. Good. Something else. I mean, let's check. Did you have a good bowel movement? You know, anytime that was probably better than that moment, right?
[35:38] B: Yeah.
[35:39] A: Taking a shower might have been better than that moment. Anything, Right. You know, going in the pool, was that better than that moment? Right. Good. So what's another thing you've done that was more enjoyable in that moment?
[35:47] B: Literally anything and everything.
[35:49] A: Literally anything and everything. But think of one. Just because we like, you know, detail. Because we got. Having your daughter. Something else.
[35:57] B: Going to a music festival.
[35:58] A: Yeah. Going to a music festival. Way more joyful than that. Good. One other thing.
[36:07] B: Going to church.
[36:08] A: Yeah. Going to church was more fun than that, right? Yeah. Good. So we've got all those things. There's an aspect of your brain back then that doesn't know about any of that forward stuff. So we wanted to get good news. So the thing that happened. You're 18. It happened. You were where, when it happened?
[36:25] B: At a hotel.
[36:26] A: You're at a hotel. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[36:28] B: It was, like, getting dark.
[36:32] A: Okay, so it was like afternoon on its way to evening. Good. Right. And you're where? At the hotel? So you're in the room. Good. And you're like, standing, sitting, laying. You're laying down. Right. Like On a bed or a floor? On the bed. Right. Good. Like on your back or on your side or.
[36:47] B: My stomach.
[36:47] A: Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[36:50] B: Dude thought I was sleeping.
[36:52] A: Good job. Right. And then what happened?
[36:54] B: And he raped me.
[36:55] A: He did what?
[36:56] B: He pulled down my pants.
[36:58] A: So he pulled down your pants? He pulled down his pants. He put his penis in your butt. Penis in your vagina. Right. And that was weird. And then what happened next?
[37:07] B: I pretended to be asleep.
[37:09] A: Right. Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[37:11] B: And then he was done.
[37:13] A: And then he stopped.
[37:14] B: Yeah.
[37:15] A: And pulled out. I know. Well, eventually he did. Because there's no penis in your vagina right now. Right. So eventually he stopped and pulled out his penis from your vagina. Because it's not there now. Right, Right. Good. It's not. Does that mean.
[37:29] B: No.
[37:29] A: Okay, good. We got that. You would know. Right. So. So he stopped, and then did he pull your pants up? Right. And then he pulled his pants up or he pulled his pants up and then your pants up and then did he leave?
[37:41] B: He got in the shower.
[37:42] A: He got in the shower. Right. Which was better than when he was doing that. And then what happened next?
[37:46] B: And then I got up and left.
[37:47] A: And then you got up and left the hotel.
[37:49] B: Yeah, but I didn't have anywhere to go.
[37:51] A: Right.
[37:51] B: I just sat in front of the hotel.
[37:53] A: Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[37:55] B: And then he came down.
[37:56] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[37:57] B: Acted like nothing happened.
[37:59] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[38:02] B: I don't. I had no choice but to go back.
[38:04] A: Well, then you went back into the hotel room and that particular time ended. Right. And then eventually you got up, and then later on you had your daughter. Right. And you went to the music festival. Right. And what's the other thing?
[38:16] B: Church.
[38:17] A: Yeah. Right. Going to church. Right. So we got. Going to church on the music festival and having your daughter. And then before that, you had gone back to the room, or you had left, and then you'd gone back to the room, and then you'd gone back up with him, and then he's like, what? And then you were sitting outside, and then you had left, and then he had gone in the shower, and then he had pulled up pants. In your pants, and then he had stopped, and then he had put his penis in your vagina. Then he had pulled your pants down. Then he had come in. And then before that, you would lay down on the bed. And before that you were doing whatever you're doing. Good. Now, as I ran through it backwards, compared to forward, emotionally, how Was it stressful? Was it?
[38:51] B: Yeah.
[38:51] A: Really? As bad as it was when you were telling it to me or less.
[38:55] B: Was it as bad as when I.
[38:56] A: Was telling it to you?
[38:57] B: No.
[38:57] A: Oh, it wasn't, was it? Right, so it was less. All right. Isn't that weird? Because when you run a memory in reverse, it actually unplugs it to begins to take away the charge. So here's the third piece to this. That part of our brain doesn't work with logic. It works with patterns of association. So here's what I mean by that. You can remember earlier this morning putting your jeans on. You can remember which room you were in when you did it. But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your jeans on, and then said, brianna, stop putting on your jeans, you'd look at me and you'd go, I am not putting on my jeans. Because, you know, there's a difference between you remembering doing it and you doing it. Make sense? So that's what we want to get in. Remember getting dressed, putting your jeans on. Brianna, stop putting on your jeans. Say, I'm not putting on my jeans. Well, then stop putting on your shirt. Say, I'm not putting on my shirt. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you're not putting on your shirt. Well, stop me from putting on my jeans. Say you're not putting on your jeans. Well, stop him from putting his penis in your vagina. Say he's not putting his penis in my vagina. Well, then stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that. Well, then stop that from happening. Say it's not happening. So then where is it go? It no longer exists, which is what we want to get in, right? And again, that thing happening with that guy, did that have anything to do with you? Right. It had everything to do with what was going on with him. But you didn't know that back then, right? So close your eyes, think of that younger you, and let her know these four words. Ready? Repeat them after me. It's. It's not about me. It's not. Say it about me so that she gets it. It's not about me. Let her know that it's over, finished, completed, that it no longer exists. No, wait. Open your eyes. The wrong person's educating. See, here's the interesting thing. She doesn't know that that's over. Do you want her to get the good news? Oh, and what's happening now?
[40:47] B: What do you mean?
[40:48] A: Well, you're feeling something. What's going on? Is it tears of sadness or Relief.
[40:51] B: Relief.
[40:52] A: Oh, well, that would be really bad to start feeling those now. Right? Because she's getting the good news, isn't she? That it's not about me and that it's over. By the way, let her know that it was on the way to having her daughter. Right. When she gets that, what do you notice happened to the younger you?
[41:13] B: Happy.
[41:14] A: Oh, she is. And you wouldn't want to be really happy right now. Right now, aren't you becoming more happy and more peaceful and more at ease? Because when you think about that moment now, try to feel bad about it.
[41:28] B: I can't.
[41:28] A: I know. Isn't that weird? Well, shit, that's never happened before. That's right. Isn't that cool? Right, because when your brain got that it's data, it went, oh, never mind. It's never been making you feel bad because it's wanted you to feel bad. It just didn't know it stopped. Now it does. Now it's like, oh, okay, cool, we're fine. That's right. Right? Yeah. So again, you're going to think about the eagle. And as you're looking towards the eagle, you the unconscious scan back once again through experiences that have happened in Brianna's history and bring a particular moment to mind. Good. What comes to mind now?
[42:16] B: My dad left.
[42:17] A: Oh, good. You might have been how old?
[42:20] B: Like six.
[42:21] A: Six. Okay, cool. So let's get that one cleared again by being here with. So you're six. How did you find out this particular moment? You're where?
[42:30] B: At home.
[42:30] A: So you're at home. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[42:32] B: I don't remember.
[42:33] A: You don't remember? Well, what might it have been? You can make it up.
[42:37] B: Probably. Morning.
[42:38] A: Morning time. Good. And then what happened next? You would come out of your room. Right. And then what happened?
[42:46] B: My mom said, he's gone.
[42:48] A: Mom said, hey, by the way, just wanted to let you know, Dad's gone. She didn't say it like matter of fact. Was she crying? Yeah. Oh, so mom was crying, which lets you know that it wasn't a good thing. Right? Mom didn't cry when there were good things going on. So she was letting you know that this is bad. Right. And she said, he's gone. Right. Good. Then what happened next? You probably started crying.
[43:12] B: Yeah.
[43:12] A: Right. And then what might have happened next? Well, I know that's because our mind stops the story at the shitty spots and freezes it right there. That that moment doesn't know anything past it. Isn't there more enjoyable things after that? Like your daughter, It's Way more enjoyable than that, isn't it? Right. So what might have happened next?
[43:35] B: What might have happened next?
[43:38] A: You might have gotten ready to go to school.
[43:41] B: Yeah.
[43:41] A: And then you might have been dropped off at school and then you would have gone through that day. And then that particular time of mom telling you that was over. Right. And then later on you did something more fun. Right. Like have your daughter and go to the music festival. Right. And you know, go to church. Right. So we got going to church in the music festival and having your daughter. And then before that you had probably been at school and then got ready to go to school and then mom had told you he left and mom was crying and then you had walked towards mom and then you had gotten up and then before that you might have been asleep and then before that you would have been doing whatever you were doing. Good. And again, we run through it backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it different? It was, wasn't it? Right. You can remember that happening and her doing that. Right. You can remember washing your hair. No. Ever.
[44:29] B: I mean, what?
[44:32] A: Brianna, stop washing your hair. Say, I'm not washing my hair.
[44:34] B: I'm not washing her hair.
[44:35] A: Well, stop brushing your teeth. Say, I'm not brushing my teeth. Well, stop getting that tattoo. Say, I'm not kidding. Stop me from putting on my shirt.
[44:40] B: Don't put on that shirt.
[44:41] A: Well, stop me from kissing my daughter. You're not kissing your daughter. Well, stop dad from doing that. See, he's not doing that. Well, no, stop him from doing it quick. Say he's not doing that. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Right. Second, him doing that. Did that have anything to do with you? No. Did it have anything to do with his love for you? Did it have anything to do with your lovability? But back then you thought it did, right? So we want that you to know that it had nothing to do with you. So close your eyes. Picture her back then. Let her know that that's over. Let her know that dad being that way had nothing to do with you. His love, your love, your lovability had everything to do with something being off with him so that she gets it's not about me. Let her know about having her daughter. Let her know about going to that music festival. Let her know about being at church. Let her know so that she gets it. Let her know about the positive changes she's making now. Yay. That's right. Let her know so that she's getting it. And then you can open your eyes. That's Right. There we go. What's happening now?
[45:45] B: I feel better.
[45:46] A: You do, don't you? And so the last little thing that younger you back then thought that she actually needed her dad in order for her to be okay, like turn out okay. But did she need her dad in order for you to like love your daughter and want to be connected and present to her? Which is why you haven't signed anything. Because you want to make sure that you stay involved in her life. Right. So did you need your dad in order for you to be that way? But see that younger you thought she did need that. So let her know. Close your eyes. Picture that earlier you letting her know that she didn't even need her dad in order for you to be okay and love your daughter. That's right. That's right. And as she's getting that from you, take a deep breath in. And a big exhale. And one more deep breath in. And then a big exhale. And open your eyes. And what's happening now?
[46:49] B: I feel better.
[46:50] A: You do? Yeah. So think back about that moment. And what are you noticing now?
[46:55] B: It's not as bad.
[46:56] A: Well, is it bad at all? Right now it's just data. We still don't like that it happened. But there's a lot of things in life that we're gonna like that we wish had not happened. I mean, that's just how it goes, right? Yeah, but you're becoming more and more okay. Isn't that cool? Right? All right, so again, as we're thinking about that eagle, you the unconscious scan path through experiences and bring another moment to mind. There we go. Your ex. Good. We got one particular time with him.
[47:35] B: No, all the times he put his hands on.
[47:37] A: I know. So we want to think of one particular time. I mean, because when you learn how to tie a pair of sneakers, do they give you 15 pairs?
[47:43] B: No.
[47:45] A: Here you go. Learn, kid.
[47:48] B: Maybe some people, I don't know, I.
[47:50] A: Don'T think that happened. I think we get one pair and they show us bunny rabbit ears and try to teach us all sorts of weird ways to tie them. Right. So we want to get a moment that had happened with him. Right. And you might have been aware when that one happened.
[48:05] B: Motel 6.
[48:06] A: Motel 6. Good. That's where Tom Beaudet talks. And that really like, this is Tom Beaudet from Motel 6. You never watch that commercial. See, you don't watch enough TV. Alright, so you're at Motel 6, right. And then what happened next?
[48:27] B: It was. It was like.
[48:32] A: So you're in like a hotel Room.
[48:33] B: Yeah.
[48:34] A: Good. Right. And you're sleeping. Right. And then what happened next?
[48:37] B: I woke up to my ex because he knows I keep my money in my bra.
[48:43] A: Yeah. Good job. Right. So you woke up to him trying to grab money. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[48:48] B: And then he freaked out as you.
[48:50] A: Woke up and you're like, what the.
[48:51] B: Yeah, he's like, I yelled at him.
[48:54] A: Right. Good job. Right. And what happened next?
[48:56] B: And he yelled at me.
[48:57] A: Yes. Good. Then what happened?
[48:59] B: And then we got in a fight.
[49:02] A: What cost out. You were yelling. He was yelling. He got up now.
[49:06] B: Yeah.
[49:06] A: Then what happened next?
[49:07] B: He punched me in the face.
[49:08] A: He punched you in the face? Right. Like hand, like fist? Yes. Good. That hurt. And then what happened next?
[49:14] B: On the ground.
[49:14] A: Right. And then what happened? And you got back up.
[49:18] B: Yeah, I got back up.
[49:19] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[49:19] B: And then I punched him in the face.
[49:21] A: Right, good. So it's like just a prize brawl going on.
[49:24] B: Yeah.
[49:24] A: Right. Now what happened next?
[49:26] B: Trash the hotel room.
[49:27] A: Well, you guys are banging around. Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[49:31] B: The office called the phone.
[49:33] A: Yes. Hey, what are you guys doing up there?
[49:35] B: Yeah, Right.
[49:35] A: Good. Then what happened next?
[49:36] B: We had to leave.
[49:37] A: You guys gotta get the hell out of here.
[49:39] B: Yeah, good.
[49:39] A: Right. Then what happened next?
[49:41] B: I grabbed my clothes basket and started to go out the door.
[49:45] A: Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[49:47] B: I ran upstairs with the basket. Yeah, right.
[49:50] A: Good number next. Yes.
[49:52] B: And then this Hispanic guy, didn't speak, like, any English, asked me if I needed help and I said yes.
[49:59] A: Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[50:01] B: I went to their hotel room.
[50:03] A: Yes. Good.
[50:04] B: And I waited for my friend to come pick me up.
[50:07] A: Good. Right. And then your friend got there and picked you up, and then that was over. Yeah. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[50:12] B: Yeah, Right.
[50:13] A: Like.
[50:14] B: Well, I mean, it may have not been a good thing, but I went and got high.
[50:18] A: Well, that was better than that moment. Yeah, but it was to deal with that moment.
[50:22] B: Yeah, Right.
[50:23] A: Which we're getting cleared. She won't need to do that anymore. As the moments get better and better and better. Right. That's how it goes. So. So then the. But you've done other things after that that were more fun. Like go to church.
[50:39] B: Yeah.
[50:39] A: Right, Right. So we got doing that. We've got sitting here, which is more fun than that. Right. Good. And then before that, your friend had got you, and then you were waiting, and then you called your friend and then you went in their room and then he asked if he needed help. And Then you'd run upstairs and then you grabbed your stuff, and then they had said you guys needed to leave. And then there was like banging going on around. And then there was like a punch from you and them getting up. And then a punch from him. And then you guys yelling at each other, and then him reaching in to grab your money. And then you sleeping. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[51:11] B: You're really good at that.
[51:15] A: But notice what happened. You can remember all that happening, right? You can remember putting your shirt on. Stop putting on your shirt. Well, then stop him from doing that.
[51:26] B: He's not doing that.
[51:26] A: Well, then you stop doing that. We'll stop putting on your pants. Stop that from happening. So then where is doesn't exist, Right? And again, that happening with him, that had to do with what was going on with him. That's right. Which was what we want you to get in. Right? So. So again, close your eyes. Let that earlier. You know, it's not about me. Over, finished, completed. Let her know that she's free to become now more and more of who she really is. Just so much more than that stuff. And things are beginning to lighten up. Take a deep breath in. Exhale. And open your eyes. There we go. What's happening now?
[52:13] B: Feel great.
[52:13] A: You do feel great, huh? So think about that stuff that happened with boyfriend. Think about the stuff that happened with dad leaving. Think about the stuff that happened with the guy in the bed. What do you notice?
[52:32] B: Does it hurt?
[52:33] A: Oh, it doesn't. You can remember it. You remember it happening. It's not located in the same place anymore when you think about it and see it, is it?
[52:41] B: No.
[52:42] A: No. Notice how it's like further away, a little bit smaller. Right? Because it's just data. Right. You're becoming more at peace and more free. Right. And you've had bad feelings, right, over having used. And it really getting bad because, like, you didn't have, like, connection with your daughter. See, things were bad, but they got really bad. Because what was keeping the bad somewhat in check had to do with your love for her. Isn't that interesting how much you love her and want what's best for her, don't you? That's right. And want to be connected to her because you love her. Yeah. Yeah. So would it be okay for you to no longer have any bad feelings over having traveled way down? Because it is in the traveling way down that got you to be clean and SOBER now, since May 10, we wouldn't want to actually feel good about that. Huh? What's happening now?
[53:46] B: You're right.
[53:47] A: Oh, right. That's right. We wouldn't want to feel really good about that. Yeah.
[53:53] B: It is what got me here.
[53:54] A: It is, isn't it? Yeah. Right? Yeah. On your way to being a way better mom. Cause you really love her. And on your way to having your life work better for you because you're worth it. Yeah. See, you haven't been feeling that way. No. Right. I know. You know that she's worth it, but you haven't been feeling like you are. Right. But how about now beginning to feel more and more of your worth.
[54:22] B: Yeah.
[54:22] A: Yeah. And lovability. Yeah. And that you got a lot to add value. Right. In your way about improving your life. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah. And what's happening now?
[54:41] B: I feel relieved.
[54:42] A: You feel lighter and you feel lighter. Right? Yeah. Well, it'll be a lot harder to feel depressed when you're light. Yeah. Because you're up. Because think about the stuff that used to make you feel really sad and depressed from the things that you would say to yourself. And what are you noticing?
[55:10] B: It's not the same.
[55:11] A: Oh, how's it different?
[55:15] B: You made it different. You helped me make it different.
[55:17] A: No, but how's it different for you? What are you noticing that's different?
[55:21] B: I'm not blaming myself.
[55:22] A: Oh, so you're not saying that to you.
[55:24] B: Right.
[55:25] A: Oh, isn't that nice? Yeah.
[55:29] B: This is another statement.
[55:32] A: Oh, so you're feeling better about you? Yeah. Because there's gonna be lots of things that we've done, lots of things that have happened that we feel bad that we did. But based on what was going on back then, with all the experiences happening in the way they were, we just did what occurred for us to do. So the clear thing is you couldn't have not done any of that stuff that you did back then. Just like all the other stuff that has happened to you couldn't have not happened. But what's beginning to happen for you is that you're getting free from the effect that it's had both on you feeling bad over stuff you've done and then you feeling bad over stuff that happened to you. Right. Because you're realizing that you're much more than just that stuff. Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. So what's up next for you? Like, you're at Salah, Right. And what. What's your. So if we thought of, like, how do you want to be like, when you're done with this program, like, you know, there's probably short term and longer term goals.
[56:40] B: Yeah. I want to go back to school.
[56:42] A: Oh, you want to go back to school? 4. Do you have any idea?
[56:45] B: I'm thinking about getting my certificate for victims advocacy and maybe criminal justice technology.
[56:52] A: Criminal justice technology? What's that?
[56:55] B: I don't really know exactly what it is.
[56:58] A: Me either. But something to do with technology has to be computers, right?
[57:02] B: Probably. I know that it would. I didn't really know. That's why I said I don't know much about criminal justice technology. But they told me that it would look good and it would help the victim's advocacy because of, you know, if you. If you're looking for a job, you're most likely gonna get hired if you have more skills. Education skills. Yeah.
[57:25] A: Okay, so victim advocacy, that would be something.
[57:28] B: Yeah. I was thinking about going to school for like a trade that I would make a lot of money in, but I'd rather help people. I'd feel better.
[57:37] A: Well, you can't do both. It's only one or the other. I don't know. That's a good question. It is a good question. Right. What if you could do both? Like do something in a trade that could make lots of money and make a difference for others? I mean, you wouldn't want to do both. Exactly.
[57:56] B: Why not?
[57:57] A: You would want to do both. Yeah. Yeah. So let's check again. Scanning back two experiences that have happened. Think about another thing that happened with a boyfriend. Whether that one or a different boyfriend. Got one. You can remember that one happening. Right. And if you just watch it go by and then like, you know, you're doing something more fun later. What happened as you watched it go by?
[58:30] B: Faded.
[58:31] A: Oh, it faded. How was your body feeling as you watched it go by? It did, didn't it? Right. And as it faded and faded and faded and kind of moved all the way away so it was really, really small and kind of like insignificant. Remember it all happening and him doing it. Remember putting your pants on. Remember the stuff that you did? The stuff that he did. Well, stop doing that stuff. Well, stop him from doing the stuff.
[58:54] B: He's not doing the stuff.
[58:55] A: Well, so then where is it?
[58:56] B: Doesn't exist.
[58:57] A: That's right. And now think about it. What do you notice?
[59:02] B: I don't feel the same.
[59:03] A: You don't? Right. Notice how much easier it is to get it better, how much faster that went because your brain goes, oh, well, I know how to do this. I can get that better. Yeah. Are there other things that you felt bad over having done, like Guilt stuff for you.
[59:23] B: About the ex or anything?
[59:25] A: Anything in general.
[59:28] B: Like I said before, that kind of dipping on my daughter just abandoned her.
[59:34] A: Did you abandon her or did you leave her with your mom?
[59:37] B: I left her with my mom.
[59:38] A: Oh. Who was really capable of taking care of her. Oh, so you didn't abandon her. Know what you did is you protected her, didn't you?
[59:45] B: Yeah, that's true.
[59:47] A: Because you didn't have her have access to seeing you when you were really fucked up. Huh. So you actually protected her by leaving for a little while and, you know, being very interested in being back, aren't you?
[60:07] B: Yeah.
[60:07] A: Right. But you needed to get yourself to be better before you wanted to be back for her. Yeah, that's right. So did you actually abandon her? Did you, like, leave her in a really good place? You did, didn't you? And then, like, things were off, and then you've gotten yourself better. Right. Which is why you're, you know, interested in reconnecting, which is why it's really important that if mom does adopt that you like to have access and that it's based on. And you said this, me doing, you know. Well, like, me, you know, stopping with that other stuff. Right. Because that's when you want to be around her, when you're, like, clean and clear. Right? Isn't that cool? Right. So think about it now. You know, having left her with your mom, you know, really capable person who can take care of her. Right. You know, try to feel really bad about that. Right? Yeah. Cause isn't mom somebody that loves her, like, almost as much as you do? Right. Yeah. And you wouldn't want to leave her with somebody like that. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. Right. Well, what's happening now?
[61:31] B: I feel a lot better.
[61:32] A: You do, don't you?
[61:33] B: Yeah.
[61:33] A: Yeah.
[61:34] B: I never looked at it that way.
[61:36] A: Well, because there was all this, like, stuff of distortion in the way. And as we kind of peel that out of the way, you get to see it clearly for what it is. Right? Yeah. And that was like a more knowing than you actually knew as it was all going on, right? Yeah. Yeah. Any other stuff where there's been bad feelings? Any bad feelings over sexual stuff that you did with guys?
[62:04] B: Yeah.
[62:06] A: Would you like that ticket gone?
[62:08] B: Yeah.
[62:08] A: Oh. So what's something that you've been feeling bad about having done?
[62:13] B: Escorting.
[62:14] A: Escorting. Okay. And that was something that you did by yourself or did you have somebody, like, that was working you to do it?
[62:21] B: Both.
[62:22] A: A little bit of both. Okay. And when you think about the bad feelings, what's it specifically about.
[62:28] B: Me?
[62:29] A: Well, what about you again?
[62:32] B: That I'm not good enough.
[62:33] A: How did you doing that have to do with your worth?
[62:38] B: I don't know.
[62:40] A: Well, check it out. See, how do you know when to feel? Not good enough. As you're thinking about escorting, what is it that you're thinking about? What is it that you're seeing happening? Right. What is it that you're feeling inside?
[62:53] B: Ashamed.
[62:54] A: Ashamed. Okay, so you're feeling ashamed. And the shame, does that serve you? Like, are you better off feeling shameful over having been in that particular industry? Does it make you do better? Like feeling really good? Okay. Would it be okay to get the shame going? It would be. So sometimes shame is a malfunction out of the interaction between my logical brain and my emotional brain. So with your logical brain, you can think about future things, you can remember past things, you can track what's happening now. That's all with your logical brain. So therefore, with your emotional brain will mirror your logical brain. When you think about future things, it'll have the emotions paired with it. When you remember past things, it'll have the emotions paired with it. Got it. Your body's always in now. That's when you'll be feeling them. Why? If you're worried about something, you'll be feeling it now. Why? If you're remembering something bad, you'll be feeling it now. Because your body's always locked in now. So the error mechanism that happens with shame is that with your logical brain, you can conceive of having not done that stuff, whether that be with a guy that was running it or be that you were doing it on your. You can conceive of having never done it. Right, Your emotional brain. Because in conceiving you having never done it, that would be better. Your emotional brain goes, well, if it would be better, then stop doing it. Hurry. And it causes you to feel bad. That's where the shame is. The shame is actually trying to motivate you to stop doing that. Hurry, quick. Stop escorting. What are you waiting for?
[64:55] B: I'm not doing that.
[64:56] A: Right. You aren't, are you? It's kind of like if we're driving up to St. Pete and we head up the bridge and you're driving and I'm in the passenger seat and I scream at you, turn right. And you're like, where? And I go at the exit three miles back. You're an idiot. Right? That's what's going on with this thing. Your brain is trying to motivate you to stop doing that. However long ago that you were doing it. Quick.
[65:18] B: Not doing that.
[65:19] A: Right. So what I'm going to have you say next is there's nothing to be done.
[65:24] B: There's nothing to be done.
[65:25] A: Well, stop escorting. Hurry.
[65:27] B: Not doing that.
[65:28] A: There's nothing to be done. No. Hurry. Stop escorting. There's nothing to be done. No. What are you waiting for? Stop doing that.
[65:34] B: Stop doing that.
[65:35] A: Say there's nothing to be done. No. Quick, stop doing it. Well, stop having that guy run you. Right, so then where is that moment? Where is that stuff? It doesn't exist. Right. By the way, is that who you are? No, it was just something that you were doing. And why were you doing it? Because at that time, that was a way that you could actually survive.
[65:57] B: Yeah.
[65:58] A: Right. It wasn't like, you know, you didn't wake up, like, you know, when you were 13, you went, you know what? I hope one day I become an escort. That will be fucking like the ball. I want heels that are fucking so tall. That wasn't it, was it? No. You didn't have that conversation when you were 13? No. I thought that was every little girl's dream. I hope not. Right. But based on life and what was going on. You were doing what you needed to do to survive in that time. Right. And you couldn't have not done it. What's happening now? You're going, yes, I could have not done it.
[66:40] B: Yeah.
[66:42] A: Oh, how am I not doing it? Could you have not done it now, given that you did?
[66:50] B: You lost me.
[66:51] A: I know. Could you have not done it now, given that you did do it? Or better yet, how can we get you to have not done it right now?
[67:02] B: I'm not doing it right now.
[67:03] A: I know. How can we get you to have not done that then? Now, do you have a time travel machine? I got the DeLorean. Go back to the future. I don't. So the idea is everything in life that has happened couldn't have not happened. Even if we don't like it that it did, if it happened, there was something going on that caused it to happen. And because of the cause, it couldn't have not happened. So there's a rock up at the top of a hill. Every day you walk up and over the hill you come on this particular day, the rocks at the bottom of the hill, you might think to yourself, I wonder what caused it to get to the bottom? But you would never think, I wonder if there was a cause. Because, you know, given that it happened, something had to cause it to happen. Rocks just don't magically move. Right. If you walk down a sidewalk, every single day, you walk down the same sidewalk, but on this day, there's a hole right in the middle of the sidewalk. You might think to yourself, hmm, I wonder what caused the hole? But you would never think to yourself, hmm, I wonder if there was a cause. Because, you know, given that it's there, something must have caused it to be there. You don't have to know what the cause was to be getting that there was a cause. The existence of it proves it. And the deal is, because something was caused, it couldn't have not happened. Right. Lightning bolt shoots a tree, causes a branch to break and land on the ground. There are two things we know. One, given that the branch is broken and on the ground, there's no way the lightning bolt could have not hit the tree. We also know, given that the lightning bolt did hit the tree, that branch couldn't have not been broken in on the ground. So it kind of locks it in on both ends. And from this vantage point, if you had known back then, before you ever started any of that stuff, everything that you know now, if you'd known all of that back then, prior to ever doing any of that stuff, what you know now, would you have done it? Oh, so then the learnings were just in the wrong location. Because you've also been thinking back about that earlier. You going, hell's wrong with you. Right. But she didn't know any of the stuff that you do now. Right. Got it. And as you're getting that, what do you notice happening to the feelings? Yeah. Well, then stop escorting. Hurry.
[69:37] B: I'm not doing that.
[69:38] A: That's right. Well, then stop the guy from running you. He's not doing that. Why? Because there's nothing to be done. Why? Because it no longer exists. And it's not even who I am.
[69:48] B: It's not who I am.
[69:49] A: Yeah. It's just what I did at one time, and I'm certainly not doing it now. That's right. I'm doing a lot better now. Aren't you? Yeah. Even just today. Right. Right. So think about that stuff and try to have that, you know, shame. I'm somehow not good. What's happening now?
[70:19] B: I don't feel ashamed.
[70:20] A: You don't, do you? Right. Because you wouldn't want to be feeling really good about all the positive changes you've already made on the way to making even more, would you? Start feeling that way now. Aren't you. Yeah. Really proud. Yeah. Of the things that you've already done. Grateful. That you've been able to do them proud, that you have done them on the way to doing even more. Feeling better inside. Right. Lighter and clear, seeing things clearly. Right. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. Having access to more of who you really are, which is so much more than just that stuff. Right. And how's your body feeling now?
[71:09] B: Relaxed.
[71:11] A: It is relaxed. Yeah. So other stuff. Any other things kind of going on where there's been there, any challenges that you have in dealing or being at the house with different personalities? All that estrogen.
[71:34] B: Sometimes get irritable.
[71:36] A: You do?
[71:37] B: Yeah.
[71:37] A: Okay. How do you know when to do it? Where might you be? So let's put it in a context. Where might you be when you get irritable at the house? Like, where in the house?
[71:53] B: Sit in the living room.
[71:55] A: Like you're sitting in the living room. And what might be happening that then all of a sudden you're feeling irritated. Animal.
[72:00] B: Somebody is chewing on gum like they're an animal.
[72:08] A: Right. So they're doing that. Notice what happened to your face. Oh, good. So how do you want to be when that happens?
[72:14] B: How do I want to be when someone's.
[72:16] A: Yeah.
[72:18] B: Not as bothered by it?
[72:19] A: Would you want to be bothered at all? No. Do you know why you're bothered by it? Oh, because it comes really close to you. It's about. It's really big and about this close. So what if that representation moved further away and got a little bit right. Notice how it already is a little bit less than it was and that. Weird, Right? So what you haven't been realizing is that what causes you to feel the way that you feel is never the stuff. It's always something your brain is doing to you in response to this stuff. So the silly example would be, the lion approaches the zebra. We go, the lion makes the zebra scared. Duh. But if we look at it, the different lens, we go, no, it's the zebra's brain that's making the zebra alert, motivated, strong. We call it scared. As the zebra senses, sees, feels, thinks that lion is approaching. It's doing it in response to line, but it's something that zebra's brain is doing. So there's something your brain has been doing. If that was no longer an issue for you, how would you actually be?
[73:26] B: How would it be?
[73:27] A: Yeah. Like, if that no longer caused any of that, you know, irritation, how would you actually be relaxed? And what's it like for you when you feel relaxed?
[73:35] B: Peaceful.
[73:36] A: Oh, it's peaceful. Right. And when you're peaceful and relaxed, and your body's feeling and peaceful and relaxed. Think about them and what do you notice?
[73:46] B: Doesn't it bother you?
[73:47] A: Right. Notice how it's getting less. Right. Yeah. So we think of you as being peaceful and relaxed. Right. And notice how it's also becoming a little bit quieter. Even though it's not quieter. It's becoming quieter for you. Kind of runs in the background. Right. Because what are the other things that are also going on in the house as you're sitting there, other than just that sound?
[74:10] B: A lot of people talking.
[74:11] A: Yeah. So notice all the different people that are talking, Whatever might be going on on the tv, if there is one, and people who are reading and all the different scene that's going on. And we take that and we put it in context to all of the other stuff that's happening. What do you notice?
[74:32] B: It's insignificant.
[74:33] A: Oh, it's insignificant. So you wouldn't want to be feeling. Right. What's happening now? Nothing. That's right. Nothing's happening. You're not being bothered, are you? Isn't that weird?
[74:49] B: Yeah, that's really weird. It's something I've struggled with for as long as I can remember. Certain noises which just literally make me want to rip people's heads off.
[75:01] A: Right. You didn't know that they came in too hot. They came in too loud for you. Representationally, they were experienced as being really close and big. That's why literally your head went back when you were hearing it. Right. Because it comes in too close, too loud.
[75:23] B: I don't know why that is.
[75:25] A: Well, that's just because of how your brain had been representing it. Right. Kind of like the guy when I say to him, nobody has a spider phobia when they see them as small and far away. And he goes, I have a spider phobia. Geez. Right. He didn't consciously decide to make his hands this big or put them this close to his head, but his body did. That's how he could scare himself. Because if you want to be scared of spiders, hallucinate a spider this big, put it this close to your head. Right. It'll freak you out. Yeah, got it. That's what's been going on with those sounds.
[76:05] B: But why?
[76:07] A: Well, I don't know. I mean, you can think about the discomfort. Where do you feel the discomfort in your body when you hear that sound or other sounds that are like that sound that cause that irritation? Where do you feel it in your body?
[76:20] B: Makes me hot. It makes my blood boil. Sometimes feel it in the pit of my Stomach in my chest.
[76:27] A: So you feel it in the pit of your stomach, and you feel it in your chest. And as you're feeling it in your chest and the pit of your stomach, close your eyes, and the unconscious part of you will scan back and follow that feeling back. Because that feeling, Brianna, will take you back, growing you earlier and younger towards its source and origin, which may not have anything to do with anything. You think if the unconscious will Shh. All the way back and bring that moment to your attention. Now, what comes to mind? Isn't that weird? The thing that just came to mind happened how long ago?
[77:08] B: When I was little.
[77:09] A: Yeah. And the thing that happened, you might have been wearing that happened in my house. So you're at your house daytime or nighttime?
[77:15] B: Daytime.
[77:16] A: And you're wearing the house. Right. And then what happened when my mom was there? So your mom's in the kitchen, you're standing by, like, the stove or the sink or the.
[77:24] B: Sitting at the table.
[77:26] A: Sitting at the table. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[77:29] B: My mom was chewing.
[77:30] A: Right. Mom's chewing, like, on cereal.
[77:33] B: I don't remember what it was.
[77:35] A: She was just chewing something. Yes. Right. And then what happened next?
[77:39] B: Frustrated me.
[77:40] A: Well, you were hearing it.
[77:41] B: Yeah.
[77:42] A: Right. And then what happened? Well, and then you were just kind of annoyed. Yeah. Right. And then what happened? Frustrated. Right. Well, eventually, like, she stopped and then you left. Right. And notice when you think about mom, where is she? As you're hearing that sound from her chewing, representational. Where is she? Like, as you're seeing her doing it, where is she? Is she over here? Is she here? Is she here? Is she there? Where is she? She's over here. Okay. Is she farther away now? Is it big or small? Oh, is it bothering you as much? Right. Because it's smaller and further away already. And if she moved all the way, what do you notice now? And just think about that younger you noticing that there's other things also happening in that space, all of the other objects. She might even be able to hone in on a clock tick or sounds in the background or outside or in other rooms. And even more than just Mom's face when what her mouth is doing as she's doing it, that all begins to move into the background. And what rushes in is everything else that you can see, all the other stuff all rushing from the background in the foreground. And now think about that, you know, sound. What do you notice?
[79:05] B: Doesn't bother me.
[79:06] A: Isn't that cool? Yeah. Other stuff that, like, you know, at the house, like, is Difficult to deal with?
[79:16] B: No, not difficult to deal with.
[79:21] A: Any other stuff that irritates you?
[79:25] B: Not so much.
[79:27] A: Who's your roommate?
[79:29] B: My name's Rachel.
[79:30] A: Rachel. Rachel. The Buddha. I know Rachel. I like Rachel. Rachel and I have done really useful things.
[79:41] B: She's cool.
[79:45] A: She is pretty cool. Yeah. All right. So any other stuff, like, for you, like, going on? Because think about this stuff. Think about dad leaving. Think about what the guy did in the hotel room. Think about the violence with the other guy in the hotel room and the other thing that we kind of just ran back. Think about the stuff that happened, you know, with even Mom. Think about, you know, with, you know, daughter and you and dcf. Think about all that stuff. Think about, you know, having done escorting and gotten run around. Think about all that. What do you notice? Any of it making you feel bad about you?
[80:21] B: No.
[80:21] A: Huh. Isn't that a good news thing?
[80:27] B: Yeah.
[80:27] A: Yeah, right.
[80:29] B: I didn't think that was possible.
[80:33] A: It is.
[80:35] B: I can't, even if I try.
[80:36] A: I know. And you are trying to get there and it's not happening. Right. Isn't that cool?
[80:42] B: Yes.
[80:43] A: Don't you think it's going to be a lot easier now to move forward doing the things that you want to do?
[80:46] B: Yes.
[80:47] A: Yeah. Right? Yeah. Isn't that cool? Huh? So how long have you been at Selah?
[80:56] B: Since June 17th.
[80:58] A: Since June 17th?
[81:00] B: Yeah. And I got Zoe residential July 11th. I remember because it was free Slurpee day at 7:11 and I didn't get to get one.
[81:14] A: That's all right.
[81:15] B: Such is life sometimes.
[81:16] A: Such is life. Yeah. Well, that's cool. And it's been a good thing so far.
[81:22] B: Yes.
[81:23] A: And you've liked the program. Cool.
[81:26] B: There's no place better for me to be at.
[81:28] A: Right. Are you a local? Like Sarasota?
[81:34] B: From Sarasota, yeah.
[81:35] A: Like where?
[81:35] B: I wasn't born there, but I was.
[81:37] A: Raised there in Sarasota. And you went to school in Sarasota. When you went to school, where did, like, where'd you go for elementary school?
[81:45] B: I went to Goshio. For middle school. Well, sixth grade I went to Booker Middle, and then seventh and eighth to Macintosh. And. And then I went to Polytech, and then I graduated from Sarasota High.
[81:59] A: Wow. Sarasota High. Sailors. Go Sailors. Cool. All right. Yeah. So anything else, like, you know, left for you in terms of, like, stuff that you haven't been feeling good about or things that you kind of get challenged with or stuff that covered it? Yeah. Well, now let's think about, like, mom and adopting and that. Because as you're thinking about that now, what do you notice? You know, kind of think about it both from me right now and kind of put it in context. So we want to be thinking of it. Think of, like, you know, the eagle from way up above being able to narrow in on that point, but also seeing the bigger picture. So as you think about, like, what's best for you, best for mom, best for your daughter, what do you notice?
[83:00] B: I noticed that my mom adopting her would be the best thing.
[83:05] A: Like, how is your connection with mom now?
[83:09] B: It's a work in progress.
[83:10] A: Okay, well, let's check. Are there things about mom that kind of you?
[83:16] B: Yeah.
[83:16] A: Oh, well, why don't we get those better, too? Probably a good idea. You know, if she's gonna have your daughter and you want to deal with her, it might be a good idea. Yeah. So what's something that goes on with mom that, like, causes, like, where might you be and what's something that might happen?
[83:32] B: Well, a thing that kind of has bothered me for a long time is the fact that she wasn't really ever there for me emotionally.
[83:41] A: What does that mean?
[83:42] B: Like, she always provided, don't get me wrong, like, we always had food, toys, roof over our head. But, like, as far as being there emotionally, like, needing, like, someone to talk to or, you know, just a mom, you know, she wasn't. She didn't know how to be because of the way she was raised, I think.
[84:02] A: So let's think of a time back then when you, like, really wanted to connect with her and you couldn't or didn't. You might have been how old?
[84:16] B: 14.
[84:17] A: And you might have been, like, where. What was going on? What happened?
[84:21] B: I got my first boyfriend.
[84:22] A: Your first boyfriend. Right. And then what happened?
[84:26] B: I was afraid to tell my mom.
[84:28] A: Right. Then what happened?
[84:30] B: And then she found out.
[84:31] A: Right. And then what happened?
[84:32] B: And she made me stop seeing him.
[84:34] A: Right. She said, you're not ready to date boys. Right. Then what happened next?
[84:41] B: I started sneaking out to see him.
[84:44] A: That's right. You said, screw you, Mom. I can do what I want to do. You tell me what to do. Pretty much. I'm 14.
[84:51] B: I know everything.
[84:52] A: That's right. Shit, Maybe I didn't. Damn it.
[84:55] B: No, not even close.
[84:57] A: And then what happened next?
[85:00] B: She grounded me.
[85:01] A: Yes. Right.
[85:02] B: And told me I wasn't allowed to see him.
[85:04] A: That's right. And then what happened?
[85:06] B: I freaked out.
[85:07] A: Right. And then what happened?
[85:11] B: I finally. Well, actually, I got bigger. Acted.
[85:15] A: Right. Then what happened next?
[85:18] B: She told him that I was cheating on Him.
[85:21] A: Oh, good job. Right. And then what happened?
[85:23] B: Then he believed her.
[85:28] A: Yes, of course. Because why would your mom lie?
[85:30] B: Right, Exactly.
[85:32] A: That's what I said.
[85:36] B: Then he started seeing this other girl.
[85:38] A: Right. And that made you sad. Yeah, and then that made me sad. What? Then that experience was over and you were onto something else, weren't you? Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like have your daughter and go to music festivals and church and. Music festivals in church. And having your daughter. And then, like, you know, him dating another girl and then him believing mom. And then mom telling him that. And then you being baker active and you being really upset. And then mom grounding you, telling you can't see him anymore. And then you sneaking out and seeing him. And then. Sure. Telling you that you can't see him. And then her finding out. And then you started dating this guy. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Right. And as we ran through it backwards again, what do you notice? You can remember her doing that, right? You can remember putting your jeans on. Stop putting on your jeans. Stop her from doing that. So then where is it?
[86:31] B: Doesn't exist.
[86:32] A: That's right. Second, that whole thing with mom about mom not being emotionally available and then, like, you getting connected with a guy that seem to like. Like you and not having dad around and then, like, having a guy that liked you, like, that was, like, the whole thing that was going on and she didn't get it. Not because she could, not because she didn't want to, but because that's not what she's capable of. Makes sense. And it has nothing to do with her love. Her not being more emotionally connected has nothing to do with your loveability or her love for you. It's just not in the cards for Mom. Right. Have you ever been to McDonald's?
[87:17] B: Yes.
[87:18] A: McDonald's serves, like, the same kind of food wherever you go. You know, Big Macs and. Do you ever go to India?
[87:26] B: No, but I've seen on TV that they don't serve beef because they worship cows.
[87:35] A: Do you know why they worship cows? No, it's not the cow.
[87:38] B: It's not?
[87:39] A: No. It's the poop that comes out of the cow that grows the magic mushrooms that give them a psychedelic experience. Really? Yeah. That's why they worship the cow, because the cow has access to this higher.
[87:50] B: That's cool.
[87:53] A: It's all about the psychedelics.
[87:54] B: That's cool.
[87:56] A: So. So.
[87:57] B: So for real, are you just messing with something?
[87:58] A: No, no, no. That's. That's a big oh, that's what they think is why it was so much worshiping a cow. It was the psychedelics that came out of, like, opening up consciousness to something bigger than me. Right.
[88:16] B: That's cool.
[88:17] A: Yeah. So McDonald's, though, serves the same menu. Big Mac, quarter pounder with cheese, filet o fish, French fries. Would you ever go into McDonald's asking for salmon?
[88:28] B: No.
[88:29] A: How about prime rib? Nice. Good chunk of prime rib. No sushi? No. Because that's not what McDonald's serves. McDonald's is only capable of doing what it does. Doesn't do other things. Like if we went to McDonald's and said it would be better for you to have healthier entrees for people, they go, that's not the people that are coming to eat at McDonald's. The people who are not eating at McDonald's want healthier. The people who are coming here aren't interested in kale salads. That's not why they're coming. That's not our target audience. Right. So mom's like McDonald's. She's only got certain capabilities. She can't go outside of that. You just had been thinking when you were little that her not being that way had something to do with you or your lovability or her love for you versus that she. And she's only capable of this, which is really good to have somebody who's a really good provider for your daughter and somebody else who can actually be, like, emotionally connected. Huh. Well, that's a good team. Right? So think about that now with mom. And what do you notice? It's not her fault. Or are you mad at her now about having been like, you know, not emotionally there because she did what all that was her ability. I knew it would be better if she had different abilities. I always thought when I was growing up that it would be better if my dad was different than he was. But I didn't get that dad. I got the dad that I got, and it's fine that I got that dad, but he's not the dad that I am. I get to be a very different dad than him. Him. Which might be the benefit that my girls get out of me having not gotten it. Your daughter actually gets a mom who's connected, like, emotionally to her. Huh? Huh? Right. You wouldn't want to feel really good about that too, Right? Yeah. What else about Mom? What's happening now? You're so good. Yeah, you do, right? And as you think about interacting with mom, is mom adopting your daughter? Why? Like, what's the reason behind it because.
[90:54] B: She'S afraid that I'll relapse and not be able to take care of my daughter and that. Well, she's not. Not that she thinks it's gonna happen. She just, you know, doesn't want it to and is afraid that it will. I guess I don't really know all her reasoning because I just.
[91:18] A: So is she adopting your daughter to protect her?
[91:21] B: Yeah.
[91:22] A: Oh. Cause she cares and she wants to make sure that she's okay. So maybe if you sign something, it's, you know, as I'm clean and sober, I have free access to my kid. Yeah, right. Because the thing that she's wanting is for you to be clean and sober. She's not going. Oh, well, then you can't see her ever. So if you're going to sign something, then the signing of it is as I'm clear now, and I'm clean and sober now, which is when I would be wanting to interact with her. I get free interaction. Not just like, yes, I get for a short time. It might be one time a week, given that I'm in certain things, but I want to have free access to her as I'm doing better and better and better. Yeah. Which may or may not have anything to do with her adopting, but could be a different kind of an agreement, too, that you do want your daughter to be protected, that mom gets to make certain decisions if you're incapacitated, which you won't make great decisions if you're using. That's kind of how it goes.
[92:35] B: Yeah.
[92:37] A: Yeah. Yeah. So think about mom now and think about that. What are you noticing? Better. You do feel better. Yeah. Yeah. Other stuff with mom that kind of, like, gets at you. Brianna, she do any of that stuff?
[92:56] B: Yeah.
[92:57] A: Oh. So think of her that way, right, when she's giving you one of those kind of like. Right. You know, she does that. Right. And when you think of her doing that, where is it you ever notice, like, she's kind of like, here and you're below her. Huh. I wonder if she dropped back down to earth and you saw more eye to eye with her. How would that be? Or if you kind of, like, you know, realize that you're all grown up now as an adult and you can see more eye to eye with her. So thank you for, like, you know, giving you that lecture thing. But, like, it's more. Oh, eye to eye, what do you notice? That's because you care. Well, how do you feel?
[93:34] B: Better.
[93:35] A: Oh, right. It's not bothering you, is it? Huh? It's managed Right, right. Because now we're like, you know, on the same level, on the same page. Because what you both want is what's best for your daughter. Isn't that cool? We wouldn't want to be in agreement on what's best for your daughter. That would make it a lot easier, wouldn't it? Right. Because that's what we want to keep in mind is what's best for her. Yeah. Is mom still in Sarasota?
[94:04] B: Yeah.
[94:04] A: Okay. And she's three, she's up mobile home, that kind of stuff.
[94:18] B: She's awesome.
[94:21] A: Well, she's got an awesome mom, cuz. You're awesome.
[94:25] B: Thanks.
[94:25] A: I mean, think about it, like, let's just check, given what you've gone through in life and all the different things that have happened along the way and the things that you've done and the things that you got into and the things that happened, all that stuff, to be sitting here now, feeling the way that you're feeling, realizing that you've made it through all that stuff on your way to having a life that truly works, that you're choosing for you for the first time ever. You're making it all happen. You're choosing it for you for the first time ever. It's not based on all that got slammed in. It's you're actually choosing your life for the better. How cool does that feel? It feels great, Right? Yeah. Yeah. And that's because, you know, you're way more than all that stuff, that little stuff that happened now. Yeah. There's much more to you. Right. And you wouldn't want to feel really good about that. Yeah. And grateful at the same time. Like proud. And having a lot of gratitude that I have been able to make the right decisions to improve my life. Yeah. Isn't that cool? And that you also have an interest in, you know, doing things that. Where you can make a good living and make a difference for others. Huh? Right. Because they're not exclusive things. When I went to social work school, the training that I got is, your job is to work with the poor and disenfranchised. And you went, yay. And what they forgot to tell us but was the evil behind the door. And then you'll be a little less poor than them. You won't thrive, you won't make a good living. You'll just be a little less poor. And I went, God, that's a horrible message. Because then we don't actually get our own worth, our value, that we make a difference. And I want all the people that are Therapists to be getting that because then they know how to do good change work. They get to feel like gratitude and proud, excited. Because it's really fun to like work with like really dynamic people and get stuff that's been bothering them for a long time to not bother them anymore. Right. And that's what you're noticing. You're becoming more in connection with you, by the way, it's quieter inside, isn't it? Right. And you can try to say those negative things about you. You're so not good enough. You escorted. Right. What do you notice? It's not happening. Is it. Isn't that weird? Notice how different that is? Yeah. Cool. So any other stuff for you before we wrap up for today? I don't think so. Okay. And we probably cleared that we weren't thinking that we could get all of this done because when I like described that whole thing, I was like, yeah, right, whatever, pretty much. Right. But now, what do you think?
[97:24] B: It's amazing.
[97:25] A: Yeah. Cool. Well, I'm excited, so. Last bit. Think about that soaring ego. Take a big deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Good. With eyes closed, they rest. As they rest, you rest, aware of your breath sounds. And what happens now is your unconscious begins to integrate all of what it's gotten and learned all the way through each and every cell within your body. Getting that same learning, healing, change at the deepest levels. And just like with watering a plant, the work happens when you water it. And then there's nothing you need to do to make it grow. The water seeps into the seeds. The seeds grow roots. The roots ground that plant deep inside with peace and light and ease, so that it begins to grow up towards the surface, breaking through to the other side to experience the light that is you so much more. And that light is brought in, providing energy mixed with water, providing nutrients gathered in from the soil. And everything's already there within you to deal with anything that has and anything that is and anything that might come your way. Because you're strong, powerful, centered and grounded, connected to what matters to you. Feeling good on your way to feeling even better about the things that you've already accomplished and on the way to doing more for you in your life. Lighter, feeling good inside, peaceful and free. All of that integrating now within you so that as you move through your day and into your week, you're going to be noticing things in all different ways. Maybe in the moment going, hey, that normally would. That sounded. It's not. Or maybe after that fact realizing, hey, wait a minute, that used to. And it didn't. Lighter, free. More clear, wise, connected. And then as you sleep and dream tonight, all those learnings will just get cemented in. Feeling better on the way to even better still. You can begin to find your way back. Up and up and up. Anytime you think of that eagle, it'll just the same thing that's happening now. Take that deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Good job. And what's happening now, I feel even more late. You do, don't you? Right? Connecting to more of who you are. Isn't that a good news thing? Well, awesome. I'm glad we had a chance to get together today and do some really useful things.
[100:46] B: Yeah, me too.
[100:48] A: We'll. We'll schedule a follow up appointment. I'm sure. Who? I don't know. There's a new person that does that so. With Selah. So we'll get another appointment schedule in a little bit and things are going to be way different, don't you think?
[101:02] B: Yeah.
[101:02] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool? Good job. Well, you did great today. All right, we can stop for today. I'll turn this.
