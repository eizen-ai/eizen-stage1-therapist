[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 29th of September, Brianna. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that that recording, given what we do, is useful for you. May be made available in training professionals. Want to make sure that's okay with you?
[00:15] B: Yes.
[00:15] A: Okay, cool. So first give me an update. How did our last session leave you? What have you noticed for yourself?
[00:23] B: I noticed it. It was very helpful, that's for sure. Well, when I. When I actually. I don't think about the things that we talked about, like, you know what I mean? How do I explain this? It worked.
[00:42] A: Basically, the things that we talked about don't bother you anymore?
[00:46] B: No.
[00:46] A: So even if you do think about them, they don't have any yuckiness.
[00:49] B: Yeah.
[00:49] A: Isn't that cool?
[00:50] B: Yeah.
[00:51] A: Yeah.
[00:52] B: Nice.
[00:52] A: Yeah, I bet. Yeah. Cool. Well, that's a good news thing. I'm glad. What do you want our time today to do for you?
[01:03] B: I don't know. Let's just play it right here, I guess. I don't know, I just. Probably gonna emotionally vomit on you.
[01:11] A: Oh, don't vomit on me emotionally.
[01:15] B: That is a nice shirt.
[01:18] A: Or you could just like say what's going on and not be vomit at all.
[01:23] B: That's a good idea.
[01:25] A: Yeah. So I get that you get irritated by people's. That's full of bull bullshit. Okay, so that's something. But what would be useful for me to know, to understand?
[01:37] B: Well, there's a few girls in the house that I feel like, have a sense of entitlement. Like they're princesses. Well, they think they are. In other words, like, if shit doesn't go their way, they're a total bitch about it. And it's really annoying because they could be out in the streets and doing God knows what and not even have a place to live. But they're just pissed because they got picked up late from school and had to wait 20 extra minutes. Big freaking deal. It just really pisses me off. Like, I don't know, maybe it's because I've been through a lot and, like, I'm very grateful. Maybe it's. I'm just more mature than these people. I don't know what it is, but it really, really gets under my skin. And like, I want to say something, but then again, I don't know if it's just me. Like, I don't know. I don't know, but it really pisses me off.
[02:44] A: Okay. Is it just about school?
[02:47] B: No, it's about everything. Everything.
[02:50] A: Cause nothing goes their way.
[02:51] B: Nothing I mean. Well, I mean, I don't know about that, but just. I mean, the girl was getting her hair done for free the other day, and she just had a pissy attitude the whole time, like, bitch, you're getting your hair done for free. Shut up. God.
[03:14] A: So here's the weird question. Ready for it?
[03:17] B: Yeah.
[03:17] A: What about them being pissy? Bitchy? What about that's been irritating.
[03:26] B: All of it for you.
[03:28] A: What about it, though, is irritating?
[03:29] B: I feel like they should be more grateful and just deal with it.
[03:37] A: You wouldn't want to be feeling grateful that you're not them.
[03:41] B: I would. Wait, say that again.
[03:43] A: You wouldn't want to be feeling grateful that you're not them.
[03:47] B: Oh, no, I do. I do feel grateful that I'm not them. That I don't. I'm not miserable. I mean. You know what I mean? I just. I am happy that I'm not like that. And I was talking to one of the other girls today, the new girl, Donna, that.
[04:01] A: You have a girl named Madonna?
[04:03] B: No. Donna.
[04:04] A: Is she, like the.
[04:06] B: The singer?
[04:06] A: Yeah.
[04:07] B: No. No, not really.
[04:08] A: But that would be really cool.
[04:09] B: I was just looking at the magazine that had Madonna on the COVID No, she's really sweet. What was the question? I forget.
[04:20] A: You were talking to her.
[04:21] B: Yeah, yeah, sorry. Yeah. We were saying that, like, let's make a pact or whatever, that when we're in, like, the higher phases of the program, if we're ever acting like that with, like, a stank attitude, just to, like, redirect each other in a nice way, and I think that's awesome. Cause that's a good idea. I don't want to ever act. I don't see myself ever acting like that. But it was cool.
[04:50] A: Okay, so you got somebody that's on the same page with you.
[04:53] B: Yes, yes.
[04:54] A: What if you weren't annoyed or irritated?
[04:57] B: What if I wasn't?
[04:57] A: Yeah, by their attitudes.
[05:00] B: That would be nice.
[05:01] A: Oh, it would, wouldn't it?
[05:02] B: Yeah.
[05:03] A: Because you don't want them to have that much control over you.
[05:06] B: Right? That's true.
[05:07] A: Because they get under your skin.
[05:10] B: Yes.
[05:11] A: Right. And if they weren't being. And, you know, getting under your skin.
[05:14] B: How would you be relaxed and at peace.
[05:19] A: Right. And what's it like when you're relaxing? That peace it is. Right. And you wouldn't want to be feeling that way as they're, like, going, whenever.
[05:29] B: You got me in time. I would.
[05:32] A: Oh, you would?
[05:33] B: Yes, I would like that.
[05:35] A: Okay, so what is it about what they're doing that then, like, causes that irritation? Like, how do you know when to get annoyed? Frustrated, Angry at them?
[05:49] B: Sometimes it's just a look on their faces. Just like that. Just like. Like I said, stank look. And just like, that's one of them.
[06:00] A: Okay.
[06:01] B: Sometimes it's when they walk into the room, just like, oh, God, here we go.
[06:09] A: Okay, so if that wasn't happening for.
[06:13] B: You, it would be easier.
[06:16] A: I think it would be easier. So when you see their face that way and they walk in the room, where is it? Like as you're thinking about seeing their face right now, you know, kind of. Where is it around you?
[06:32] B: Off to the side?
[06:33] A: Is it off to the side? Is it far or is it close?
[06:38] B: Not far, but not close.
[06:39] A: Okay. Is it life size or bigger or smaller than life?
[06:44] B: Smaller than life.
[06:45] A: Oh, it is, yeah. So why does it bother you at all?
[06:49] B: Good question.
[06:50] A: Huh. What else is also going on other than their face looking that way?
[06:59] B: They're bitching.
[07:01] A: So you hear their voice?
[07:04] B: Yes.
[07:05] A: Where is that coming from? What side do you hear it on? Oh, for you.
[07:10] B: Right side.
[07:11] A: Okay. What does that mean?
[07:14] B: What does that mean?
[07:15] A: I don't know yet.
[07:16] B: Okay.
[07:19] A: I'm not sure, but I'm gonna find out.
[07:21] B: Okay.
[07:22] A: Actually, I'm not really concerned about what it means. I'm just trying to figure out how it's programmed. That's why I'm asking the questions. Because if we can change the programming, then they're not going to be able to affect you. Right. In life, we can't get rid of people that press our buttons. In particular, if we're in a program and we're surrounded by people that press our buttons, we can't like, X them out, but we want to do things that unplug the buttons. Okay. So it's over on that side. Okay. And when you're hearing it and you're seeing their face, then how do you know when to start feeling agitated?
[08:03] B: How do I know?
[08:04] A: Yeah. So you walk. They walk in, you see that face, they start saying whatever it is that they're saying in that way that they're saying it. Right. And then how do you know when to start feeling?
[08:17] B: That's when I start feeling that way.
[08:18] A: Oh, right. And where do you. You're just getting a little bit of it now, Aren't you frustrated?
[08:24] B: Yeah, yeah, I know.
[08:27] A: I just watched. It happened. It was so good. Right. So where do you. No, that's really good.
[08:36] B: Okay.
[08:37] A: Do you know why it's really good?
[08:38] B: No.
[08:38] A: Because then the problem isn't with them.
[08:43] B: It'S with people in general.
[08:44] A: No, Myself No, I know. This is the weird part. It's with how your brain has that coded. Because you were able to do it without it actually happening. Right. Just by thinking about it, you were able to cause a little bit of it. Right. Isn't that cool?
[09:04] B: Yeah. Frustrating?
[09:06] A: No, but really cool because that means all of it's here. If it was solely external, then we couldn't do anything about it. But given that you were able to do it without it even happening, we know that it's something that your brain is doing to you. Remember that silly example of lion and zebra and we go, lion makes zebra scared. No, it's actually a zebra's brain. Yes. It's doing it in response to lion approaching, but it's zebra's brain. So it's your brain that's been doing it to you, making you feel bad, irritated. Do you think it really wants you? You feel irritated?
[09:39] B: I hope not.
[09:40] A: It doesn't give a rat's ass how you feel.
[09:42] B: To put it lightly.
[09:44] A: To put it lightly. It doesn't care. It doesn't cause it for that reason. It causes it to get you to do something. Sometimes the thing that it's trying to get you to do, there's nothing to do about it. Right. I mean, some of what's going on with them, there's nothing for you to do about it. Mean you could say something and then they would be even more bitchy.
[10:06] B: Yeah, Right.
[10:08] A: Cuz like when somebody's like agitated at something and you tell them, hey, you shouldn't be agitated at the thing that you're agitated by, you know what, they start getting agitated with you. Right? Right. Somebody's angry at something and you don't think they should be angry about it and you tell them you shouldn't be angry about it, their anger stops being about that and starts being at you.
[10:30] B: Just angry at life.
[10:32] A: Well, not life. They were angry at that thing that you didn't think they should be and you told them you shouldn't be angry at that. No big deal. Oh really? Now I'm pissed at you. Makes sense. That's how it goes. So as you start feeling it, where do you feel it? In your body?
[10:49] B: It makes me hot. It makes my stomach like turn kind of anxiety. Really?
[10:55] A: So it makes you hot.
[10:56] B: Mm.
[10:57] A: And your stomach starts to do what? Oh, it turns?
[11:02] B: Yeah, pretty much.
[11:03] A: Do you know which way it's turning? Did you think about it? Like, is it this way or is it this way? Or is it this way?
[11:09] B: Clockwise.
[11:10] A: It's clockwise. Huh. Isn't that weird?
[11:12] B: Yeah, that's weird. It's trippy.
[11:14] A: It's trippy because you've never paid attention to that before. No, I know, right? And I wonder what would happen if your were to go counterclockwise with it, if you would have the same feelings. Isn't that weird? Because with all sorts of problems that we have, if we intervene with one part, it has to change all of the rest. They're all pieces that hold it together. If we pull one piece out, the structure is not going to be the same. We take another part out, we're going to be able to change how it all works for you. Yeah. So if it started going, you know, counterclockwise and you were to actually feel, like, really cool realizing, I'm really glad I'm not that. Yeah, right. Like having the actual gratitude that you do that you're in this program and that you're making these positive changes and that you're having your life improve to the point that you can recognize, hey, you know what? If I ever get to that thing, hey, I want you to, like, go, hey, don't. You know, you're kind of being so. I don't. Because I don't ever want to be that. Huh? Isn't that cool? Right? Which they might be at different levels than you because they've been there longer, but you actually might be at a different level than them. Yeah, right. And you wouldn't want to feel really grateful about that. See, you could actually start feeling really good every single time that they're bitchy, realizing, I'm so glad that's not me. I mean, imagine that being you. That the littlest thing that's miserable.
[12:55] B: Why would anyone want to.
[12:56] A: Well, I don't know whether they want to be that way. I'm not thinking they're choosing. I'm not thinking they're deciding. Hey, you know what? If they're late today by five minutes, I'm gonna be so fucking bitchy, pissed. I don't think it's a decision that they're doing. I'm thinking they're getting triggered into it.
[13:13] B: Could be.
[13:14] A: I don't think they decided. I didn't get to decide. The shape of my nose, the one I got. It happened to me. Right. Some of that stuff, they're not choosing. They're at the effect of it, which is what you've been at the effect of them being bitchy, which is what we're interested in shifting. So that. That's not happening for you. Right. So we know that you're kind of Seeing it over here, then you're hearing it there. And then all of a sudden you start getting. Huh? And your stomach starts. Right. Anything else with it.
[13:56] B: Want to yell? Sometimes you do want to, but I don't.
[14:03] A: Just like. I think that would be really, really funny.
[14:07] B: I think it would be too. Maybe I should.
[14:09] A: If they come in and they're all like that and you just go.
[14:16] B: I think I should too.
[14:18] A: Krien, why are you yelling? I just felt like it.
[14:21] B: All right. Just act like nothing happened.
[14:23] A: What do you mean?
[14:24] B: That wasn't me.
[14:26] A: I don't know what you're talking about.
[14:28] B: I'm gonna do that, see what happens.
[14:31] A: Right. Just as a science experiment. Because we can really do like science experiments to see what reactions we get. And people don't realize that they're in a crappy state. And sometimes it takes something to break them out of that state so that they can lighten up. See, I wonder what it would be like for you if that was lightened up. Up that you were to experience and see more than just their face looking that way and hearing that voice. Because isn't there a lot more going on in the room, in the space that you're in, than just that? Right. Huh? Isn't that interesting? So we know they come in, you see that face, you hear them saying that you start feeling hot and your stomach starts moving. Yeah. And then what happens next? Then sometimes you feel like yelling, but you don't.
[15:28] B: Right.
[15:29] A: Okay. Is there a particular thing about their face? Like if you're narrow in on their face, is there a particular part of their face that really. Is it something that they do with their lips or something that they do with their eyes or both posture that.
[15:45] B: They take or eyes and mouth.
[15:48] A: Eyes and mouth. Okay. And what is it that they do with their mouth?
[15:51] B: Kind of like a frown, but I don't know. Just not. Not to that extreme, but kind of.
[16:01] A: Maybe they just have resting face. Yes.
[16:04] B: No. Maybe. No.
[16:06] A: They might just have resting bitch face.
[16:08] B: Cuz it's not always like that.
[16:10] A: Rbf. You could just say it. Rbf. Do you have rbf? What's that? You'll know if you have it. I think you have it. Because that might lighten things up. Because nobody wants to have that.
[16:28] B: No. Yeah, that's more like kids.
[16:34] A: And you wouldn't want to like. Actually that's right. Lightening up. Right. So we want to do a couple different things. One has to do with shifting foreground background because that's the thing that's kind of in focus. Right. You're seeing their face and their mouth looking like that and their eyes doing the thing that it does and you're hearing that that's what's in the foreground. But if you notice in a place that you might be. So where might this happen? You might be at the house.
[16:58] B: Yes.
[16:58] A: Where might you be at the house.
[16:59] B: That it's happening in? The living room. Well, I call it the living room, but it's called education room.
[17:06] A: Oh.
[17:07] B: Where the TV is and the couch and stuff.
[17:09] A: That's educational.
[17:12] B: That's true. Well, there's computers.
[17:13] A: That's why they watch that. That's where the TV is. Right. Because we only watch PBS educational programming.
[17:21] B: Not even that. We only have Netflix, which is pretty good.
[17:24] A: We only have. Oh, wow. I am so sad that you only have Netflix, which has all sorts of things.
[17:30] B: No, I love it.
[17:31] A: I'm gonna recommend that you guys all watch a really cool video I actually.
[17:35] B: Did the other day. I watched really awesome documentary and made me cry a couple times. It's called living on $1.
[17:44] A: Living on $1.
[17:45] B: Yeah, it's awesome.
[17:47] A: It doesn't seem like doable.
[17:48] B: No. But these like, it's like these group of like college students, they go to Guatemala and this like poverty stricken community.
[18:03] A: And they just start throwing raining.
[18:05] B: No.
[18:06] A: Dollar bills. No, not like that.
[18:08] B: Not quite. They, they see what it's like because some of the people there live on a dollar a day if that. If they're lucky. And it's cool the way they did it. They like put a bunch of different dollar amounts in this like hat and hung it on the wall. And each day they. The amounts were like $0 to like $10 or something. And sometimes it. Some days they would get zero dollars and they'd be screwed. Sometimes they would get 10. It was really cool. It was really. I feel like a lot of the girls at the house should watch that. It's really awesome.
[18:44] A: Because then they might have more gratitude for what they do.
[18:46] B: Yeah.
[18:47] A: Huh. There's a really good one called I am not your guru.
[18:53] B: Is that on Netflix?
[18:56] A: Tony Robbins. You know who Tony Robbins is? Have you ever heard of him?
[18:59] B: The guy that's on Shallow Hal?
[19:01] A: Yeah, he's actually in that. Yes, but he's a personal growth and development and training and all that stuff. They actually did a documentary on his six day Date with Destiny program which his Date with Destiny program is about designing your life and it's pretty moving and empowering and transformative.
[19:24] B: I'm not your guru.
[19:25] A: I am not your guru.
[19:26] B: I'll have to watch it today.
[19:27] A: Tony Robbins. Yeah. It's pretty cool.
[19:30] B: I like stuff like that.
[19:31] A: Yeah, I think you would enjoy it. Yeah. So we want to do a thing that's all about having you experience more than just that. Because that's the thing that's in the foreground. And see, what we know is that when we move something from the foreground into the background and include more, it can't be such a big deal. Right. So that being a problem, which kind of feels big because you're surrounded by these people that sometimes you're like, right. Like you got that kind of thing right. And you're like, I'm really glad I'm not a princess. My daughter, I think she wants to be a princess for Halloween.
[20:04] B: Oh, that's so cute.
[20:07] A: No, because then she's gonna be all bitchy and like, look that way and be like, man, something go my way.
[20:12] B: Notice how I said princess? That's not how princesses act.
[20:16] A: Oh, they don't? No. Okay.
[20:20] B: Not how I should act anyways. I feel like.
[20:25] A: Do you know why Cinderella was called Cinderella?
[20:28] B: No, I don't.
[20:29] A: Her name was actually Ella.
[20:32] B: Oh.
[20:34] A: But she had to go clean the chimneys and she would get filled with the cinders from the smoke stacks of cleaning it. So she got the name Cinderella.
[20:49] B: That's cool.
[20:52] A: Isn't that interesting?
[20:53] B: Yes.
[20:54] A: I learned that because I read it to my daughter the other day.
[20:58] B: Uh huh.
[21:00] A: I didn't know. Did you know that that's how she got her name? He did. See, he's smart enough. I'm a geek. What's that.
[21:08] B: Stuff?
[21:08] A: Like that. So what we want to do is we want to do a thing that's all about getting more into the foreground background stuff. So if we notice the face, we notice what the eyes are doing and the mouth are doing. We hear that tone and like that's what's in the foreground. So that's like right there. Right. And then there's everything else in the education room that's in the background. So there's like the TVs, the couches, the, the books, the other stuff that's in that room that's all in the background. Got it. So what we're gonna do is you're gonna think about that face, that look, that kind of tone that comes in.
[21:42] B: Right.
[21:42] A: That's in the foreground. Right. And then that begins to fade into the background and what rushes in the foreground and everything else in that room, the educational room. So we've got the couches, the chairs, we got the Computers, we got all of that rushing in. That's right. And what do you notice happening inside?
[21:58] B: Feel tingly.
[21:59] A: Oh, you feel tingly?
[22:01] B: Yes.
[22:02] A: You do?
[22:03] B: Yeah.
[22:04] A: And you're not getting so hot. Right. Isn't that interesting? Right. Because it's already beginning to cool down for you inside. Right. Because you want to be cool. Right. You ever notice the deodorant commercials? They say never let them see you sweat.
[22:18] B: No, I don't really watch tv, but ever. I mean, I don't really pay attention to commercials. Yeah, but there's no commercials on there.
[22:27] A: Watch tv.
[22:28] B: Netflix is different.
[22:29] A: You're watching TV all the time. So now we got that, like, right, educational room. But then we're gonna think of the whole house that's in the background. So not just what's in the educational room, but then, like, what's in the kitchen and the other rooms and all the other bedrooms and even the pool outside. That's all in the background. Right. So now we've got, like, their face, Right? Got them. You notice that vice now their eyes are looking in their mouth kind of thing, Right? They got that look on their face, right? That's in the foreground. You hear that tone coming, right? You got that there. And that's in the foreground. That begins to fade and Mac and wall rushes in the foreground as everything else in the education room and everything else on the house, all the kitchen, all rushes in the foreground. You see? Even that much more. That's right. What do you notice happening inside?
[23:14] B: I feel chill.
[23:15] A: You do feel chill. Alright. And you wouldn't want to feel chill.
[23:19] B: I do.
[23:19] A: You do, don't you? Especially when they're feeling bitchy. Yes, that's right. So you can actually be chill. Yeah. So I'm wondering what it would be like for you to be chill or for, you know, you to be chill. But to the extent, or better yet, let's say it in this way, I'm wondering what it would be like for them to be bitchy to the extent that you're feeling chill.
[23:45] B: Would be nice.
[23:46] A: It would be nice. So now we're not just going to be thinking about their face, right? What it looks like in their mouth and their eyes kind of thing that they got going on. Right. And we got that voice coming in, right? Then we've got the rest of the house, we've got the rest of the property. And then we're going to think of all of Bradenton, All Rushington. Right. So we've got, like that face. You can see it, right? Got that, like, sound coming in kind of thing. Right. That's all in the foreground. That begins to fade in the background. Then what rushes in the foreground is the entirety of the house. Everything in the education room, the whole property. And then all of Bradenton rushing in the foreground. You see? That's right. And your body feels lighter. It does, right? Because things are beginning to lighten up. Then if we could, like, put it into the context of the entirety of the United States and then all of the world. How significant is their face and that? It's got, like, nothing.
[24:49] B: Yeah.
[24:50] A: Something. Right? And you see them that way, and they've got that kind of thing, and they're like. Right. And you can notice all of that. Right. Begins to rush in the foreground as the rest of the house, all of Bradenton, all the Florida, the entirety of the United States and the rest of the world rushes in the foreground. That's right. And what's happening now Feel better? You do, don't you? Right. And what if that starts to, Instead of going clockwise, starts going the other way?
[25:23] B: Would it be different?
[25:24] A: It would be different. And how much more chill can you be when that stuff doesn't matter to you?
[25:31] B: A lot more.
[25:32] A: Yeah. Right. And you want to be more chill, don't you? Right. Because you actually realized, hey, you know what? If I'm that way? Like, clue me in, because I don't want to be that way.
[25:44] B: Definitely not.
[25:45] A: Right. Isn't that cool? Which must mean that you're, like, you know, at a higher level, realizing that you don't actually want to ever occur like that. Huh? Isn't that interesting? So who is this Donna? You don't call her Ma Donna. I would have to do that. I see her movie. Hey, Ma Donna.
[26:11] B: No, Donna. She. She's really sweet. She's my new roommate.
[26:15] A: Okay.
[26:16] B: Me and Rachel are with her now.
[26:18] A: Awesome. How is Rachel? Tell Rachel I said hi.
[26:21] B: I will.
[26:22] A: Okay.
[26:22] B: She's good. She's. She started working at Goodwill down the street.
[26:27] A: Like, across the street or the one like. Like here?
[26:32] B: I don't. Well, would it be that way?
[26:36] A: I think it's across the street. The big Goodwill. That's, like, in a shopping center?
[26:39] B: Yeah, yeah, that one.
[26:43] A: Yeah. That's across the street.
[26:45] B: Is it that way or that way?
[26:46] A: Well, like, if we're sitting here, it's gonna be over there.
[26:48] B: Oh, wow.
[26:49] A: Well, I would know because I'm the one that sits here all the time.
[26:52] B: That's true. Yeah. She's. She's good.
[26:57] A: Cool.
[26:57] B: But I think That's. I'm just gonna start from the beginning, because she. She. She's awesome. She. But she didn't learn how to even read until she was in her 20s. She's like 30 something now. But when we went to North Carolina for the hurricane, we came back too early, and there was no power at the house.
[27:25] A: That was fun.
[27:26] B: Oh, God, it was horrible. It was a shit show, but it is what it is. At least I had a place over my head, you know? But. So she was. She hadn't come over into residential yet, but the assessment girls were there with us because they didn't have power at their house either, and we had a generator, so at least she had a generator. Yes, that was nice. But. So they had the assessment girls write up a grocery list, and Donna was the one who wrote it. And because she didn't learn how to read and spell until later on in life, a lot of the words were misspelled. And I was sitting at the kitchen table. I can't remember what I was doing, but I was sitting there. And Deanna comes up and picks up the list and starts laughing. And then she calls Savannah over to her and was pointing out all the misspelled words, like this one. This one with a smirk on her face. And I said, hold up. Wait. You don't need to be doing that. That's not okay. You do know she didn't learn how to read until she was in her 20s, right? And she's like, I wasn't making fun of her. Before you make a judgment, make sure you know what you're talking about. Da, da, da. Whatever. She just walked away, and I just dropped it. But it really bothered me, you know, because that's not cool. And. And I think that's why they put Donna in my room, because I kind of, like, advocated for her. But, yeah, she's really sweet. She's. She's really funny, and she's awesome. She's cool.
[29:11] A: Yeah, well, so are you.
[29:13] B: Well, thanks.
[29:14] A: Well, I mean, come on. I mean, think about it. You got that what they were doing wasn't okay.
[29:19] B: Yeah.
[29:20] A: And you call them out on it.
[29:21] B: Mm.
[29:21] A: Right.
[29:23] B: Definitely. Because if I was acting that way, I would want someone to call me out on it. I mean, I wouldn't act that way. But that's not right. You shouldn't do that.
[29:32] A: Right. And aren't we really glad that that's not you?
[29:35] B: Yeah.
[29:36] A: That. That isn't the thing that occurs to do.
[29:38] B: Yeah.
[29:39] A: Yeah. How cool is that?
[29:43] B: Wait, that isn't.
[29:45] A: That doesn't. Occur for you to do that. Like it wouldn't show up to be looking at the list, seeing the misspelled words and pointing them out to somebody.
[29:53] B: Yeah.
[29:54] A: Hell no.
[29:54] B: I would never do that.
[29:56] A: Right. Oh. Huh.
[29:58] B: It's not cool, Right? No matter who it is. Even if they, even if they didn't did learn to read when they were five or whatever. However old you are, when you learn to read, it doesn't matter. It's not something to make fun of someone about.
[30:10] A: Yeah. So you can stand up for others and you. Right. Well, that's cool. So think about, you know, like somebody coming in, you know, they're like a princess and how much more chill you feel now.
[30:29] B: Doesn't bother me.
[30:30] A: I know.
[30:33] B: I love it.
[30:36] A: Isn't that cool?
[30:37] B: Yeah.
[30:38] A: Right? Yeah.
[30:39] B: That's nice.
[30:40] A: Right. Because then you get to be in the state that you want to be in, which is, you know, having gratitude. Because here's the deal. When we're truly in gratitude and you'll actually hear this in some of what, you know, Tony Robbins talks about, but you know, when you're truly in gratitude, gratitude is the antidote for anger, agitation, upset, resentment, guilts, shames.
[31:03] B: I believe that.
[31:04] A: Yeah. Right. And you are so. Even when it was a shit show going on, you had no power. You're like, well, at least you have roof, right?
[31:13] B: Yeah.
[31:14] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So any other stuff going on for you?
[31:22] B: Well, I, I think like the last time I was here, I was about to go to court, Right. For mediation for my daughter.
[31:33] A: Wow. I don't know.
[31:35] B: I don't remember. I don't remember. But I ended up signing the adoption papers.
[31:42] A: That was the question, Right. We had to get to you being okay with like, it was mom.
[31:50] B: Yeah. So I signed the papers and it was really a hard decision, but there was no way my mom was going to come up off adoption. Like, she was not having it. So even though, even though I like, asked her if we could do, like, if she could just do long term guardianship, she was like, no, no, no. And that means I would have had to take it to trial and I would have lost and then I would. My rights would have been taken and then I would be screwed. So it's an open adoption and I get to see her. Well, at first it's every other week for eight weeks or something like that. And then I could see her every week after that, which is good. Not a lot of people get that much in an open adoption, so. So that's good. I feel a lot better about it, you know, I didn't want to do it at first, but it's the right thing to do.
[32:57] A: And your mom wanted to have it be an adoption because she wanted to make sure your daughter's okay. Right. Because we can go. You're making lots of positive changes. And we can also go, well, there was that history of other shit.
[33:13] B: Right.
[33:14] A: And I want to make sure that this little one's okay.
[33:17] B: Yeah, yeah.
[33:19] A: And I'm happy to have you be interacting with her.
[33:23] B: Yeah. It's not like I thought it was.
[33:25] A: I thought as you're making positive changes and you're okay.
[33:28] B: Yeah, exactly.
[33:30] A: Right. That's so clear.
[33:31] B: I thought that she maybe wanted to keep her from me, but she doesn't want to do that. She wants me to be in her life, you know, and that's awesome. And it also keeps me accountable, you know, because even though I've been clean and in the program, making good choices or whatever, I was doing drugs for 10 plus years and that, you know.
[33:54] A: And you're not now?
[33:56] B: No. Whether or not it's awesome, whether or not, like I'm 30 years clean or 44 months clean, I'm still right on the edge just as anybody else. So I get that. Even though, like, I can say I don't wanna do drugs, don't wanna get high, don't wanna relapse, blah, blah, blah, but you know, shit happens.
[34:16] A: Well, you may wanna just say, I wanna be clean and sober instead of what you don't want. I wanna be clean, clear, sober and connected to my daughter. Cause she matters to me. And that's way more empowering. Check it out. I don't want to relapse, I don't want to use versus I want to be clean, clear and connected. Yeah, right, right. Because that's really more about what you want versus talking about what you don't want. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good job. Yeah. So this whole being in Selah, with all the ups and downs that go along with it, has been really, really useful and really good for you. Right. And you are making positive choices. So, like, what's the next steps for.
[35:16] B: You in Selo or just period?
[35:18] A: Well, overall.
[35:20] B: Well, hopefully in October I can start victim advocacy certification.
[35:26] A: Right.
[35:28] B: Because that's when the next course starts or whatever. Okay, so that'll be nice. I should be phasing up soon. I put. I did the questionnaire or whatever so that it should be like a week or so before I phase up.
[35:42] A: Yeah, yeah. Well, that's cool. So you are like making really good progress.
[35:52] B: Yeah. Also. Well, I kind of had a setback. I went on Friday, the one that just passed. I had to go to the hospital because I was having extreme stomach pain. I mean, I. I was almost. I have a high pain tolerance because I dealt with a lot of pain physically. And I was borderline in tears because my stomach hurts so bad. And earlier that day, I went to get my. My levels checked because I'm on blood thinners and my. The level was way too high because the normal level is like a two, and I was a six, which means my blood was way too thin.
[36:40] A: Oh, wow.
[36:41] B: So naturally, you know, me being overly cautious, I'm like. Or scared or maybe hypochondriac, I don't know. But I was like, oh, my God, what if my stomach's, like, bleeding or some crazy shit like that? So I made the decision to go to the hospital. I didn't want to at first because I was supposed to see my kid the next day, and I really need to see her because I was supposed to see her the Saturday before that. But that was. Or whenever it was. That was when we went, yeah, hurricane. So it's just the past couple of times it's hasn't happened, and that sucks, but whatever. Anyway, so I went to the hospital and they did an ultrasound and they found a cyst on my ovary that was hemorrhaging.
[37:33] A: Oh, wow.
[37:34] B: Yeah.
[37:34] A: So good that you went to the hospital.
[37:36] B: Yeah, yeah, really good. But anyways, so while I was there, they were giving me narcotics, and I didn't stop them like, I should have. I should have said, no, I don't want them because I'm an addict. But I kind of just said, fuck it, and took them. And I didn't say anything until last night. It was really eating me up inside, you know, Like, I didn't. I don't know, I was. I was mad at myself and I didn't want to get in trouble. Like, I've been working so hard to phase up and whatever. Whatever. So we had a zoom meeting because obviously I failed the drug test when I got back from the hospital. But I told them, well, at first, like, when they. Before they tested me, the day that I got. Day after I got back, I was like, they gave me narcotics one day and I told them that I didn't want them, blah, blah. I was just bullshitting because I was scared. I didn't want to get in trouble, even though I should have known better because you don't get in trouble and say it like that. So anyways, so last night, they did. We did a zoom meeting with Jesse and two of the coaches and my case manager. And they asked me what was up because obviously I failed the drug test. And I was like, well, here goes it. The best thing to do is just come right out with it. And I told them, and I felt a lot better. And they're really proud of me, like, because they said it showed growth just then. Because, I mean, I wasn't gonna tell him at first. I didn't want to, but it was. I don't know.
[39:23] A: But it was eating you up inside.
[39:25] B: It was.
[39:26] A: Right.
[39:26] B: And.
[39:27] A: Because that's not how you want to be.
[39:29] B: No.
[39:29] A: How cool is that? Like, really.
[39:33] B: Yeah.
[39:34] A: Right. That's already huge change, right?
[39:39] B: Yeah.
[39:39] A: Because you recognized in doing it that it wasn't how you want to be in life, and that's what was causing it to be eating you up instead.
[39:47] B: Yeah. I mean, like. I mean, I couldn't even sleep at night, it was so bad.
[39:50] A: Right. Right. Good job.
[39:57] B: One of the, like, the. The resident, Kim, that is in ilp, we were talking. Me and Donna and her were talking. We weren't talking about me or any. I can't remember what we were talking about, but Kim said something like, secrets can keep you sick. And that. That was, like, a few days before I had came out with it. So that helped a lot, too. Cause it was true. It was literally making me sick.
[40:24] A: Yeah.
[40:26] B: Physically and mentally.
[40:28] A: Yeah. Good job.
[40:30] B: Thanks.
[40:31] A: That's awesome. Right?
[40:34] B: Yeah.
[40:35] A: Yeah. So you're making all sorts of really, you know, huge changes, and sometimes it's in going through stuff that's hard.
[40:46] B: Yeah.
[40:47] A: Right. That's confronting. Then we have even bigger growth. Yeah. That's really good. I'm really proud of you, too.
[40:58] B: Thanks.
[40:58] A: Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah.
[41:02] B: Yeah. It was just. It. I couldn't. I mean, even the coaches noticed, like, a difference since I got home because I just, like, kind of went into a shell in a way and kind of was, like, just over it. Really.
[41:18] A: Kind of removing yourself. Yeah. Because you were feeling bad.
[41:21] B: Yeah.
[41:22] A: Yeah. And now that's not in the way.
[41:26] B: Yeah.
[41:27] A: Right. And notice how you didn't have to vomit here.
[41:30] B: Yeah.
[41:31] A: Yeah. That was better. I don't really like vomit because I might then have to throw up.
[41:36] B: I didn't mean literally vomit.
[41:37] A: You know how it's, like, contagious.
[41:39] B: Is it?
[41:40] A: Well, somebody throws up, and then you're like, you know, somebody else does.
[41:44] B: You never heard that, though, emotionally vomit?
[41:47] A: No, never.
[41:48] B: Oh, now you have.
[41:49] A: Of course I've heard.
[41:50] B: Oh, okay.
[41:51] A: Right. But see, when somebody emotionally vomits, they don't think it's actually vomiting, but it is. Because sometimes if I vomit on something and I get it out, I feel better. But they're left with it.
[42:09] B: Yeah.
[42:12] A: Now they don't. Nobody wants to get vomited on. Oh. They're stuck with this nastiness, even if it's just verbal.
[42:19] B: Yeah.
[42:20] A: Yeah. Right. Well, good for you. Thanks. I'm excited about all of the positive changes. I think that as you made that decision, realizing that mom wants you to be connected to your daughter, she just also wants to make sure your daughter's okay.
[42:36] B: Yeah. Which means a lot to me.
[42:38] A: Yeah. Doesn't it? Right. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. And with clearing out the stuff that we did the last time, those things that used to be triggers don't trigger you. Right. So it makes it a lot easier for you to direct your path of being clean and sober and connected. Right. And we already know that you're somebody that's really interested in making a difference for others, which is why you want the whole victim advocacy. That and you take a stand for things that you no. Aren't. Right.
[43:18] B: Yeah.
[43:19] A: Right. Which is also why it was eating you up inside, because that's not being true to you. Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[43:30] B: Yeah.
[43:31] A: Good job.
[43:33] B: Thanks.
[43:33] A: Yeah. You're doing great. Yeah. So any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know or any other things going on?
[43:44] B: Yeah, one more thing I wanted to talk about. You know how I told you about my ex, Clay, that used to be the shit out of me? Well, I don't think about, like. Like, I don't get the feelings and stuff and whatever, all that crap, but, like, I just can't seem to get him out of my head. It's like he infected my mind.
[44:07] A: How so?
[44:08] B: Like, I just can't stop thinking about him. I think about him all the time. I even dream about him. Just. I don't. I don't know if it's because there's no closure or what I don't understand because he's put me through.
[44:20] A: What is it that you're thinking about when you think about him?
[44:23] B: Everything. Just, like. I mean, not. Not necessarily like, all bad, you know, sometimes there was good times and, you know, sometimes I think about, like. You know, how I wonder how he's doing and I just wish I didn't care. Really. I don't. I don't know. I just. I really wish I could explain better, like, why or what, but I don't know.
[44:48] A: It's better to go think about. How do you know when to start thinking about him?
[44:55] B: I don't know. I don't know. Just. Just comes.
[45:01] A: So it just comes?
[45:02] B: Yeah.
[45:03] A: Okay. And if that wasn't happening, meaning it wasn't just coming, how would you actually be better? He'd be better. Okay. Well, is it okay to be concerned about his well being?
[45:16] B: Yeah.
[45:17] A: Even if he's somebody that beat the shit out of you?
[45:19] B: Yeah.
[45:23] A: And if you had closure, what would that look like? What do you mean by closure?
[45:29] B: Um. I don't know.
[45:33] A: I guess because how. How haven't you not had it already?
[45:37] B: Well, you see, like, we were. Well, I don't know. I. I don't know. It's hard to explain. We were, like, together. Even though he was cheating on me with everyone in Sarasota, Bradenton, North Port, Venice, all that? All the above.
[45:56] A: I never had sex with him.
[45:57] B: Well, I mean, so it wasn't the right.
[45:59] A: Did you? No. Okay, so it's not everybody.
[46:03] B: That's true. Most people, I guess.
[46:11] A: Maybe just some. Maybe not most. I'm sure we could probably, like, pull, like, thousands of people that don't even know who he is.
[46:18] B: Probably right. Yeah. Never know. So. Yeah.
[46:27] A: So we were together even though he was doing that.
[46:29] B: Yeah. And he ended up going to jail. And we were still talking and whatnot. And one day I just stopped talking to him because I couldn't. I just. He was. Just couldn't do it.
[46:50] A: Right.
[46:51] B: And I don't know, I think I was thinking about this last night, that maybe it would be helpful to write a letter, but just not even have to give it to him. Just, like, write down what I want to say to him. Maybe. I think that would be helpful.
[47:15] A: What is it that you want to say that you haven't said?
[47:20] B: I didn't. Well, mainly I just want to know, like, why. Why he did me. How he did me, basically.
[47:29] A: And if you knew why he did you the way that he did you.
[47:33] B: I feel like I would feel better.
[47:35] A: Oh, you would Check it out. So you now have learned that he did it because of these reasons. Do you feel better?
[47:47] B: No.
[47:48] A: See, that's true.
[47:51] B: Damn.
[47:52] A: So you've been thinking that if I knew why or understood that the understanding is the road to the solution on it. But it's not right. If a rat is in a cage and it's used to pressing a lever to get a morsel of food, and we take away the food and the rat hits the lever and there's no food, you Know what the rat does? Freaks out, slams the river, going, where the hell's the food? Right? And then eventually the rat stops pressing the lever that every once in a while, it might hit it, but not expecting food. So when we end something, the way that something ends is that we stop communicating. We don't do it anymore, and that's closing it. See, tug of war is a game that only works if I continue to hold onto the rope, right? If you and I have a rope and we're playing tug of war here, we'll do it. We're playing, right? It only works. It stops as soon as I let go. You can't play anymore, Right. It's the same thing. So the idea is what's been going on is you actually stop. Stopped, right. Talking to him, right? And then you were trying to figure out why he did that stuff, which he might have done that stuff, because he's not like, well, I mean, do most. Well people go to jail or do the shit that he did? Okay, good. So we got that part, right? Yeah. And we can also be thinking that it's really good that you're not in that. Even though there might have been moments of being in that that were okay. We're not thinking, like, every single moment that you had with him was an awful moment. There are other moments that weren't as bad as those.
[49:35] B: I think that now we're getting there.
[49:38] A: Good job.
[49:39] B: I think that a lot of it has to do with, like, as cheesy as it sounds or whatever. Like when. When it was good or whatever. I don't know if it was real, but it felt real just the way I felt when I was with him. It was amazing, Right?
[50:01] A: So here's the problem with that, right? That is frozen and not in context with all of the other moments. So I want you to think back to a. You. When things were good and you had that feeling, right? And you can remember that you. Right. But that you doesn't know about all the other things. Doesn't know about what he did to your body, doesn't know about the stuff that he did with other people, right? That one separated from those. They're not in the same linked together, right? So if you're to think back to the. You, like, you know, feeling really good, right? And you let her know about the other things that he did. How good does he feel?
[50:56] B: How good does he feel?
[50:57] A: Yeah. You know, how good does it feel when you know about all the other things?
[51:03] B: Not so good.
[51:04] A: Oh, it's not so good. It's the same thing with using. Right. The problem with using is that the ending isn't in the front. Right. Somebody has a thought about it, and they remember, like, the good pieces of it, and that's what's first. But what's after it is what it leads to, which is the shitty. Right. And see, if what it led to is actually first, they wouldn't feel so interested in doing it.
[51:30] B: That's true.
[51:31] A: Oh, right. See? And that's what's been happening with this thing. Right? And so now if we put all of those pieces together. Check. Because what happens is you've been reminiscing, and when you reminisce, you only focus on that small, narrow bit of information of when that part was really good. But see, that part isn't connected to all of the other. Right. So if you were to, like, think of the you back then when it was really good and kind of, like, associate to her, like, kind of how that felt really good. Right. And those moments. And then let her know right now about all the other times and all the other stuff that he did and all the other stuff that happened with you. And when she gets that good feeling connected to all of the other times, what do you notice happening to that really good feeling goes away. Oh, it does. Right. Because you wouldn't want to see all of them. That's right. Cause you're clear. Yeah. And what's happening now?
[52:40] B: I feel relieved.
[52:41] A: You do, don't you? I know. Isn't that a good news thing? So you didn't know how that thing had gotten stuck. Right. And now we put it all together. Right. And now it's the whole picture. Yeah. And you get to feel relieved. Isn't that a good news thing? And so really happy that you're not in that.
[53:07] B: Yeah.
[53:07] A: Yay. Right? Yeah. Right? What's happening now?
[53:15] B: A little better.
[53:16] A: You do, don't you? Cool. All right. You did great work today.
[53:23] B: Thanks.
[53:23] A: You're welcome. It was lots of fun. I'm really excited about all the positive changes and growth and, like, who you really are. Like, your essence of who you are. Like a stand for others.
