[00:00] A: So today is the 19th of January, Brittany. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And you know, given what we do is, you know, transformative and life changing, that might be used in teaching other professionals how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:17] B: Yes.
[00:17] A: That's not okay. Cool. So, yeah, I'm really interested in what do we want our time to do for you? What do we want to get better?
[00:25] B: That's crazy because. I don't know. I just. I know when I spoke with Joan, I was just telling her I need someone that I can talk to that doesn't know me. It's not judgmental. The way. The only way I can explain it is I have certain people at my. In my life that puts me on a high pedestal. So I'm scared to tell them that I feel like I'm failing. I'm scared to tell them real life things that I'm going through that, you know, I'm scared.
[00:53] A: I don't think people up on high pedestals don't feel those feelings or have that stuff happen.
[00:57] B: I mean, I guess that's what I feel.
[01:00] A: They feel like those people never have any problems. Their shit doesn't even smell.
[01:06] B: But that's how it seems.
[01:08] A: And I'm like, so you don't want to say stuff.
[01:11] B: Yeah.
[01:11] A: Because you don't want to, like, have it cloud their view of it because it feels good for them to see.
[01:17] B: Exactly.
[01:17] A: I got that.
[01:18] B: And then I have others that never thought I would accomplish anything anyway, or they're waiting for me to resort back, or they just won't give me the good advice. Some of my friends just won't give me the good advice. And girl, do this or girl, do that.
[01:31] A: Maybe they don't have the good advice to give.
[01:33] B: Yes, exactly. So you have that good advice.
[01:38] A: I don't know about advice.
[01:40] B: Hopefully you do. Or I can end. Steered me in the right direction. It's like I feel like I have so many good things going on in my life. I came so far, but I constantly still feel like I'm failing. There's this empty. How can I explain? Just now I genuinely laughed and it was euphoric, it was funny. But as soon as that smile left, my heart dropped again. And I'm constantly walking around with this hole like I'm empty. I'm always incomplete. I don't know if it's a spiritual thing, I don't know if it's a mind thing, but I Can feel it. I don't know. I feel like. I feel like I'm crazy saying it, but it's. I can feel the hole in my heart that I'm constantly carrying. It's always.
[02:27] A: You haven't been experiencing you as being whole.
[02:30] B: Yes.
[02:31] A: And complete inside.
[02:33] B: And.
[02:33] A: And it's not because you're not, by the way, whole and complete inside.
[02:38] B: Yeah.
[02:38] A: And that, you know, is a part of the whole, incomplete inside that you are already.
[02:42] B: Yes.
[02:44] A: You haven't been experiencing you that way. Got it. So notice how even though you've accomplished lots and you feel good that you have, you feel like there's this, like, hole.
[02:57] B: Right.
[02:58] A: Because it isn't about getting there.
[02:59] B: Yes.
[03:00] A: Right. And we can get to there, and then there'll be another there to get to.
[03:03] B: Right.
[03:04] A: Thinking that when I get to that there, that's when I'll really feel it.
[03:07] B: Exactly.
[03:10] A: But it doesn't work that way. We want it along the way. And it's not because it's not already there. It's that you've had crap happen so that it's been blocking your access to it.
[03:24] B: Yes.
[03:25] A: Follow me with that.
[03:26] B: Yes.
[03:27] A: That's why what we want what you already know, but it doesn't have you feel.
[03:32] B: Right.
[03:32] A: We want you to actually feel it and feel really good. Not like in an arrogant I'm better than way, but like, yeah, solid. Like, good. With me. Yes.
[03:42] B: And it's crazy that you say that, because even one thing I do, I never said well, with me. I want to apologize about our phone call. I felt so bad, but I just felt like, you know what? I don't need him. I don't need to be there because I know it. It feels like I know what I need to be doing. I know what I don't need to be doing. I know that I picked the wrong men in relationships. I know this might not work. What the hell is wrong with me? Why don't I listen to what I know? Why doesn't my heart. Heart know? You know what? You are good enough. You are beautiful enough. You are doing more than enough. You are better than that. But my heart, I don't feel it. I know it. I know the. And I feel like, oh, that would have just been. It's a waste of time anyway. He's gonna tell me exactly what I feel like I already know.
[04:34] A: Are you interested in not knowing why you feel? Because even if you did understand it, it. It doesn't change it.
[04:44] B: Right?
[04:45] A: Oh, I get it. The reason that I pick these kind of guys is because this should happen. Cool. Great. And I keep picking these kind of guys. Awesome. Way to go me. Ah, right.
[05:00] B: That's my life in a nutshell.
[05:03] A: Right. But see, understanding the why isn't what changes the how I feel. Remember, the feeling part of our brain is primary. All of that is stuff that we get triggered into. Like when you start laughing and it's euphoric for you. It's not like you chose that. Oh right now when he says that thing, I'm gonna feel it. I'll just laugh. That way it doesn't go down. Instead you're just in it do it. Right. Same thing with crappy emotions. It's not like I go, oh, when this person does this thing to me, I'm going to feel like this cool. Craig going on. Right. None of them are choices. We all get triggered unconsciously. Or pre conscious is more appropriate. Right. Before I realize now I'm stuck in it. What we do when we stuck in it is try to get. Try to figure it out. Better idea is to just get out of it.
[06:02] B: Yes.
[06:03] A: Because in that container there aren't any solutions. That's the problem circulated and it's why therapy, which is all about that premise of understanding, figuring out self analysis, introspection, knowing more so that I can work on it and change it is very long and doesn't work with emotions because knowing it doesn't change how I feel. Yes, got it.
[06:31] B: Yes.
[06:31] A: So you have a wealth of knowledge of things. You know what to do you in even that you see yourself doing really useful things in a lot of ways. And then there are these certain ones that you're like, they're so not consistent with this. What the hell. Then you get, you know, down on yourself about that stuff.
[06:55] B: Right.
[06:56] A: And then you feel down like I'm not as not and I can't like, like say that to all these people. Go, man, girlfriend, you are like don't look at you look at what you've done. Look at what you've accomplished. I don't want them to like go, hey, wait a minute. You also have the same insecurities. We all do shit.
[07:11] B: Right.
[07:11] A: Right. Because that wouldn't actually have them like.
[07:18] B: Actually a job. But they'll live without me.
[07:21] A: Right? Exactly. You're worth it.
[07:23] B: Right.
[07:24] A: What we do today is gonna make you even better there too.
[07:27] B: Right.
[07:28] A: Right.
[07:28] B: I hope so.
[07:29] A: Well, it is. Yeah. No question. I mean, because the stuff that hasn't gotten better is what I know how to get better. That's what I do. I change the way that the Feeling part of the brain works in response to ST stuff. If it's all preconscious, I'm getting triggered into it, not because I'm choosing it. How then am I supposed to choose to not be in it?
[07:53] B: Yes. How?
[07:56] A: Right. Well, the problem is getting it so that I'm no longer triggered into it, so that it's no longer doing that to me.
[08:04] B: Right?
[08:05] A: Because if I didn't choose to get in it, then I can't consciously choose to get out of it. I got to do something else.
[08:10] B: Yes.
[08:11] A: Makes sense.
[08:12] B: Yes.
[08:13] A: If knowing it doesn't change how I feel, well, then I got to do something else. The guy, he's 52. His uncle did awful stuff to him when he was 12. He tells us about it. And as he tells us about it, he's like getting all emotional, and we all understand. We go, yeah, he's emotional because that was awful.
[08:32] B: Right?
[08:32] A: But what if he's not emotional because it was awful? What if he's emotional because part of his brain doesn't know the awful's over, doesn't know that moment stopped, right. Once that stuck on. See, intellectually, the guy knows that it's over. He knows that he survived it. He knows that he's been successful in lots of other ways in his life. He's a proud banker, does really well, has a great family, good dad. He's got all of that. Like, he knows that. He knows that what uncle did to him back then wasn't even his fault. He knows that some of it, like, confusingly wise, felt good, but not because he wanted it from uncle, but because the body part that's that way is designed to feel good. He gets it all. Why is there still all that hurt? The guilt, the pain, the shame? Well, it's because part of his brain never got that it's over. The feelings, right? Feeling. Part of our brain is more like an animal. Animal has feelings to get. Animal brain makes animal feel to get it to do something, to get something to stop or to solve the problem. That's why when mama bear sees somebody poking a stick at her bear cub and she goes and runs after. After the guy got away, she's not sitting in the bear den going, mother, have I ever seen. Right? You got. You want the bears be on the lookout for that guy. You find him, you hold him down. I'm gonna come in, right? Nor if mama bear caught the guy and ripped him to shreds, is she later on in the bear done going, so, you know, here's. What do you think? I overreacted. Do you think he like you would have stopped if I just like scared him or like did I like I'm kind of feeling bad. I probably didn't like need to. Those two things are happening for the answer, right? Because they're always both physically, emotionally present. See, our bodies are locked in now. We can't be anywhere other than now. That's the only part of us though, that is our thoughts can be now beast, but they can be future beasts. They can be past based our emotions same can be now, can be future, can be past. Here's the problem. If I'm worried about something that could happen, that would be bad if it did. I'll be feeling all of it now because that's where my body is. If I'm remembering something that was awful, I'll be feeling all of it. Great. Because when it's awful past, the brain has the memory of it and the experience of it glued together so that at that level the memory is the experience. That's why anytime I think about it, I feel all of it. Anytime something in my environment reminds me, I drive by the house that had happened. Anything that reminds me triggers it. And even things that weren't the issue but happened at the same time trigger it. Like I read this woman, really funny, funny story. So her parents, not funny what happened, but funny story. Her parents got her and her little brother together, sat them on the couch, she's eight, he's six. And they're sitting across and they begin to tell them how mommy and daddy are getting divorced. Now as she was sitting there, she had been eating Nilla wafers. Mommy and daddy say we're getting divorced, your life's different. You know, he's gonna come and live with dad, you're gonna live with mom, and then we'll rotate and that's how it's gonna go. So that was a yucky experience at 8, right? But you know what the weird thing is? She can't stand even walking by the box of Nilla wafers in the grocery store.
[12:22] B: Are you serious?
[12:25] A: Something that simple Nilla wafer happened at the same time that the problem. So it all got stuck as the same thing. That's where it gets stuck. So it's that our brain doesn't know that it's over once the memory is unplugged and the brain experiences it as data. It's data like any other informational thing. I still don't like that it happened. But I'm not constantly replay makes sense.
[12:58] B: Yes.
[12:59] A: It's not Constantly. I can remember it. That was still a sucky thing. Glad that's done. Through other stuff, Right.
[13:07] B: How do you unplug? How do you unplug? Just leave the past in the past. It sounds so easy when you say.
[13:20] A: Is. And the really good news is you have been thinking it's your job to do it and that you just for whatever reason, because in all other areas, when you put your mind to doing something, you make it happen.
[13:34] B: Yes.
[13:34] A: Except this one. Exactly right. So what if it's not your job to get it better for you? If somebody goes to the dental hygienist, I'm hoping that they don't hand that person the tool and hold the mirror so that they can look as they're scraping their own teeth. I think it's the hygienist role. She's the expert in it. She's the one that's knowing what to do. She knows what to look for. She even knows what the number of the teeth are and what they're called. I knew I had wisdom teeth. They're not there anymore.
[14:07] B: Thank God for that.
[14:08] A: I guess maybe I'm dumber now because I lost my wisdom teaching. But when you know how to get it better, it's not dependent on the other person. That's why I was saying, if you're not consciously choosing it, how can you consciously choose to not have it?
[14:28] B: Right.
[14:29] A: There's going to be a couple processes that unplug it in a painless way. Because we don't have to relive to get better. We just want to update the brain. Now I'll tell you something. In the world of neuroplasticity, what that means is our brain is able to rewire, but in order to rewire it, we have to light up the problem. Right. So I bet even right now you could think about a whole bunch of different stuff and feel a little bit of bad feelings.
[14:58] B: Yes.
[14:59] A: Right. And it doesn't take a long time. But that just was the hardest part, was lighting up the problem. Now, if that was no longer an issue for you, meaning if you were no longer troubled by that stuff, if it wasn't causing any discomfort of pain, if it no longer triggered you into those yucky states, if you no longer had that shame, guilt, hurt, pain, sadness, if that was no longer an issue, how would you actually be?
[15:20] B: I would hope happy as hell.
[15:22] A: Yeah. Happy.
[15:23] B: Right.
[15:23] A: What's it like when you feel happy?
[15:25] B: Just refreshing and refreshing.
[15:27] A: Right.
[15:27] B: Not even happy, just being free. Yeah.
[15:32] A: So like we're seeing a you who's happy and who's free.
[15:34] B: Yes.
[15:35] A: Right. And it's refreshing. Right, Right, right. Because she's, like, you know, gets to be, like, enthusiastic. That's the you that I'm seeing. Yeah. Right. Well, that's why we call it transformational work. Right. Because what we're changing is the part that you haven't been able to yet. And it isn't because you weren't motivated, and it isn't because there was something wrong with you. It's because you're in the machine and it's really hard to do it yourself. Even the best dentist isn't taking their own cavity out. They could. They have to go at it at a different angle.
[16:10] B: Yes. Amen.
[16:12] A: Right.
[16:13] B: That's a good way to look at it.
[16:15] A: Exactly.
[16:16] B: Preaching this stuff.
[16:19] A: Right? Right. And that's why I say the only thing that there is is then if we think of a you who's, like, free and happy and light and that peace and connected to who she really is so that at an inside, deep level, she's connected to her own worth.
[16:34] B: Yes.
[16:35] A: Whole and complete. Clear. There's nothing missing. And if it comes to a guy absolutely crystal clear that he's lucky if I'm gonna allow him to spend even a moment of my time, because I'm worth it. Because you know what? In the jungle, the, you know, female panther never runs down a male. She never, even when she's in heat, is running after the male, going, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me. You know, the female panther doesn't do that. She's sleek, she's mysterious, she's strong, she's powerful. And she lets him know that it's okay to approach. Cause you know what? If a male panther approaches a female when she doesn't want him to, do you know what she does?
[17:19] B: What? Really?
[17:21] A: Oh, yeah. You don't fuck with me in my body. So she'll let him know it's okay to approach. But you know what she makes him do? Work, right?
[17:34] B: Yes.
[17:35] A: She makes him work to get her, Chase. She makes him work to get her. Because when he does, I'm worth it.
[17:48] B: Right?
[17:49] A: Right. That's where we want you to be when it comes to guys.
[17:53] B: That damn panther. She good. I need to take notes. I want to sit down.
[17:59] A: Well, that's how I'm seeing you when it comes to guys. That way, we adjust the picker. Right, Right. So that you actually pick guys who are more. Well. Right, Right.
[18:11] B: But you know what I feel like? I feel like I always start off that way, and once I get them I instantly started start feeling like I need you here now. Like I'm comfortable with you, I like you a lot. I don't want to change anymore. So when you act up, most people, people be like, you know what, Brittany? You got this going on. Why are you even dealing with it? And I'm like, I know I shouldn't, maybe I shouldn't put up with it. Maybe, whatever. But it'll change. It'll be different. It'll. Whatever it feels like. I start fierce. In the end, I let you know, listen, I got this going on. I have that going on. I have children.
[18:52] A: But see, the problem is you stop.
[18:56] B: Yes.
[18:57] A: Because we think, oh, I'm done, I don't do anymore. But see, you have to remember two other things. Right. So men and women get turned on very differently. Men get turned on by women. You gals are beautiful, sensual, provocative, shapely, you smell good, your body moves in different ways, you got different parts. Like men get turned on by women.
[19:19] B: Right.
[19:19] A: Women do not get turned on by men. Look at if women got turned on by men, there'd be three guys out there that have like this harem. Right? So it's something else. What women get turned on by is the freedom to be a flirt.
[19:33] B: Yes.
[19:34] A: That you can't have me unless I want it. That it's always on my terms. See, women are regulators, men aren't. Women don't have to always. Men can't never. Not if the gal that he's attracted to says, hey, do you want. Yeah, she didn't even have to get it out yet. Right, right. Yes, of course. Right. 4:00 in the morning. I ought to be up. Yeah, sure. I'm in. I'm a guy, it doesn't take me very long. So, yeah, for. See, for a guy like we're never knows for women, your yeses when you want to. Right, Right. The guy in the middle of the night tries to wake up his woman. Get that thing away. What are you doing with that, sweetie? I'm sleeping. What's wrong with you? Right. You know, I mean, that's the whole thing. She holds the keys. Women are the regulators when it comes to relationships. She's got to hold the keys because if she hands them to him, he's gonna drive recklessly. Right, right. Because the woman doesn't need him to take care of her.
[20:38] B: Yes.
[20:39] A: Heck, the clitoris wasn't. I mean, the orgasm for a woman wasn't designed to happen with a penis.
[20:46] B: What?
[20:48] A: It's the clitoris. See, only about 20% of women can have an orgasm through straight intercourse. All women can have an orgasm through clitoral stimulation. And the women who are having orgasms, their clitoris is positioned in such a way that as it's moving in and out, it's getting slow stimulated. That's not how it is for all. But all women can have an orgasm. So a woman doesn't even need a man. A penis wasn't even designed for an orgasm. It's designed to make the baby, not to make her feel good. That's why in certain African places they have clitorectomies. Cut it off. But there's also Brittany. A really good reason that you all got born with it and you didn't. Because if the whole thing's sole purpose is sexual pleasure, there's no other reason for it. It's just for sexual pleasure. If we had one of those, we'd never stop touching all day long. How you doing? Yep. What are you talking about? I mean, we have a hard enough time not touching it to begin with. Okay. And if all it did was that all day long, what did you do today? I don't know. It's why we don't have multiple orgasms. We keep going. We've already done 278. Cat, can we stop? No. Keep going. Okay, so we want to get it like a woman doesn't need a man. A woman needs a man Like a fish needs a bicycle, which is not at all. So the woman doesn't need the guy to carry the groceries to the car. She can do it herself. But sometimes as a woman, it feels good.
[22:20] B: Useful. It'll be helpful.
[22:21] A: It feels good to have the guy. No, no, I'll carry those, baby.
[22:26] B: It feels good.
[22:26] A: I don't need him to do it.
[22:27] B: Right.
[22:28] A: But it feels good. Right? So we want you to hold the keys. We want you to be owning your own worth. We want you to have that solid inside, right? So that you're connected to it. Because it's not that it's not there. It is. You started off already there from the factory, right? When you have a baby, isn't a baby perfect, whole and complete. There's nothing missing.
[22:46] B: Yes.
[22:47] A: Right. There's nothing missing. Right? And then we go through life and shit happens to us that make us feel bad. And then all of a sudden it starts feeling like, you know, I'm not whole or there's a hole inside. Right. Complete. Now you're going to become more and more whole and complete inside. Connected to it. Because it's already there.
[23:08] B: Right?
[23:09] A: Right. Peace inside. Right. That's where we're headed for. You got it? Yes. So then the next little piece for you to kind of understand is when we go through negative experiences, they short circuit the brain. That part stays on, but a secondary thing happens, and that is because it was something bad, a meaning gets attached to it. Humans brains search for meaning in things all the time. Oh, my goodness. I got passed by, like, osprey, and I've seen, like, five ospreys over the past, like, three days. I wonder what that means.
[23:45] B: Right?
[23:48] A: Let me Google it. Some crazy. Oh, it means, oh, my goodness. That's what it means.
[23:54] B: Right?
[23:55] A: So we're constantly searching for meaning. The problem is, if it was a bad experience, the meaning makes me feel worse about me. Because when we're little children, we're inundated in this culture that thinks it's a good idea to lie. So we constantly lie to children. First, we tell them that if you're a good boy or a good girl, your life will be good. We reinforce that lie with movies and stories and books and TV shows, children's stories, all sorts of things that are designed to teach kids that if you're good, good things will happen to you and you'll get to live happily and after, which is fantastic, you know? And we give them cookies and candies and praise and all that stuff when we're happy with them. So they're learning that if I'm good, life is good. Magical people come and give me gifts once a year. Freaking fantastic. I hate Santa Claus because it ruins stuff for me. Dad gets no credit. Dad gets no credit for anything. Oh, it's Santa that got the cool gift. Yeah, yeah, Right, Santa.
[24:59] B: Right here.
[25:00] A: Santa's the one that climbed in the tree to put the swing on. Yeah, it was. Reindeer landed right on. Easy for Santa, right? Daddy's out with the flashlight in the middle of the night.
[25:12] B: But it's always Santa, right?
[25:14] A: So we tell kids this whole story that life is good. We reinforce with experiences. So when my little girl was coloring on the wall, we said, no, no. The bad girl took the away. Sit in, time out, spank, heiny, whatever. She's learning I was doing something I wasn't supposed to do. Something bad happened to me, which reinforces the second lie. If good only happens when you're being good, bad only happens when you're being bad. So now I go through a bad experience. Well, it must be my fault. Or must be because I wasn't smart enough or I should have known better. I shouldn't have put myself in that situation. Right. I remember somebody telling me about how they had left work at 4:30 at night and it was light out and it was a nice neighborhood and they walked to their car and when they went to get in their car, two guys jumped out of van, grabbed them, threw them in the van, drove to a secluded area and raped them. Horrible, right? But then you know what they told me? Craziest part was, you know, I'm never gonna forgive myself for that. I'm like, what the talking about forgive yourself for what? Well, being careless and stupid and putting myself in that situation. Oh, you mean 4:30 at night walking across parking lot in a suburban area. Right. Okay, but see, because it was bad, it must be my fault. So that gets intensified. Now I feel all these things where like I'm somehow. It's about me at my identity. So this seven year old whose dad says, I'm gonna take you to Disney, and he never shows up. That seven year old might know that dad drinks, but not really get what a drinking problem is. The 7 year old's not thinking, oh, it's because my dad's fucked up and he's got. He must be on a drunken alcoholic banger. That's why, you know, he didn't show. Kid's gonna be thinking, oh well, if my dad loved me or if maybe I was more lovable, then maybe dad would be there. So it must be because like I'm, you know, not lovable enough. So that stuff gets reinforced. So the bad thing happens, which makes me more vigilant and sensitive to it. The meaning gets attached, which makes it bigger, so it attracts more. Then my brain searches for it and gets set off by it in ways that I'm consciously aware of, in ways that I'm not. I remember a guy literally telling me, you know, he was with his girlfriend and she started reaching her hand up his leg and he went like that. And he was thinking to himself, what the hell's wrong with me? What is wrong? Yeah, but it flashed back to what, his uncle? Yeah, so. Well, that's great. She's certainly not his uncle. But a very different thing. But there's some structural similarity. Hand on their inner thigh. Right. So as those memories of what happened get unplugged, they're no longer active. Then what? The person knows. All those feelings of the guilt and the shame and the hurt and the pain and the regret and the remorse and the anger and the sadness get lifted and gone. Then the person no longer interacts with this stuff in the same way because the Person programming has changed. So what I want you to consider isn't that we want to go to specific experiences because of their, like, the reason, but what it does is certain experiences are going to give us different handles on the problem. And the problem is that despite all of the things that you've been able to do and accomplish and where you've come from to where you are now, you don't truly get it inside about you. And we want you to truly, like, own it and feel it and get it. Right?
[29:02] B: Yes.
[29:02] A: And then you'll actually be free to share with those people who see you there that you have the same vulnerabilities, concerns, worries, and despite it, you're still doing it because that'll then have them be able to have a path there. Right, Right.
[29:15] B: Right. I didn't look at it that way.
[29:18] A: I know you hadn't been. Right. Right. Because they think, you know, well, that person doesn't have any issues.
[29:25] B: Right.
[29:25] A: Okay, good.
[29:26] B: Right. And I'm about to jump head first off that pedestal you got me on.
[29:33] A: Right? Yeah. Right. So, any questions about what I've talked about so far?
[29:38] B: No. I mean, everything makes sense. Even with certain stories that you even describe. It just trigger moments, of course, with my father and. And with my aunt's husband and things that I've been through. But like, I hate to say it, it helps me understand better.
[29:57] A: It is. But see, there's another thing that's happening. Both you're getting it and your unconscious is also getting it because you're noticing different feelings and you're getting different parallels. So as I'm explaining it, it's about something over here, even though there's some similarity.
[30:18] B: Right.
[30:19] A: So that lights up your intellectual brain and understanding. So then the next thing that we want to consider is, did you know that if you and I came back one year from today and got together that 99.99 of the subatomic particles that are making us up would not be here?
[30:42] B: What do you mean? What's making us?
[30:44] A: Yeah, like the subatomic particles that are making us up would not be here. That if we took the smallest tiny little particle in atom with the center, proton, neutron, electron, floats around. If we blew it up to the size of a marble, the electron would be more than a football field away. That's how much space there is. Right. So what's very fascinating is we think of ourselves as being our bodies, but what if we're not our bodies? I mean, my mom, when she was 17, had a freak accident with a snow cone. Machine and it chopped the tip of her finger off. But when she goes over to people's houses, they don't say to her, hey, Susie, I'm glad almost all of you could make it. So my mom can't possibly be her body. She has one. It's not her.
[31:32] B: Right.
[31:32] A: It's hers. And there's not a single cell that's the same even as you were when you were little. They've all changed and they've all replaced and heck, that whole thing of 99.9. Right. So you're not your body. We could also say that you have thoughts. And we tend to think of being the person as the thinker of our thoughts. But what if we're not the thinker of our thoughts? What if our brain is the thinker of our thoughts and we have a brain. We're not our brain, so we're not our thoughts. Right? Isn't that crazy? What if we have feelings which we do, which we express, and we feel happy, sad, angry, glad? But we can't be our feelings because you're still you, regardless of how you feel. There's things you do, there's stuff you've done, but when you stop doing different things, did you stop existing? Right. So then you're not what you do, Right. Or your thoughts or your feelings or your body. Which leads to the weird question, then, what are you? Now, religiously, they call it my soul, spirit, essence. But instead of us thinking of it as a thing that you have, let's think of the light as you. Yes, Right. And that light, that is you, it can't be touched or hurt or harmed. It only allows the love in. Totally whole and complete. Can't be touched. And I say that because, you know, you've been at times in life where you were outside in nature and you see something and it's just beautiful. Yeah. What is it that you see sometime when you're flowers or.
[33:10] B: Yeah, I love the ocean.
[33:13] A: Right. And aren't there moments that as you're seeing the ocean and those flowers that you're feeling that peace and excitement and people go, oh, it's the ocean. The flowers, they gave you the feelings. But if we looked at it differently, we go, no. What if being there and seeing it just drew my awareness in towards my center light where I'm already it? Like if I'm at the fire and I move my hands closer to the flames and I go, boy, the fire's hotter. And you go, no, it's not. You're just becoming more aware of it.
[33:49] B: Yes.
[33:49] A: So we know that there have been lots of times in your life where your awareness has been anywhere but the light at the center.
[33:56] B: Yes.
[33:57] A: Stressors of sunset. But the way we're going to think of it, no matter where awareness is being been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited. And that light is you. And you already are feeling it, right? You're getting it in your body. Your body's also responding, which is the thing that's most closely connected to unconscious processes. Right. I'm driving down the road and the bug splats and my body blinked. Right? Most closely connected to unconscious processes. So all things are already beginning to change. Kind of like if we had a package of seeds, we know that the seeds inside the package don't look like the picture on the outside yet. But if we planted them, covered them up, we know that before you ever even see any of it above ground, lots is already happening below the surface. That's right. All of that is happening now. The next little thing to be thinking about. You know, I remember working with this one girl. She had had a lot of different stressors, really had overcome a lot of different things. But one of the things, when she was a little older, brother used to take Matchbox cars, drive them up her leg and park them in her. And she had a lot of yuck about it. But as we cleared it, it was gone. And she sat across from me. She was present, feeling great. And I go, okay, so all of that pain, I where was it? And she goes, it's going, right? But the question was, where was it? And she goes, was it surface? She goes, no, it wasn't intellectual. Was it at the center? She's like, that's dumb. It couldn't survive in that light.
[35:34] B: Yeah.
[35:34] A: I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone. Lights joined together. It's clear to me that it's gone. And so I said to her, I go, yeah, well, know when you were little, your brother, he messed with your stuff. She goes, I know, and it hurt my feelings and it screwed up my thinking for a while. And then she turned and she goes, but you know what? He never got who I really am. He never really touched me. He messed with my body. It screwed up my thinking, hurt my feelings, but he never got me. I go, wow, isn't that powerful, right? So as we're collaborating, energy is something that flows. I'm going to show you what I mean by that. Take one of your hands and just hold it out like that. Look at that spot right there. As you look at that spot, I'm going to bring my hand towards yours. As I bring it in, you're going to see it moving. It gets closer and closer before you ever have it touch. You feel it, right? The warmth, Right. Isn't that cool? See, you're feeling the warmth of my hand here, different than when it's over there.
[36:36] B: Yes.
[36:37] A: Right. You see my point the way that here you feel it, which is cool because you and I are collaborating. Right.
[36:44] B: Start shaking when you get that close. I don't know why.
[36:47] A: Well, it's unconscious. Right. Because you feel that energy. It's you and I joining, intentions, organizing. Which means I'm coming closer to touching who you really are.
[36:59] B: Right.
[36:59] A: Than anybody that ever messed with your body.
[37:01] B: Right.
[37:02] A: Or hurt your feelings. Because who you are is so much more than that.
[37:07] B: Amen.
[37:08] A: That's right. And see, all of that is beginning to get in because just check. How's your body feeling now? That's right. And as your body is feeling relaxed and happy. That's right. Your unconscious is going to travel back to a moment, one that you might remember, one that might have been a long time ago for a us to clear. Yeah. And what comes to mind? What experience. You got one. Right. You might have been how old? Oh, good. So now here's. Let me tell you how we clear. Watch. You're going to be emotionally. There we go. What?
[37:48] B: What did you just do?
[37:53] A: But just check. How's your body feeling now?
[37:56] B: Okay.
[37:57] A: You are, aren't you?
[37:58] B: What did you just do? What did you just do? That.
[38:06] A: See, we're interested in getting the effect that that's had cleared and gone. And the thing that happened is as you started thinking about it, you went there.
[38:14] B: Yes.
[38:14] A: And then I did something that got you back here. And isn't it way more fun to be here than there? Right. So here. So I'm going to explain to you how we get something clear. A, you're going to encounter me because I'm more fun. This is what's happening. And that isn't. And we're working on the goal that we're both interested in. Right. Two, when you tell me the what happened, it's facts. And it's going to go that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened. And it was done. Got it?
[38:46] B: Yes.
[38:47] A: Three, there have been many things, things you've done after that moment that were way more enjoyable than that moment. You know what's one thing that was way better than that?
[38:55] B: An amusement.
[38:56] A: You're going to amusement park. Way better than that. Good. Something else.
[39:00] B: Graduating.
[39:01] A: Yeah. Graduating high school. Way better than that. Right. And getting the promotion. So we got getting the promotion, graduating high school. We've got going on that amusement park. All of those things more enjoyable than that moment. Did you know that there's an aspect of your brain that doesn't know anything past that moment, that doesn't have any of that good news that has met kids. Right. So we've got really good news to get in. So it's just fast. The. What happened while being with me. So you're eight. You're where? And what happened? So you're eight. You're like inside or outside? Inside. Like you're in a bedroom or in a hallway. You're in a bedroom. Good. And you're on the bed. Right, Good. And then what happened? Next person pulled down your pants?
[39:47] B: First he just asked me if he could touch me.
[39:50] A: Right, Good. So he said, hey, can I touch you? Sure. Right. And be here with me because I'm fine. So he said, hey, can I touch you? Like, okay, whatever.
[39:59] B: He won't even let me think of it.
[40:02] A: Yeah.
[40:02] B: He asked me, can they touch me?
[40:04] A: Good. Now I have an example.
[40:06] B: I didn't say anything to say yes or no.
[40:08] A: Of course not. But then he went and did it.
[40:10] B: Yeah.
[40:10] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[40:11] B: And he just asked me how I felt.
[40:13] A: Right. Did you like it?
[40:15] B: No, not at all.
[40:16] A: He didn't ask that. But he asked you how it felt.
[40:18] B: Yeah.
[40:18] A: Right. And you were like, I didn't say anything. Right. And some of it might have felt good, but not because you wanted it, but because the body worked for something. Right, Good. And then what happened next? Did he put his finger in your vagina?
[40:29] B: Yes.
[40:29] A: Right, good. And then what happened next?
[40:31] B: Inhale. Just said, do you like when I move it around?
[40:34] A: Good job. Right. And that was weird. Right, and then what happened next?
[40:36] B: And I just said no.
[40:37] A: Right, good. And then what happened? But you're not liking any of this thing. Like, clearly I'm eight. This is not anything to do with me enjoying it. I'm fucking eight. This is not what eight year olds do. I was hoping to play this other thing over here. I had a, you know, oven bake thing. And then what happened next?
[40:58] B: I just kept asking for my auntie.
[41:00] A: Right, good. Then he eventually pulled his finger out.
[41:03] B: He just told me to be quiet.
[41:05] A: Right. He pulled his finger out, said, don't tell anybody.
[41:07] B: Yes.
[41:08] A: Right. Then you got to pull up your clothes. And then he left the room.
[41:10] B: Yes.
[41:11] A: Right. And that was better.
[41:12] B: Yeah.
[41:12] A: And then that Time ended. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to an amusement park. Right. You get the promotion. Right. Good. So we got getting the promotion and graduating, going to the amusement park. Now we never go back, but watch what happens when we do. So we got, you know, graduating and promotion, Graduating, getting, going to the amusement park. And then before that, him leaving.
[41:31] B: Yes.
[41:32] A: And then him saying, don't tell anybody. And then him pulling it out, and then him having it in and asking all sorts of questions. Then him touching your body and then asking if he could. And then him coming in. And then before that, you had been in bed. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[41:44] B: Yeah.
[41:44] A: Right. And as I ran through it backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it? I don't believe it. Didn't have the same feeling, did it? Isn't that weird?
[41:51] B: Like pieces. It was just like bastard.
[41:54] A: But yeah, that. But it didn't do the same thing at the same level.
[42:00] B: Yes.
[42:01] A: Isn't that interesting? So here's the third part. The motions work with associations, not logic.
[42:07] B: Yes.
[42:08] A: So I'll give you a great example. You can remember putting your boots on and how long it took you to do it. You can remember doing it where you were when you did it. But if I said to you remember, you know, putting your boots on and said, brittany, stop putting on your boots, you'd look at me and go, I'm not putting on my boots. Because you know for sure that there's a difference between the memory of it and the experience of it.
[42:28] B: Right.
[42:29] A: So remember getting dressed, putting your boots on. Brittany, stop putting on your boots. Say, I'm not putting on my boots. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt.
[42:37] B: Yeah, say that you're not putting on your shirt.
[42:39] A: Well, you stop putting on your bracelet.
[42:41] B: I'm not putting it on.
[42:42] A: Will. Stop me from putting on my bracelet.
[42:44] B: Then you're not putting your water.
[42:45] A: Well, then stop him from touching you. Say, he's not touching.
[42:48] B: He's not touching.
[42:48] A: Well, stop him from putting his hand in your. Or finger in your vagina. Well, stop him from doing that.
[42:54] B: He's not doing that.
[42:54] A: Well, you stop putting on your boots.
[42:56] B: I'm not putting.
[42:57] A: Well, stop him from doing that.
[42:58] B: He's not doing that.
[42:59] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[43:01] B: It no longer exists.
[43:02] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to get in third, him doing that. Did that have anything to do with you?
[43:06] B: No.
[43:07] A: No. Had a lot to do with him.
[43:09] B: Yes.
[43:09] A: Right. Thinking that an 8 year old would get like turned on. Yeah, well, we're gonna get that going too, so. Right, right. I mean, seriously. Right. Because the anger that you're having is actually a little bit different than it was. But we're gonna get the whole thing first reversed because that earlier you had been thinking that it did have to do with you.
[43:32] B: Right?
[43:33] A: Right. And you know there wasn't a right answer. Right. It wasn't. You couldn't say really anything because there wasn't a right answer.
[43:41] B: Right.
[43:41] A: Know. It feels completely awkward and uncomfortable.
[43:44] B: Right.
[43:45] A: I mean, this is really weird that you're doing this to me. It's really uncomfortable. I don't even know how to like be with it. Like, I can't even process because I never even thought of that before you started doing this.
[43:56] B: It just made me feel like you could have did something. You could have screamed. You could have.
[44:02] A: Well, see, that's anything.
[44:03] B: And you just sat there.
[44:05] A: Oh, okay. Yeah, well, we're gonna get to that moment in a second because, I mean, that's only because you're this bright girl. Stupid, dumb me. You might want to be a little easier on you. She was in the midst of going through a really horrific experience. She didn't have the wisdom that you have from here.
[44:22] B: Right, Right. And it's like you see stuff in the movies and you like scream something, tell somebody.
[44:29] A: Right. So. So that earlier you thought back then that it had to do with you.
[44:34] B: Yes.
[44:34] A: So repeat these four words after me. Here we go. It's. It's not.
[44:37] B: Not about. About me.
[44:39] A: It's not. It's not about me.
[44:42] B: About me.
[44:42] A: Right? It's not about me.
[44:43] B: It's not about me.
[44:44] A: Now close your eyes. Picture the younger you back then. Let her know that it's over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists. Let her know that it's not about me. Had nothing to do with me. Had everything to do with something. Being off with that guy. So that she gets it. Let her know that despite having that happen, what she's been able to do, the strength that she has inside, let her know about her kids. Let her know about what she's doing. Let her know about graduating. Let her know about getting that promotion. Let her know so that she gets that from you. Right. And as that you is getting all of that, what do you notice happening to her face?
[45:19] B: She's going away.
[45:20] A: Yeah, right. She's okay. That's right.
[45:25] B: She is beautiful.
[45:26] A: Yeah, right. You are, aren't you? Beautiful?
[45:31] B: I'm not even really hurt. She's Just so beautiful.
[45:35] A: She is, isn't she? Because she defeated that. By the way, that guy never touched you, right? He messed with your body, hurt your feelings, screwed up your thinking, but he didn't get you. Right? So repeat this after me. I have a nose. I have two elbows. I have 10 fingers. I have 10 toes.
[45:55] B: I have 10 toes.
[45:56] A: I'm not my toes. I'm not my elbows.
[45:58] B: I'm not my elbows.
[45:59] A: I'm not my fingers. I'm not my nose.
[46:02] B: I'm not my nose.
[46:03] A: I have a vagina.
[46:04] B: I have a vagina.
[46:04] A: I'm not my vagina. My vagina is mine.
[46:08] B: It's mine.
[46:09] A: But it's not me.
[46:10] B: But it's not.
[46:10] A: So he messed with my stuff, and it hurt my feelings. And it screwed up my thinking.
[46:16] B: And it screwed up my thinking.
[46:17] A: You know what? He never got me.
[46:20] B: He never got me.
[46:21] A: He messed with my body.
[46:22] B: He messed with my body, but he.
[46:24] A: Never got who I really am.
[46:26] B: He never got who I really am.
[46:28] A: Because who I am can't be touched in that way.
[46:31] B: Can't be touched.
[46:32] A: That's right. So he messed with my stuff.
[46:34] B: He messed with my stuff.
[46:35] A: But he never got me.
[46:36] B: But he never got me.
[46:37] A: That's right. And as that filters in, what he noticed now.
[46:42] B: Relief.
[46:43] A: Yeah, right.
[46:45] B: I don't feel as guilty anymore.
[46:47] A: I know, right?
[46:49] B: Like, it was my fault. I feel like I always knew it wasn't my fault, but, like, you could have done something differently.
[46:56] A: Yeah, well, because she knew what was gonna happen anymore. You ever seen the movie Sully?
[47:01] B: No.
[47:02] A: So it was about the guy who landed the plane in the Hudson. So there was an airline player that the plane had some issue and couldn't make it back to the runways, and he had to land it in the middle of the Hudson, and everybody got rescued. And then they made a movie of it. Well, in the replays of it, they had people in the pilot, you know, doing simulations that they could actually make it back to the different airports. And he was thinking they couldn't, like, in the moment. And he said to him and go, oh, but all of your pilots knew exactly when it was gonna happen and already had it prepared for.
[47:37] B: Right?
[47:37] A: Yeah, because they knew that. Right. We didn't know that that was gonna happen.
[47:41] B: Right.
[47:42] A: So we didn't have the same luxury of knowing, oh, well, this is what we do with it. We were trying to figure out what the f just happened.
[47:51] B: Right.
[47:52] A: So it's always from after the fact that we look back at the earlier me. We go.
[47:59] B: Right, right.
[48:01] A: But see, that earlier, you didn't know that that was going to go down. Yes, because heck, if she'd known that that was going to go down, she might not have gone to bed. Hey, grandpa, what's up? I'm hanging out with you tonight. No, I'm not that tired.
[48:15] B: Exactly.
[48:16] A: But she didn't have any of that information.
[48:19] B: Right?
[48:19] A: Right, Right. So notice how that's not hurting. Right, Right. And you're not even having like the guilt.
[48:30] B: No.
[48:31] A: Right. And that a good news thing.
[48:33] B: To be honest, I don't even want to go back to it.
[48:37] A: Well, I would like you to try to go back to it and feel bad. See if you can. I mean, you can remember the whole thing. Him coming in, him saying, hey, hey, cool eight year old. Would it be good for me to touch you in a sexual way?
[48:51] B: What?
[48:53] A: Here? Doesn't that feel good? Doesn't that feel good? Oh, do you like that? Do you like it?
[48:58] B: Right?
[48:59] A: You can remember all that happening. Okay, well, whatever you do, don't tell anybody that I did all that. Right? Yeah, that was over. All right. That was better.
[49:08] B: Yeah.
[49:09] A: And then you went to an amusement park, had kids and see, I went through all that. What'd you notice?
[49:17] B: I didn't have enough faith.
[49:19] A: Right.
[49:20] B: And it went pretty fast too. I didn't have time to just sit and dwell on it.
[49:26] A: Right. Well, even if you do see, it's not about you. Right. It's not about me, right? No, it's not about me. Wasn't had nothing to do with you just happened to be in that situation. Yes, I sucked. Right.
[49:44] B: Damn it. Wrong place, wrong time.
[49:47] A: Right. Yeah, Right. But notice how that's getting.
[49:51] B: Yes. Louder.
[49:52] A: Yeah, Right. And how's your body feeling now?
[49:55] B: Okay, not the best.
[49:57] A: Oh, you notice discomfort?
[50:02] B: Some.
[50:02] A: Oh, where, where are you feeling it in your body?
[50:06] B: Not really discomfort. It's just. I feel like I don't care anymore. I don't care about that. I don't want to go back to it.
[50:15] A: You don't care about it? Yeah. Right. It doesn't matter anymore. Oh. It doesn't define you. It's not even a part of you. Right, Right.
[50:25] B: It's like whatever. Like I could think about it and I'm like, I don't feel any emotion. Not happy anymore. Because you're not being funny. But. But I'm like, okay, that's done.
[50:39] A: Right? It is done now. It's finally done.
[50:41] B: Yeah.
[50:42] A: That's what just got in that. I'm done with that. I defeated that. That's over. It's not about Me. Never touched me.
[50:51] B: Yes.
[50:52] A: Right, right. And it isn't my fault because, you know, you didn't know. Right, Right. Because if you had, you probably would have done something different. Oh, so if I go to bed at night at this time that's gonna happen. Cool. Come in. I was looking for a really scary experience.
[51:19] B: Alright, I'm here, I'm ready. That's a sick joke, you know.
[51:29] A: I know, but I mean, how awful would it have to be to be the guy thinking that an 8 year old would be like, oh, dude, this is fucking great, man. Oh yeah, baby. Yeah, baby. Yeah, yeah. Right. Like that's actually what was going on in that person's head. That an 8 year old would be into something like that. That's how off he is, you know, in the actor roles of, you know, playing parts.
[51:56] B: Yes.
[51:57] A: We're glad you got yours instead of his.
[51:59] B: Right.
[52:01] A: Imagine being somebody that. That's something that comes to mind to do.
[52:04] B: Exactly. It makes me feel sorry for him.
[52:10] A: I know, right. Which is different, isn't it?
[52:13] B: Yeah.
[52:13] A: Yeah. Right? Yeah.
[52:18] B: It's not even a hate, it's just.
[52:20] A: No, you don't hate him anymore. Right.
[52:21] B: You don't even deserve my hate.
[52:23] A: You just sick. Yeah.
[52:25] B: Yeah. It's like you're just like. Yeah, that's right.
[52:30] A: Seriously, it's like, no, you sick.
[52:32] B: When you put it that way. You're sick.
[52:35] A: Right. You hadn't been able, you need help. You hadn't ever considered.
[52:38] B: Not me. You need the help.
[52:39] A: Right? Yeah. For the that to be something that comes to mind to do. I mean like, I mean, is there anything that like an 8 year old boy could do to turn you on? What if he says you got a cute. What if he says you got a cute butt? What if he says he likes your hair? What if he says you look sexy in those boots? What if he flexes for you? What if he shows you a little.
[53:09] B: Right there?
[53:10] A: See, there's Nothing that an 8 year old boy could do that would do that for you.
[53:17] B: Excuse me.
[53:18] A: Yeah. Yeah, Right. So notice how that's different.
[53:27] B: Yes.
[53:28] A: By the way, it's different than it's ever been.
[53:31] B: Yes.
[53:31] A: Right, right.
[53:33] B: It's not as fast.
[53:34] A: Well, is it painful at all?
[53:36] B: No, I guess not.
[53:40] A: Try to feel really hurt.
[53:41] B: Right? Make it hurt.
[53:43] A: Try to feel really hurt. See, you couldn't not feel hurt by it before. Now we're laughing and I'm going try to feel hurt by it now.
[53:51] B: And I can't.
[53:52] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[53:53] B: You're sick. You made that Funny. It's not supposed to be funny.
[53:59] A: Why not? Why wouldn't getting bad stuff better be a laughing matter? Because I think we do better when we feel good.
[54:08] B: We do.
[54:10] A: Right.
[54:10] B: And I love to laugh.
[54:11] A: Yeah, Right.
[54:12] B: I told you. That euphoric feeling that comes over me.
[54:15] A: Right.
[54:17] B: Peace.
[54:17] A: Right.
[54:18] B: And I didn't instantly feel empty again.
[54:21] A: I know.
[54:21] B: That's another feeling I didn't feel.
[54:24] A: Yeah, right, Right. Because it's already there. Right. It's already whole. You've been thinking there's been a hole, but you're just really whole. Incomplete inside.
[54:37] B: Right.
[54:37] A: Right. Peace. Happening. So your brain is going to scan back and select another yucky moment to clear, and you got one happen. When?
[54:52] B: When I was, like, five.
[54:53] A: Oh, good. Feelings.
[54:54] B: Yes.
[54:55] A: Hurt. Anger. Sadness. Pain. Guilt, Shame. Huh. Would it be okay to get the hurt gone?
[55:00] B: Yes.
[55:00] A: Okay, cool. So again, you just tell me what happened while being with me, because I'm fine. So you're five. You're where?
[55:06] B: I'm at my grandmother.
[55:08] A: So you're at Grandma's. Good. Daytime or nighttime?
[55:10] B: Daytime.
[55:10] A: Daytime. When you're, like, in the living room, kitchen, Outside. Outside. Good. Right. In the front yard or backyard?
[55:15] B: In the front yard.
[55:16] A: Right. Good. And then what happened there?
[55:17] B: It's raining.
[55:17] A: Right. Good. Know what happened?
[55:19] B: And my dad promised me that he would be there to come.
[55:21] A: Right. Good. Right. Then what happened?
[55:23] B: I remember sitting outside and my aunt said, are you sure he's coming?
[55:27] A: Yeah. Right. Good job.
[55:29] B: And I said, yeah, he's coming. I just got off the phone with him.
[55:31] A: Yeah. Oh, yeah, totally.
[55:33] B: And I lied because I didn't call him.
[55:35] A: Oh, you want to make him look good?
[55:37] B: Yeah.
[55:37] A: Right. Yeah.
[55:38] B: And they told me, oh, well, we're gonna. We're running to the store. And I said, oh, well, he said, he's right up the street.
[55:44] A: Yeah, right.
[55:45] B: It was like, okay, well, we're gonna go.
[55:48] A: Right.
[55:48] B: And they was like. They let me sit outside. They closed and locked the front door.
[55:53] A: Right. Good job.
[55:54] B: And they left.
[55:55] A: Right.
[55:55] B: And I was just sitting outside waiting for my dad.
[55:58] A: That's right. In the rain. Good. And then what happened? And then they came back from the store.
[56:03] B: They came.
[56:04] A: They said, what are you doing sitting here? I thought you were getting picked up by your dad. Right.
[56:08] B: I thought you said your dad was on his way. I thought he was right up the street.
[56:11] A: Yeah. Good job. Right. Good detail. Right.
[56:13] B: And.
[56:14] A: And then you went back inside. Right. And then that time ended.
[56:18] B: Yeah.
[56:18] A: Right. And you went back inside. They might have, like, fed you.
[56:21] B: Yeah.
[56:21] A: Right. And then that was over. Snacks gave You, Snacks. Right. And that was good. Right. And then later on you, you know, graduated and then you got the promotion. Yeah. Going to amusement parks. So. Yeah, going to amusement parks and, you know, getting the promotion and then graduating and then before that being back inside and eating snacks and stuff and then walking in and then I'm like, what the heck? And then them pulling back and then them being gone and you just sitting there and then go, okay, we're out. And then you say, no, he'll be right around the corner and then going, I thought your dad was coming. And then you were sitting out on the porch and then before that you were over there. Right. And again, as we run through it backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it?
[56:55] B: I didn't feel anything.
[56:57] A: Right. You can remember that happening, right? You can remember, you know, eating something or earlier today.
[57:03] B: Yes.
[57:03] A: We'll stop eating that.
[57:05] B: Not eating.
[57:05] A: We'll stop dad from doing that.
[57:07] B: He's not.
[57:07] A: We'll stop me from putting on my watch.
[57:09] B: You're not putting.
[57:10] A: We'll stop dad from doing that.
[57:11] B: Oh, he's not here.
[57:13] A: Yeah. So then where is it, say, no longer exists. By the way, dad doing that, did that have anything to do with you?
[57:19] B: No.
[57:19] A: Right. But it felt that way. It felt like it had to do with like your love or his love for you. But as we know. Are we thinking dad, by the way, back then was, you know, 100% mental emotionally? Well, yes, he was.
[57:31] B: I was thinking.
[57:32] A: No, but was he?
[57:33] B: No.
[57:33] A: As you think about it now?
[57:35] B: No.
[57:36] A: Right. He had like his own stuff going on.
[57:37] B: Yes.
[57:38] A: And his stuff had nothing to do with his love for you?
[57:40] B: No.
[57:41] A: Right. Had to do with. That stuff had nothing to do with your lovability?
[57:45] B: Well, it kind of did. It was a mixed up situation.
[57:49] A: No, it didn't have to do with your loveability. Had to do with what was going on with him. See, if the boy comes home with two Ds and two Fs and his mom says, wait until dad comes home. And then dad comes home and dad takes the belt off and starts beating the kid. The kid is feeling well? Yeah. I mean, dad's doing that because I got the four grades. But that's one logical level. Is dad doing that because he got the poor grades? See, isn't there like at least a thousand other ways dads could handle that situation other than beating him out with the belt?
[58:21] B: Yes.
[58:22] A: So then it's not about the kid or the grades. It's about whatever is going on with dad.
[58:27] B: Right.
[58:27] A: That. That's what came to mind. To do. Because.
[58:29] B: Right, right.
[58:30] A: Exactly right. So it had nothing to do with. You had to do with dad. Right, Right. By the way, you thought that you needed him around in order for you to turn out okay. Did you?
[58:41] B: No.
[58:41] A: Need him around in order for you to turn out okay, to graduate, to get the professor promotion, to be a really good mom.
[58:46] B: No, I wanted him.
[58:48] A: Right, you did, but you thought that you needed him.
[58:51] B: Yes.
[58:52] A: That was the difference. Because when we're little, we think we need our parents because we can't do anything by ourselves. They feed us, they brush our teeth, they change us. They. All the stuff that parents do for little kids. So we're trained to believe that we need them to be okay. But you didn't. But see, you didn't know that back then at five.
[59:12] B: Right, Right.
[59:13] A: So close your eyes. Picture that younger you back then at five. Let her know what you know now. One, that it's over, finished, no longer exists. Right. The dad doing that had nothing to do with you or his love for you or your love ability so that she gets it. Let her know that she didn't need a more well dad in order for you to turn out okay. Let her know about graduating, let her know about her kids, let her know about the promotion, let her know what she's doing. Let her know that sometime in maybe the near future she's gonna have a house. And as all of that's going in, what do you notice now?
[59:51] B: I don't have any feelings towards it.
[59:53] A: Yeah, right. What do you notice feeling about you now?
[59:59] B: I feel more complete. I feel like it's. It's not my fault.
[60:03] A: Right. Notice how you said I feel. I feel different than. I know it wasn't.
[60:14] B: Right.
[60:16] A: Look at you. Notice how you feel different now.
[60:21] B: Yes.
[60:21] A: Right. It's not hurting. It's not coming in and hitting here. That's the thing that would impact you too often in your current life. Because you're a caring person, things come in and hit you at heart level. When it does that, you don't get to have the same access to your smarts. Because when we're in states of high emotion, we're in states of low intelligence. Yes, Right.
[60:53] B: We do.
[60:54] A: So we want you to be registering it up here. Other people's garbage is about them.
[61:00] B: Yes.
[61:00] A: Not me. Other people's stuff is about them, not me. And you'll be seeing that more and more clearly now.
[61:12] B: Stop making other people problems my problem.
[61:15] A: Well, that's the thing. If you loan somebody my money, you don't realize that in doing that, you are taking. You're not just loaning them money. You're taking on their problem.
[61:28] B: Yeah.
[61:29] A: And we already have enough of our own take on somebody else's. Because in order for them to be in a position that they need to be asking you for money. Something is wrong.
[61:38] B: Yes, Right, exactly.
[61:42] A: So you're going to inherit their problem. Not useful.
[61:46] B: Right.
[61:49] A: We don't want to do that. We can have it.
[61:52] B: Yeah.
[61:53] A: Yeah. So that's not hurting. And think about other stuff with dad. And what do you notice?
[62:01] B: Doesn't bother me as much.
[62:03] A: There's a little bit. What's something else that's happened with dad that was hurtful?
[62:08] B: Just that he always left me or lied.
[62:11] A: Like, what does that mean?
[62:12] B: That he would tell me that he would come around and he wouldn't.
[62:17] A: And so let's think of another time.
[62:19] B: That he said me, he just didn't help me in that situation and that he should have been there.
[62:25] A: What situation?
[62:27] B: With my aunt's husband. I feel like he should have been.
[62:30] A: There when you were eight. That one. Okay. Did that happen more than once with him?
[62:34] B: Yes.
[62:35] A: Okay. And there's more stuff that he did.
[62:37] B: Yes.
[62:37] A: Okay.
[62:38] B: And I feel like if he was around, it wouldn't have happened.
[62:42] A: Oh, so you're thinking that if your dad was there, that wouldn't have happened.
[62:45] B: Yes.
[62:47] A: Which is only one possibility, because your dad could have been around and that could have happened.
[62:52] B: Right.
[62:53] A: Your dad could have been around and then, like, other things could have happened that might have been worse than that.
[62:59] B: Yeah. You are right about that.
[63:01] A: Right. But see, we only look for the one, like, well, if he was around, then it wouldn't have. Yeah. That's the only one that we shine the light on. Not all the other ones that it could. Not all the other possibilities that it could be. Right. Right. So we want to get that cleared. So all of those tentacles that are attached to it are gone.
[63:19] B: Yes.
[63:20] A: Right. Because the stuff with uncle. Other times that he did stuff, and he might have done more stuff. Did he do more stuff than just fingers?
[63:27] B: Just fingers?
[63:28] A: He just did fingers. So he didn't actually do penis. He didn't do other things. But he did the fingers multiple times. And that lasted for how many years?
[63:35] B: For a couple years.
[63:36] A: For a couple years. Right. And then he stopped. How'd you get him to stop?
[63:41] B: I moved in with my grandmother.
[63:43] A: So you weren't staying there anymore?
[63:44] B: No.
[63:45] A: So that's how it stopped. You left. Whose decision was it to move?
[63:50] B: My aunt's. And she kicked me out.
[63:54] A: Uh, huh? Why?
[63:55] B: Because she didn't believe me.
[63:57] A: Oh, wait a minute. So here we go. No. So. Oh, interesting. So before all of this, you told aunt what was going on with her husband.
[64:04] B: Yes.
[64:04] A: And then she said, you need to go to Grandma's.
[64:06] B: She originally. She originally tried to do something. She confronted him about it.
[64:13] A: And you're doing stuff to my niece. No, I'm not. Oh.
[64:17] B: And they brought me in the room.
[64:19] A: Right.
[64:20] B: And I remember they were both yelling at the same time. And she was like, brittany, don't you lie. Did he touch you? And he was like, don't lie. Did I touch you? Did I touch you? And I didn't say anything.
[64:32] A: Right? Right.
[64:33] B: I just stood there crying.
[64:35] A: Right. Because, you know, that's a really great place for a little kid to be in.
[64:40] B: Right?
[64:40] A: Two large adults yelling at them, opposite messages, one being their perpetrator. Cool. That's fair, right? Man, what am I supposed to say here?
[64:54] B: I should have said something again then. But I did say something.
[64:58] A: You said something.
[64:59] B: I should have said it in face.
[65:01] A: See, here's the interesting thing, which you haven't considered before. You stopped it.
[65:09] B: Yes.
[65:10] A: You stopped it from happening.
[65:13] B: Right.
[65:15] A: You did that. You told her. Then it blew up. However. It blew up.
[65:19] B: Yeah.
[65:19] A: And then you lived with Grandma. Right? You stopped it. Right. And, see, aunt wouldn't believe you or couldn't believe you, not because she didn't believe you, but because of what that would mean about her. That my own husband would be doing that to my niece? Mm. That's the issue. So, like, your aunt couldn't process and be with it.
[65:50] B: Right.
[65:51] A: Because of what it would mean about her that my husband would be doing that to my niece? Can't even be with that. No. Can't possibly be.
[66:01] B: Yeah, right.
[66:02] A: But see, you didn't realize that you stopped it.
[66:05] B: No, I didn't. I just.
[66:07] A: And how much courage and strength that takes.
[66:09] B: A lot.
[66:10] A: Right. You didn't realize that either. How you stopped it and how strong you are in doing that.
[66:17] B: I wish I had more courage to say to his face, stop lying. You know you did. You know what you did.
[66:24] A: You see, here's the thing. The ultimate thing that you were interested in doing wasn't in being right, wasn't in having him look bad. It was getting it to stop. And that's what you did. Sure. It didn't go down exactly the way that maybe later on you would have liked it to go down, but if we look at the net result of what you did, right, my dear, you got it to stop if it Wasn't for you doing that. It might have continued.
[66:59] B: Right.
[67:00] A: But you made sure that it stopped. Right?
[67:03] B: Yes.
[67:04] A: Right. And I'm wondering what it would be like to feel really good about that right now. It feels really good that you stopped it.
[67:17] B: I never felt like I stopped it. I always felt like that was my opportunity to say it to his face. And again, just like I did when it stopped, I just sat there and cried when I was asked, I sat there and cried. I just looked at them and cried. So. But I stopped it.
[67:36] A: Right. Because you know what? For attention. Most little kids, you know, 9, 10, 11 years old, are wanting to tell their aunt that her husband's, you know, touching my vajayjay, thinking that I'm liking it.
[67:54] B: Right.
[67:55] A: See, not only is he doing it, which is bad to begin with, but he's so fucked up that he actually thinks, like, I'm enjoying it.
[68:02] B: What the fuck?
[68:05] A: It's not on my terms.
[68:07] B: She didn't believe it until it came out that the same thing was happening to her daughter and her son.
[68:13] A: See, she did. See, that's the thing. It's not that she didn't believe it. It's that she couldn't.
[68:21] B: Right.
[68:22] A: Because of what it would mean about her.
[68:24] B: Right.
[68:25] A: That's all had nothing to do with you not believing you. It wouldn't have mattered whether it was you or any other person in that situation with her and him having had that happen.
[68:38] B: Right.
[68:38] A: That's how she would have responded. Not because she doesn't love you or didn't believe you. And see, you'd been feeling bad because it was one time to really confront, but you did it in the best way you could. Right. And by the way, by crying, they were just thinking that you weren't answering. But, you know, standing there crying is actually answering. Do you follow me?
[69:09] B: Yes. It was.
[69:11] A: That's actually like answering something.
[69:14] B: It was.
[69:15] A: Right.
[69:16] B: It was crying.
[69:16] A: If you talk to one of your kids and you ask them this thing that they were feeling bad about, and as you get to the right one, they start crying.
[69:25] B: Yeah.
[69:26] A: All right.
[69:27] B: Yeah.
[69:31] A: I don't have to be a detective.
[69:33] B: Right.
[69:33] A: Figure it out. Right. You did answer yes, and you got it to stop. And how brave that is that you took a stand for you.
[69:45] B: Yes.
[69:47] A: Right. Right. And you didn't need that in order to get it to stop. Right. Didn't. Right.
[70:04] B: I would have loved him to kick his ass.
[70:05] A: And now you want to let that younger. You know.
[70:08] B: Yes.
[70:09] A: That she didn't need dad to get it to stop. That you Stopped it. That you stood up for you because you're worth it. That's right.
[70:23] B: Amen.
[70:23] A: That's right. And you're beginning to feel. Feel it.
[70:28] B: Yes.
[70:29] A: Integrating inside.
[70:31] B: Yes.
[70:32] A: Yeah.
[70:33] B: And it feels good.
[70:34] A: I know.
[70:36] B: I did. I did that.
[70:37] A: That's right. You did.
[70:38] B: Not many can.
[70:40] A: And I did that. You did. Right. Right. And you also led the way to get it exposed for others.
[70:48] B: Yes.
[70:52] A: Right?
[70:53] B: Yeah.
[70:56] A: Yeah. How cool is that? Awesome, right?
[71:00] B: It is.
[71:01] A: That's right.
[71:05] B: My cousin Terrence, one of the ones that it actually. My male cousin that it happened to, he just has this nonchalant. Like everything that you said. Say that you're saying right now. It's just. Was always his attitude. I don't know what he could possibly be hiding behind closed doors. But he just always had this, you know, what how people feel about me, how people actions. It just doesn't have anything to do with me myself. Like he. He has a way to just cut the rest of that off. And sometimes I talk to him and he'll act like he doesn't remember what I'm talking about. And. And then one day we just really sat down and he said, you know what? I just got this black hole. Like, I don't know. I think I just blacked out a certain section of my life. But I guess it worked for him. I don't know. And I always wanted to be like that.
[72:00] A: I don't know if it's totally worked for him because if you block out a chunk, you gotta block out all of it.
[72:08] B: Yes.
[72:09] A: And there's other things that are there.
[72:12] B: Right.
[72:12] A: See, what we do isn't erase memory. You still remember.
[72:18] B: Yes.
[72:18] A: It's just not making you feel bad. It's not making you feel bad about you.
[72:23] B: Right.
[72:23] A: You're not having the hurt. Right? Right. We would prefer it having not happened, but unfortunately it couldn't have not happened. We don't like it that it did.
[72:40] B: Yeah.
[72:41] A: But it doesn't define who you are because you're much more than that experience. There's so much more to you than that. Right. All a part of the whole incomplete that you are inside. Right. And you're becoming more and more connected to it ongoingly. That's why your body feeling calmer, Right?
[73:06] B: Yes. Feels tense talking to you or embarrassed or scared. Feel relaxed. Feel okay.
[73:15] A: Right. You feel okay. Right. Right.
[73:20] B: I like this feeling.
[73:21] A: I know. Good feeling to be having.
[73:24] B: Yes.
[73:24] A: Right. Because you do have all the resources to deal with whatever is going on. What did, what is, what might.
[73:32] B: Right.
[73:32] A: They're already there. We're just connecting them to where the problem states were. So it rewires your circuitry in your brain and how it interacts with other stuff, things that normally would like, trigger those emotions when you start feeling down and then getting down on yourself when you don't feel like you can expose that shit. Sometimes I feel like crap too.
[74:01] B: Right.
[74:03] A: I don't always have my stuff going for me. Don't look behind the sheet.
[74:10] B: Right. Wait until I'm ready, put my mask on.
[74:17] A: Yeah. Right.
[74:18] B: But that's okay. It's okay not to have it all together.
[74:23] A: Right? Right?
[74:26] B: It is.
[74:27] A: It is.
[74:27] B: You have to believe it. It's okay to not have it all together.
[74:34] A: All the time.
[74:35] B: All the time. Right. All the time. We have to have it together sometimes.
[74:40] A: We will have it together sometimes. Well, we won't probably have it together all the time.
[74:46] B: Right.
[74:47] A: And it's okay. Right? Yeah. So just check. What do you notice now?
[74:55] B: I just. A piece that I can't explain just came over me. That hole that I said I felt constantly.
[75:04] A: Right.
[75:05] B: I don't feel it anymore.
[75:06] A: Right.
[75:08] B: I mean, I could use. I felt it. I felt it. It was hard to explain, but I don't feel it.
[75:15] A: You don't feel it.
[75:15] B: I'm just.
[75:16] A: Because you're whole. Yes, that's right. That whole. Your whole.
[75:21] B: About me. I'm like, you know what? You did a damn good job.
[75:26] A: Right? Yeah. On the way to doing more.
[75:30] B: Right.
[75:30] A: Because it's not about getting to the next place. It's about enjoying the road.
[75:38] B: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[75:42] A: And that's starting to happen because you're getting your own worth. See, you took a stand for you when you stopped it. That I'm worth more. That's not okay. Right. And you did it at the time that you could.
[75:58] B: Right.
[76:00] A: Because earlier you couldn't have.
[76:01] B: Right?
[76:02] A: Right. Right. I remember this girl who had her dad used to do stuff to her. One time when she was 13, they kind of walked and she was begrudgingly not wanting to walk to like the place where he was going to do that thing. And he went to do it and she's like, just like. And so he stopped and he said to her, he goes, okay, well, like, you know, if you ever want me to do this thing, just let me know.
[76:35] B: Really.
[76:35] A: Right. That's what he said.
[76:36] B: How sick you.
[76:38] A: Right. But see, she stopped it.
[76:40] B: Right?
[76:41] A: Because from that moment forward, he never did it again. She got her own power. You don't get to do that to me. It's mine.
[76:49] B: Right, Right. Yes. Amen.
[76:55] A: Got it.
[76:58] B: I bet that was the craziest feeling, just to know it was that easy to just take control of you.
[77:03] A: Well, but it. Yeah, but she didn't know. Nobody knew she was feeling the same way you were like, oh, no, she didn't get the strength in that. She stopped it right by looking at him at this, like, seriously, you're gonna do this thing? Right?
[77:21] B: Probably made him feel bad, like the sicko that he is.
[77:28] A: But she stopped, was done, never happened again.
[77:35] B: And, you know, it's weird. Even with friends of mine or, you know, like, that close friends that I confided in, Even when I sat. Sat down and told my grandmother and was telling her what happened when I moved in with her, it seemed like that thing. It wasn't okay, but it happens to everybody. And I'm not saying it happens to everybody, but nearly everybody that I knew when I kind of told them and I had that emotional moment, it was just like a. Oh, yeah, this such and such happened to me too. And you just get over it. And I could never just get over it. And I'm like, even with my grandmother, when I sat and told my grandmother, I sat down and I spoke to her. She believed me. She cried with me. She helped me. She told me how sorry she was that she couldn't protect me. And then she just went on to tell me a story of how her father did the same thing for her, to her. And that's why she ran away from Virginia and, you know, started her new life here in Florida with. With the. The man that she met and married and etc. Etc. And it just wasn't a. Oh, my goodness, this is. Let's put him in jail. Let's do this, and let's do that. It's just. You know what? This. It happened. Like, it's okay. Like. And I just. I never. I never liked that.
[79:00] A: Yeah. Because you were getting from Grandma that she. She was telling you that it was okay.
[79:04] B: Yes.
[79:05] A: What Grandma was trying to convey to you is that you're gonna be okay even though you had that happen.
[79:10] B: Yes.
[79:11] A: Cause I got to be okay even though I had it happen.
[79:14] B: Yes.
[79:15] A: See, what you thought Grandma was doing was saying that it was okay. Grandma wasn't saying it was okay. She was giving you that story.
[79:25] B: Right.
[79:26] A: Because she wanted you to know that it's not gonna define you.
[79:32] B: Yes.
[79:33] A: That you get to be okay even though that wasn't. That you get to move on. And, yeah, it's a sucky thing that happens in life, but there was so less exposure to what a problem it is then. I mean, even till more recently, it's been the. You know, when the person who has it happen to them comes forward, they're the one that is shunned. Yes, right.
[80:05] B: Yes.
[80:06] A: Notoriously, people go, oh, well, you know, you were a provocative dresser, so. Oh, right. So because I show cleavage, it means I want to get raped. Cool. Yeah. Okay, I got it. So because you see a little bit of this, I have to get anally. What the. Huh?
[80:25] B: Now I have to dress like a nun every day.
[80:27] A: Right, Exactly.
[80:28] B: That's the way our society feels nowadays.
[80:31] A: But that's actually changing with what's happened with the people in California, Hollywood, all sorts of stuff. Things are getting more exposed that it's not okay. Right? Yeah. So check it out. What about anger towards dad?
[80:54] B: I don't know. I'm still kind of pissed at him.
[80:58] A: Oh, good. And that feeling travels to what?
[81:03] B: What does it turn into?
[81:05] A: Where does the feeling go? Like, if you were to trace that feeling towards a memory. Yeah. Where does it take you to?
[81:15] B: To be honest, it doesn't immediately take me to him. It takes me to the loneliness I've always felt because of him. My mom didn't have a chance to be around. He had that chance.
[81:28] A: And your mom didn't have a chance?
[81:30] B: Yes.
[81:30] A: What happened to mom?
[81:32] B: She passed away when I was first born. She had toxemia, and as she gave birth to me, fluids flooded her heart. She had a heart attack.
[81:48] A: So really, the anger that you have towards dad, what if it's not because of what he did or didn't do? What if it's because you can conceive of having had a different dad?
[82:06] B: I don't know what that means.
[82:07] A: Well, you can think of having had a dad who was more involved, who was more around, who was more nurturing, who was more there, who was more seemingly interested, who was doing what they said they would do. Like, I'm gonna pick you up. And you knew that he was gonna be there. Not like, oh, fuck, is he coming? I hope you guys don't leave. Right. You in your brain can conceive of having had a dad that was better than the one you got. Right?
[82:44] B: Right.
[82:44] A: But what you haven't been considering is that you could have got a dad who was worse than what you got. You could have got a dad who was really physical with you, who beat you. You could have got a dad who, you know, did sexual shit to you. You could have got a dad who, like, prostituted you out to other men. See, we keep Thinking of like, oh, we could have had that.
[83:07] B: Yeah.
[83:08] A: And then mad that I didn't get that. Right. But we never go to, well, I could have been worse.
[83:13] B: Right.
[83:14] A: Kind of lucky that I only had that to deal with. Right. Because we all get to step up being born in the United States, we all could be born in Syria and that would really suck.
[83:23] B: Right? Exactly.
[83:24] A: At least we're here. We got some chance there. We're walking.
[83:29] B: Right.
[83:30] A: And it's a crapshoot, you roll the dice, you don't know where you're going to go kind of thing. So the other part to it is the emotional part of our brain can only think of doing things that it can actually do. If an animal can't do it, it can't even conceive of doing it. So our intellectual brain, we can conceive of alternative outcomes to stuff that's over.
[83:59] B: Yes.
[84:00] A: So let me give you an example. A year ago, this guy's brother had asked him to go on a motorcycle ride and he didn't go and his brother died. So he's got all this guilt. Now, we would all say that he's feeling the guilt and he's thinking because. Because he should have gone on the ride. Well, what if he's not feeling it because he should have gone on the ride? What if he's feeling it because intellectually he can conceive of having gone on the ride and if he had, his brother might still be alive. That would be better. So because he can think it, his emotional brain goes, oh, well, if you can think it, we can do it. So do it. Go on the motorcycle ride with your brother, quick. But can he do it?
[84:43] B: No.
[84:43] A: See, that's where the error is. See, you can conceive of having had a dad that was more involved and more around and more and more and more you can conceive of that. Right?
[84:55] B: Right.
[84:57] A: So because you can think it, your brain is trying to motivate you to do it.
[85:01] B: Right?
[85:02] A: Right. So get dad to pick you up more frequently when you were seven. Quick. Hurry and go. There's nothing to be done. Done. Say there's nothing to be done. Well, get dad to be more around when you're five.
[85:12] B: There's nothing to be. No. Get dad to be more involved when you're 8. No. Get down to being more involved when you're 12.
[85:18] A: There's nothing to be done because it no longer exists.
[85:21] B: It no longer exists.
[85:22] A: Right. And now as you get that check, what do you know that's happening to the feelings?
[85:27] B: The feelings of Anger have gone away.
[85:29] A: Right.
[85:30] B: They're leaving.
[85:31] A: Right? Right. Because you're better off with them.
[85:34] B: Yes.
[85:35] A: Have you ever heard that saying? It makes me so mad, it makes me sick.
[85:42] B: Yes.
[85:43] A: Did you know that anger retards the healing process? Our body is always in states of maintenance and repair. It's always ongoing. It accelerates when we rest. It's why somebody gets a cold, flu or surgery, we tell them a rest. And it decreases when we're in states of threat. If we're in your car and we're on our way to get the oil changed, we're at the stop sign, the Jiffy Lube is just down the road. Somebody starts shooting at us in your car, you take off, you start racing down the road. You drive right past Jiffy Lube. The oil.
[86:22] B: Right. No screw now my car can keep going.
[86:27] A: It's fine. Right? Got it.
[86:32] B: Yes.
[86:32] A: That's the difference. So you not being angry, the anger was hurting you. Right. And anger is a response to threat that once threat's gone, anger is no longer there. Mama bear's not angry anymore. And see, you're also getting that dad couldn't have been any other way than the way he was.
[87:02] B: Yes.
[87:03] A: And despite having had that dad, you turned out way better than okay.
[87:09] B: Yes.
[87:10] A: You actually might have turned out worse if you had had a better dad. If you had had a dad that coddled and was more involved, you might not have been as motivated.
[87:18] B: Exactly. I tell myself that all the time.
[87:21] A: Yeah. But now as you're telling yourself that, notice how you feel.
[87:24] B: Yes, I feel it now.
[87:26] A: That's right.
[87:26] B: That's the difference between knowing it and feeling it. I always knew that.
[87:31] A: Right, right, right. And now that earlier you is getting that she didn't need dad in order for you to turn out way better than okay. Right? Yeah, that's right.
[87:49] B: That's what pushes me to do so much more. But it's. It feels different because I feel like what I was doing, I always wanted to be better, to feel. But just like you said, try to.
[88:03] A: Prove to yourself that you are. But you couldn't ever prove it because the thing that you were trying to fill was already full.
[88:11] B: Yes.
[88:12] A: The thing that you thought was a hole was already hold.
[88:18] B: Yes.
[88:19] A: So it wasn't working.
[88:21] B: It was never working.
[88:22] A: Right.
[88:23] B: I see that now.
[88:25] A: Yeah. And you feel it differently too.
[88:27] B: Yes.
[88:27] A: Right. Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[88:33] B: Yes.
[88:34] A: So if you think back about any of the stuff that uncle did try to feel bad about.
[88:41] B: I can't.
[88:42] A: Right. Yeah.
[88:44] B: I just hope this feeling Stays like that after I leave here.
[88:48] A: Well, aren't we having it become as resilient as the problem was?
[88:52] B: Right. Yes.
[88:56] A: So you don't believe in Santa Claus anymore?
[88:59] B: No.
[88:59] A: Your kids might a little. Little. Yeah.
[89:03] B: The baby does.
[89:04] A: The baby does. So once you know that Santa is not real, can you go back to believing in Santa?
[89:14] B: No.
[89:15] A: Right. Once your brain gets that it stopped, can it ever think that it's still happening?
[89:21] B: No.
[89:22] A: Right. So you won't be able to get those feelings. And you can try. You can think about it really hard. You can remember the whole thing. You can think about the weird looking at his face. He's going, how does that feel?
[89:37] B: Right.
[89:39] A: What's wrong with you?
[89:45] B: Right.
[89:46] A: Right.
[89:46] B: I can see it vividly.
[89:48] A: Right.
[89:50] B: And even some of that is a blur now.
[89:53] A: It is, isn't it? Right. You're not seeing it even as vividly and it's not even in the same place it used to be.
[89:58] B: Yeah.
[89:59] A: When you would go to look for it.
[90:00] B: Right.
[90:03] A: Right. Because it's not running the same program that's been changed. It's beginning to be more and more outwardly focused so that we're not learning about you. Right. Other than that, you're really strong. Because. That's right.
[90:22] B: Yes.
[90:23] A: You're on the other side of some yucky stuff.
[90:25] B: Yeah.
[90:26] A: And you stopped it.
[90:28] B: Yes.
[90:29] A: Right.
[90:29] B: I stopped.
[90:30] A: You did. Because you're strong. That's right. And you're worth it. Right.
[90:39] B: And I'm worth it.
[90:40] A: Yes, that's right. Right. Because how can you not be good enough for you.
[90:45] B: Right. Thank you.
[90:49] A: Thank you.
[90:50] B: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Jesus.
[90:52] A: Yeah. Right. So if we think about that stuff. That stuff's different. What else do you want our time to do?
[91:03] B: I don't know.
[91:07] A: Notice how different.
[91:08] B: Yucky stuff.
[91:09] A: Right. Any other yucky stuff that we didn't get to. Any yucky stuff. More recent.
[91:14] B: I mean, more work related. Relationship related.
[91:18] A: Well, cool. Let's get that addressed.
[91:20] B: Mainly with work lately.
[91:22] A: Yeah.
[91:23] B: I just been feeling overworked and underappreciated and like, I'm the general manager at the Best Western 64.
[91:32] A: Yeah.
[91:32] B: And I guess let's put it with me going to school. I'm usually a. It's not honor roll when you're in college. Is dean's list. I usually make the dean's list, but I'm terrible at math. I hate math. I failed math twice. And it ties back into work. I get to work and I just feel like I got this promotion because I'm a hard worker. I'M good. I'm a people's person. I'm great at everything else. But when it comes to those numbers, making sure invoices are correct, making sure I'm competing with this is our competition, and making sure that our numbers are matching our comp set. And my mind completely shuts down around those things. And I see our hotel failing because of those things, and I'm not getting that. I express to the owners that I need help, and they're like, oh, you can do it. It'll be okay. Just put your mind to it and it'll be fine. And when I can't do it, I'm in trouble. But I told you I needed help. I need some assistance. I need somebody to sit down with me and walk me through these steps. And I feel like I don't have the support I need from them or the backing to succeed. And I also don't want to step down from that position because it feels like this position is all I have. From what my family and friends look at me, they say, oh, you did good. I worked from housekeeping. I've been there for five years. I started off in housekeeping and became.
[93:09] A: A general manager in five years.
[93:11] B: In five years, right?
[93:12] A: In five years. That's a long time, really, to go from housekeeping to general manager. Yes, in five short years.
[93:21] B: It feels like forever. You live it day by day.
[93:25] A: Five years. Five years to get from there to there. Wow, that took so long.
[93:38] B: And it's like, they put me up here. They're like, oh, my goodness, you did something no one ever did, and you're successful.
[93:44] A: First of all, I want you to check. Do you feel like your job is all you have right now?
[93:50] B: Yes.
[93:51] A: Really? Just check.
[93:54] B: I mean, I have my kids.
[93:56] A: See, like you.
[93:59] B: Yes, I have me.
[94:03] A: Well, check it out. How do you feel about you right now? You aren't you. So is your job the only thing about you?
[94:14] B: No.
[94:14] A: Right. And if you weren't working that job and you were different doing a different job, people would be like, oh, doing. Oh, my goodness, she's not as cool.
[94:21] B: As we thought she was. No, I don't think they would do that. I did. Yeah, I do think, how about now? No, I don't care if they did.
[94:37] A: Right. See, isn't that the difference?
[94:40] B: But then it's like, I want to do something that makes me feel as useful. How can I go from being a general manager and go from either dropping down my position back to a regular front desk agent or. Or going to a Burger King somewhere because I mean, those are the places I started before I came into hospitality. How can I just. How do I drop? I don't know where else to go.
[95:09] A: I feel like you wouldn't want to go up.
[95:12] B: But how can I go up if I can't even.
[95:15] A: You go from being the general manager at that to a other role in a larger, different place.
[95:24] B: Right. And every time I think of it that way, I'm like, if I can't manage the 60 well.
[95:32] A: But it isn't that you can't manage. Aren't you managing it?
[95:36] B: Yes.
[95:37] A: There's some things that you haven't been properly trained in. Yes, exactly Right.
[95:46] B: And I need that help.
[95:48] A: Well, you need more training.
[95:50] B: Yes, you're right.
[95:52] A: Right. You don't need help. We don't know whether you need additional staff people.
[96:01] B: Right.
[96:02] A: What we do know is that you need some additional training so that you can be better at it.
[96:07] B: Yes.
[96:08] A: And you know what the people have learned about you. You know that in five short years, you get housekeeping to general manager. They know that you're somebody that's committed to doing a really good job.
[96:23] B: Yes.
[96:24] A: And instead of telling them that you need help, you want to let them know that I need some more training in this. Because this part doesn't. I don't quite have a handle on this. And I really want to.
[96:36] B: Yes. And they put me into some computer trainings, but I'm not that type of learner. I need for you to come.
[96:45] A: Right.
[96:45] B: You know, you've had years in the industry. You come show me how do you compare your comp set? You come show me where ADR needs to be this year compared to last year, those big things. See, I feel like they promoted me because I was always flexible. I worked from housekeeping to breakfast attendant. I could work the front desk. I'm good with the guests. I work whatever shift you put me on. I can work it. I can do it. But the back end, behind that office, I didn't know how hard it was to manage that end of it. I'm a people's person. I could talk you off the bridge. I can't talk myself to my own life, but I feel like I could talk you off a bridge. But when it comes back to getting on this computer and looking at those numbers and making sure things add up from the previous year and organization and all that type of crap, I feel like I'm not. I want to say I'm not fit for the position.
[97:48] A: Okay. So what would happen if that crap there lowered and you saw that Crap. From your spot down here.
[97:59] B: I can manage it.
[98:01] A: Right, you can. Right.
[98:03] B: Handle it.
[98:04] A: So you said two things to me. I've been feeling like I'm overworked and underappreciated. Right. You then told me where it was up above you. So it's felt like it's been over your head.
[98:18] B: Yes.
[98:18] A: Right. And I said, what happens if we bring it back down here and you see it from your perspective down there? What'd you say?
[98:27] B: I could do it.
[98:28] A: You can, can't you?
[98:29] B: Yes.
[98:29] A: Right. You didn't know that it wasn't. That it's been in the wrong location.
[98:34] B: Yes.
[98:35] A: Right, right, right, right. So as you step up, we want to see that down there.
[98:43] B: Yes.
[98:44] A: Because then you're going to be able to see the bigger picture. And then you understand why I need to do this and that how this matches that. If I'm at a narrow lens and it's closed or it's up above, I don't have the same perspective as if I get up above it and lay it out and I can see it. Right. Distance.
[99:05] B: Right, Right. Yes.
[99:08] A: Right. So as you think about the work and where the numbers are and where projections need to be, but as you see that all down there, how does your body feel now?
[99:21] B: Like I can conquer it.
[99:23] A: That's right.
[99:24] B: If I'm looking at it from down here and I'm seeing the paperwork that much.
[99:31] A: That's right.
[99:33] B: I just.
[99:34] A: And see not just the paperwork, but see what else ties into why we do the paperwork.
[99:41] B: Yes, yes.
[99:41] A: So that you can see how the parts connect. That's the challenge that you were having when it was up above is being able to see how those parts connect. I don't get how this fits with that.
[99:55] B: Right.
[99:55] A: So, like, I need somebody to show me how these things fit. But as it already lowers down, you have a whole different vantage point as you're seeing it.
[100:04] B: Yes.
[100:04] A: And you can see more than just the paperwork. Right.
[100:11] B: Like, another issue that I have with it is I'm trying to separate myself from being the front office manager to now the general manager, or pretty much just your co worker to your employer. And a lot of people that have been there years before me and are a lot older than me, they're not happy with the decision. But my owners have built a relationship and a kind of bond with them because they have been there for so long. They don't want to remove them or let them go. But I feel like it's a certain level of respect that they don't show me some. Some People feel like they have grandchildren my age. You can't. Little girl, you can't tell me anything. When I've been in this industry for 15, 20 years, what can you show me or tell me? And I feel like my owners aren't putting them in the.
[101:11] A: First of all, let's. Let's think about that right now, and let's think of somebody that you might interact with that kind of. Has that kind of an attitude towards you where you can't possibly teach or tell me anything that I don't already know. I've been around the block more times than you've been. Whatever. Right, so you got that kind of person.
[101:36] B: Yes.
[101:36] A: Right. Good. When you're interacting with them, how do you want to be? Because we know how it's been frustrating and, like, feel like I can't. So how do you actually want to be interacting with them?
[101:50] B: I want them to actually listen.
[101:52] A: No, how do you want to be? Oh, knowing how they are.
[101:56] B: Yes.
[101:57] A: How do you want them to be?
[102:00] B: I don't even want to have to worry about, to be honest. I don't want to deal with that issue anymore. I don't even want to have to.
[102:07] A: Well, is there anything that there is for you to do?
[102:13] B: I mean, I technically can't fire him. No, I can. I have the authority to do so, but not when my owner has a bond with him.
[102:24] A: That's.
[102:26] B: That's different. He's been there longer than I have. He just wants me to overlook him. But I don't know what else to do at.
[102:33] A: So does this guy that's the employee, get whatever he needs to get done? Done?
[102:39] B: Not since I've been promoted.
[102:42] A: Oh. He's not doing his work.
[102:44] B: I mean, he's doing the bare minimum. He's doing enough for us to. So that we can't say that you're not. But at the. In the. In hospitality, it's not about doing what you're supposed to do. It's about going above and be. Because it's not just check in, check out. You're not just a front desk agent, your customer service representative. You want to make sure everything that the guest needs, they get. And I mean, he won't go that extra mile anymore. He won't do. And he won't do it. Maybe because all of his feelings aren't towards me. It's because he felt like he should have the position that I have. Sometimes I feel like he should have had the position that I have. But he has some boundaries and some things going on. He's still just a front desk agent.
[103:32] A: Okay, so he's been there a long time.
[103:35] B: Yes.
[103:36] A: And he knows the systems.
[103:38] B: Yes.
[103:39] A: So he's just not being the above and beyond, which is what we want in somebody in hospitality.
[103:47] B: Yes. And he knows. He knows better. He has been doing, you know, above and beyond and helping and, you know, being helpful, but now it's just check in, check out. And it's only been like that since I've got the promotion. And they're like, oh, he'll come around. Give him. And it's almost been a year now since I've been the general manager, and he still hasn't came around. And it's. It's getting worse. It frustrates me on top of what I already feel like I can't do or what I'm already frustrated with behind, you know, in the office. To have my staff, you know, not really responding to me the way I think they should makes it worse.
[104:31] A: So are there things that you're asking him to do that he's not doing?
[104:36] B: Again, it's hard to say. He does what he's supposed to do do as far as checking guests in, but we'll get guest reviews to where they ask him to do something simple as bring a remote. And he'll say, we don't have any more. And. Or they'll say, hey, we need fresh towels. Oh, we don't have any clean towels. And they'll write reviews. Well, this is a hotel. How do you not have clean towels? And this is always on his ship. It's just reoccurring things.
[105:11] A: Do you have that information?
[105:12] B: Yes.
[105:15] A: How often do you have conversations with the owners?
[105:21] B: I have one owner. They're like part owners. So I have one of the owners that works with me on pretty much every day. And then the actual big owner, I don't really talk to him as often. He's always flying. He's the one who make the head. He makes the main decisions. He put in the most money, and I'd hardly see him. If I have anything to say, I have to go through Harry that's with me day in and day out. Harry is the one who pretty much built the relationship and bond with Andy that I'm having the issues with. And he's kind of overlooking some things and ignoring it and saying he's gonna talk to him or he wants me to talk to him about doing. Doing a better job. And it's just not been working right.
[106:04] A: So what we need to do is sit down with you and Harry and him.
[106:11] B: Yes. And Andy or the Omen, I don't.
[106:14] A: Know whether the bigger owner will be there.
[106:16] B: Oh, no, he wouldn't.
[106:17] A: But you want to sit down with the people who are involved and be like, okay, this has been a year. We had a grace period. You used to be a really great employee, and you used to do this. I don't know whether it's because you're feeling. Got hurt and you wanted this, like, but something's got to get exposed here.
[106:31] B: Right.
[106:32] A: Because we need you to be back to be a really good employee again.
[106:34] B: Yes.
[106:35] A: You're not doing that now. And these reviews, these things that we're getting that are happening on your times that you're here, that's not okay. That's not like having people feel really taken care of.
[106:50] B: Right.
[106:51] A: Which we're in the hospitality business, which is all about having people feel taken care of.
[106:57] B: Exactly.
[106:58] A: That was my first. Well, second. Well, no, always in service. But I worked as a bellman for a really long time.
[107:04] B: Oh, okay. What kind of hotel?
[107:06] A: It was a hotel in upstate New York.
[107:09] B: Oh, okay.
[107:09] A: It was a nice, ritzy place. Yeah.
[107:14] B: When you said bellman, I knew there's not many bellmen in these kind of hotels.
[107:19] A: No, not in these. Right? Yeah. But if you go down to New Naples and you're at the Ritz.
[107:23] B: Oh, yeah.
[107:24] A: There's 15. Not only that, there's a guy that's outside that takes the car. You gotta tip that guy. Then there's a guy inside that takes the luggage.
[107:37] B: I'd rather go to one of these. Gratuity on everything.
[107:43] A: My goodness. We always say to ourselves, okay, so you stay at a regular Marriott, and you got to pay for Internet. You got to pay for food, you got to pay for. You stay at a residence inn, you stay at a court, you stay at other ones. Oh, food is included. That's included. And Internet's included. It's like, oh, the more expensive restaurant, the more expensive the hotel is, the less stuff is included. How does that work exactly?
[108:04] B: And that's what I don't get about the Best Western. It's like, we're deep. We're very competitive. Well, we're not as compatible because our rates are lower than everything surrounding us. Yeah, we're way better than the Motel 6. We offer the breakfast. We're not, you know, a pretty big hotel, but it's like our guest scores, we keep getting beat up on them. And I feel like I used to be the front face. I used to be the face of the hotel. I was, you know, working in breakfast and housekeeping. And when I was the front office main manager, you know, I handled all the guest complaints. But now my hands are so tied in the back of the office, my staff don't give the guests that hundred percent that I used to give. And then we have high turnover. So some of the people that I used to work with together, that we put a team together with, they're not there before, you know, they left before we made the new changes.
[109:03] A: Right.
[109:05] B: And it's like the hiring pool in this area sucks. No one really wants to work. Everyone comes just to get a paycheck, which is understandable, but everyone feels like a front desk job, an office job. You just sit behind the desk and they'll surf the net and you check in and check out and they don't believe in check in rooms. They don't, they complain about money, but they don't want to help work extra shifts. So not only am I frustrated in the back office, but I'm covering shifts. Call offs. I get calls 6, 7 o'clock in the morning or 5 or 30 in the morning saying, hey, we don't have these items for breakfast. So not only do I have to get my children up and ready for school, I have to run to the hotel or run to Walmart, grab milk or grab eggs. When these are things that our breakfast attendant could have said the day before that we need it or you know, they're responsible for putting those. I don't, I just don't have the help. I feel like I'm doing everything on my own and I just want to give up. It's hard. And they're so used to me being able to handle so many different things on my own or direct so many.
[110:17] A: Different things that would be part of. We want to be able to do some training and development.
[110:25] B: Yes.
[110:26] A: With staff. This is what our expectations are.
[110:31] B: Right.
[110:32] A: So it's easiest when you get new people to train new people up to the expectations.
[110:37] B: Right.
[110:38] A: It's harder if you have old people to retrain them.
[110:42] B: Exactly, exactly right. Because it has not been working.
[110:46] A: But what we. So part of that has to come from you and the other guy, Harry, having a conversation and setting up. Here's how we want things to be. Here's what you're going to check. Because the difference is when you are at different levels because of your ability, you could do it all. You've taken on a bigger piece, which means some of it needs to get filtered out. Maybe some of like the number stuff that isn't your forte gets Taken up by the other guy. If that's something more of his interest, the other front desk guy, then he can be doing some of that or whoever else can be involved in that.
[111:31] B: Right. I think Harry needs to step up and do the numbers portion.
[111:36] A: See if Harry would do the numbers portion where. See if we really think about it, your best qualities in what you do are being underutilized given the other things there are for you to do.
[111:55] B: Yes.
[111:55] A: So in sitting down and having a conversation with Harry, I'd like to propose a shifting a few things in particular. As we're coming into season and knowing that there's going to be a lot more people and a lot more guests, I'm wondering what it would be like if you took on these pieces of it, which would allow me to be able to do more of this stuff and get that, get the systems in place. Right. The reason that a place like McDonald's which is a. Each McDonald's is a, you know, multi million dollar a year business run by 19 year olds.
[112:28] B: Right.
[112:30] A: It is because everything is pre programmed. The where the pickles go, how much ketchup comes out to how long the fries cook for, to what's in the soda. To push this button. This button. This button. Here's what you give back. I mean you don't even have to figure anything out. It's all Michael and I have to think about it. Right.
[112:49] B: And it's still error.
[112:52] A: But those turnkey, what you want to put in is the system. So see, you already know. Hey, it would be useful the night before or after breakfast is over. Let's go through inventory of what we have, know who's coming in as guests and where we are and what we need to have so that we can have it.
[113:11] B: Right.
[113:11] A: Right. Those are the systems that you want to put in place because you do have turnover because you do have different things. The systems are what enable turnover to happen. And the system still work?
[113:24] B: Yes, yes.
[113:25] A: Right. So you can start engineering because you already know them. Right. And best systems to put in place in training as Harry takes over some of the parts that you're not as good at. And if you think about it in that way and having that conversation with him, how does that feel?
[113:47] B: It feels a lot better.
[113:48] A: Yeah.
[113:49] B: Before I just. I always felt as if I would pretty much be telling him I can't handle my job. No, I didn't want to tell him that I can't handle.
[113:58] A: See, it's not that you can't handle your job, it's that you're The. The. What you're best at and how you can best help the business be a sound, growing, better business is by having more flexibility to those things and therefore him taking that part on which he might have a natural inclination or be better at anyway, that would be useful. I still want to know. So I like to know what our numbers are in our business. I've got what I'm doing. I've got eight therapists that are seeing people, and I want to know where we are.
[114:37] B: Right.
[114:38] A: I don't want to calculate it. I want to do math. I want somebody to show me what I need to look at. Where are we compared to where we were? Okay. How's this going? How about number of clients? Okay, great. I don't know how to calculate that myself. I don't want to be adding that up. Okay. So this person saw. No, I want somebody to show it to me. I still like to be involved. I like to know where our numbers are. My wife writes our. Pays the credit card bill. I still like to have an idea of what we bought.
[115:13] B: Yes. You don't want to pay it, though.
[115:16] A: I'm not the one. No, she'll do it because that's part of how we've got it set up. She's got more time. You know, I can't, like, multitask. Hey, by the way, I know you were talking about let me go ahead.
[115:27] B: Right. That's how I feel like I am. I can't really multitask.
[115:32] A: We're not best of multitasking. We're best at single task to completion to the next. Single task to completion.
[115:38] B: Yes.
[115:39] A: Right.
[115:40] B: And when I jump from task to task. Okay, well, let me handle this and then I'll come back to that. And then you ask me a question. I get to that. Two days went by and I've never completed that first task I started. And three weeks later it's due and you still haven't done it. And I'm like, shit. I. I was working on it. I got to page two and someone called me. I got distracted. I don't know what to do.
[116:03] A: Yeah.
[116:04] B: And then on top of that, I'm going to school, so.
[116:07] A: Right. It's just. So the idea with Harry isn't to say I'm not capable. I can't handle it. You know what, Harry? I've been looking at stuff and I've got some ideas about how we can improve. I think I can be really good at putting the systems we need in place and training the staff so that they're doing it so that I'm managing instead of constantly doing.
[116:32] B: Yes, yes, right.
[116:34] A: It was really hard when I first transitioned to give over my schedule to the office staff.
[116:40] B: Really?
[116:41] A: Oh, my goodness. It was because, like, they're like my. Like, I talked. Like, they're talking to people before me.
[116:48] B: Like, what if you mess up something?
[116:51] A: And then I'd let it go. I had a hard time, like, going, oh, so this person really wanted to see me, but I'm gonna have them see. But what if they don't do what I would do and give that up? But I have to manage it now. I used to call every single person. Well, I don't call everybody now. They might talk to the person and go, oh, you know what? This therapist that we have does really good with this. And they might go, we're scheduled. They still let me know, hey, this person called. We scheduled them with this. If that's all right. You still get to say no, I think it'd be better with great, awesome, click. I'm done with that.
[117:23] B: Right, right.
[117:24] A: Because now I've got things in place so that I don't have to do all of it.
[117:28] B: Yes.
[117:29] A: It's just running.
[117:30] B: Yes.
[117:31] A: What you're wanting and why you want Harry to take over that part is that you want to be able to put in better systems so that even if you're not there.
[117:38] B: Yes.
[117:39] A: The systems work. And now being in this role for about a year, I've got a really good idea from this vantage point, seeing how we could really improve as an overall hotel. Right, right. And that would require this. So, you know, you taking on that part of it.
[118:00] B: Exactly.
[118:01] A: Right, right. And people are interested in people coming up with innovative ideas to get stuff better. And you already have a lot of, like, deposits in the bank that you're really good and that you're dedicated. Right. So you've got a lot of deposits. That's the difference. The front desk guy who had the relationship also had a lot of deposits. That's what's enabled him to be able to get away with what he's doing for this long.
[118:35] B: Yes.
[118:36] A: But he hasn't been putting any more deposits in.
[118:39] B: Yes.
[118:40] A: So it pretty soon runs the bank dry. Right?
[118:44] B: Yes.
[118:45] A: Got it.
[118:45] B: I can't wait.
[118:55] A: That would be the way to phrase that, because. Not that you can't handle it. You still want to know, you still want to be involved. Okay, so we had x many check ins last year, year at this time versus what we've got, you know, on the books for this year.
[119:09] B: Right.
[119:09] A: You know, where are our Numbers, what are, you know, where we rate wise. Because that always changes at hotels, right?
[119:15] B: Always.
[119:17] A: Saturday's got to be more expensive than Friday and Tuesday. Shit, man.
[119:24] B: And even when you say that about the numbers, it's like you being in, I don't want to call it social work or therapy. I don't know what it is you do. Then whatever it is you do, you still have to deal with numbers, you still have to deal with systems. And that's what I, that's how I'll say it, you still have to do is deal with systems and managing things and.
[119:46] A: But you know what? I can tell you this. I do have to deal with systems and we put in systems so that I don't have to do.
[119:52] B: Yes.
[119:53] A: My wife asked me one time because we talked about, you know, growing, because we have grown from. I started off by myself in a one room office in an executive suites in 2006, and then in 2008 we bought here and we had enough furniture for two rooms. And then we've kind of grown along the way and now we have this office in two rooms in the office behind us. So I mean, we're doing different things. And she goes, well, do you feel like you're busier now? And I go, no, I'm not busier now. I do different things now.
[120:23] B: Right.
[120:24] A: I'm not less busy. I mean, I still do stuff. But when it was myself, me, myself and I, I was calling people, scheduling people, doing the sessions, I was charging people, I was depositing money, I was, I was doing everything.
[120:42] B: Yes.
[120:43] A: Well, now I don't do everything. It's already done. People, people have already called, reminders already sent, they're automatic. They go out, the staff does all the fees and charging, they take care of that, they do all the scheduling, rescheduling, people have to call. There are times that I've been in an office and I'm doing a session for a few hours and somebody's called, they needed to cancel and somebody else called and they needed to get in and it's already been changed. I have to touch it.
[121:08] B: And you're like, wow.
[121:12] A: Right? But I do like to have an idea. But I can also tell you that I know by feel how the business is doing. I can kind of guess by feel where we are, where our monthly numbers are, by feel. Because every call that comes in passes through me.
[121:37] B: Yes.
[121:39] A: So even if I didn't have to do anything with the call other than person called, this is what they had. We've scheduled them with so and so I still have a sense as to what's going on.
[121:50] B: Yes.
[121:51] A: So because of that, I kind of have an idea ballpark of where we will be number wise, just in my own intuitive. And that gives me, and I go by that feel more, but I like to look just to confirm.
[122:06] B: Right, right. Is that just because you've been doing.
[122:09] A: It so long and it's different? I think part of it's because I've been doing it so long, part of it's because I get it and it's touched me. So I kind of have a sense and I also have the belief that, you know, when you're in a profession that's about dealing with, you know, health related stuff and you want to get people emotionally better, you're not doing it for money that comes with it. Sure. But that's not like I don't go into a session going, oh yeah, I can't make, wait to make a lot of money off of the best people. Oh yeah, right. It's because there's an interest in making a difference. So for me, that's where I want my therapist to be, is to be coming from the position that we're there to make a difference.
[122:57] B: Right.
[122:59] A: And that we're worth it.
[123:00] B: Yes. Because I am worth it.
[123:02] A: Yes, you are. That's right. That's right. And they know that there or they wouldn't have promoted you in five years.
[123:09] B: Yes.
[123:10] A: Right.
[123:11] B: And it just, even with that, it feels like I can't even say that I don't feel whole anymore because I do say it. I don't know, I guess I was saying that I didn't feel, feel complete because I wasn't really happy at work and I don't, I guess I'm. I'm realizing now I'm not happy because I just need the more, more training and if I knew what I was doing, got a system together, it could pretty much run itself. But I was also just feeling like it wasn't what, maybe it wasn't what I was called to do. I want to work with people, people that went through the same thing as me and what I'm going to school for, like I'm working pretty much, I guess a business degree is what that would have been as a general manager and I'm going to school for criminal justice. Going to school because I want to work with delinquent youth that, you know, teens that had a disruptive past or you know, just younger people that been through the same things I was going through as, as I was younger and be able to help those kind of people. And I feel like I'm not doing that there. And I didn't feel whole, but again, I can't even say it now because I don't have that empty spot that I felt again, so.
[124:24] A: Right. I guess I can't see. You can do all of that stuff that you want to be doing to be of assistance to kids on the.
[124:33] B: Side, and that's what everyone.
[124:35] A: You can see there's a potential with what you're doing and what you already do to move and go to other places that are bigger, that will have a higher salary, that. You know, Bill Gates spent a lot of time in his career doing all this stuff with Microsoft and making a ton of money and providing for a lot of people, computer systems, all sorts of stuff. Microsoft was amazing at all of that. But now the guy's worth, you know, $8 billion, which I still can't grasp, like the numbers until somebody told me this. So if we take. A million seconds is equal to 11 days.
[125:17] B: A million seconds?
[125:18] A: Yeah. A billion seconds is equal to 32 years.
[125:24] B: 32 years.
[125:25] A: Yeah.
[125:26] B: A billion seconds. It's hard when you say it in seconds. It's like.
[125:30] A: Right. A billion seconds is 32 years. A million seconds is a 11 days. They're not even in the same ballpark.
[125:37] B: Yeah.
[125:37] A: Right. But he's got $8 billion, you know, and he wants to get rid of, you know, diseases in Africa.
[125:46] B: Right.
[125:47] A: Right. So he did what he did that generated whatever it generated that has enabled him to do the calling. Right? That's right.
[126:00] B: Yes.
[126:01] A: But see, you couldn't do it along the way all the time.
[126:03] B: Yes.
[126:04] A: He had to do this first.
[126:06] B: Right.
[126:07] A: And then he could do that. Right.
[126:09] B: And that's. At first, it was making me feel like, am I even doing my. The right major? Like, I'm. This would be my last year before I graduate, and I'm like, have I wasted my whole time doing criminal justice when maybe I should switch over to business now that I'm gonna have this general manager under my belt and the.
[126:30] A: Degree is the only thing that matters.
[126:32] B: Yeah.
[126:33] A: See, the degree is what matters, that you have one, not what it's in. Right. Because you already have the skill set.
[126:44] B: Yes.
[126:45] A: And the skill set that you learn in hospitality transfers to anything else. You.
[126:53] B: Yeah.
[126:54] A: My biggest concern is service with my staff. I want them to immediately greet people.
[127:03] B: Me too.
[127:05] A: When they walk in and ask them, you know, if they'd like a glass of water. I want them to be welcoming when they're on the phone. I want Them to be pleasant. I want them to handle things that come up.
[127:19] B: Me, too. Right. That's exactly right. So everything transfers.
[127:24] A: So hospitality transfers, yes. This is still a service industry. I never would have thought in a million years that therapy would be seasonal. But everything in Florida is seasonal. We get busier during season just like every.
[127:44] B: Everybody else, just like the hotel. So this is your busy season. This is peak season.
[127:49] A: Right. It starts right. January into February, March, April, a little bit into May.
[127:54] B: Yeah.
[127:55] A: And then it dies down into June, July. It's like.
[127:58] B: Right.
[127:59] A: The ghost town. Although that's been better now that we've been. The longer that we're here, the more that. That is ongoing for people. But I. I liken it to. I don't like to see. I try to take off the week of Christmas and then a few days, the week of New Year's because everybody's schedule's frantic and I work multiple days. There'd be cancellations all the way through. Right. I like to take off a couple weeks in July because people are on vacation.
[128:28] B: Yes.
[128:29] A: There's all sorts of other stuff happening. My kids are off, so I'd like to hang out with them a little bit.
[128:36] B: Crazy people.
[128:37] A: Yeah. Yeah. Right. So what's the part with relationships?
[128:42] B: I'm terrible at them. No, it feels like.
[128:45] A: Right.
[128:46] B: No, but.
[128:47] A: Well, I mean, you've been picking project guys and settling for, you know. You know, not quite good enough, but, like, okay, yeah, I guess we'll deal with it.
[128:56] B: And again, I'm so happy I can say this. That empty feeling.
[129:01] A: Right.
[129:02] B: I blame that on that empty feeling. On a lot of different things, but that empty feeling, like.
[129:08] A: Right. You thought that you needed a guy with you.
[129:10] B: Yes.
[129:10] A: So that's why, when you got one, you would put up with whatever they did.
[129:14] B: Yes.
[129:15] A: Because you thought, like, well, like, at least I got one.
[129:18] B: Right.
[129:19] A: No matter what.
[129:20] B: Could be worse. I could be alone. But I don't know, it felt like a lot of that other baggage kind of closed the door for me. And I'm like, you know what? Screw all of that. Like, that empty feeling that I had. I'm like, you know what? I can get back into work. And that empty feeling I had, I feel like, you know what? I could let these bad relationships die because it was that empty feeling that made me feel these ways, like I was inadequate at work or that I wasn't enough for this man or.
[129:53] A: Yeah. Try to feel really inadequate at work right now.
[129:56] B: I just can't. And I feel like I just don't feel that empty that empty feeling, that hole in my heart that I felt every day, I don't feel that. So I can't. And it's hard to. For me to even talk to you about anything else that bothers me because that does.
[130:15] A: It don't.
[130:16] B: It doesn't bother me right now. I don't know how I feel when I walk out the door, but right.
[130:20] A: Now it's not bothering.
[130:22] B: It doesn't bother me as much as this at all.
[130:25] A: That's the thing. What you got clear, is you're okay.
[130:30] B: Yes.
[130:31] A: You don't need anybody outside of you to be okay. That you're already full.
[130:37] B: Yes.
[130:37] A: That the sunset is beautiful on its own and it doesn't need anything outside of it to shine.
[130:43] B: Yes.
[130:43] A: And to have the sky become violent. Right. Other things can add to an experience, but they're not needed.
[130:52] B: Right.
[130:52] A: Right. See, it no longer feels like you need something outside of you in order to be okay.
[130:58] B: Yes.
[130:59] A: Right.
[130:59] B: It does.
[131:00] A: Exactly. That's the difference. That's clear. Now, could you. Sure.
[131:07] B: Yeah.
[131:07] A: It might be nice at some point, but it's on your terms.
[131:12] B: Right.
[131:13] A: Because you're worth it. So for a woman, it's always being a little less available than the guy would want. You shouldn't have any problem with that.
[131:21] B: Yeah. Trust me, I'm good with that.
[131:26] A: For a woman, it's always on her terms. For a woman, the question is never. Oh, am I gonna get to see the guy?
[131:33] B: Yeah.
[131:33] A: It's. Am I gonna allow that guy to spend time with me?
[131:36] B: Yeah. And I don't feel like every day. I don't feel like it today.
[131:41] A: Right. But that's the whole thing for you, getting that about you. Because you don't need it. Right. That then changes the picker. It's not out of desperation. It's not out of neediness. Oh, I can't survive or live or be without you. It's not out of that.
[132:02] B: Right.
[132:02] A: Anymore. I don't need it. Could add to it.
[132:07] B: Yeah.
[132:07] A: Unheeded. I'm good. Right. Which has you then be not just attractive to other kinds of guys, attracting a different kind of guy.
[132:24] B: That's what I mean.
[132:25] A: Right. See, you won't find it attractive anymore. The damaged ones, the ones that. Oh, project cool.
[132:33] B: Yeah.
[132:33] A: If this guy were to be more that way and that way and that way, and if we could change those things about him, then he'd be the great guy.
[132:39] B: Yeah.
[132:40] A: Too much of a project. No.
[132:44] B: Seriously, too much work.
[132:47] A: It's not on me. I don't need that project. Right, right, right. And that's what you're getting. Right. So you've got some useful strategies in what to do. Work wise conversations, how what you want to actually create so that they see it. He sees doing that number stuff as an opportunity to have more of what he wants, which is, you know, more often. All the way full hotel.
[133:19] B: Yeah, right, Exactly. Saves money anyway.
[133:23] A: Right. I mean, here's the thing about me. Having more opportunity to do these things actually will make us a more fill and more profitable. More full and more profitable hotel. Right, Right.
[133:39] B: It's definitely. It's a better way to look at it and definitely a way better way to. I'm brainstorming different ways to bring it to him and feel more comfortable having this conversation with him now.
[133:52] A: Right. That's the opportunity that he has.
[133:54] B: That's another one of those people that I felt like I was put on a pedestal and I was scared to say, I don't. I can't.
[134:02] A: Right.
[134:02] B: I need help. Whatever.
[134:05] A: You know, and the thing that you want to remember is that all those people up on pedestals still put their pants on the same way.
[134:12] B: Right.
[134:13] A: And still sit down to shift. So, I mean, you know, one leg at a time.
[134:21] B: Right. Bad mama Jim if he don't.
[134:29] A: Yeah.
[134:30] B: But.
[134:32] A: Right.
[134:34] B: Thank you.
[134:34] A: Yeah, you're welcome.
[134:36] B: If you haven't done anything else, you help me feel complete.
[134:41] A: Yeah. Well, I just had you get like, you know, connected to who you really are.
[134:46] B: Yes.
[134:49] A: And that you get your own worth and you get to feel good about everything you've accomplished. You get to feel really good about all of the things that you've gone through and made it to the other side and feel really good about what you stopped.
[135:05] B: Yeah.
[135:06] A: And how you took a stand for you because you're worth it.
[135:08] B: Yes.
[135:09] A: Right. And how when you put your mind to something, you make it happen. That's right.
[135:16] B: Every time.
[135:17] A: That's right. That's right.
[135:20] B: It just feels so weird. Once I got that gap, this gap.
[135:23] A: Is in alignment with you.
[135:26] B: And once I got that gap filled, I think all the other stuff that I thought was that bad and just. It wasn't even worth. It's not even worth the conversation anymore. It just. It doesn't. That hurt doesn't feel the same. Like, I don't know.
[135:43] A: It doesn't feel the same, does it?
[135:44] B: You put a piece of a puzzle back and I'm just like, oh, okay, it makes sense now.
[135:50] A: That hurt doesn't feel better.
[135:51] B: Not only does it make sense, it feels better. And I feel like I actually am. Okay.
[135:56] A: You Are. Aren't you?
[135:58] B: Yes.
[135:58] A: Yeah.
[135:58] B: And it is a place.
[136:00] A: And you now feel it. Yes, that's right. Fully feeling it now.
[136:06] B: And it's crazy how 1. A couple of traumatic experiences, kind of. It'll throw your whole life out of whack.
[136:16] A: Well, it didn't. It would. It didn't throw your whole life out of whack because you, despite going through that, turned out way better than okay prior to meeting me.
[136:29] B: Yes.
[136:31] A: It's because you turned out way better than okay that you have the freedom to have gotten this stuff cleared because you got out of strictly being in survival mode.
[136:48] B: Yes.
[136:51] A: You're gaining more security in your job with going to school, with getting your own house, with taking steps and actions that are for you. So you've been doing that. You just weren't always feeling the way you wanted. And then perplexed. Why the hell am I attracted to the house?
[137:09] B: Right.
[137:11] A: I know. It's a stupid thing for me to do.
[137:13] B: Right.
[137:14] A: I'm still doing it.
[137:16] B: Great.
[137:17] A: Awesome.
[137:17] B: I don't know. Let's go.
[137:18] A: That'll make me feel even worse because now I know that it's a bad thing for me to be doing, and I'm still doing it. So now I'm gonna be hard on myself about it. Right. So things have lightened up. You're a lot easier on you.
[137:29] B: Right, right.
[137:31] A: Right. And the issue isn't personal with the guy. It's about what you want for your organization, what you want for the hotel, how you want the hotel to be viewed both internally from the staff that work there and externally from the people who are coming to visit.
[137:49] B: Yes.
[137:50] A: Right.
[137:53] B: Yeah. And that's exactly how it is.
[137:55] A: And then you're gonna put in the right structures because you already know how to do all the different roles.
[138:00] B: Yes.
[138:01] A: Right.
[138:02] B: I'm just master one more, and then I have it down. Unpack.
[138:08] A: Right.
[138:11] B: Excuse me.
[138:13] A: Cooling. Good. I know.
[138:17] B: I can tell. I'm glad I did this.
[138:21] A: Yeah.
[138:21] B: You were really good. You told me that. Oh, I. I only need three hours from you, and I'm like, three. You can fix my life in three hours.
[138:35] A: I was not even.
[138:37] B: Right. I'm like. I don't think I even have enough time to tell you all of the chaos I've been through in my life. And you did it. I did. You didn't do anything. I'm sorry.
[138:49] A: We did it.
[138:50] B: We did it.
[138:50] A: Yeah.
[138:51] B: We did it. And I feel I'm happy.
[138:54] A: Yeah.
[138:55] B: And, you know, this is that happiness I thought I was trying to get in relationships.
[139:00] A: Yeah.
[139:00] B: The Happiness I've been trying to get. Get degree after degree. The happiness I've been trying to get after promotion after promotion and child after child, to be honest.
[139:11] A: And it would feel good for a moment.
[139:13] B: Yes.
[139:14] A: But not last.
[139:16] B: And I even felt like a bad mother because I had my children and said, you know what? I just want to have my own. And I could love them and I can give them everything that I didn't have, and they'll love me, and I know they love me, and I would. I won't have to worry about anything else. And it was good. The pregnancy, not so great. But I had her, and it was euphoric. And after a while, it's like, no, I love you.
[139:41] A: Nobody tells us that kids suck and they're really hard, and, yes, we love them, but man, oh, man, oh, man.
[139:51] B: They are a handful. But I wouldn't have it any other way at this point.
[139:55] A: Right.
[139:55] B: But again, they still did not fill that empty hole. And it was there.
[140:01] A: Right. Because the hole was always complete.
[140:05] B: Yes.
[140:06] A: You were always whole. You just kept thinking that there was a hole.
[140:15] B: Thank you.
[140:16] A: Because of the things that were in the way.
[140:18] B: Right, Right.
[140:22] A: And now you get it. Right. Good job. You did great.
[140:29] B: Thank you.
[140:29] A: Absolutely. Yeah. Cool.
[140:33] B: That was an awesome session.
[140:34] A: All right. I'm glad.
[140:36] B: And I'm so glad that you're able to meet with me.
[140:39] A: Yeah. That's a good news so much.
[140:42] B: Thank you.
[140:42] A: My pleasure.
[140:43] B: Thank you.
[140:43] A: Yeah.
[140:45] B: Really awesome.
[140:45] A: Yeah. Well, I knew you're like.
[140:47] B: Yeah.
[140:48] A: From what was going on, that we could definitely.
