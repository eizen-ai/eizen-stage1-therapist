[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 20th of June, Tia. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:17] B: Yes.
[00:17] A: Okay, cool. So thinking about that question, what do we want our time together to be doing for you? Right. If we could really change problematic ways that you've been feeling or reacting or thinking, what do we want to get better? What would be useful for me to know?
[00:39] B: Well, I've just recently been, like, having nightmares.
[00:44] A: Okay.
[00:45] B: Getting triggered by just the smallest things because I've been in my sex trafficking.
[00:50] A: Okay.
[00:51] B: When I was.
[00:51] A: What might be a small thing that you got triggered by that you wouldn't normally think you'd be triggered by?
[00:56] B: Just, like, a red car.
[00:59] A: A red car, huh?
[01:00] B: Yeah.
[01:01] A: Yeah. And that was a. Yeah, a trigger. Got it. Okay. So you're recognizing one, that there's some nighttime activity, unconscious bad dreams, so to speak. But then you're also a lot more on edge and more sensitive to be triggering by things that are similar.
[01:29] B: Yeah.
[01:31] A: And it Causing the reaction.
[01:34] B: Yes.
[01:35] A: Got it. Okay, so we want to turn that way down. Okay, cool. I know how to do that.
[01:42] B: Great.
[01:44] A: What else would be useful for me to know? What else are we wanting to get better?
[01:52] B: Just trying to, like, numb my pain instead of just letting it out.
[01:58] A: I don't know what that means. Like, what do you mean by your pain?
[02:03] B: Like, the past?
[02:05] A: Oh, yeah. There's moments of experiences that have happened.
[02:12] B: Right.
[02:12] A: That still hurt even though they're over.
[02:17] B: Yes.
[02:17] A: Right. And they're not stuck because I buried them. I know. That's what we hear in the world is like, oh, I wasn't able to fully express it when it was happening. And so I buried it, or I put it in the cellar, or I locked it behind the closed doors, or I put it in a. Right. And that we're supposed to help the person get those bad feelings out. Like throwing up, which after throwing up, I do feel a little bit better. I don't really like throwing up because it's, like, gross to do it. But I do feel a little bit better. Problem is, I still get triggered by the same stuff. Got it. So what if you're not troubled by that stuff because it happened? I know that sounds crazy. I'm gonna say it anyway. You're like, what are you talking about? But what if you're troubled now because when it happened, Emotionally, there was a part of your brain that short circuited where that part short circuited was typically at the worst part of the worst part. So that's kind of what replays at that level, Kind of like a short git file replaying the same worst of the worst of the worst. Right. That part where it got stuck, then also got separated, like, disintegrated from the nervous system. So it's living as an island by itself, not knowing that it ever ended, thinking it's always ongoingly happening. Right. We only notice it having that effect on me when I do think about it or something reminds me of it. Right. So it's not troubling because it was. Was awful, bad, wrong, shouldn't have happened. It's troubling you now because there's a part of your brain that never got the good news. It ended. You survived it. You're here now. You're okay. Right. That's the kind of instead of get it out of me. That's the kind of good news we want to get in to the part of the brain that doesn't know certain experiences. We want to do something that's more about unplugging the memory so the brain can emotionally read it as information about something that happened, not reading it as still happening. Does that make sense?
[04:52] B: Yeah.
[04:53] A: Cool. That's something that we want to get done because you've recognized that although you've got distance from it and time from it, that stuff still has an undercurrent that you get sucked up in sometimes. Okay, cool. I know how to get that better too. Cool. What else, Tia? Would be useful for me to know. What else are we wanting to get better?
[05:28] B: Well, I keep looking for, like, a. Like, I don't know how to explain it. Like, I'm always, like, victimizing myself about it.
[05:48] A: Like, how might you go about doing that? What might be something that happens that then you're victimizing yourself about it.
[05:57] B: Like, I'm always saying it's my fault because of what people, like, been telling me.
[06:02] A: Okay.
[06:03] B: Like, my own mom, she's been telling me, like, if I haven't done this, then it would have never happened.
[06:08] A: Oh, okay, so mom has. You blame you.
[06:11] B: Right.
[06:12] A: For the all bad stuff that happened. Cool. Awesome. And then you blame you, too.
[06:18] B: Yeah.
[06:19] A: Okay. And you do that even though a lot of it, you know, wasn't your fault.
[06:25] B: Right.
[06:26] A: Or about you.
[06:28] B: Right. Well, I do kind of feel like it is my fault because, like, if I would never, like, ran away, it would have never happened.
[06:36] A: Right. Because you were thinking back when you were running away that it was going to lead to what happened.
[06:41] B: No, I didn't.
[06:42] A: I know. Right. That's part of the problem. Right. When you ran away, that earlier you. That was the farthest thing from her mind as an even possibility that it was going to go the way that it went. Make sense. She was, I'm getting out of here because here isn't good. Make sense. She wasn't thinking. She was thinking anywhere other than here would be better. She had no thought in her mind that, oh, no, what if somewhere out of here is worse? You follow me with that? And if you and I could float back along the timeline prior to you ever leaving home. Right. How old were you when you did that? Yeah. So if you had known at 14 that by leaving home, it was going to lead to all the stuff that happened. Got it. If you had known that at 14 back then. Right. No. With certainty it was going to do all that, would you have left?
[07:45] B: No.
[07:46] A: Right. Got it. And see, part of what's been going on is that there's been regret and remorse or guilt and shame about having done that. So I've been kind of beating up my younger self for being so stupid. I should have known better. But if we look at it clearly, if you had known everything that you know now, you wouldn't have left. Right. So we actually can't have regret and remorse or guilt and shame about something we didn't know was gonna happen. So we want you to lighten up on the earlier you. So that she realizes that you get it, that she just didn't know it was gonna lead to all the awful stuff that happened. Right. Because she didn't know. She was only thinking, anywhere away from here is better. Got it. Right. And as that's starting to get in Tia, what do you notice happening to the feelings, by the way?
[08:51] B: I can see now.
[08:53] A: You can see now. What do you notice starting to happen to those feelings of, like, you know, guilt or regret?
[09:00] B: Her they're, like, probably gonna go away.
[09:03] A: Notice how they're already lessening. Isn't that cool? Right. And we just started our conversation. Right. Because we want you to be free and present. We want you to add a deeper level, although we're not gonna like the stuff that did happen. Get it. That it couldn't have not happened any other way than the way it went down. Right. So that we are at peace with it. It's, like, done over. And by the way, it doesn't define me because it wasn't ever part of who you are. It was just a bunch of fucked up shit that happened to you. That's not part of who you are. Right, right. And there was other stuff that was going on prior to 14 that led you to even have the mindset of, oh, I'm leaving at 4 when I left. Follow me with that. So that's the stuff that we want shifted so that you're more at peace with things. So that you're more. Okay. So that you see mom's stuff as being about mom, not about me. Right. So that we actually lighten up on you. Just a little big, heavy, hammer me down. Cool. What else would be useful for me to know? What else do we want to get better?
[10:29] B: The intrusive thoughts, just about, like not being good enough.
[10:36] A: Okay. Those thoughts come to mind.
[10:40] B: Yes.
[10:41] A: Is there a particular time where with something that you're doing or they just pop up? Yeah. And when they pop up, what do they do to you?
[10:51] B: They don't make me feel good.
[10:53] A: Oh. Do you notice, like, discomfort in your body as it pops up?
[10:57] B: Yeah, I'm like my hands start hurting.
[11:00] A: Yeah. Okay, so we want to get that to turn down. Right, Right. So that you're more okay in you. Right, right, right. That's what we want is we want you to be more okay in you. Because the mechanism that's causing you to, or at least pointing out those things to you is doing it because it's got a higher positive intention. Right. It's doing it thinking that by pointing it out, it'll prevent you from doing it again. Right. That's what we think punishment does. And we think guilt and shame do and all of that, but it's not actually working because you kind of getting down on you or having doesn't improve performance ever. Right. We don't want the field goal kicker of our favorite team feeling horribly guilty about having missed the easy one at halftime as he's lining up the, you know, 50 yarder. That's a horrible strategy. Right. We don't even want him thinking about having missed that one. We want them totally focused on making this one. Right. Makes sense.
[12:15] B: Yes.
[12:15] A: Yeah. So that's the kind of stuff we want to get that all untangled, unraveled, unwinded, so it's not causing you to feel all boned. Cool. Okay. What else?
[12:44] B: I guess, like insecurity. I mean, it's basically just wrapped around, like, whilst like being told with me was like, what I've been through. So that's like what I've been like.
[13:02] A: How do you know when to feel.
[13:03] B: Insecure when I look at myself.
[13:07] A: Okay. When like you look in the mirror. Yeah.
[13:10] B: Sometimes I feel pretty and sometimes I don't.
[13:13] A: Okay.
[13:13] B: Just. Cuz like I just think about like what happened back then.
[13:19] A: Yeah. You think about the bad stuff that happened. Yeah. And that then has made you feel bad about what your body looks like sometimes. And then you've been thinking that you are your body. So when I say sometimes that I don't like me, it's sometimes that I just don't like what my body looks like. Right. Or I don't like me, it's because I don't like the kinds of thoughts that I'm having or the way that I feel. Right. We get stuck sometimes. T is that we think how we think, feel and act is part of who we are. But see, the thing that's part of who we are isn't changeable. Right. If a girl comes in and she says, I'm five two, my name is Sally and I'm shy. Well, if she thinks about her shyness in the same way she relates to her height, can she change it? No. But is her shyness the same thing as her height? No. It definitely affects how she feels and then thinks and acts, but it's not part of who she is. So it's in the realm of changeable. All the stuff that you've presented in the ways that you've been feeling about you and the triggers that are happening externally and with the stuff that happened, all of that stuff is changeable because none of those ways of feeling, thinking, triggering, reacting, were ever a part of who you are. Got it. So we're changing all of that. We're keeping you. We're just changing the problematic ways that you've been thinking and acting. Got it? Yeah. Cool. Any other stuff that would be useful for me to know?
[15:07] B: I think that's about it.
[15:09] A: Yeah. So I get that sometimes there's like the insecurities around books. Sometimes that's confidence stuff. Sometimes I just don't feel good in me. Right. That's that sometimes I'm like negative and critical and down on me. Sometimes the messages that I got from different people that were in authority around me flood me and make me feel bad. Sometimes there's external things that and I get triggered. Right. There are all sorts of ways that I feel and react to stuff that I don't want to and I'm not choosing. That's what we want to get changed. Got it. So the you that I am seeing when we're done, she's much more emotionally present. She's much more at peace and comfortable in her own skin. The you that I am seeing is free emotionally from the effect that the past stuff has that she knows, she's aware, she can remember, but it's not causing any of that. So we think of her as being much more emotionally present so that her emotions are matching. What's happening? Got it. Right. This is the you that I'm seeing. Make sense. The question isn't how it's going to happen that we get you here. The question is, would it be okay with you? Yeah. So we've got a green light. So a couple things about understanding our brain, right? So think of our brain is like a monster computer. And there are certain things that get programmed in our brain. How certain things get programmed in our brain is that we go through certain experiences. And the more I go through a similar experience, that bigger and more robust that program is in me. Make sense. So we all have some really great programming in us. We have some really great programming that at certain times in my life served me well to make it through it. We also have some programming that wasn't ever useful. Right? We also have some programming that, yes, was useful then, but being all the way on now isn't as useful. So that's part of what we're doing. We're going to change the way your brain has information coded wired so that we change the program. That's the world of neuroplasticity. What we know now by watching FMRI scans is that our brain has the ability to rewire itself. That it's not stuck in one state, that it's constantly able to rewire. That when memories move from the long term stores into the present moment, they're changeable, malleable and adaptable. So that we can rewire how the information got coded. So that once the programming changes, how you automatically interact with your world is going to be different. Right? Because what people tell me is the stuff that used to be triggering to them isn't triggering them. If something does happen, the intensity that it used to go is way less. The frequency in which it used to happen is way less. The duration in which it used to last is way less. So instead of, for them, it being a mountain that they have to overcome to get to the other side, it's a speed bump. They're still annoying. Nobody likes to drive over them. But we're beyond it pretty quick. Makes sense. So that's the you that I'm seeing as she's interacting with her Day to day life. Got it. Then just a couple things of understanding how come emotional wounds don't heal. Right. It's a weird thought, but if I broke my foot when I was 10 years old and I was telling you about it right now, and I'm as emotional as when it happened to me, you're gonna look across at me and go, what is wrong with this guy? His foot is fine. He walks all over. I didn't see a limp. What? Right. But on the flip side, if I tell you about what my uncle did to me when I was 10 and I started to get emotional about it, you'd be like, well, yeah, of course. But why? Why does the physical wound heal and the emotional wound doesn't? And we have the saying that time heals all wounds. How come? Not those? Right. And the reason that those don't heal isn't because they can't, but it's because that part of the brain, emotional part, froze it and doesn't know it's over. Got it. So there's an aspect of the brain that doesn't know the bad experience ended. And even if there's multitudes of them, they're kind of lumped in, and it doesn't know that it's over. Got it. That's the first part that makes me feel bad. Right. Second part, because my brain attaches meanings to experiences. And what we all learn from when we're little, all the way up to like 7, 8, 9, is that you're supposed to be good. And you're supposed to be a good boy or a good girl. Because good things will happen to you when you're being good. Because when you're being good, you get praise and you get hugs and you get candy and you get presents and you get love and you get nurturing. And once a year, some guy you don't know drops gifts off. Right? We live in the world that teaches young children, very impressionable kids that don't know any better lies. Life's good. And when you're good, good things happen, which is great. If the child has a nothing but good life, and that's the funny story, because nobody has a nothing but good life, right? And the error isn't the first lie. Life is good. Good things happen. When I'm good, it's that the second lie must be true. If it's bad, it's my fault. If it's bad, it's because I did something wrong. If it's bad, it's because I should have known better. Right? If it's bad. It's about me. So the little kid draws a picture on the wall. Mommy sees it, shrieks, grabs the kid, wanks him on the hiney. No, no. Bad boy. Little kid's nervous system learned I did something I wasn't supposed to do. Something bad happened to me. Mommy's mad. Bad things happen when you're bad. So now I learned that. But I get a little bit older. Dad used to be in the house, now dad's gone. Well, I don't look at it that it's a mom and dad issue or maybe I just got a deadbeat dad. I look at it that if I was more lovable, I would have a dad. So again, it goes back to my lovability. Then of course, you know, I'm out and you know, I go out on a date with this guy who seemed to be nice. I had no idea that he put something in my drink. And of course, you know, he winds up, you know, assaulting me. Of course I'm blaming myself because I did wear the skirt and I did show a little bit of cleavage and we kind of flirted and I did kiss him because I liked him. But I certainly didn't think it was going to do that. But you know, totally my fault because I must have let him out, right? No, Right. But see, because it's bad, it's my fault. Does that make sense? So with all the negative stuff, what gets layered into it is, oh well, it means something about my worth, whether I'm good enough. And then the third thing happens. Once those two things are locked, this is what you experience. My brain is going to scan and sort and search and look for anything that's even smaller similarity to what I went through that was painful. Even if the similar thing wasn't part of the problem. Right. The color of the car we know is not the issue. Whoever was in it and what happened, that's the thing that's troubling. Got it. But because they happened at the same time, it stuck together. Right. The brain hasn't distinguished. Similar is read as identical. Right. Reminders are confused as oh, it's the thing makes sense. Because the brain is hyper vigilant and super sensitive, it still thinks it's happening. So it thinks it's at war still like gotta survive. Right. So what we want to do is we want once that happens. Right. So that's why the soldier dies on the ground when the firework bursts. Even though he was the guy that lit the firework at a fourth of July party. What the right Weird. Where the guy's making out with the gal. He's totally into her, she's into him. She touches his inner thigh and he does this and he's like, what is wrong with me? The girl who I'm into is touching me in a way that should have felt good. Yeah, but is there any similarity to what uncle did do when he was 10? Yeah, it's a hand on his inner thigh. Yeah, but that was a dainty female hand with pretty nails. Grubby man hand. Doesn't matter. Right. So with all that stuff active, the brain is constantly confusing similar as identical. So when we unplug the memory and what you already know, a lot of times you start to feel it inside, the brain stops confusing similar as same. Got it. Instead of I'm in a constant alert mode, but through a very narrowed lens because that's why I got a constant feed. Keep looking to see everything. Because it's a very small lens, it's an open lens so that I can see more space and have more distance. Make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Any questions about what I've talked about so far? Yeah. Yeah. So how we unplug trauma is actually a simple process. It requires only one thing from you. And the one thing is to intend to emotionally be with me. And the reason that you want to intend to emotionally be with me is that this is the thing that is actually happening. I'm a happening dude. You're happening right now. We're happening. And that stuff isn't. Got it. Two, we're working on the mutual worthwhile goal. This future you. Right. Three, hoping being in this conversation is at least a little more enjoyable than some of the awful moments in your life. Got it. So we're not going to set the bar very high, but I'm hoping I can manage that. Right, then, before we ever deal with stuff, we're going to get your body to be more at a state of rest. And we want your body to be at a state of rest. Because when your body's at a state of rest, that's what accelerates healing on the inside. It's why when somebody's got the flu or if they've got a cold or after surgery, we tell them to all do the same thing. Rest. Because it enables the body to do more internal healing. Right. And the last little part is it's not going to require much effort on your part to heal this. Right. Most therapy or even addiction stuff all is about requiring a lot of work on your part. Right. You're with you. You Got to keep yourself clean, right? Lots of stuff requires work and effort. This is an internal change. So when an internal change happens, it doesn't require work. It's like when a cut heals from the inside out. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to encourage it. Come on, baby, come on. Right? Like it just does it on its own. That's the same kind of healing. And when you get certain things, it's going to change it in such a way that it becomes embodied. And an experience of what kind of change happened that became embodied in somebody is when they went from not having balance on a bicycle to getting balance right? And once you got balance, you've got it right. You don't lose it. You can go 5, 10 years without riding a bicycle. Hop on and start now. You might be a little. But you got balance. Make sense. So that's what's going to start changing inside. Got it? And then the last little part, because I want to do a whole education component of Right. As we get your body into a state of rest, we also want to begin to understand a way of thinking about our bodies and who we really are, right? Because there's lots of people who've had different things happen to their bodies. And too often when people have had different things happen to their bodies, they all go, well, it happened to me because we all walk around going, I am this body, right? It's me, right? But weird question or weird thought to you is, what if you're not this body? What if this body is totally yours, but it's not you? And I say that because when my mom was young, she lost the tip of her finger in a snow cone machine accident. And when she visits people now, they don't say to her, hey, Susie, I'm glad almost all of you could show up. So she's all there, even if part of her body's not. So you have a body. Your body's totally yours. But what if it's not you? Which is a weird thought to have. I know, but we'll hold on to that one for a moment. Okay, so if you're not your body, then maybe you're your thoughts. Except what if you're not actually your thoughts? What if you're not even the thinker of those thoughts? Your brain is. And your brain is an organ, just like your heart and your lungs, they're yours. They're not you. Okay, so now we got not my body, not my thoughts. Maybe you're how you feel, except you feel different ways at different times. So you're not absolutely a feeling. Oh, well, then maybe you're what you do, but you've done different things at different times, and you didn't stop existing. Weird, right? So here's the question. If you're not what you do, and if you're not your thoughts and if you're not your feelings, and if you're not your body, what are you? Weird question. Right. So just for today, think of the time when you were outdoors in nature and you see something and it's beautiful. So, like, as you're looking at it, you're, like, captured in the beauty, and you're like, wow, what is it that you see?
[29:50] B: The sky.
[29:51] A: Yeah. What's it looking like?
[29:55] B: Orange. Beautiful sunset coming up.
[29:59] A: Yeah. As you see the sunset coming up and the orange in the sky, there's a moment that as you're seeing that, you're experiencing that sense of awe, wonder, peace, excitement. And some people might say to you, Tia, that of course, being there and experiencing that is going to give you those kinds of feelings. But if we looked at it a different way, we could say that seeing that and being there drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited? Kind of like if I'm cold and we're outside and there's a campfire, and I bring my hands towards the flames and I say, holy cow, this fire is getting hotter. Is the fire getting hotter? I'm becoming more aware of the heat. So in your life, we know that there have been lots of times where awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Times where there's been hurt and stress and anger and grief and guilt and shame and pain. But no matter where awareness has been, what if always at your center, you're peaceful and excited? Kind of like, you know, two of us are here. How do you know it? You look around. Your senses bring in data. Intellect organizes it. We call that knowledge. Sometimes people call it light of knowledge. What if at your center, it's a brighter light? It's light of wisdom. And so we've got light of knowledge. We've got light of wisdom. And I work with all sorts of people that. All sorts of young stuff. I remember one girl, older brother, used to take Matchbox cars, drive them up her lane and park. So there was a lot of. Around all of it. We cleared it. So all the discomfort and the pain, gone. Like, totally gone. And I had to ask her the question. I go, you know, all that discomfort, I go, where was it? And she looks at me and she goes, it's gone. I don't feel any of it. I go, I know. She goes, that's cool. I go, I know. I said, but the question was, where was it? And the two of us started thinking. I go, was it at the surface level? And she's like, no, it wasn't intellectual, huh? Well, then maybe it was at your center. And she's like, dude, really? How could that survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited? So I asked her again. I go, well, then, where was it? She goes, oh, I know it now. It was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I said, what happened? She says, the lights are joined, the shadows are gone. I said, isn't that cool? And she said, it is. And then we started talking about how people in life tend to screw up identity words all the time. Like, people say things like, I'm anxious, I'm depressed, I'm shy, thinking that the way that they feel is who they are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm really upset about what they did, and you say to me, well, what did he do? And I go, well, first he put me on a chair, and immediately my head is going down and my feet are coming up. It's very uncomfortable. And you're like, yeah, you're at the dentist. Well, then he positions this light. He's bringing it right towards my face. It's shining in my eyes. I can't see anything. And you're like, yeah, you're at the dentist. And then I go, well, then he takes this cold metal instrument and shoves it inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness. And you're what? And I go, tia, my mouth. I'm at the dentist. But see, the weird thing is that's what I said to the girl with her brother when she was younger. I said, when you were little, he really messed with your stuff. And she said, he did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings. But then she looked at me, and she had this look of conviction and peace. She. She goes, but you know what? He never touched me. I go, what? She goes, he. He messed with my stuff, my body, but he never touched who I really am. He never got me. Like, whoa, that's pretty cool. So as we're organizing your brain towards the future, you and body becoming more in a state of rest, we're going to use. Use some brain levers designed to help body rest. First lever, silly. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. So not a complete drop like ah, but just a little bit when you slightly lower your jaw. That's right. It activates our vagal nerve and starts to put the body into parasympathetic arrest state. Second lever is you're going to rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. So as you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, mind and body become more satiated. Internal dialogue starts to turn down. Third, you're going to begin to breathe intentionally, a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale and then a little bit longer on the exhale. So your jaw is slightly lowered. You rest your tongue and you breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer. Right. And as you're intentionally breathing in this slower and deeper way, exhaling a little bit longer to you, just check inside your body. How's your body beginning to feel now? Like more tense or more calm? Yeah. The next lever is when we're highly stressed or highly activated, we're in very narrowed beta wa waves. So they're high running narrowed beta waves. That's where all the anxiety, agitation, irritation, angst, live. Beta waves normally are great because they're good for what we're doing, talking, communicating, conversation, arithmetic, you know, driving. We want to move the brain waves down from beta, highly elevated, down towards lower beta, higher alpha. Alpha waves are quite correlated with what people think of as being in a flow state. Surfers flow, Right. It's more of what athletes call the zone. So alert but relaxed at the same time. And there's an expansion of awareness. So I notice more space with my peripheral vision. So how it works is again, you slightly lower your jaw. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. That's right. You breathe in a little bit slower and deeper, exhaling just a little bit longer than the inhale. As you're breathing in this way, you can look across and see me in my nose. You're going to stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers. My fingers move out. As they move out the sides of your eyes. Pick up my fingers wiggling. Nope. See, that's looking. You cheated. Notice what? It's different, though. See my nose? Stay looking at my nose. But with the sides of your eyes, pick up the wiggling. Notice how that feels different than when you looked and looked. Isn't that interesting? Because what happens as you do that t is you are becoming more aware of space. Like the space towards the side doors and windows, like the space between us, the space beyond me, the space underneath You. The space behind you, the space above your head. And as you're becoming more aware of space, again, checking your body. How's your body feeling now? Isn't that cool?
[37:34] B: It's kind of weird.
[37:36] A: It is kind of weird. See, these are all levers. Was that neuroscientists, when they had these FMRI scans on the brain, were able to have people go through, and they literally show that it was a part that would calm and, like, reset and regulate. It's kind of neat, right? And the last one. Have you ever heard somebody use the phrase, maybe you've said it yourself. I'm under a lot of stress. Right? And in order to be underneath the stress, where must the stress be? Yes. So we know that the reversal is to get out from under it and to rise up above it, having a different metaphor, one that we call a bird's eye view. And that means I have a view from above. I'm seeing everything is underneath and below me. But not just like a bird perched in a tree. Think of a bird that's free to soar through the vastness of the space of the sky, right? And move in any direction it wants to. All right? It can soar, it can flap, it can glide, it can take curves, it can do all sorts of stuff. So again, you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue. You breathe a little bit slower and deeper. As you're breathing in this way, you see my nose, my fingers, they go all the way, way out. The sides of the eyes pick up the wiggling. You notice the space in the room, and you recognize this space goes beyond the room, literally all the way out towards outer space and beyond. Right. As you're noticing more of the space, just for a moment, go ahead and close your eyes. And then imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roofs so that you rise way, way, way up above it all. Having this bird's eye view. You're seeing everything as being underneath and below you. Because you're above, you're over it. And like the bird, free to soar and move, to glide, to flap, to fly in any direction, in all ways. Big, wide, arching angles. You turn, you soar, you glide, you fly. You're free, above and over it all. When you're ready, bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you. And then when you're ready, a nice, slow, deep breath in. Long exhale and open your eyes. Good job. Those short moments. How's your Body feeling now. Yeah. Isn't that cool? Right. As your body's feeling good, more in this state of resting, the other part of your brain, unconscious, is gonna travel back down the timeline of negative moments in your own history. Things that happen that we try to never think about. Because whenever I do, I feel all. It's going to begin to group and categorize those moments, and then it's going to narrow, pinpoint, and bring a specific time. One time, one moment, something bad happened for us to unplug. The moment that comes to mind happened how long ago? You might have been home 10 years ago. Yeah, like 10 years ago. Right. And you might have been how old?
[41:12] B: Like eight.
[41:13] A: Like eight. Right. Good. So it might have happened when you were like eight. Right. And. And so here's the cool part. Two separate pieces. One, the feelings, when you think about it, are they feelings of like, hurt, sadness, anger, grief, guilt, shame, regret, remorse, guilt? Like combination?
[41:30] B: Yeah, most all of it.
[41:32] A: Oh, good. So first question is, would it be okay to get that gone, meaning none of those strong emotions, like, cleared gone, you're free. If we do that, does that in any way, shape or form mean what happened was okay? Got it. You get to be okay even though what happened then wasn't cool. Third, there have been things you've done after that moment that were more enjoyable than that moment. What's something anytime from when you were 8 until yesterday that was more fun than that? I mean, talking to Misty earlier today was more fun than that, wasn't it? Right. We got talking to Misty. What's something else you've done that was more fun than that moment?
[42:23] B: Waking up next to my kids.
[42:25] A: Yeah, being with your kids. Right. Good. One other thing.
[42:28] B: Going to school.
[42:29] A: Yeah, going to school. Right. So we got going to school, we got being with your kids, we got talking to Misty. All of those things happen after that moment. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond it. So we have actually really good news to get in. You follow me with that? Yeah. So what you're going to do is you're going to intend to be with me. I'm going to be watching, paying attention with you. And if I notice you go in there, I'm going to do everything I know how to do to get you to stay with me. Got it. So you're just going to intend to be with me. We're going to go through the what happened in a matter of fact way, and in a minute or less so to go, that happened. That happened. That Happened. That happened. That happened that other time. Got it. So that thing happened when you were 8ish when it happened, you might have been where? So you're in your aunt's house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime? Nighttime. And you're where in the house? So you're in the living room. Right. Like, are you on, like, a sofa or chair or on the floor?
[43:25] B: The floor.
[43:26] A: So you're on the floor Right. Now there? Blankets. Pillows. Yeah, there's blankets and pillows. And you're, like, laying down, like, with your chest on the ground or with your back? So you're on your back. Right. Good. Laying. Watching tv. Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened next? So the uncle comes downstairs. No, no. The ex boyfriend comes downstairs. Right. Good job. Good detail. Right, and then what happened next?
[43:49] B: He pulls my pants down.
[43:51] A: So he pulls your pants down. Right. Good. How you doing right now?
[43:53] B: Okay.
[43:54] A: He'll be here. Hi. Good job. Right. So he pulls your pants down. Right. And then what happened next? He put his penis in, or he put his finger in, or he touched between your legs. So he put his tongue down there. And so some of that felt weird. Some of it was ticklish. Some of it might have felt good. Right. Then what happened next?
[44:10] B: He carried me upstairs.
[44:11] A: And then he carried you upstairs. Right. Good job. Right, and then what happened next? So he continued to do that. Right. And then what happened next?
[44:21] B: I ended up waking up. I wasn't really asleep.
[44:26] A: Right. So you kind of, like, startled awake. Right. And then he stopped. Right. And then you pulled your pants back up. Right. And then he left the room. He said, don't you dare tell somebody. Right. Good. And then he left the room. All right. And then that moment ended. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like hang out with your kids. Right. Or go to school or talk to Misty. Now, notice as you were telling me about it, there was some of that discomfort. It was less because you were here. Isn't that cool? Now, crazy. We never go backwards with a memory, but when we do, it unplugs it. It takes away the charge. So we're gonna go backwards. So we got talking to Misty. We got, you know, waking up with the kids. We got going to school. Right. And then you had woken up, and then you'd finally fallen asleep. And then he told you, don't. And then he had left, and he told you, don't tell anybody. And then you startled awake, and then he was doing it in the bed. And then he had carried you up, and then he had started Doing it down there. And then you were kind of sleepy. He had come downstairs. And then before that you were watching tv. And before that you got it all set up to watch tv, right? As we go backwards, compared to forward, emotionally, how was.
[45:41] B: Was kind of weird.
[45:42] A: It was kind of weird, right? But emotionally, was it same? Was it more? Was it less?
[45:47] B: Less.
[45:47] A: Isn't that cool? So weird. But it was less emotional. Cool. Third, the emotional part of your brain does not get logic, but it does understand patterns of association, right? And the error is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening have been glued together. So they're living as if they're the same thing. But there are things you can remember doing that you know you're not doing today. Like, for example, putting your shirt on. You can remember doing it. You might even remember where you were when you did it. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your shirt on, and then I went to you stuff, putting on your shirt, you look at me and go, dude, I'm not putting on my shirt. Right? Because, you know, there's a clear difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually doing it. They're not the same thing. Makes sense. That's what we want to get in. So you can remember that happening, him coming downstairs, him pulling pants down, him putting his face and touching in between your legs with his tongue and mouth. And you can remember all that? You can remember all happening, right? You can also remember putting your pants on. Letiya, stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants. Say that I'm not putting on my pants. Stop me from putting on my pants. Say, you're not putting on your pants.
[47:11] B: You're not putting.
[47:12] A: Well, then you stop putting on your shoes. Say, I'm not putting on my shoes.
[47:14] B: I'm not putting.
[47:15] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shoes. Say you're not putting on your shoes.
[47:18] B: You're not putting.
[47:19] A: Well, stop him from putting his mouth down there. Say he's not doing that.
[47:22] B: He's not doing that.
[47:23] A: Well, stop him from touching you in that way. Say he's not doing that. Well, then stop that from happening. Say it's not happening. Well, stop him from threatening you. Say he's not threatening me. Right? So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. As that starts to get in, what do you notice now? There's some relief, right? What that you didn't know is that some of that might have felt good, but not because she wanted it from him, but because body part touch in certain ways designed to feel good. Follow me with that. She didn't know that. So that was really confusing to have that thing happen, which was weird to have happen, but some of it was feeling good, some of it was different. Weird to then when it stopped being told, don't ever tell anybody, which made it feel, like, shameful and bad. Right? So this thing that was somewhat feeling good because of what was being happening, not because I wanted it, then it was really bad that it, like all that was going on. Right. As we're looking at it, clearly we know it didn't feel good or some of it didn't feel good because that's what you wanted. It felt good because the body part touched in that way. That's what it's designed to do. Got it. And that that happening had nothing to do with you. It had everything to do with what was screwed up with him. Right. You didn't fully know that then. Got it. So we want those information to get in. We want you to repeat these four words. Here we go. It's. It's not about me, Right? Because did that happening have anything to do with you? No. And everything to do with what was off with him. You didn't know that then, right? So close your eyes. Picture that earlier. You let her know that moment it's over, finished. That it no longer exists. Let her know that that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with him. That some of it felt good. Not because that's what you wanted, but because the body part touched in that way is designed to feel good. So that she gets it right. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about her waking up with her kids. Chat with Misty. Let her know. Right? And as it gets in, what do you notice now? Yeah. What's happening now? Isn't that interesting? So there's just. Check. Is this more of like sadness or relief? It is, isn't it? Isn't that cool? Good job, right? Notice how she's not stuck there. Notice how even as you're thinking about it, it's not making you feel bad about you. Right? Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. Yeah. Because check it out. Think about that time. Think about that time with him. All of what happened. And then him threatening. What do you notice as you think about that now? And there may be more than one time, but as you think about that time now, what do you notice?
[51:07] B: It's over.
[51:08] A: It is over. Yeah. Anything about it that's at all troubling now? Because you check, right? What about that thing happening then? Troubling now. Ah, so notice how it changed. What was troubling first was coming from the part that didn't know that it wasn't happening. Right? Because notice how you're not troubled that it happened. What's troubling you is coming from the thought that it shouldn't have happened. Make sense? And there's a problem with that in our brain. And here's the problem. I'll give you a different example. So we see it clearly. But think of this guy. A year ago, his brother had asked him to go on a motorcycle ride. He didn't go. Brother dies. He now feels guilty. He's thinking he's feeling guilty because he should have gone on the ride. But he's not actually feeling guilty because he should have gone on the ride. He's feeling guilty because intellectually he can conceive of having gone on the ride. And if he had, his brother might still be alive. That would be a lot better. So because he can think it, his emotional brain, by the way, works like an animal. Animals can't think of doing things that they can't do, right? Porcupines aren't trying to build hang gliders to fly. Dogs aren't depressed. They can't climb the tree. So what it lives with is that this emotional brain lives that if I can think it, that means that I can do it. So here's what's happening. His intellectual brain is conceiving of having gone. His emotional brain goes, well, if it would be better, then go, hurry up. Go on the motorcycle where I'd with your brother a year ago. Can he do it? No. So when our brain gets either A, the first one, it no longer exists, or B, that there's nothing to be done, it stops causing the feeling. It's not causing the feeling because it wants you to feel bad. It's trying to get you to do something. What it's trying to get you to do is in a time period that no longer exists. So there's nothing to be done. Here's what it's trying to get you to do. Tia, hurry. Stop him from doing that when you were eight. Quick. And you go, there's nothing to be done. Say that. No. Hurry. Stop him from doing that when you were eight. Quick. No, hurry. We'll go together. Come on, come on, hurry. Say there's nothing to be done. Right? Why? Because it no longer exists, Right? Say it no longer exists. Right. And as that gets in, what do you notice?
[54:04] B: It no longer exists.
[54:06] A: That's right. What do you notice happening to the feelings? They are. Because we're not troubled because it happened. I can conceive of it having not happened. But the real matter is, everything that's already over, fortunately or not, couldn't have not happened exactly the way it happened. If things happen, something caused it to happen because of the cause, it couldn't have not happened. Right. That's the world of cause and effect after the fact. Right. If every day we walk along a sidewalk, but this particular day there's a hole in the middle of the sidewalk, we might think to ourselves, I wonder what caused the hole? But we would never think to ourselves, hmm, I wonder if there was a cause. Because we know, given that it's there, something caused it. Got it. So if a lightning bolt hits a tree, causes a branch to break and land on the ground, we know two things. One, given that the branch is broken and on the ground, there's no way the lightning bolt could have not hit the tree. The tree there. We also know, given that the lightning bolt did hit the tree there, there's no way the branch could have not been broken on the ground. So that cause and effect locks it in. So all the stuff that has happened couldn't have not happened. And the good news is, we don't need to get it to have not happened in order to be free from it, in order to be at peace, in order to be okay. Okay. Got it. Yeah. And that's where we're headed, is you becoming more and more okay in you. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. And how's your body feeling now? It is, isn't it? Right. And again, that other part of your brain, that unconscious part, is going to travel back and bring another moment to your awareness to clear. All right. What comes to mind now? Staying with my uncle, huh? So this happened when, like, I think.
[56:25] B: When I was, like, 13.
[56:26] A: So you're 13, right. Good. And you're where. When you're 13? So you're at Uncle's house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[56:34] B: Nighttime.
[56:34] A: Nighttime. And you're where in the house?
[56:36] B: In his room.
[56:37] A: So you're in his room. Right. Good. And are you standing? Sitting on the bed? Laying.
[56:41] B: Laying.
[56:41] A: So you're laying down on the bed? Right. Good. And he's where?
[56:45] B: On the other side. Like, I was at one end, he.
[56:48] A: Was at the other end, like, laying this way. So his head here? Your head here?
[56:52] B: Yeah.
[56:53] A: Like, looking.
[56:54] B: Well, my head there. His Head there.
[56:55] A: Well, okay. But yes. Right. Then what happened next?
[57:02] B: Well, all the kids were watching a movie in that room.
[57:05] A: Right? So the kids were watching the movie. Right.
[57:07] B: They went to sleep.
[57:09] A: Right. Good job. Good detail, right?
[57:10] B: Yeah, I think I was sleep. But he ended up putting his fingers.
[57:15] A: So you were sleeping, Right. And then he did what? He moved his hands up your legs, and then he put his finger inside your vagina. And that was weird. And then you might have woke up. Right? And then he pulled his hand out.
[57:27] B: Yeah.
[57:28] A: Right. And then what happened next? You left, which is better than when he was doing that. And then that moment was over. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like hang out with your kids. Right. Or go to school or just talk to Misty. Right. Got it. So, again, notice how things are changing. We got talking to Misty. We got hanging out with the kids. We got going to school. Right. And then you'd left, and then he pulled his hands out. And then you woke up. And then he had his hands, and you felt it inside your vagina. And then he put his hands on your legs. And then you were, like, sleeping. And then the kids had been sleeping, and then you'd gone to lay down. Right? And then you were watching. They were watching a movie. Then before that, you'd gone over there. Right. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it? I know. Isn't that cool? Right? Notice how it's already getting easier. You can remember that happening, right? You can remember putting your shoes on, right? Tia, stop putting on your shoes. Well, then stop him from touching between your legs. Say he's not doing that. So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists. Right. Again. That moment, did it have anything to do with you? No, it had to do with what was off with him. You didn't know that fully then. Got it. So again, close your eyes. Picture that. Earlier, you let her know that moment, over, finish, no longer exists. This. Let her know him doing that had nothing to do with you. Everything to do with what was off with him. So that she gets, it's not about me. Let her know that you're okay. Right. Let her know about her kids. Let her know school. Let her know. Right. And again, as all of this gets in, what are you noticing now? Yeah. Even more relief. Right? Right. Because mind and body is getting that it's over. Right. And being able to see it clearly where I knew that stuff wasn't my fault. I didn't feel right. Notice how that's different. Right? And then think of how we would want somebody to have handled that situation. Didn't you handle that situation exactly the way we'd want somebody to handle the situation? Right. Don't you think, like, that happens, they get up and they leave. Right? Right. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So again, slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue. Breathe a little bit slower and deeper in. Exhaling a little bit longer out. Right. As you breathe in this way, notice more space to the sides. As you're aware of more space, go ahead and close your eyes. Notice that with your eyes closed, you don't see see me or what's out in front of you, but you actually see just the backs of your eyelids. And when I see the backs of my eyelids, there's different hues of colors. Darker, lighter. Go ahead and open your eyes. Notice that as they're open, you see me and what's out in front of you. Close your eyes again, noticing that you don't see me or what's in front of you, but what you actually see is just the backs of your eyelids. And so an interesting, maybe unusual, curious question. Without using your memory or your imagination, what do you actually see behind you? Because it might surprise you that what you actually see behind you is nothing. You see nothing behind you. That's right. And then what would it be like to just for a moment, drift back into nothing? No. Thingness. That's right. Because in nothing, everything exists as a potentiality. That's right. Nothing. Begin to find your way back out of nothing and into now. When you're ready, take a nice, big, deep breath in. In. And then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. Right. And what do you notice? How's your body feeling now?
[62:34] B: Very relaxed.
[62:35] A: It's very relaxed. And as your body's staying very relaxed, that other than conscious part travels back again. And we'll bring another one of those moments, your awareness, for us to clear. This one happened when I was 14. You're 14. Good. And you're where?
[62:55] B: St. Pete.
[62:55] A: So you're in St. Pete. Good. Was this daytime or nighttime?
[62:58] B: Nighttime.
[62:59] A: Nighttime. Right. And so you got into St. Pete. You're in St. Pete. You're, like in the. Like downtown?
[63:05] B: I think so.
[63:06] A: Or South St. Pete or.
[63:08] B: I'm not sure.
[63:09] A: Yeah, but you're somewhere in St. Pete. Right. And you're in, like in a car, in a house, In a. So you're walking somewhere in St. Pete. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[63:20] B: A red car or a red van comes.
[63:23] A: Right. So red van comes up next to you. Right? Right. There are four or five Men in the van. Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next? So then they get out of the van and they grab you and they put you in the back of the van, and that's scary. How you doing right now? Yeah. You want to be with me? Hi. I'm fine. Right. More fun than that. Right. Then what happened next? So they drove to a hotel. Right. So then they drove to a hotel. Right. Good. Then what happened next? They put you in a hotel room.
[63:55] B: Yeah.
[63:56] A: Right, Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[63:58] B: They handcuffed me to the bed.
[64:00] A: Right. So you're cuffed to the bed. Right. That's scary. Right. Then what happened next?
[64:05] B: I just sit there for, like a couple weeks.
[64:08] A: So you're sitting there without eating. They're not there.
[64:12] B: Yeah.
[64:13] A: You're just in there waiting.
[64:14] B: Peeing on myself.
[64:15] A: Peeing on yourself. Right. Good. Right, Good. And what happened next?
[64:21] B: This guy comes and he starts, like, ejaculating.
[64:25] A: Right. So then a guy came in. Right. And he started masturbating. Right. And then he ejaculated on you. And that was gross. Right. Then what happened next? How you doing? Right now? You are? Right. You're here. Hi. Good job. Right. This is where you want to be as you're telling me what happened then? Because this is. And that isn't. Right. Then what happened next? Did that guy leave? Right. That was better than when he was doing that. Right, Right. So there was you and somebody else. Oh, there's another person there. Oh, got it. Right. So you've been put in the room with that other person. Was that over the person already there?
[65:11] B: No, she was together.
[65:13] A: You two were walking down the street together. Got it. They took both of you. Okay. Now I'm with you. Right. So then they uncuff both of you. Yeah. And Right.
[65:24] B: Give us, like, clothes.
[65:25] A: Right. So then you were able to get clean, which is better than when you were bed. Right. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[65:33] B: They started giving us drugs.
[65:34] A: Right. So then they gave you drugs. Right. Of course, being numb from stuff felt better than. Right, Right. Good. Then what happen? We start having sex with them or did they bring other people in?
[65:55] B: Other people.
[65:56] A: So then other people came in. Into the same hotel room?
[65:59] B: No, it wasn't.
[66:00] A: So you're in different rooms. Right. And then different people came in and had sex with your body. Right. And that happened for a period of time. Right. And then what happened next?
[66:09] B: We moved to a different.
[66:10] A: Moved to a different hotel. Other people came in. Right. Then what happened next?
[66:14] B: Move to a different.
[66:15] A: Right. Good. And then Other people came in. And then what happened next? That's a really good breath, by the way. Good job. You're doing great. Really.
[66:30] B: I locked myself in the bathroom.
[66:32] A: Then one day. You locked yourself in the bathroom so they couldn't get to you? Probably. Good job. Good detail. And then what happened next? I started cutting. Right. Good job. Right. And then what happen next?
[66:41] B: I took a shower.
[66:42] A: Right. Then what happened?
[66:44] B: I just laid down.
[66:46] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next? Was it still bleeding?
[66:48] B: Yeah.
[66:49] A: Yeah. So you took the shower, it was still bleeding. You laid down. It's still bleeding. Right. Then what happened next? Somebody came in.
[66:57] B: Yeah.
[66:58] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[66:59] B: Gave us drugs.
[67:00] A: Gave me drugs again. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[67:03] B: Started, Continued.
[67:05] A: Did the sex of the body suffer any? Good. Then what happened next?
[67:09] B: The police gets called.
[67:11] A: Yes.
[67:12] B: And I get saved.
[67:14] A: And then they arrest them.
[67:17] B: Just the woman.
[67:18] A: The woman. The other person. Right. And you get to go with the police.
[67:25] B: Yeah.
[67:25] A: Right. And then that's over. And then later on, you did something more fun, Right. Like, you know, hang out with the kids, wake up with them. Right. Talk to Misty, probably go to school, finish. Are you done? How exciting. He still got finishing school, Right. We were talking to Misty. We got hanging out with the kids. Right. Then the police had you. Right. And then that cycle repeated where there was drugs and sex and drugs and sex. And then you'd been laying on the ground, cut. And then you had gotten out of the shower, and then you were showering, and then you had cut, and then you locked yourself in the bathroom. And then there was drugs and sex and drugs and sex and drugs and sex at different. Different. Different hotels. Right. And then the. Well, then they had gotten you the ability to get clean. Right. And then they'd gotten there, and then that guy left, and then he ejaculated. And then he had come in there, and then you two were there being. And then they had locked you to the bed, and then they put you in the hotel. Right. And then before that, they drove you in the red van, and then they had grabbed you and put you in the red van. And then you guys were walking. And then somehow you've gotten wherever you were in St. Pete. Right. And then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing as it goes backwards again compared to forward, what do you notice? Right. Isn't that cool? You can remember them doing all that, right? You can remember. Put your pants on. Well, stop putting on your pants. I'm not putting on my pants. Right. Stop them from doing that. See they're not doing that. Well, stop it from happening. It's not happening. Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. It isn't. That's right. As that gets in again, check. Do you notice relief? Yeah. Right. And then the other part is, which I don't know if this has ever fully gotten in, but what if they never touched who you really are? What if all that stuff messed with your body, screwed up your thinking and feeling, but there's no part of your body right now that's essential, Same as it was. You know, neuroscience will tell us that if you and I were to come back one year from today, 99.9999, meaning almost all of the subatomic particles that make us up would not be here. So all we are is always changing, Right? Right. What if who you are is the light at the center? And the light that is you can't get touched, hurt or harmed. Right. If we've got an angry monster trying to hurt the light, it punches right through claws, right through it. Right? An orb of light shoots at it, goes right through it. Can't get touched in that way. So I have a thought for you, and I'm going to show you something that's kind of a little weird. So take your hand and hold it out like that, right? I want you to look at that spot. As you look at that spot, I'm going to bring my hand and my hand is going to get closer to your hand. And then before it ever touches your hand, you're going to notice that you can begin to feel my hand. Notice how you can begin to feel the warmth. That's right. From my hand within your hand. And cta, this is the coolest part because. Because I am coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body or screwed up your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with mutual respect or the love that you allow in. Right? So repeat this after me. I have a nose. I have 10 fingers. I have two fingers, two elbows, 10 toes. I'm not my nose. I'm not my fingers. I'm not my elbows. I'm not my toes. I have a vagina. I'm not my vagina. I have an ass. I'm not an ass. They're mine. They're not me. So they mess with my stuff. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and feeling.
[72:00] B: For a long time, I screwed up.
[72:01] A: My thinking and feeling, right? But they never touched who I really am.
[72:05] B: But they never touched who I really am.
[72:07] A: Right? They never got me.
[72:08] B: They never got me.
[72:10] A: They mess with my stuff. They mess with my stuff, but they never touched me.
[72:15] B: They never touched.
[72:16] A: Right. Take a nice deep breath in. Exhale, exhale. Close your eyes. That arm can just drop down, down, down, down, down, down, down, deeper, deeper inside. Towards that calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy. The light at your center. That calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy. They messed with my stuff. Never touched who I really am. That's right. So that the earth earlier you realizes that's over, finished, no longer exists. That you got away, that you survived. That none of that happening had anything to do with you. Because it wouldn't have mattered other you or somebody else in that same situation. That's what they would have done. Right. Let that you know that they never touched who you really are. They mess with your stuff, but there's no part of your stuff now that's the same as it was then. Right. So they never got you. Right. Let her know about her kids waking up next to them. Let her know. Right. About finishing school. Let her know about on her way to her next adventure. Let her know how much you're healing from the inside out. Connecting more to who you are. Like what you became aware of as you see the orange sky at the sunset. That's right. All of this integrating at deeper and deeper levels. More and more. And then when you're ready, because you can take your time, there's no rush. Enjoying this peaceful resting, connecting more to who you really are. Ever so slowly begin to find your way back. Up and up and eyes are open. Good job. What are you noticing now?
[75:45] B: My mom. My mind is empty.
[75:48] A: Isn't that cool?
[75:49] B: Yeah.
[75:50] A: Yeah. Right. As you think back about that stuff, the stuff that happened with those guys in the different hotels, when you think about the stuff that happened with uncle or that boyfriend, moms. What do you notice now?
[76:14] B: It's over.
[76:15] A: Yeah. What do you notice in terms of how it's feeling?
[76:22] B: It doesn't define me anymore.
[76:24] A: It doesn't? Yeah. Any of it hurting? No. Any of it making you feel bad about you? Right. Right. Look at how strong and resilient you are. Right. If we look back at the mountains that she's overcome at the young age you're at, that's pretty amazing, don't you think? Yeah. That you're here now as clear as you are. Right, right. Right. Because they had been giving you drugs. What were they giving you?
[77:18] B: I remember horse tranquilizers. Shrooms. Cocaine.
[77:29] A: Yeah.
[77:33] B: Lsd.
[77:34] A: Right. So all sorts of weird stuff that Was causing all sorts of. Right. Notice how none of that's happening now. Good job. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So again, as you're thinking about all that stuff, anything about any of those situations, that it's all troubling now. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So now let's check. So sometimes you've told me, or at least you were saying earlier, that there were people around you that told you negative and hurt, hurtful things. Some of it was mom. Some of it might have been other things. Mom, even recently is like the whole thing was your fault because you ran away. Right. So think about that. Do you notice any discomfort?
[78:38] B: A little bit.
[78:38] A: Where do you feel it? You feel it in your arms. Right. So just notice this sensations that you're feeling in your arms right now and then make your eyes big as you can and then make the sound of curiosity, of wonder. Go, big eyes and go. Right. I know it sounds really silly, but just notice the sensations in the arms. Make your eyes big and go. Right. One more time. Big eyes. Go. Hmm. And what do you notice happening to those sensations? They went away. Right. So how do you want to be as it pertains? Because you probably are going to have some interactions with mom ongoing. Yeah. And Mom's going to probably be the same way Mom's always been. Right. And Mom's been somebody that, like, you know, talks down to you. Right. Like, puts the blame on you. Like, talks down to you. Like, I. I'm all knowing or I know better because I'm older. That kind of stuff. Right. And as you think about mom and the way mom interacts, what are some of the things that mom typically says or does that normally do that kind of discomfort to you?
[80:10] B: I'm not good enough.
[80:12] A: She might say that. In what context am I taking care of the kids good enough.
[80:19] B: Yeah. That. Or if I tell her I wanted to, like, do something in life.
[80:23] A: Yeah.
[80:24] B: She'd be like, oh, you can't do that. Because that's my.
[80:28] A: Because you're not allowed.
[80:29] B: Yeah. Well, no, I pass.
[80:31] A: Oh, what about.
[80:34] B: Happened?
[80:35] A: It did. Right. Notice how it's not defining you.
[80:38] B: Right.
[80:38] A: Right. So what might be something that you tell mom that you want to go do that. She's like, oh, you can't. Could you?
[80:48] B: It's like being a doctor.
[80:50] A: Huh?
[80:51] B: Like, for a baby doctor.
[80:53] A: Yeah.
[80:54] B: She's like, I already went through, like, trauma, so, like, seeing that probably, like, effect.
[81:04] A: I don't know whether that's true. What do you mean you've already gone through trauma?
[81:08] B: Like my past.
[81:10] A: Oh, you have. You know what the best part about it? It's over. You know what's the really best part about it? You're fully getting that it's over. That's right. Isn't that cool?
[81:26] B: Yeah.
[81:27] A: Yeah. So it's not that you can't become a doctor. It's a lot of hours and a lot of years. Right. There are other things that you can do that are also really great things to do that are less hours and less years. Right? Yeah. But check it out. So think of mom saying that now, you know, the worry has been, oh, because you had trauma, that if you're working, that stuff would traumatize you. No, check it out right now. Does it? Right, got it. What people in the world don't know, so this would be mom, is that emotional wounds can heal. People live that you can slightly get it better, not really better, because the methods they use aren't the right methods to heal emotional wounds. All right. It's kind of like physical therapy is great for a lot of issues and a lot of injuries for rehab. But if I broke my arm, it doesn't matter how much physical therapy I go to, it's not the right solution for the problem. So regular therapy, unfortunately, is not the right solution for emotional wounds, even though it gets known as the thing that people go to to heal emotional wounds. Got it. Yeah. But notice you're not finding yourself troubled. Right. And you're really different than you were at 14. Yeah, right. So as we think about mom, we think about, you know, mom kind of being the condescending or somehow you're not good enough. Right. What does mom have to do or how white mom look facial wise when you know that she's like doing that thing. What do you see in mom when you start feeling this whole like, I'm not good enough. I'll never be good enough. I see herself, you see her. Right. Think about her. Think about her face. What does her face look like?
[84:19] B: Drained.
[84:20] A: She looks drained. She looks really tired. And that's when she's saying to you, you're not. Yeah. Huh, Right. Are you looking really drained?
[84:32] B: I don't think so.
[84:34] A: You aren't. Oh, but she is.
[84:36] B: Yeah.
[84:37] A: Right, Right. So how do you want to be feeling when she might say that?
[84:46] B: That I am good enough?
[84:49] A: Yeah. Right. Maybe a little indifferent to what mom says. Like more of like a. Okay, whatever. Yeah, right. Because when you interact with mom in those sequences, we're not learning about you, we're learning about Mom. And we might be learning About Mom's opinion. We're not actually learning about. You see, part of what happens when we're little is we get the lens change jammed inward that I feel in life that I'm learning a lot about me. Because everything in life when I'm little is about me. Right. So if anything's going on in my world, because I must have done something right when My daughter was 4, and I go, whose house is that? She'd go, it's Daphne's house. Oh, yeah, Daphne's house. Right. It's not Dad's house, it's Daphne's house. Right. So we get elevated with things feeling like they're about me. But when we interact with other people, we're not learning ever about ourselves, we're learning about them. We're learning about maybe their opinion of something I said or did or didn't say or didn't do. But I'm not actually learning about me. Makes sense. So think of mom. And think of mom being in that condescending way, looking at you as she's drained. Right. And she's, you know, conveying to you how you're not good enough. Right. Feel some of that feeling. Let that feeling take you back. So it grows you younger and earlier and earlier and younger towards one of the first times you had that kind of a feeling, which may or may not have anything to do with Mal, but as your unconscious travels, it brings. Yeah. Huh? What was it that led to that?
[87:12] B: Being mistreated at home.
[87:14] A: Yeah. So what was happening?
[87:17] B: Just being, like, bullied.
[87:24] A: Think of a particular time that finally was the, I'm done and I'm leaving.
[87:31] B: When my uncle put his hand on.
[87:34] A: Me, that was the time.
[87:36] B: Yeah.
[87:36] A: Yeah. That was right after that. They were like, hello. How else had you been being mistreated verbally? So they might have said, what would it have been? Uncle, mom, aunt, everybody. Who's everybody?
[87:52] B: My cousins, my grandma, uncles, aunties.
[87:57] A: Right. So you might have been wearing what might have been one of the things.
[88:00] B: That they said I would have been at home.
[88:04] A: Yeah.
[88:05] B: And I guess it would be like an argument.
[88:09] A: Right.
[88:11] B: And they would just.
[88:12] A: You're arguing with them about something.
[88:14] B: Right. And they would just call me names like a slut later.
[88:31] A: You're doing great. What? Something else they might say, huh? And that might come from Uncle Grandma. Right. And so you can remember them saying that. Right. And as we're looking at it clearly, were we learning anything about you? No. Right. And because they said that, were we learning that that's what you are? No. Got it because you're a kid. Right. So you can remember them saying that. You can remember putting your shoes on. Stop putting on your shoes. I'm not putting on my shoes. Say that. Well, stop them from saying that. See, they're not saying that. So then where is it? Say it doesn't exist. Right. Who were we learning about? No. Not at all. No. When they said those things about you, were we learning anything about you? No, we were learning about them. Right. What are we learning about them? And they're probably a little screwed up. Right. You didn't know. Right. And you just recently did with Ally, a genogram. What was one of the things that you learned out of doing the genogram?
[90:09] B: Both my grandma and my mom has.
[90:11] A: A blind eye because of their own abuse. Yeah. So you learned that. What else did you learn?
[90:23] B: That has always been verbal abuse to. Towards each other, my mom and my grandma.
[90:31] A: Yeah.
[90:31] B: Just bringing it out on me.
[90:34] A: Yeah. So you didn't start. It didn't start with you. Right. It started well before you.
[90:44] B: Yeah.
[90:44] A: And they have a blind eye. Blind eye because of what it would mean about them if it were true.
[90:51] B: They got good people.
[90:54] A: Right. But like, if. Because I've had my own abuse, if it were to be true that the abuse was happening to you, what would it mean about me?
[91:06] B: I don't understand. I'm sorry.
[91:08] A: I'll give you a different example. So I had a guy one time tell me that he told his mom that Uncle Tony was molesting him. And mom's response was, don't you dare say that about my brother. Kid felt completely. And we started to understand it more. And we go, well, she didn't say that because she didn't believe you. She didn't say that because she doesn't care about you. She said that because of what it would mean about her if that was true, that her own brother is molesting her son. Like she can't be with it because of what it would mean about her. Right. So when somebody has a blind eye, they can't see it because of what it would mean about me if it were true. Like they can't even be with it. Makes sense. You didn't know any of that. You didn't know until you did the genogram that this thing has been generational and I just kind of got born into it. Right. I didn't get to pick. Right. We don't get to pick our family of origin. Right. We don't get to pick our. Our siblings. We don't get to pick our relatives. Right. But if you got to pick, would you rather be you or your mom or your grandmom or uncle? Right. So even out of the cards that were dealt, you're glad you got the ones you got. Right? Right. Because you got a lot going for you and you're getting healing early. Right? Right. Which connects you more to your resources that you already have. So that stuff happening, you didn't know when they were saying that that that was part of the family history, wasn't about you at all, and had everything to do with them. You didn't know that they weren't well, that they had their own trauma, sexual abuse, violence. Right. That them responding to you that way had nothing to do with their lack of love for you, had everything to do with them being screwed up. Right. We weren't learning anything about you being a SL light at 14. You're learning about them. Right. And that. That's a screwed up thing to be saying to a 14 year old. Yeah, right, right. My daughter's 15. I can't imagine going up to her and going home and going, you're a what? Got it. That earlier you thought she was learning stuff about herself. Were we learning anything about you at all? Are we learning about them and them not being well, by the way, did you need them to be well in order for you to turn out okay? In order for you to survive and escape? Right. In order for you to finish school, in order for you to make wise decisions, for you to go into programming that's supporting who you're wanting to become? Right. When we're little, we think we need our parents because when we're very, very little, we kind of do. Because we need them to feed us and change changes in bathas and shit like that. As human beings, we have the longest incubation period, like really dependent for a really long time. Right. Where the gazelle drops and in four hours it can run. Makes sense. So as we're looking at this thing that earlier you didn't know that they weren't well. Right. That it tends to be, and this may be the experience, but I'm gonna say tends to be in a screwed up family. That the person who's most well is the one that's considered the black sheep. Isn't that crazy? Caught it. That you didn't know that they weren't well. That you didn't know any other way. Right. That you didn't have other experiences. Now we're knowing it had nothing to do with you. It had everything to do with them not being well. That you didn't need them to be well in order for you to turn out okay. In order for you to love your own and be there and be present. Right. By choosing programming to make sure that I'm present in there. Right. Good job. Right. Finishing school. Right. So again, close your eyes. Think back to an earlier you. Or whether it be Graham or mom or uncle, somebody saying one of those things, learning that that's not about me. It had nothing to do with me. I'm not that. Because they said it. They said it. Which means they're not well. Wow. They're not well. Oh, I didn't realize how unwell they were. Wait a minute. I didn't even need them to be well in order for me to turn out okay. Right. In order for me to love my own. Right. In order for me to lighten up on me. Right. To be more okay in me to. That's right. Guided by an inner wisdom to do right. What's best. Right. As that gets into the earlier you again, check. What do you notice happening to her face? What are you noticing now? That's a good breath. Yeah. Right. What are you noticing?
[97:42] B: That they weren't well.
[97:44] A: Yeah. Right. Notice how clear that is is now. Before it was all muddied. Now you're seeing it clearly for what it was. Right. And I didn't need them to be well. I turned out okay despite them not being well. Right. And your whole thing about getting away when you were 14, you were all about taking care of you. Because what was going on in the environment and it being wasn't was ongoingly happening. Make sense? Right. You ran away to get away from something that was bad, thinking that anything would be better than that. And then you learned and went, fuck, not anything. Right. And you made it through that and you got away. Right. And then you got back to like school. Right. And taking care of you. Right. That's why you're doing the genogram. That's why you're going to a different. That's why. Right. Yeah. And did you need them to be well in order for you to make wise decisions for you? No. Right. And are you not so much wiser now.
[99:24] B: Yeah.
[99:26] A: Than you were at 14, right? Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. So, Jack, what do you notice?
[99:38] B: Oh, no weight on my shoulders anymore.
[99:41] A: You don't have any weight on your shoulders anymore. Isn't that cool? Yeah. You've lightened up. Right. Try to be really down and hard on that you for. Should have known Better. Isn't that cool? Yeah. All right. Try to really get down on her. She should have known. That's right. She didn't know. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And so mom may say one of those things again. No, you're not. I don't think you should be going to that program. Right. Notice how you're like, got it. Yeah. Because she's great with advice. She's definitely the person that I want to take advice from. Right. Isn't that cool? So notice.
[100:49] B: Check, check.
[100:50] A: Inside thinking about Mom. Thinking about what Grandma? Thinking about what happened to the uncle. Thinking about what happened to that boy. Thinking about. Right. And see, there were moments when you got taken in the van, when you got locked in the hotel, when it was ongoing, ongoing, ongoing. There are moments that. That you wasn't sure she was ever going to be okay. Yeah. Look at how different you are now. Right. And that's all your actions have all been to change your life for the better. And now we just add to it because now it's not just your actions, but your emotions are aligning. Right. And you're feeling more and more of it. That cool? Yeah. And the neat thing is when our brain gets that, it's data. Right. Like I told you, it gets embodied. She don't lose how to ride a bicycle. Once your brain gets that that stuff that happened is data, it can't ever go back to thinking it's happening. And the only reason that it was troubling you is that part of the brain didn't know it was over. Got it.
[102:13] B: Yeah.
[102:13] A: Yeah. So you truly get to be free from the effect that that stuff has had. Right. And checking in, knowing. Because check it out. Notice that that stuff happened to your body. Right. But did it actually touch you? No. Isn't that cool?
[102:35] B: Yeah.
[102:36] A: Yeah. You were never touched by any of that stuff. Yeah. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Right. And that's where there's more and more freedom happening. More and more ease. You're becoming more and more open. Okay with you? Where's the program going to be? What were they?
[103:04] B: Iowa.
[103:05] A: Iowa. That's right. It was. Right. Iowa's cool. You been to Iowa?
[103:08] B: No.
[103:09] A: It's cold.
[103:10] B: Yeah, I heard.
[103:11] A: Different than Florida. They don't have the same amount of humidity. It's a little bit drier and it's definitely colder.
[103:18] B: Looking forward to it.
[103:20] A: Yeah. What part of Iowa do you know?
[103:23] B: Des Moines.
[103:23] A: Oh, yeah. Okay. That's the. Yeah. Well, cool.
[103:30] B: I can't wait.
[103:32] A: And you leave for that next week?
[103:34] B: Yeah. Tuesday.
[103:36] A: Tuesday. All right. Is it A plane ride or is it a drive?
[103:39] B: It's a plane.
[103:41] A: So you and kids and Misty. And Misty. So you at least have somebody to help with two children.
[103:48] B: Yeah. Because I cannot do.
[103:52] A: Well, you have two children under the age of five.
[103:55] B: Yeah.
[103:55] A: Right, Like a two and a one.
[103:57] B: Yeah.
[103:58] A: So here's my take. When you have two children. Well, regardless, when you have one or two, when you have children under the age of five, as the adult, you are in survival mode, meaning you do everything you can to keep your own head above water. There's not a lot of like in the reserves because at that age children are super demanding, Right. And they're not very patient. You can't be like, I'm on this phone call, could you just give me a minute? What?
[104:32] B: No.
[104:34] A: Right. So what it's like as a parent is you're always on to put out anything that shows up whenever it shows up and you have no idea when it's going to show up. And every once in a while you can get them both down and they're both sleeping and then you look around the house, bottles and stuff and other things. And sometimes it's like, I just want to lay down too. Right. And so that's what you just need to know that that will happen for the first five years of a child's life. Right. Once they get to four and a half, as they get to five, they gain more independence. You still have to manage, but it's not so physically labor intensive. Right. So now you have to do it all from changing them to feeding them to bathing them, to clothing them to. And ongoing. Right. As they get a little bit older, they can put their own clothes on. As they get a little bit older, they can take their shower instead of it's me doing tummy time. Right. I sometimes miss tummy time because that was a fun way to play. But I'm really glad that I don't have to do it every day. Yeah, right. So we just realized that for the first five years I'm in survival mode. Then they're less physically dependent and demanding and I can have them do certain things. Then it's about managing. Right now it's about doing it all. Then it turns into managing, still doing lots of it, but managing. And then it slowly turns into managing, but getting them to pay more attention to notice. Like I'm in the phase now with a 15 and 11 year old. Like, okay, girls, we need to notice that the dishwasher needs to be unloaded. I don't need to tell you that the Dish like, you come in and you check. That's part of your routine. Yeah. How long is this program?
[106:45] B: Two years.
[106:46] A: Two years. Cool. All right. And what do you get to do throughout the whole program?
[106:51] B: It's a Christian based program, so, like Bible study, church.
[106:56] A: Yeah.
[106:58] B: You know, going with the animals every day, planting.
[107:05] A: Nice.
[107:06] B: It's just more of like a nature.
[107:09] A: Yeah.
[107:09] B: Type of thing.
[107:10] A: Do you. When you leave, do you have, like. Are you. Will you come back to Florida? Do you set up job, like in the. Is that all? Probably not there yet because it's two years, so.
[107:20] B: Well, I'm thinking about just after I graduate from there.
[107:25] A: Yeah.
[107:25] B: I was gonna go to their colleges.
[107:27] A: Nice.
[107:28] B: And like. Because they have their own, like, apartment.
[107:31] A: Oh, beautiful. Okay.
[107:32] B: The graduates go there and you start living on their own independently and.
[107:36] A: Nice.
[107:38] B: So this is what I think I'm gonna do.
[107:40] A: Well, good. Right. And then maybe do some extra schooling or.
[107:43] B: Yeah.
[107:44] A: Yeah. Other than doctor, what other things do you want to do? What's of interest would you, like, generally? Okay.
[107:54] B: I used to do that a lot.
[107:55] A: When I was younger. Yeah.
[107:57] B: Just to, like, write my feelings down. And I even wrote up a whole book, like a notebook. And it was. It looked like a book.
[108:05] A: Wow, that's cool.
[108:07] B: Yeah. I love writing. I did.
[108:09] A: Okay. We don't do so much of it now. No.
[108:12] B: I don't have time.
[108:13] A: You have two children.
[108:14] B: Yeah.
[108:15] A: Right. That's the thing that I'm talking about. They are physically demanding of your time, and you can't plan anything.
[108:21] B: Right.
[108:22] A: Because they take precedence over anything that's going on. Always.
[108:26] B: Yeah. They need my attention. 24.
[108:29] A: Yeah. My wife and I, when we had the kids that were. When we had one that was colicky, we. We would be attentive. And then there was every once in a while where, like, we just needed them to cry themselves to sleep.
[108:40] B: Yeah.
[108:40] A: That we literally had to go out into the garage.
[108:43] B: Yeah.
[108:44] A: To not be in the house to hear it, like.
[108:50] B: Used to drive me crazy.
[108:52] A: Yeah.
[108:53] B: I miss it, though.
[108:55] A: Yeah. Sometimes.
[108:56] B: Yeah.
[108:57] A: I like all the phases. They're all different. They're all enjoyable. Yeah.
[109:02] B: My favorite is the newborn face. Because they sleep.
[109:06] A: Yeah. That doesn't last that long, unfortunately. Yeah. Cool. So is there any other stuff that we didn't get to. That you can think of that we.
[109:23] B: I think that was pretty. Yeah, I think that was it.
[109:28] A: Yeah.
[109:28] B: I mean, I have some problems with relationship.
[109:30] A: How so? What does that mean?
[109:32] B: Like, I keep choosing the wrong men.
[109:37] A: Oh, okay. So the picker's off.
[109:39] B: Yeah.
[109:39] A: Okay.
[109:41] B: Like, my. My two Past relationships. They were abusive.
[109:46] A: Okay.
[109:47] B: And I'm not sure why.
[109:50] A: Oh, I know why. Yeah, I do. Because you never felt like you were worth it.
[109:58] B: Yeah.
[110:00] A: Right. How about right now? Are you worth it to you? Are you worth it to you?
[110:09] B: Yeah.
[110:10] A: See that younger you didn't feel like she was worth it to grandma, mom, dad, uncles. She didn't think she was worth it. How much is that younger you worth it to you?
[110:24] B: A lot.
[110:25] A: She is, isn't she? She's totally worth it to you.
[110:28] B: Yeah.
[110:29] A: Right. So what happens right now when you close your eyes and you picture the younger you who wasn't feeling like she was worth it? Let her know how worth it she is to you. Like so worth it. Right. That she's getting how worth it she is from the one that matters most. Right. How brave, courageous, resilient, strong. Shoot your consciousness into the younger you so that you inhabit her. Worth it to you. Growing her all the way up into the you. Now, from infant stage to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 38, all the way up. All the way up and into you. That's right. Worth it to you. Right. Try to feel like you're not worth it to you. Now, what do you notice? Tia? Try to feel like you're not worth it to you. Now, what do you notice?
[111:51] B: Can't.
[111:52] A: Isn't that cool? Yeah. Notice how different that is?
[111:56] B: It's actually amazing.
[112:00] A: Yeah. Yay. So here's the deal with guys, right? For a woman to have a successful relationship with a man, the woman needs to know that she holds the keys. And what I mean by that is the way that men and women are attracted to each other are very different. So men, us guys, we're attracted to women in a more visual sense because you're beautiful, you're shapely, you're provocative. Your body moves in different ways at different parts. Like, men get turned on by women. Women don't get turned on by men. It's not what the guy. Not just primarily what the guy looks like that might be a part, but it's more of how she feels. Right. A woman actually gets turned on by being a turn on by knowing that he wants me, but knowing he can't have me. Right? That kind of teasy, flirty kind of stuff. So women who have successful relationships with men are women who hold the keys. Hold the keys. Meaning I've got the goods, I've got what the guy is interested in. Because if the guy is interested in me, the guy likes the package that I'm in. He wouldn't be interested in me if he didn't like the package. Because you can tell a guy, I've got the 10 categories that you wanted in a woman. All of them are a match with this one. He goes, yeah, but what does she look like? The woman won't say that. She goes, cool, I'll meet him and then I'll decide. Right? So a woman who has a successful relationship with a man is a woman who holds the keys, meaning she's got the goods, meaning she gets to decide. So the question for is never do I get to be with the guy? It's always, am I going to allow that guy to hang out with me? So a woman who has successful relationships with men is a woman who's a little less available than the guy would want her to be, isn't pursuing the guy. Right. Because the female panther doesn't run down the male panther even when she's in he heat and wanting it. She lets him know I'm approachable, don't come near me if I'm not. But then she makes him work to get me. So we get your worth. Because I'm worth it. Right? He's lucky that I'm gonna allow him to spend time with me because I'm worth it. Got it. So that's how it works for a woman. And she gets to decide always it's on her terms. Right. Women in relationships are regulators, not men. Right. Women are the ones to determine the where, the when, the with whom, the how much, the how often, not men. Because if it's a guy, he's a yes. Yes, Always. Yes, yes, yes. Always, Always. Right? There's not a single time that a gal who has a guy that's into her can go to the guy and be like, hey, you want yes. There's not a single time that he's going to say no. Right. If it's a guy that is into her and she's like, hey, yeah, but we don't have. That's okay. Right? Because the guy is an always yes. So the woman is not an always yes. A woman is a yes when she wants to. She's a no if she doesn't. Right. Women are regulators because women have a body part that sole purpose is sexual pleasure. A guy doesn't. Right. A woman has a lot longer lasting time than a guy. She takes a little longer to warm up. So the guy is the drag racer. 100 yards, it's over. He's done. Done. She's NASCAR. We first turn it on, we Let the engine warm up a little bit. Then we drive slowly around the track. And then we speed up and we finally get to race speed. And then we go 500 laps like, that's the woman. So that's why the woman is the one to determine the where and the when and the with whom. She's the one that decides. She's the one that determines whether she's going to allow him to spend time with her. She's a little busier than he would want. Her life works for her whether she has him in it or not. Right. So he's not something that fills something that's missing. Right. Beautiful sunset. Doesn't need you or I to see it in order for it to be beautiful. You watching a beautiful sunset, don't need anybody with you to enjoy the beauty of the beautiful sunset. You sitting with somebody, maybe sharing some food and watching the beautiful sunset might add to it. But none of it's needed in order for that to be beautiful. So she doesn't need the guy. A woman needs a man about as much as a fish needs a bicycle, which is not at all. I mean, the penis wasn't designed for her pleasure. It was designed to make the baby. Got it. So for you, what's happening is, as you are becoming more worth it to you because you're definitely worth it to your kids, you're going to find yourself both attracting and finding yourself attracted to more of that kind of guy as we are healing those emotional wounds. Right. Predators are only attracted to weakness, not strength. The lion, who might be king of the jungle, doesn't go after the strongest gazelle or the biggest elephant to prove how strong he is. He goes after the weak one. So when those wounds were still open, based on childhood experience and other stuff that had those got right. As those wounds are healed, you're no longer attracting or attractive to predators because you're strong. Got it. And I get more say, right. Then I'm gonna find myself attracting and being more attracted to guys that are. Well, in that they're treating me more in the way that I want to be treated by them. Guy because he's lucky that I'm gonna allow him to spend time with me. Because if he wants to spend time with me, it's because he likes the whole thing. Right. Got it. Does that make sense? Yeah. And that's what there is to do as you weed through relations. So the change that we've done, there's the drastic part, part that you notice, all the past stuff there, it's not troubling you like it was. That's fantastic. But we've also changed the trajectory. So even if two ships set out to sea are on parallel courses and one gets adjusted by a degree at first, it doesn't seem like a lot. But we know that the more they move out into the waters, the bigger the difference. Got it. So your trajectory is distinctly different than what you've gone through, because what you've gone through isn't a part of you and doesn't define you. It's just experiences that you've had that you've gone through that made you stronger and more resilient and brave and courageous to step into this thing that you don't know on your own, with your kids, to look to improve and better your life. Good job. Got it. Cool. All right. Anything else?
[120:05] B: No.
[120:07] A: Okay. Well, you did great. If anything shows up while you're there, reach out to Misty. We can do. Phone, we can do video, we can do. And it won't take as long as this because we've already gotten connected. But you did great today.
[120:21] B: Thank you.
[120:22] A: Yeah, you're welcome. My pleasure. I appreciate it. Absolutely. Yeah. It'll make being at programming way better for you, too.
