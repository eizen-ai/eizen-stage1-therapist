[00:00] A: Today is the 12th of September, and, Shantelle, this is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, that might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work, I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:18] B: Yes. That's okay.
[00:19] A: Cool.
[00:19] B: Awesome.
[00:20] A: So before I move into the kind of what we want to get, I just want to give you a little thought. Okay.
[00:25] B: Let me get comfy real quick.
[00:28] A: So the little thought experiment goes like this. If I were to tell you about falling out of a tree when I was nine years old, and when I did, I broke this arm. If I were to tell you about that right now at almost 49 years old. So almost 40 years later, I was as emotional as when it first happened. You would look at me like I'm crazy. Why is this guy still upset? His arm is fine. Right, Right.
[00:57] B: Okay.
[00:57] A: So for all physical wounds, the saying holds in that time heals all wounds.
[01:05] B: Okay, got it. Yeah.
[01:07] A: But if I told you about what my uncle Mark did to me when I was nine and I started to get all emotional, you'd be like, yeah, of course.
[01:15] B: Okay.
[01:16] A: Isn't that weird?
[01:18] B: Yes.
[01:19] A: That the physical wound heals, but the emotional wound doesn't.
[01:24] B: Okay.
[01:24] A: And it's not that the emotional wound can't heal. The reason that the emotional wound stays stuck on is because we've.
[01:33] B: What?
[01:34] A: Is because when it happened, the brain short circuited emotionally, froze the moment, and then it got disintegrated from the rest of my nervous system. That went forward.
[01:45] B: Then he sent it to me.
[01:46] A: I know up here that it's that I survived it, that I made it through it, that I'm okay. But there's a part of my brain, when it happened, that doesn't have the good news.
[01:59] B: Okay. Makes sense.
[02:00] A: So the error in therapy is that therapists and even lay people, like regular people, think that in order to make it through something, what I do is I bury it. I repress it.
[02:11] B: Yep. Yep.
[02:12] A: I lock it behind closed doors, I put it in the closet, and I go this way. And the therapist thought is, well, if I buried it, we need to help the person dig it out. Meaning get all of the painful emotions and kind of throw it up.
[02:26] B: Right.
[02:26] A: Which after throwing up, you do feel slightly better.
[02:29] B: Right.
[02:30] A: The problem is that you get re triggered by the same shit.
[02:34] B: Makes sense.
[02:35] A: Makes sense.
[02:35] B: Yeah.
[02:36] A: So instead of trying to get the bad feelings out, it's literally the reverse.
[02:42] B: Okay.
[02:43] A: Get the good news in.
[02:45] B: Okay.
[02:46] A: To the parts of the brain that don't know certain experiences stopped. That sounds kind of cool, right?
[02:51] B: Yeah.
[02:52] A: Second, I don't have to be a lot of fun, but I'm hoping sitting here with me in this comfortable room is at least a little more fun than sucky moments.
[03:01] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[03:03] A: Got it.
[03:03] B: Yeah.
[03:04] A: So where I'm interested in is you being here with me because this is okay and that stuff isn't okay. And the error, Chantelle, is that part of your brain doesn't know the difference between the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening.
[03:23] B: That makes sense.
[03:24] A: It's as if the memory is being experienced as the experience.
[03:29] B: Really.
[03:29] A: That's why when I think about it, yeah. I'm reminded of it. Somebody starts talking about it, I start talking about it. It's as if I'm back there in it again.
[03:39] B: That makes sense.
[03:40] A: Makes sense.
[03:40] B: Yeah.
[03:41] A: So what we're interested in doing is getting that part of the brain.
[03:45] B: Okay.
[03:46] A: To know that those awful moments stopped.
[03:49] B: Okay.
[03:50] A: That I survived, that I made it through it, that I'm okay. Because there were moments when I was going through it that I wasn't sure I was gonna make it.
[03:59] B: That's true. Yeah. Yeah.
[04:02] A: So we want to be getting in this kind of good news.
[04:06] B: Okay.
[04:07] A: Once that happens and the memory is unplugged, the pain that was attached to it.
[04:13] B: Okay.
[04:13] A: Goes away.
[04:14] B: Scary. It's still scary.
[04:16] A: I'm like, okay, right. The pain that was attached to it goes away and is gone.
[04:20] B: Okay.
[04:21] A: It doesn't reactivate anymore.
[04:23] B: Now can I ask you a question?
[04:25] A: You can ask me all sorts of questions.
[04:27] B: Is it possible? So like. So this is what concerns me. Is it possible, possible that I have, like. So I don't really. There are things that I'm not sure if I am consciously stopping the memory.
[04:47] A: Or if you just weren't there for it. Cuz you disassociate.
[04:52] B: Because I will react to things like I was sitting at the head of a table and where I'm at, and I would was realizing I'm lashing out at people and I'm not even thinking about anything. And I wrote, I went, maybe I'm associating the head of the table when I'm sitting in it with my adopted family. Because I'm lashing out in anger and I wasn't thinking about anything at that time. I'm getting like redirected about it. Is that possible? That though I don't acknowledge it consciously, my brain is doing it?
[05:23] A: So here's the cool part. Here's the cool part about that. And that is a really good kind of thought process. How come I'm feeling, reacting, saying stuff, and I don't have any, like, real reason? Maybe it lingers to some connections to other stuff. Right. So the cool part is you have a conscious brain.
[05:45] B: Okay.
[05:46] A: Right. And then you have an unconscious brain.
[05:48] B: Okay.
[05:48] A: So think of your conscious brain, the part we kind of think of typically as I or me as a person sitting on top of an elephant.
[05:57] B: Okay.
[05:57] A: Okay.
[05:58] B: Yes.
[05:58] A: The person who sits on top of the elephant feels like they're in control.
[06:02] B: Okay.
[06:03] A: Only when the elephant is doing what they want. So, for example, if they're partnered, and when the person wants the elephant to stop, the elephant stops. When that person wants the elephant to move this way, the elephant moves this way. And when the elephant want, then moves that way.
[06:19] B: Okay.
[06:20] A: So the guy who's on top of the elephant feels like he's totally in control.
[06:24] B: Okay. All right.
[06:25] A: But is he really? No, because what happens is the elephant gets spooked and takes off.
[06:30] B: Oh, yeah.
[06:31] A: That guy's just going along for the ride. Like, there's nothing that guy could do to get the elephant to stop. Right?
[06:36] B: Yeah.
[06:37] A: And if the elephant is stubborn and doesn't want to go anywhere, there's not a lot that guy can do to get the elephant to move. Right. So what we want to be thinking about is there's a whole other part of our brain that directs our automatic, preconscious emotional responses to stuff.
[06:54] B: Okay. Well, I think it's fair to let you know I was told I had a injury in the cognitive part of my brain, which I know is your thought to action. Right. So I don't know that, like, my impulse thinking is what they say. So I'm not sure.
[07:09] A: You may have had a traumatic brain injury.
[07:12] B: Yes.
[07:13] A: That does not discount that we can make changes.
[07:17] B: No, I know.
[07:17] A: Also does not discount that we can lengthen.
[07:21] B: Okay.
[07:21] A: The impulse.
[07:23] B: Cool.
[07:24] A: So that they're less frequent, often less intense.
[07:28] B: Well, I didn't really believe the doctor, so I don't know. I don't know if I'm any different. I can't remember. So it's like, I think I've been this way my whole life.
[07:36] A: And. And again, the coolest part about our brain, and this is really, in the past decade, the research has shown that our brain has what they call neuroplasticity.
[07:50] B: Okay, Cool.
[07:51] A: And what neuroplasticity simply means is that it's the brain's ability to rewire itself. Cool.
[08:00] B: Okay.
[08:00] A: That it's an ongoing, always happening process. Process.
[08:04] B: I believe that. Yeah.
[08:05] A: Right. That all the experiences we go through in life, on purpose or not, cause physical changes in the structure of our brain.
[08:12] B: Really? Okay, cool.
[08:14] A: And that we can rewire it so that it works. Your brain works more in the way that you would be wanting it to.
[08:21] B: All right.
[08:21] A: Automatically.
[08:23] B: Cool.
[08:23] A: Right. So not so much that I've got to be thinking all the time to manage it. I'm in situations. This is what people tell me. And you can ask Tori this question, but what people tell me is that they are in situations that used to produce that and now they're in the same kind of situations, but it's not producing that anymore.
[08:43] B: All right. I'm down.
[08:44] A: Isn't that cool?
[08:45] B: Yeah.
[08:46] A: Those are the things that we want to change.
[08:48] B: Okay.
[08:49] A: Right. That's how we're gonna get it better, and we can do it. I know it sounds crazy because you haven't gone through it yet.
[08:54] B: No, I know. Like, I don't know if I feel like my brain. I feel like it's gonna be tricky, but. Okay.
[08:59] A: But the really cool part of it is it's not up to you.
[09:03] B: Okay.
[09:04] A: To get it better for you.
[09:06] B: All right. Deal.
[09:07] A: It's really up to me.
[09:09] B: All right.
[09:09] A: In collaboration with you.
[09:11] B: Okay.
[09:12] A: In the same way, if you go to a dental hygienist, Right. It's her job to do the teeth cleaning.
[09:18] B: Right.
[09:18] A: In collaboration with you.
[09:21] B: Yeah.
[09:21] A: Right. She doesn't hand you that. A little scrapey tool and say, tooth 14. Go ahead and scrape the elbow. Right. She does it. But she needs your help. If you're like. She can't really get a lockdown. Right. So therefore, we're really doing a collaborative approach. But it's my responsibility to get things better for you secondarily and maybe primarily, it's my job to explain things in a way that makes sense to you.
[09:55] B: Okay.
[09:55] A: So that you're getting it and you're understanding it. All right. If what I'm saying is not making sense, I have lots of ways to say it.
[10:04] B: I'll tell you. Yeah. I like learning. So. Yeah.
[10:11] A: And this stuff is really interesting. And you will notice right away changes in how you feel. Feel.
[10:19] B: Oh, good. Okay, good.
[10:22] A: Right. We'll get done with a process, which is a thing that you normally would never want to think about, because anytime you did, it caused all that stuff.
[10:30] B: Right.
[10:31] A: I'll ask you when we're done. Think about that thing right now on purpose. Try to feel the feelings. And you're like, they're not there anymore. Right. That's the kind of change we're going to be making for you. And that kind of change doesn't require you to be in the distress of what you went through. That's actually counter.
[10:52] B: Okay, see, that's what I was worried about.
[10:54] A: I was like, well, I would imagine most people would be worried because therapy's got a different perspective, a different view, and they think that we've got to get it out of you when what we're really doing is getting the good news in.
[11:09] B: All Right.
[11:10] A: To the part of the brain that don't know certain awful moments are over.
[11:14] B: Okay.
[11:15] A: Right. Yes, That'll be useful.
[11:17] B: Yeah.
[11:17] A: Second part to that is.
[11:21] B: Tell me.
[11:22] A: Yeah. We tend to. Because when we were little children, we were really impressionable.
[11:29] B: Okay.
[11:29] A: Right. People can lie to us, and we don't know the difference when we're little. So they lied to us about the Easter Bunny, they lied to us about the tooth fairy, but we believed it. And heck, when I woke up in the morning and there was, like, you know, a quarter underneath my bed, it must have been the tooth fairy. Couldn't have been my mom that did that. Right. So when we're little, we live in the world. People train us to believe that good things happen because I'm good.
[11:59] B: Okay.
[12:00] A: So I get hugs, I get praise, I get candy, I get cookies. Once a year, some guy, I don't know drops gifts off.
[12:06] B: What if your child's at wasn't like that?
[12:08] A: Yes. But the cultural world still lives in. All the stories, TV shows, books, movies geared for little children reinforced the message that good things happen to good kids. Yeah. When you're being good.
[12:24] B: Yeah.
[12:25] A: Which makes the flip also true.
[12:27] B: Okay.
[12:28] A: Bad things only happen because I am bad. So when I was coloring on the wall with a crayon.
[12:36] B: Yeah.
[12:37] A: And my mom saw it, and she didn't want me coloring on the wall, and she grabbed me and she spanked my hiney and said, bad boy.
[12:45] B: Right.
[12:46] A: My nervous system learned I was doing something I wasn't supposed to do. Mommy got mad, I got spanked.
[12:54] B: Okay.
[12:55] A: What does that lock into me? Bad things happen when I'm bad. Now, as an adult. And you're how old now?
[13:02] B: I'm 33.
[13:04] A: All right, so 33 adult. Right.
[13:07] B: Yeah.
[13:07] A: You know that bad shit can happen to good people without them doing a damn thing wrong.
[13:13] B: Yeah.
[13:13] A: Right?
[13:14] B: Yeah.
[13:14] A: But because we learned that when we were young, that's what stays stuck.
[13:20] B: Okay.
[13:20] A: Does that make sense?
[13:21] B: Yeah. But I like to say if I didn't have bad luck, I'd have no luck at all.
[13:27] A: Right.
[13:27] B: So I tend to not be very positive with myself.
[13:31] A: Yeah. But I wouldn't say it in that way. I would say based on experiences. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to view it that way.
[13:39] B: Okay. Makes sense. Alright. So you get it because other people are like, you can't think like that.
[13:43] A: Like, I've got a buddy on the golf course that says I'd rather be lucky than good.
[13:47] B: Ooh.
[13:48] A: And I say to him, I'd rather be both lucky and good.
[13:52] B: Yeah, I like that one. That's a good one.
[13:54] A: Like if I get to choose, I don't want to be either. Or I'd like to be both, but I don't want to have the bad kind.
[14:02] B: Right.
[14:03] A: As you're putting it. Right. So the thing is, even though I know better, it doesn't feel that way inside. So think of that guy again talking about what happened with his uncle right now. It's been 40 years, so the guy knows up here that what his uncle did to him wasn't really his fault as a little nine year old.
[14:27] B: Okay.
[14:28] A: It was because of uncle and whatever's fucked up. An uncle. Yeah. He knows that some of uncle's touching felt good. Not because he's gay, not because he wanted that from his uncle, but because body parts touched in certain ways are just feel good.
[14:43] B: Oh, yeah. I say that to people. Yeah.
[14:45] A: He knows that. He knows that it's.
[14:48] B: Yeah. Okay.
[14:49] A: He's even done the intellectual work of forgiving uncle for what uncle did to him.
[14:54] B: Yeah. Okay.
[14:55] A: Why inside Chantel, does he still feel the hurt, the guilt, the shame? You would think, right? Once he got it, he would feel different.
[15:06] B: Yeah.
[15:07] A: It doesn't work that way.
[15:09] B: Right? It doesn't.
[15:10] A: It doesn't. So what we're going to be changing is the way the person feels.
[15:15] B: Okay.
[15:16] A: In response to the stuff. Right. The little kid whose parents are divorced and now dad's not around doesn't think my dad not being around is a mom and dad issue. Has nothing to do with my loveability. No little kid is feeling if I mattered more, if I was truly lovable, if I was worth it, my dad would be here.
[15:36] B: Right?
[15:36] A: Right. Dad was supposed to come to the soccer game, but dad never showed. Little kids not thinking, oh, well, you know, dad's probably busy. He's got other stuff. Little kids saying, if I mattered to my dad, if I was truly lovable, if I was worth it, my dad would be here.
[15:55] B: I see my kids.
[15:56] A: So the messages keep getting stuck that it must have something to do with me. So now when we have bad things that happen, that meaning gets attached, which makes me feel a lot of this stuff around, like dirty or worthless or disgust or anger or guilt or shame or regret or remorse or all of the kinds of blah. Yeah, right. And with that stuff on my brain. So think of that more emotional part of our brain is about our survival.
[16:30] B: And.
[16:30] A: And it works on par with an animal brain.
[16:34] B: Oh, yeah. Like the. Right, yeah.
[16:36] A: And an animal brain, the sooner it reacts to threat, the better chance it has to live.
[16:45] B: Yeah.
[16:45] A: So if a rabbit heard a twig snap and took off, that rabbit's got a much better chance of survival than the one who heard the twig snap and thought it was his friend George.
[16:58] B: That makes sense, right? Yeah.
[17:01] A: So with the trauma stuff still active, my brain becomes hyper vigilant and super sensitive. But not in a wide angle lens, in a more narrowed lens, constantly scanning for it.
[17:17] B: Well, yeah, but it's also helped me through a lot of stuff.
[17:19] A: Well, it does, but here's the error. The error is that sometimes, often similar gets confused as same.
[17:30] B: Yeah. So for example, I thought that was my good quality.
[17:35] A: It's useful to be alert and aware. Okay. When I'm looking through that lens, I'm more susceptible to other things happening.
[17:45] B: Oh, that makes sense, because I'm not seeing.
[17:47] A: Seeing the forest, I'm seeing the tree.
[17:52] B: Okay. Makes sense.
[17:53] A: I miss what's on the sides.
[17:55] B: Okay. Yeah.
[17:56] A: Right. So the soldier dives on the ground when the firework explodes in the air. Not because he didn't know it was the fourth of July, not because he didn't know he was at a fireworks celebration. He's actually the guy who lit the fireworks.
[18:14] B: Oh.
[18:15] A: It's because a completely different part of his brain, that more emotional part.
[18:19] B: Okay.
[18:20] A: Confused the sound with mortar. That's why he had that reaction. Okay, flip it around. Think of this guy, that same guy with what happened with Uncle. Now he's making out with his girlfriend, who's he's into, who's into him. And they're both interested in being intimate with each other. And so as they're kissing, she gently touches his inner thigh and he does this. And now he's thinking to himself, what the fuck is wrong with me? The girl who I'm into, who I want to be with, who wants to be with me, is touching me in.
[18:51] B: A way that should feel good, right? Exactly.
[18:54] A: But is there any similarity to his uncle when he was nine to him? Yeah, sure. It's the other part It's a hand on his leg. Yeah. That was grubby sausage finger. Man hand. This is dainty female. Yeah, but hand is hand.
[19:08] B: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[19:10] A: So that stuff stays active in it. Not at a conscious level. Sometimes we're aware of it. Right. Some people go, you know what I know I don't go by that location anymore because that location reminds me of the trip.
[19:21] B: I'm happy.
[19:21] A: Right. Or there was this particular hotel. Anytime encounter that name of that hotel, I got the same kind of stuff, even though it wasn't the same place. Right. There's some similarity. You know, I had a woman one time who was mugged by somebody wearing a hoodie. Now she sees hoodies. She's distressed. Yeah, but the issue wasn't the hoodie.
[19:36] B: Right.
[19:37] A: It was the guy that was wearing it.
[19:38] B: Yeah.
[19:38] A: Right. So all of that stuff goes on for us. Some of it we're consciously aware of. A lot of it's running in the background.
[19:46] B: That makes sense. I think mine's in the background.
[19:48] A: Right. A lot of stuff is running in the background that I don't know. That I don't know.
[19:52] B: Okay.
[19:53] A: Makes sense.
[19:54] B: Yeah.
[19:54] A: We want to unplug it all, because what we do know is that your unconscious knows everything that's happened. It's a warehouse of all the experiences, the good, the bad, the ugly. Whether I think about them or not, whether I was dissociated from them or not, they still happened to my body.
[20:12] B: Okay.
[20:13] A: My body was there even if I was somewhere else.
[20:16] B: Okay.
[20:16] A: Does that make sense?
[20:17] B: Yeah. And I didn't know I disassociated, but I think I did.
[20:20] A: Of course, most people do. In particular, if something has happened more than one time. Right. With the same person.
[20:30] B: Or multiple people.
[20:31] A: Or multiple people. I might be there for the first time, but then my brain takes me away so that I don't have to be there and brings me back when it's over.
[20:43] B: Okay. Makes sense.
[20:44] A: Right. That's a survival process mechanism, so. So that I don't have to be there for what's going on with my body. I had a woman one time that I worked with. She was in, like, a prison camp situation in a different country, and one of the guys was about to torture her. He had a large cigar, and he had lit it and he was puffed on it. Now he's got the ambers, and he's bringing the cigar close to her cheek. She felt the warmth of the ambers and then she was gone.
[21:14] B: Really?
[21:15] A: She was no longer in her body.
[21:16] B: But what if you what if your brain is different and you're conscious for it all and you just accept it as.
[21:23] A: That's a different thing too. Again, sometimes the fastest way to get something over is to not fight it.
[21:32] B: Yeah, yeah.
[21:33] A: Because fighting it gets me hurt worse.
[21:36] B: Yep, exactly.
[21:37] A: You follow me? So sometimes the best way to get it over is to not fight.
[21:42] B: Yeah.
[21:43] A: Not because I wanted it to happen, but because. Because it was the fastest way to get it over. So sometimes I might be there.
[21:54] B: Okay.
[21:54] A: But I might not fully be there.
[21:56] B: Okay.
[21:57] A: I might be there and I might know that it's going on, but I might not be fully feeling all of what's going on in my body as it's happening. Right. So that, that kind of stuff, for that woman, it brought her back when it was over.
[22:10] B: Okay, makes sense.
[22:12] A: She could see that she had burned, but she didn't know that she was burned. She had felt the warmth, she didn't know how many times. Right. Because she wasn't present as it was going on. Not that her body wasn't there, but she was kind of disassociated from it. So that's a really common, common thing.
[22:32] B: Okay.
[22:33] A: The cool part is now that's all information.
[22:36] B: Right.
[22:37] A: As I said to you at the beginning, nobody would care about any of the shit that happened to me if it wasn't negatively affecting now.
[22:46] B: Yep, that makes a lot of sense.
[22:47] A: So what do we want to do? We want to make some adjustments so that now is better. Right. So some people that come into me, they say to me that they're much more on edge. They're more easily irritated, agitated, aggravated. They're more quick, they're short tempered, they're reactive. They say shit, they do shit that later on they're like, I wish I hadn't said or done that. They don't want to be feeling like that. And that's one of the things. They want to get better.
[23:13] B: That's what I want, to get better.
[23:14] A: Yeah. Cool. Some people come in and they go, well, for me, I'm more nervous, tense, jittery, anxious. I get racing thoughts. Sometimes those racing thoughts happen and they affect me sleeping at night because they're just. Yeah. Sometimes it moves into full fledged panic. Sometimes it's in certain social situations where I'm really concerned about what others are thinking about me or whether I'll say the right thing or, or, or I got all of that discomfort. Yeah, they don't want to be feeling like that. They want to get that better.
[23:42] B: Okay.
[23:43] A: Right. Other people come in and go, you Know what? For me, I get it. There's a whole shitload of stuff that's happened. And although lots of it is over and may have been over for a long time, having gone through it, still underneath the surface continues to affect me, and I'd like to get the effect that that's had gone.
[24:02] B: Okay.
[24:03] A: Right. Some people come in and they go, you know what? For me, it's more grief and loss. There are people that I was really close to that had died, and now anytime I think about them, and I'm still caught in the whole pain of the loss, like, I'd like that to stop. Some people come in and they go, you know what? For me, it's more that I'm down. Like, I used to have a little bit more possessed and energy in doing things. Now I'm, like, having a hard time even staying motivated to do things that I know I like.
[24:30] B: Okay.
[24:31] A: They'd like that. To get better. Some people go. For me, I got problematic urges, cravings, desires around using. I'd like that to stop. So those are the broad categories of what we can actually get better.
[24:44] B: Okay.
[24:44] A: That being said, Chantelle, I'd really be interested in understanding what is it that you would be wanting our time to do for you?
[24:52] B: What do we actually want to get better? I would like a combination.
[24:56] A: Cool. Well, then you're at the right place, because those are all things that I know how to get better.
[25:00] B: I'm like, I can't. And I don't mean. I laugh when I get nervous. But as you're saying this, I'm like, is there a combo? Like.
[25:08] A: Yeah. No.
[25:08] B: Right. Is that a lot?
[25:10] A: Right. So notice that in each one of those arenas, you can kind of see.
[25:15] B: Yeah.
[25:16] A: That I've been impacted. And I'd like that kind of stuff to get.
[25:19] B: Yeah, I do.
[25:21] A: Yeah.
[25:21] B: Okay, cool.
[25:22] A: Yeah. Because what's been going on is that it happens to you. One, at times that you don't want it to.
[25:30] B: Yeah.
[25:30] A: Two, sometimes more intensely than you want it to. Right. Sometimes more frequent. Sometimes it lasts longer than you would be wanting it to. We want to get all of that stuff adjusted.
[25:42] B: Yeah.
[25:42] A: So for you, do you have difficulty resting, sleeping at night?
[25:47] B: Some nights, yeah.
[25:48] A: Do you get nightmares or night terrors? You know, bad dreams? Did those show up?
[25:54] B: Sometimes, yeah.
[25:55] A: Okay.
[25:57] B: I actually had to start taking. Now I still wake up on it. Like, right before I came to see you, I woke up a lot. But then last night, I was okay with it. So I didn't wake up but, like, twice. But for some reason, I'll have dreams and I'll wake up. Like, I don't really. I. Some of my dreams are really bad. And then some of them I don't recall, but I know I'm constantly waking up looking at the clock.
[26:22] A: Got it. Okay. So we want nighttime.
[26:25] B: Yeah.
[26:25] A: To be where you can peacefully and effortlessly rest.
[26:29] B: Yeah. And I won't think about anything before I go to bed, so I'm not sure what Eric comes from, but it's all.
[26:35] A: So, again, dreams tend to be unconscious processing that can loop on itself.
[26:41] B: Okay. I had the same dream over and over when I got there, so that makes sense. And I don't know why I kept having it, but I did, and I kept. I kept dreaming about the same thing.
[26:48] A: And I'll give you the other really interesting thought for you.
[26:52] B: Okay.
[26:53] A: Why, when it comes to unwanted feelings.
[26:57] B: Mm.
[26:58] A: Isn't actually the right question.
[27:01] B: What do you mean?
[27:02] A: No, it's a weird thing that I just said. Normally, to solve most problems, we want to understand why I'm like this way. Why do I have these feelings? Why do I react to things like this? Why do I have those kinds of thoughts? Right. We think that if I understood it, then I could begin to work on it to change it.
[27:23] B: Yes.
[27:24] A: However, that's not the case for feelings.
[27:28] B: Okay.
[27:29] A: Because feelings don't get better by knowing why. For example, I can know what my triggers are.
[27:36] B: Yeah.
[27:36] A: I can know why I have them.
[27:38] B: Yeah.
[27:38] A: I can know where the triggers came from.
[27:40] B: Yeah.
[27:41] A: I can do my best to avoid situations, but I can't avoid all. And I still get triggered, even though I know why.
[27:49] B: Exactly.
[27:50] A: So the cool part is why is actually a symptom of the problem, not on the road to the solution. When things go great for people and they're feeling really up, do they spend a lot of time trying to figure out why?
[28:07] B: No.
[28:07] A: Gosh, I'm having a great day. I feel so awesome. I wonder how this relates back to the shit that happened to me. Doesn't go on.
[28:14] B: Right.
[28:15] A: Because what's going on when we're in inquiry is we're no longer being present.
[28:21] B: Oh.
[28:21] A: We're, like, in past, trying to figure out so I can in the future be different.
[28:26] B: You see? Yeah.
[28:27] A: Follow me.
[28:27] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[28:28] A: So where we're headed is for you, who's much more emotionally present.
[28:35] B: Okay, cool.
[28:36] A: Here.
[28:37] B: All right, I'm down. Okay.
[28:38] A: Dealing with what is going on without the negative effect of what has.
[28:43] B: Okay.
[28:44] A: She's gained the strength and wisdom that happens in making it through difficult scenarios.
[28:51] B: Right.
[28:52] A: Fully integrated.
[28:54] B: Okay.
[28:54] A: But the you that I'm seeing is a lot lighter. She's a lot more uptight.
[28:59] B: Okay, cool.
[29:01] A: This is where we're headed.
[29:02] B: All right.
[29:02] A: Got it. And again, the question isn't the how it's gonna happen that we get you here.
[29:07] B: Okay.
[29:07] A: It's more would it be okay?
[29:09] B: Yeah.
[29:09] A: Notice how it's already showing up.
[29:13] B: They say I have a lot of self awareness. And I say that doesn't really help me though because I still drive 90 miles an hour into a tree. Like where does itself. Like for me, it's like I can be aware of certain things, but I'm not. It doesn't always serve me.
[29:26] A: Got it.
[29:26] B: Because I'm not sure how to buy it.
[29:29] A: So now what we're also going to be adding. Because that was really useful information you just gave me.
[29:35] B: Really.
[29:35] A: Because we want to also slow things down inside.
[29:40] B: Okay.
[29:41] A: So that. That's quieter.
[29:43] B: Okay.
[29:43] A: Cool.
[29:44] B: I'm down.
[29:45] A: Makes sense.
[29:45] B: Yeah. Cuz I. Yeah.
[29:46] A: I think this is where we're headed.
[29:48] B: Yeah.
[29:49] A: Right. And I bet right now you could think about any of the yucky stuff that's happened and feel just a little bit of the bad feelings.
[29:56] B: Oh, yeah.
[29:56] A: Notice how it doesn't take a long time.
[29:58] B: Yeah.
[29:59] A: Right.
[30:00] B: Yes. Unfortunately, yes.
[30:01] A: But interestingly enough, you did it on purpose.
[30:05] B: Really?
[30:05] A: Well, I just asked you to. You did it.
[30:07] B: Yeah. Right. So it's a jerk. Yes.
[30:10] A: Interesting. Right. Chantel, that wouldn't actually be a problem for you.
[30:14] B: Yeah.
[30:15] A: If it only helps happened when you chose to do it.
[30:18] B: Okay. All right.
[30:20] A: The problem is that your brain does that kind of stuff to you.
[30:24] B: Yeah.
[30:24] A: At times that you're not choosing.
[30:27] B: Yes.
[30:28] A: That's the error.
[30:29] B: Okay.
[30:30] A: Right. So the you that I'm seeing when we're done, that kind of feeling around that kind of stuff, this you, she remembers having had it.
[30:39] B: Okay.
[30:39] A: But if you asked her to get it, she would not have get it.
[30:42] B: All right.
[30:43] A: The you that I'm seeing, that stuff's like clear as gold.
[30:45] B: Yeah.
[30:46] A: Right. So that she's present, she's free, she's much more at peace.
[30:50] B: Okay. I feel like I just won the jackpot.
[30:54] A: The lingering painful emotions, the hurt, the anger, the resentment, the sadness, the grief, the guilt, the shame. That's all like cleared.
[31:03] B: Okay.
[31:04] A: So that you're much more present.
[31:06] B: I.
[31:07] A: Right.
[31:08] B: I never been that so.
[31:09] A: Well, I'm sure. Right. And the other part that you said to me up front is you have a little bit of a recognition that it was the circumstances, situations and things that I got put into born to those parents Having that kind of stuff that led to this. That led to this. That led to that. That led to that. That led to that. Right. That kind of set me down a path.
[31:32] B: Mm.
[31:33] A: Right. That I didn't get to decide.
[31:35] B: Mm. Yeah.
[31:37] A: Kind of like things just fell into.
[31:38] B: Yeah.
[31:39] A: Right. So the really cool part is you're here now. You've gone to the assessment house. You're looking right now at changing how life has been.
[31:51] B: Yes.
[31:52] A: So that it works in a new and better way for you.
[31:54] B: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[31:55] A: You follow me with that?
[31:57] B: Yes. Yes.
[31:57] A: Which means. Means you're in the process of co creating how you want your life to go.
[32:04] B: Yay. Okay, cool.
[32:06] A: Right. Which is very different than falling into how it was.
[32:11] B: Yeah.
[32:12] A: Yeah. And that's really cool.
[32:14] B: Yeah, I like the sound of that.
[32:16] A: This is where we're headed. Is a you who's much more uptime present, outwardly focused.
[32:23] B: Yes.
[32:23] A: Her mind is more quiet. She's not spending much time thinking or feeling about herself. She's free from the negative effect that the prior stuff is added.
[32:32] B: Okay.
[32:32] A: She's much more present.
[32:34] B: Yes.
[32:34] A: She's lighter and a little bit easier on herself.
[32:37] B: Yay. Okay.
[32:38] A: Got it.
[32:39] B: Yeah. Now I'm excited.
[32:40] A: I bet. Right? See, the coolest part is the scariest part would be thinking this is anything similar to what you've done before.
[32:49] B: Yeah, that's.
[32:51] A: I don't like people to feel shitty when they're with me.
[32:53] B: Yeah.
[32:54] A: I really like people to feel good.
[32:55] B: Okay, good. Because I was like, I don't think.
[32:58] A: And I'm hoping. Hoping with all my might that I can be just a little bit more enjoyable than worst moments of your life. I'm hoping to be here just a little bit more enjoyable. So already we're on our way because you and I are connecting and collaborating towards a mutual goal that we're both interested in and excited about getting to.
[33:23] B: Yes.
[33:24] A: Got it.
[33:24] B: Yes. Yep.
[33:26] A: So just by creating this. Right. So again, in order to get somewhere, we first need to know where we're going.
[33:36] B: Okay.
[33:36] A: Like, if I said to you, go ahead, get in the car, start driving, like, all right, I go three hours, hours from now, I'm gonna tell you where to go. You might go. I'll stop. Because I could drive in the wrong direction. Yeah, right.
[33:50] B: Yeah.
[33:51] A: So in order to get anywhere, we first need to know where we're going.
[33:54] B: Okay.
[33:54] A: Second, we also need to know that it's okay to get there.
[33:58] B: Okay. Yeah.
[34:00] A: Right. Like, if somebody said, hey, do you want to go on a plane flight to California? Yeah, sure. Well, you know, after we get to Cal, California, we're going to keep going and crash into the, you know, Pacific Ocean.
[34:12] B: Yeah, yeah.
[34:13] A: No, I don't think I want to go anymore. Right. Like, because once you know where it's going and it's okay. Right. We get to align towards it. That's what's starting to happen now. So again, the you that I'm seeing, she's much more emotionally present.
[34:29] B: Okay.
[34:29] A: She's much more uptime and outwardly focused.
[34:32] B: Okay.
[34:33] A: There's much more sense of comfort and ease in her own skin. She's gained all the strength and she feels it. She's free from the effect that the.
[34:43] B: Past stuff has had.
[34:46] A: So it's no longer running that programming and she's in the process of co creating how she wants her life to move forward in a new and better way.
[34:56] B: Yes.
[34:57] A: This is the you that I'm seeing.
[34:58] B: Okay, Got it. Yes.
[34:59] A: You, by the way, don't have to see this future you just like I am.
[35:03] B: Okay.
[35:04] A: But I want you to know I'm seeing the end result, this future you as clearly as I'm seeing you in front of me.
[35:11] B: All right, Deal.
[35:12] A: Got it. So my question isn't once again, how it's gonna happen that we get to hear it's would it be okay?
[35:18] B: Yeah.
[35:19] A: Yeah. Now here's a cool part. Brain is very responsive to symptoms. The reason I know this is advertisers use them.
[35:28] B: Okay.
[35:29] A: If you see a big yellow arch on the side of the road, you immediately think of McDonald's.
[35:33] B: Yeah.
[35:34] A: If you see a swoosh mark on somebody's shoe, you immediately think of Nike. Yeah, but what does this, the swoosh sign or the golden arch have anything to do with cheeseburgers or sneakers? They're symbols for the company. We want to get a way to symbolize the future you.
[35:56] B: Okay.
[35:57] A: Which we could use a wild animal. We could use something out in nature. We could use something up in the sky. We could use a natural formation of the earth, something that grows from the ground. But we want to make it up to symbolize the future you, who's present, who's at peace, who's free, who's clear.
[36:14] B: Okay.
[36:14] A: Right. And if we think of this, you symbolizing it as a wild animal, animals, something out in nature, something up in the sky. What comes to mind to symbolize the future? You.
[36:24] B: Me?
[36:25] A: Yeah.
[36:25] B: The chakra. So the guy that's sitting with all the color, like, you know what I'm talking about?
[36:32] A: Yeah, yeah. Like a. A Buddhist, meditative.
[36:35] B: Yeah. With all Each color that entails something and when they line.
[36:40] A: Yeah.
[36:41] B: Does that make sense? That's what came to my head.
[36:43] A: Powerful. And the coolest part is your mind selected it for you.
[36:49] B: Yeah.
[36:49] A: Just like a lock is able to produce the perfect key to open it.
[36:53] B: Yeah.
[36:54] A: Your mind created the perfect symbol. I could have given you one. Advertisers do it.
[36:58] B: Oh, cool.
[36:58] A: But your mind selected.
[37:00] B: I wonder why I picked that.
[37:01] A: It doesn't matter.
[37:03] B: Everything's in alignment.
[37:05] A: Because it's a symbol to symbolize the future you. All of that and you being in alignment.
[37:12] B: Yeah.
[37:12] A: Got it. So then I'm gonna give you a small little homework assignment.
[37:16] B: Okay.
[37:16] A: In between now and when we get back together, it's not gonna take you a long time.
[37:20] B: Okay.
[37:21] A: If you were to do it 10 times a day, it might take you like, I don't know, a minute and a half.
[37:28] B: Okay.
[37:29] A: Right.
[37:29] B: Okay.
[37:30] A: Very simple. But I'm gonna describe how we do it, then you'll know how it's done.
[37:34] B: Okay.
[37:35] A: And then we'll do it together.
[37:36] B: Okay.
[37:36] A: So what you'll do is you'll sit with both feet on the floor.
[37:39] B: Okay.
[37:40] A: You'll look up and out just with your eyes, not with your head, and you'll think that Buddha with the rainbow of colors. As you do it, you're going to take a slow, deep breath in. You don't have to do it yet.
[37:53] B: Okay.
[37:53] A: And then you're going to exhale and close your eyes.
[37:56] B: Okay.
[37:57] A: You keep your eyes closed as you slowly breathe in. And then as you exhale, you allow your eyes to open.
[38:05] B: Okay.
[38:06] A: So look up and out. Think Buddha. Take a slow breath in. And then exhale and close your eyes. Good. Keeping your eyes closed, breathe in. And then when you're ready about your eyes to open as you exhale, that small little process, like I said, took us maybe six to 10 seconds. If you did it 10 times a day, it might take a full minute to. Every time you think of that Buddha with the rainbow of colors and being in alignment, it's telling that other part of your brain, the elephant part, to begin to set up and organize towards this future me so that when we get back together, we can move in a more accelerated pace. We're gonna do all sorts of processes as we go to do healing that will have your body. When we deal with troubling stuff, stay in a more calm, neutral state.
[39:18] B: Really? Okay, cool.
[39:21] A: That's how we're gonna get things better.
[39:23] B: Yay.
[39:24] A: Because again, the deal is part of your brain doesn't know that moments are Over.
[39:29] B: Okay.
[39:31] A: We want that part of the brain to know that certain awful moments are over.
[39:35] B: Okay. Yes.
[39:37] A: Right. So that as we stay here, your brain can't continue to read those memories as happening now. Right. Once the brain reads it as information, the memories unplugged, the pain goes away. What I know up here then filters so that I feel it in here. Right. Because a lot of times I can know better but not feel different.
[40:10] B: Yep, exactly.
[40:11] A: That's what we're changing.
[40:13] B: Okay.
[40:14] A: Does that make sense?
[40:15] B: Yeah, absolutely. I want to try it. Yeah. Okay.
[40:18] A: Yeah. Yeah. And again, it's a collaborative process with you and I. Yeah. Working towards that future you that's now been symbolized by that Buddha.
[40:28] B: I know. This is really big. I'm like, why did I pick that thing?
[40:32] A: Here's the coolest part. You did.
[40:34] B: My brain did.
[40:35] A: Yes, I know.
[40:37] B: Of course my brain did.
[40:38] A: It was so complex, what your brain will respond to.
[40:44] B: Wow.
[40:44] A: It created the perfect symbol.
[40:47] B: That's so cool.
[40:48] A: Isn't that cool?
[40:48] B: Yeah.
[40:49] A: Because here's the other part in the last little piece I'll leave you with. Your brain, that unconscious elephant part, totally wants to work in ways that are best for you.
[41:01] B: Yeah.
[41:02] A: It hasn't always. Not because it can't.
[41:05] B: Okay.
[41:06] A: But because of glitches and errors and malfunctions in the way the complicated supercomputer that is your brain has been working, and it's had a lot of times that it's gotten dropped, kicked, punched, thrown, slapped.
[41:20] B: Yep.
[41:20] A: So, Right. If I took a hammer, I could toss it across the yard. We could go pick it up. Up. And still use it to hit nails.
[41:27] B: Right.
[41:27] A: We don't want to do that with our laptop. Got it. So we know that there's been a whole bunch of shit that's happened that's kind of dinged.
[41:38] B: Yeah. Right? Yeah.
[41:41] A: We're gonna tune it up.
[41:42] B: All right, cool.
[41:43] A: We're gonna polish it. We're gonna make it so that it optimizes and works more in the way that you want it to.
[41:49] B: Okay.
[41:50] A: Yeah.
[41:50] B: Yeah.
[41:50] A: So this is where we're headed.
[41:52] B: Okay.
[41:52] A: Cool.
[41:53] B: Cool.
[41:53] A: And then we get back together on Friday.
[41:55] B: Yeah.
[41:55] A: I don't normally get to have somebody first part of the week.
[41:58] B: Yeah, I know.
[41:59] A: Yeah. So it's gonna be great.
[42:00] B: I know.
[42:00] A: So in between now and when we get back together.
[42:03] B: Yep.
[42:04] A: Different times throughout your day. Not when you're in stress mode. Not when you're in anger mode. Right. So Would be useful to do when you wake up in the morning. Would be useful to do maybe after Lunch would be useful to do maybe as I'm going to bed.
[42:20] B: Right.
[42:21] A: Right. Not when I'm in the middle of a stressful situation or I'm in group or somebody just triggered me and I'll not using that.
[42:28] B: Okay.
[42:30] A: But more when I'm gonna think about that Buddha. I'm gonna take a slow breath in.
[42:35] B: Okay.
[42:35] A: I look up as I do it. I breathe in. I exhale. I close my eyes. I keep my eyes closed as I breathe in. And then as I exhale, I allow my eyes to open just like this.
[42:51] B: Cool.
[42:52] A: And then what that does, just to give you the background, it literally creates formatting.
[42:58] B: Really?
[42:59] A: So I don't know if you can remember back in computers used to have floppy disks.
[43:04] B: Yeah, I remember.
[43:05] A: And you used to put it into the computer and it would say, would you like me to flip format the disk? Which basically meant create partitions so that data could get installed. Yeah, Same kind of thing. Every time you think of the symbol symbolizing the future, you is creating formatting so that when we get back together, we can move in a way.
[43:31] B: Yeah.
[43:31] A: And do it in a way that doesn't require you to re experience or relate any of the yucky stuff. Because our intention is that you stay with me. And if I in any way, shape or form, because I pay attention to this notice that you might be going there. I'm going to do everything I can and everything I know to make sure you're with me.
[43:48] B: Okay.
[43:48] A: Cool. Because I'm more fun.
[43:49] B: Cool.
[43:50] A: Got it.
[43:50] B: Yes.
[43:51] A: All right. Come with me. We will head on out here.
