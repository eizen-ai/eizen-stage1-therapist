[00:01] A: Thank you. Thank you. So, yeah. So today is the 16th of September, Chantelle. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. You know, that given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative. The recording might be made available in teaching and training others in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:20] B: It's cool.
[00:20] A: Okay.
[00:21] B: Awesome.
[00:22] A: So going back to. Why does getting yourself cold, cooling off also cool you down? Think of somebody when they're angry. They're a hot head.
[00:33] B: Yeah.
[00:34] A: Right.
[00:34] B: Yeah.
[00:35] A: And when somebody's like, you know, like, you know, they're cool. Right.
[00:40] B: Yeah.
[00:42] A: So you're literally using the physical way to change the emotional circuit because they're the same circuitry.
[00:50] B: Wow.
[00:50] A: That's why somebody doesn't have a spider phobia. Who experiences spider is really small and across the room. Right. People who do spiders for them seem to be close and bigger.
[01:02] B: Yeah.
[01:02] A: Right. Like, have you ever heard somebody use the phrase, they were in my face?
[01:07] B: Yes.
[01:08] A: Right. And that doesn't mean they were right.
[01:10] B: Here, but it really feels like they're right there.
[01:14] A: Got it. So our body talks way. We speak very literally.
[01:19] B: Right.
[01:20] A: What you recognized is that your triggers are turned up too high. So the sensitivity needles are way up here. And then your reactivity.
[01:31] B: Yeah.
[01:32] A: Is more than you want it to be.
[01:34] B: Yeah. But I never did that before, Selah, because I was just, like, numbing everything by using. Yeah, I would. It was. Yeah. But it got to the point, what was the drug?
[01:46] A: A choice.
[01:47] B: So I was a combination of drug disease.
[01:49] A: Well, I mean, you might as well, because that's gonna, you know, I like slow and high, but it's going to not be a one plus one equals two.
[01:57] B: Yeah.
[01:58] A: It's a like 11.
[01:59] B: Yeah. So, yeah, it was bad. Like, I liked to use accelerants sometimes, but I couldn't do them without the low because I would go way too high.
[02:10] A: And if I smoke, what's an accelerant?
[02:12] B: Like methamphetamine.
[02:14] A: You're going away.
[02:14] B: Yeah. I used to smoke Crackle Cane. I don't. I didn't do that anymore. I gave that up.
[02:18] A: And then for lent. Well, that was a good decision. Yeah.
[02:27] B: I used to do heroin. I won't do it anymore.
[02:30] A: Good job. That's a good decision, too.
[02:31] B: Yes. Horrible things would happen, and I would see characteristics of people or lose friends, and I would see, like. So it was weird. My person, like, person personal, I think experience with the drug, if something happened to which didn't suit what I felt like I wanted the world to be like. Or I wanted to be like, I got rid of it. So I would learn through experience. And then I'd be like, oh, no, I do not like that feeling. But it would take, like, a lot of stuff to happen for me to.
[03:04] A: Give it up, for you to go, oh, I get it. Oh, oh, that one's not good for me. Oh, okay, don't do that.
[03:10] B: Oh, but this one's okay because it's from the doctor. You know what I mean? Like, I would rationalize, but what would happen was I felt like I could not deal with life without it because it made my thought, my life better. But I realized that I. What brought me to Selah is that I knew I had to work through all that stuff because I had become the monsters I endured.
[03:33] A: Yeah, yeah, we don't like that.
[03:35] B: No. And I. And you know, I realized you can't reach anybody because those people are so smart and they don't get it. And the world, I feel like, doesn't let sometimes you be anything more than what you were conditioned to. Does that make sense?
[03:48] A: 100%. Yeah. It's the thing that I talk about all the time.
[03:51] B: Really?
[03:52] A: Right on, right on. Paid border.
[03:55] B: So for me to get to the people I cared about and do what I wanted to do in the world, I knew I had to walk my walk out. Like, I had to literally go and change my life around 100%. Not just for. For me, but for what I felt called to do because I had tried to die. Literally, I. I did it on purpose. And I was dead for over 40 minutes. And when I came back, I came back angry and I was alive.
[04:23] A: Mother fucker.
[04:25] B: Yeah. God damn it. And you know what? God. And God, every time I would try that, he'd be like, nope, not yet. Not yet. And so when I looked around your time, sorry, and everybody was like, hysterical, you know, And I knew that he didn't do what he was supposed to bring back. So he was like, I don't even know how you're here right now, but it wasn't the first time I experienced something like that. So that was a pivotal point for me. And then I realized that this world, I'm not unique in my suffering. Does that make sense?
[04:59] A: Good job.
[05:00] B: Yeah. Sorry if I took us way off track.
[05:02] A: No, you're. We're right on track.
[05:04] B: Everybody has been through suffering something similar to me. And when we personalize things like I was. I was making it like I was the only victim. And the sad thing is Is that I don't want to get emotional about this, but sad thing is, I'm nowhere near unique. And that's the part that I want to change.
[05:20] A: That's the horrific part, isn't it?
[05:22] B: And it's sad because we should be different than we are. But there's a lot working on us. Yeah.
[05:29] A: Like we're working on.
[05:31] B: I'm working on it. I know that. Like, I've had so.
[05:34] A: How cool.
[05:35] B: Yeah.
[05:36] A: Chantel. That. That's what shifted. And now you're interested in changing the change life for the better.
[05:44] B: Isn't that weird? No, it's awesome because I didn't have this.
[05:48] A: Right. But see what you just said, like that society kind of doesn't allow people to get out of the way. That. Yeah. The way that I say it is you got born into an environment that didn't have choices.
[06:03] B: That's right.
[06:04] A: That led you down certain things. And we may have said, oh, I chose to do this instead of that, but I didn't. But no, no. It's a controlled choice. And I'll give you what I mean by that. If I have two outfits.
[06:16] B: Yeah.
[06:16] A: Right. And I say to my child, which outfit would you like to wear? And my child picks that one.
[06:24] B: Yeah.
[06:25] A: Great. You can wear that one. My child feels like they got independence. They got to decide. But the choices were the ones that I already decided I was okay with them wearing.
[06:40] B: You know what's crazy?
[06:40] A: Do you follow me now?
[06:41] B: Yeah. Yeah. And when my son was one, I would bring him over to his closet and I'd sit and pick. I thought what he wanted to wear. I'd be like, what do you want to wear? I never like. It's so crazy you say that.
[06:53] A: Right.
[06:54] B: Because I was encouraging him to know that he could do anything and everything in the world. That was the most important thing to me. I didn't care what color he liked. I did not try to. I wanted my son at 16 years old to experience life in full. Like music. He could do anything. I was not gonna stop him or tell him he couldn't. So at like one, I'd be like, what do you want to wear in his closet? And he would touch it, and I would just act like he chose.
[07:19] A: Yeah, right.
[07:20] B: Is that weird?
[07:21] A: No. No. See, again, shaytelle. All of that. So you got born into an environment that led to the coolest thing about all of it right now is that now you're in a process of co creating a completely different future. Way better than what you've gone through. Right. That's what's going on now. And I get to kind of be involved in your co creating a life way better than okay, that's cool.
[07:58] B: I like how you say that. That was a word I was trying to find in the car ride. I was like, yeah, he told me this cool thing. What was it? Co creating. Okay, now remember, that's cool. I talked to Christine about you.
[08:11] A: Oh, good.
[08:12] B: Did she tell you?
[08:13] A: I didn't see her this week. This week has been a full week on my calendar.
[08:18] B: I said, well, you wanna know what I asked her? I'll tell you because I'm an honest person. I was like, I feel like when he moves his hands, it's supposed to do something to my brain. And she's like, yeah, you're right. I said, but I also felt like the reason why you were passionate about what you're doing is because you either endured or somebody you love did and you wanna make a change. I could be wrong.
[08:40] A: Well, I will tell you that I didn't go through the kinds of stuff that some people. But I got. I got horrible. I'm a highly sensitive person.
[08:53] B: Empath.
[08:53] A: Yeah, empath. Indigo child. Highly sensitive, but not so cool as a young boy who in the. Again, not the town that I grew up in. My mom was a single mom. Nobody else was. My dad wasn't present. I was highly emotional. I got picked on. Picked at. I would cry and go underneath the teacher. Like in fourth grade, go underneath the teacher's desk crying. Like that's not like those. So I Do I get trauma?
[09:25] B: Absolutely.
[09:26] A: Sure. What has it been? At the extent. But the coolest part is I Learned like almost 20 years ago now.
[09:34] B: Yeah.
[09:35] A: That there's a different way to heal emotional wounds.
[09:40] B: It's still the same thing though. I could feel that. It doesn't matter. I think the extent of trauma.
[09:45] A: That's the coolest part. What you just said earlier. I'm telling you, you have all this aligned because you go, I'm not alone in having experienced this kind of pain.
[09:56] B: Yes.
[09:57] A: And for so long in my life, I felt I'm the only fucking one experience this pain. Yeah.
[10:04] B: See, But I could tell that, like, I didn't know. I said, I don't know what it is, but when he talks, I feel like he has experienced something. And I was like. I was watching him and I was trying to see if we were gonna. And he's like, well, she said, that's what he's doing too. And I was like, yeah. But I felt like he was that something in his life had to impact that choice. And that's why I was like, yeah, okay, I'll listen to you. Right. Like, I could tell, though, seriously. At least that's what I thought. I don't know. It could be crazy.
[10:33] A: Well, I can tell you there's nothing better than having somebody who has something that anytime they think about it, they feel all this to be able to work with them in a painless way, unplug it, so that then afterwards you ask them to try to get the bad feelings and they can't.
[10:49] B: Right.
[10:49] A: That's the coolest thing in the world.
[10:50] B: Well, I trust you. That was the big thing. Because at first I was like, don't trust me.
[10:55] A: No, I want you to trust you.
[10:58] B: I trust that what we're gonna do together is gonna help me. I believe that.
[11:02] A: Okay, good. So. But here, this is the thing.
[11:05] B: Yeah.
[11:05] A: It's not trust me. It's trust in you that you're clear that what we're doing today is in alignment with what both of us want for you.
[11:17] B: Okay.
[11:18] A: Right. So the shift is we think in life that I need to learn how to trust somebody else.
[11:22] B: Yeah.
[11:23] A: But there's a bad thing with that. What if you think the other person will always have your best interest in mind.
[11:29] B: Yes.
[11:30] A: That's a bad idea.
[11:31] B: Okay.
[11:32] A: Because they'll have your best interest as long as theirs match yours.
[11:36] B: Oh, that makes sense. Okay.
[11:37] A: Yeah.
[11:38] B: Like when I have unrealistic expectations of people and I get frustrated now, I don't do that anymore.
[11:43] A: But.
[11:43] B: Yeah. Because it's not what I would do.
[11:45] A: So if somebody has your best interest in mind and yours fits, you go down the path this way.
[11:52] B: Yeah.
[11:53] A: But as soon as they don't.
[11:55] B: Yeah.
[11:55] A: They're not on. They don't have your best interest anymore. So we. I say that. Not that we can't be building a connection in this relationship where both you and I are open and present and interested in causing change for you. Right. That's totally what we're doing.
[12:12] B: Yeah.
[12:12] A: We're connecting in that way.
[12:14] B: But you don't want me to be dependent on that.
[12:15] A: Doesn't require you trusting me.
[12:17] B: Oh, okay.
[12:18] A: See, it doesn't require you trusting me at all. Because what you keep paying attention to M I I talking my walk. Am I walking my talk? Right. So that what we're doing is this thing is collaborative together towards what we want for you.
[12:36] B: Yeah. Well, you came at the right time. Because I was like. I was in this part of my life where I was doing the work what Christine gave me about Self compassion. And I'm trying to engage my brain to switch from negative thinking to positives because I used to be very negative and angry.
[12:54] A: So let's not do either.
[12:55] B: Yeah. I don't want to, but it happens.
[12:57] A: Let's not do. Have it be either or.
[13:00] B: Yeah.
[13:00] A: Negative or positive.
[13:02] B: Okay.
[13:03] A: Because positive only works if things go well.
[13:05] B: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Not get upset about it.
[13:07] A: We want you to be more present.
[13:09] B: Yes.
[13:10] A: And have flexibility and movability to deal with what shows up. Right. One of the things that you know has been happening is that there are past triggers that are bleeding into current experiences. So my emotion reaction is way more intense than situation needs. Maybe I recognize it. Maybe after I go in the pool, I've calmed down and I see it clearer. But we want to turn all of that intensity down.
[13:41] B: Yeah.
[13:42] A: Right. We also know that there are things that I don't like to think about, because when I do, it causes this. We'd love to get that stuff to no longer cause any of this.
[13:50] B: Yeah. But see, I won't think about things. Things will occur and I don't realize it. Yeah. And then my brain goes into overdrive.
[13:58] A: Got it.
[13:59] B: Yeah.
[14:00] A: That's because the lens isn't that the environmental things cause that reaction in me. It's that my brain doing it to me. It's not the lion that makes the zebra scared. It's the zebra's brain.
[14:22] B: Yeah.
[14:23] A: In response to the lion.
[14:25] B: Okay.
[14:26] A: But it's zebra's brain.
[14:28] B: Okay. So that's what's happening.
[14:30] A: It's. You have. Based on life experiences. Because we all do. We all have glitches, errors and malfunctions. This is complicated in a machine. Right. So with all those glitches and errors, our brain doesn't always work the way we want it to.
[14:46] B: Right.
[14:48] A: So we tend to think in life. Those circumstances caused these feelings in me. Those past things made this. When I said that I felt this way. Right. Stuff causes feelings. That lens is not wrong. Just limited in what we can do. Avoid change. That's what we try to do with stuff. What we're gonna do is a third element.
[15:16] B: Okay.
[15:17] A: We're gonna be adjusting the way the automatic emotional brain reacts to stuff.
[15:24] B: Okay. Deal.
[15:26] A: So stuff that's going on that normally might have been triggers, reminders that brain pops to those same things can be happening, but it doesn't produce this in me.
[15:39] B: Okay.
[15:40] A: That's one of the things that we want to share.
[15:42] B: So how do I figure out what's causing that?
[15:44] A: Oh, you don't have to.
[15:45] B: You're gonna do it.
[15:46] A: Yeah. Well, we're doing it together. But your unconscious already knows.
[15:49] B: Okay. Deal.
[15:50] A: Right. What experiences you've gone through that left imprints that caused errors.
[15:55] B: Okay.
[15:55] A: That part of your brain knows.
[15:57] B: Well, I've kind of shut them down, just so you know.
[15:59] A: You've intellectually not thought about them.
[16:01] B: Yeah, I don't think about that.
[16:03] A: Right. Which is really. That's the best coping mechanism we have. Did you know that?
[16:07] B: Yeah. Because somebody said they want to be inside my brain. They love how I think. And I'm like. I don't really think about too much in there. It's like I'm not in my brain all the time. You know what I mean? But I think what I did was this Christmas, I wrote a letter to my adoptive family, and I saw the goodness out of the horror that I endured, and I went. I put it to rest. I think I, like, buried it, which.
[16:29] A: Right. But see where therapy misses and this is not what we're doing. Right. You have buried it.
[16:36] B: Yeah, some of it. Yeah.
[16:37] A: Right. But the problem is, even though you buried it.
[16:40] B: Yeah.
[16:41] A: It still is having an underneath the surface effect.
[16:44] B: Yes.
[16:45] A: Right. Because the error isn't that I didn't process and intellectualize and get that out.
[16:51] B: Right.
[16:52] A: The error is that when I went through certain troubling moments, my brain froze. The moment when the moment froze, the rest of me moved on. So it got separated from my nervous system.
[17:07] B: Okay.
[17:08] A: That part of the brain doesn't know the awful experience is over.
[17:13] B: Yeah. Now I'm thinking about stuff.
[17:15] A: We'll be here because I'm more fun.
[17:16] B: Okay. Okay.
[17:17] A: See, the thing that we. I'm tell you one really, really cool. Right.
[17:21] B: Oh, sorry.
[17:22] A: Right. But here's the cool part. Notice how you came back here.
[17:25] B: Yeah.
[17:26] A: So with anything that has to do with stuff that's yucky.
[17:28] B: Okay.
[17:29] A: We want you here with me. Okay.
[17:31] B: I think my brain was like, no, you haven't done that. No. You haven't put it to rest.
[17:36] A: Correct.
[17:36] B: I think it was arguing with me.
[17:37] A: Right. But. But the thing is, it's. You have here, not here.
[17:43] B: Okay.
[17:44] A: So intellectually, like, people, like, I remember working with this guy, and he, you know, forgave his grandpa. His grandpa gave him a blowjob.
[17:53] B: Okay.
[17:53] A: It only happened once, but it was still, like, a weird thing. And, like, so he, you know, had forgiven grandpa for what he did. He realized that Grandpa, you know, clearly, that was screwed up.
[18:05] B: Yeah.
[18:08] A: He knew it wasn't his fault. Right. He knew even that some of it was feeling good. Not because he wanted it because of.
[18:18] B: The body's reaction, right?
[18:19] A: Not because he's gay.
[18:20] B: I get it. I get it. But because.
[18:25] A: As we think, like all of that was going on, he's done the intellectual work of forgiving. He's gotten distance from it. It's been, you know, 30 years.
[18:33] B: Yeah, but why inside does he feel conflicted?
[18:37] A: Does he still feel some of that guilt and shame?
[18:39] B: Yeah, okay, Right.
[18:41] A: The reason he still feels it is because part of his brain never got the really, really good news. That moment stopped and is over. See, the craziest part about our brain is we have emotions in the same way that animals do.
[19:03] B: Makes sense.
[19:04] A: Animals don't have emotions though, because they're brain is concerned about how they feel about themselves. Their self esteem, their sense of self worth, whether they're confident, whether they feel lovable. Animals brain causes emotion for three reasons. Motivate the animal to do something, attack, get something to stop or solve a problem. It's that simple. For example, rabbit sees fox. Brain makes it experience fear, right? Not because it wanted it to have a bad day, but to avoid, make it run away. Squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire, pain. But not because it wants the squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid dumb moron. Because it's marred now it's going to be embarrassed. All the other squirrels are going to laugh at it, right? It doesn't notice it's only causing the emotion to get the tail out of the fire. So here's the crazy part for us. All of the negative emotions we experience, hurt, anger, sadness, sorrow, grief, resentment, rage, hurts, pain, guilt. All the negative is actually being caused in us by the same part of our brain that works like an animal.
[20:23] B: Oh, what does that make the something?
[20:26] A: Same purpose to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. Here's the error. Many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. It's why we feel bad about the same things over and over and over again. Got it.
[20:45] B: Yeah.
[20:46] A: Really good news. Many of the things that we feel bad about are are in time periods that are finished.
[20:53] B: Thank you for saying that. I'm thinking about this relationship I keep playing with.
[20:57] A: So we don't need to solve the problem. We need to update the timing. Okay, so Chantelle, the error in human brain is a timing error because we have the other part, our intellectual brain, okay. Which is reasonable and logical and has access to remembering past and thinking about.
[21:19] B: Future and knowing about to try to protect itself. So what you're saying is, like, if something reminds me of something, my brain, if I've been through something, is gonna filter through an event that's similar and try to respond to it based on.
[21:33] A: That, it's going to immediately respond. Right?
[21:35] B: That's exactly what I have it right before thought, Right? Yeah. I'm gonna go, wait a minute. Boom, boom. And I'm gonna think it's the same.
[21:41] A: Thing and not you. Your brain is gonna think.
[21:43] B: Yeah.
[21:44] A: Because for survival, when the rabbit heard the twig snap.
[21:47] B: Yep.
[21:47] A: The rabbit.
[21:49] B: Yeah.
[21:49] A: Had a much better chance to live than the other rabbit who thought it was his friend George.
[21:54] B: Oh, shit.
[21:57] A: Right.
[21:58] B: Yes.
[22:00] A: So the crazy part is, right, so because we have access to time, that's not so much a problem if the experience is positive or neutral.
[22:16] B: Yeah.
[22:16] A: Because when they're positive or neutral, the brain knows the difference between the memory of it and it.
[22:21] B: I feel like the most positive I've had in my life is now, though.
[22:25] A: Yeah. No, no, not you again. As I'm telling all this shit, stop applying it to you. Learn it over here, right? Learn it over here about somebody other than you. Then we'll have it to apply it to you. Once we've learned it, it's just easier than trying to filter it through me, Right?
[22:39] B: Okay. Okay. I'm like, all right.
[22:46] A: Yeah. So the thing that we want to be doing is we want to be updating the timing, right? So somebody tells us about a trip that they had to Key west, right? They went down there. They partied on Duval Street. They rode on a little moped. They took their picture next to the sign that said 90 miles from Cuba. They went out deep sea fishing. They ate a blue lobster, right? They tell us about the experience. Experience. But when they're telling it to us, you and I both know that they know the difference between the memory of it and it. Okay, got it.
[23:18] B: Yeah.
[23:18] A: But when it experiences negative, big one, little one long time ago, recent one time, many times, any negative, weird, bad, awful, sad, confusing, upsetting, scary, horrific, catastrophic, traumatic brain. Confuses memory, thinking. It's the experience, okay? That's why the person has the response. That's why when this guy is telling us about how, you know, him and his buddy, when they were in Chicago, they had gone out, and then they didn't know where their car was. And as they're walking late at night, the whole gang comes up, you know, he's getting hit with a metal. And as he's getting to that point, we notice him like getting like, right. What the fuck is happening with him?
[24:02] B: Right.
[24:03] A: Most people say he's reliving it.
[24:05] B: Right.
[24:06] A: Right. But we're nice. We were kindly listening to him.
[24:09] B: Right.
[24:10] A: We're not. But what happened? Emotional part of his brain confused the thought of it, thinking it was it. That's why he was having that emotional response. Not because that was a bad memory, but because his brain doesn't know that awful moment is over.
[24:32] B: Okay.
[24:34] A: There's aspects of your brain, Chantelle, that don't know certain awful moments are over. We have really good news to get in to the part of the brain that doesn't know certain fucking awful moments are over.
[24:48] B: Right? Yeah.
[24:49] A: That's one of the things that we want to do.
[24:51] B: All right.
[24:52] A: Once that gets stuck, second thing, brain attaches, meaning we learn when we're little, good is supposed to happen because when I'm being good and bad, therefore only happens when I'm bad. It's not true. But that's what we learn when we're little, impressionable. So now I go through something that was awful and I kind of blame myself. Right. Like, I shouldn't have gotten in the car with that guy. Yeah, Right. Or, you know, I remember somebody saying, well, you know, a co workers friend tried to drop me off at, you know, was gonna drive me home, and I shouldn't have gone with him because I had no idea, you know, he's gonna rape me. Right, Right. But so we blame ourselves. Right. But even the little kid, let's say. Not again, not you, but this little boy, four, mom and dad get divorced.
[25:41] B: Mm.
[25:42] A: Now dad's out of the picture, Dad's not around, Little kid doesn't go, oh, it's a mom and dad issue.
[25:47] B: No, they personalize it.
[25:49] A: Yeah. See, if I was more lovable, my dad would be here. And then he's like, got, you know, the first baseball game that he's ever in, and dad was a big baseball guy and he was hoping dad would show. Dad doesn't come.
[26:00] B: Yeah.
[26:01] A: He doesn't go, oh, dad's busy. Dad's got work. Dad's got other things. Oh. Or dad's a drunken fucking alcoholic.
[26:07] B: Right.
[26:07] A: Whatever it is. Right. He's like, if I was more lovable, my dad would be here.
[26:12] B: Yeah.
[26:12] A: That sucks to be, like, the feeling.
[26:14] B: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
[26:17] A: So with lots of negative experiences, what has gotten stuck is it's felt like what happened had something to do with me, deficiencies in me, maybe my lack of loveability or worth or value or whether I'm good enough or Smart enough or. Got it.
[26:33] B: Okay.
[26:33] A: Right. So that's the second part. And then the third part is what you experience now, and that is your brain has been scanning, looking for anything that's similar or even anything that occurred at the same time. So, for example, I worked with a woman. She got mugged in a TJ Maxx.
[26:52] B: Okay.
[26:53] A: By a teenager wearing a hoodie.
[26:55] B: Right.
[26:55] A: Right. Now, she was, you know, over at the mall, just walking down in the middle of the mall, and there was a teenager wearing a hoodie, and she was panicked.
[27:07] B: Yeah.
[27:08] A: But we know the issue for her back. Oh, actually, it wasn't a teenager. It was an old man wearing the hoodie.
[27:18] B: Right. But she saw the teenager with the hoodie, and her body responded.
[27:22] A: She confused. The issue wasn't the hoodie. The issue was what he did. But because it co. Occurred. I remember a gal who was on a dating website, finally met a guy. They corresponded. They went out a couple times, right. Like, just for, like, you know, coffee or what have you. And then they were really gonna go out for, like, a nice date, and they go out for the date, and he happens to be wearing the cologne that her stepdad wore who molested her.
[27:53] B: Right here.
[27:54] A: But again, now that she's having all that discomfort, the issue for her back then, when stepdad did that wasn't what he smelled like, it was what he did.
[28:05] B: Right.
[28:05] A: But because it co. Occurred.
[28:07] B: Right.
[28:08] A: It gets stuck.
[28:09] B: Okay.
[28:11] A: Right. That's why the soldier dies on the ground. Fireworks, firework explodes. Yeah. He let the firework. He would think different part of the brain confused it.
[28:21] B: Okay.
[28:21] A: Right. So that's what's been running a lot of why there's been over reactivity and dysregulation. Right. You're super smart and super wise. Right. We. You have a high level, as I said, of sensory acuity, meaning you pay attention to things.
[28:38] B: Yeah.
[28:39] A: I can tell you the reason that I point up here.
[28:41] B: Yeah.
[28:42] A: When I talk about a future self.
[28:43] B: Yeah.
[28:44] A: Is that when people visually visualize a future self, they look up into the right, and that when somebody tends to be an emotion, they look down into the right.
[28:55] B: That's so cool.
[28:57] A: Right. So you didn't know the terminology, but you knew little subtle cues that you picked up with different people that gave you indications that other people around you weren't picking up on. Yeah, got it. That's a wonderful skill and can serve you in multitudes of other areas that don't have anything to do with that.
[29:19] B: Sometimes it's bad though, too.
[29:21] A: It's only bad when it's always on.
[29:24] B: Yeah. And it was for a long time.
[29:26] A: So where we're headed is that we're able to turn it on and up, but we're also able to turn it down and off.
[29:32] B: Okay, got it. Yes.
[29:34] A: So this is where we're headed, right?
[29:36] B: Yeah.
[29:36] A: So those three pieces, we. We want to get that stuff unplugged.
[29:40] B: But what if, like, when you're in the middle of, like, a high stress situation, like when I survived this guy that killed these people, my brain spoke to me and told me to do the exact opposite of what I knew he wanted me to do. And that's how I'm the only living victim. So my brain was like, don't fight back. That's what he wants. Act like you like it. And then it messed him up because I knew that it was the thrill of the attack and I wasn't gonna give him that.
[30:11] A: Right.
[30:11] B: So I did the opposite.
[30:13] A: Predator.
[30:13] B: Yeah.
[30:14] A: See, goes on the attack. The bear wants the chase. Yeah, right.
[30:21] B: Okay.
[30:22] A: They also only go after weak lion doesn't go after big gazelle. Goes after a tiny gazelle.
[30:28] B: That's good.
[30:29] A: Lion doesn't mind's mighty king of jungle. Doesn't go after the. The largest of the elephants.
[30:34] B: Yeah. Well, why would I. Why does my brain get really calm and high? Like, stuff like that?
[30:38] A: So again, slows down. Right. But I've had the experience myself where I was on. In a car.
[30:47] B: Yeah.
[30:47] A: And I was driving on the interstate, and as the interstate kind of went this way. It was downpour, raining, and I was kind of coming around the car that was here. All of a sudden, my car spun around in a big circle, like 360°. As that was going on, it was literally as if I had floated up above it and was watching me, seeing that.
[31:13] B: Okay.
[31:13] A: There's no car close to me. Because you go, why do things slow down in high stress situations? Because. Because you've strengthened the muscle. Because you've been in so many high stress situations.
[31:28] B: Yeah. When you were saying that car thing, I was, I remember after I hit a tree going 90. When I was a teenager, anytime I felt like when we would be driving, it'd be normal, I would jump scared because I would feel like I was gonna get in a crash. So that's what you're saying, my brain held it.
[31:42] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It took me a long time to work in ways that are best all the time. So if it created a way that worked, that had me survive, then it goes, well, then that works for all of the things that are similar to that, which sometimes it. It does, but lots of times it doesn't.
[32:01] B: Yeah, that's true.
[32:02] A: So that's why we're going to add variability.
[32:04] B: Cool.
[32:05] A: We don't get rid of it because it's really useful, but we have, like, you know, now, like a knob that can turn the intensity.
[32:12] B: Yeah, that'd be nice.
[32:13] A: Right, Got it. So then there's one other component that we're going to talk about, because as we're organizing towards the future, you. Right. That's been symbolized by that Buddha.
[32:27] B: Yeah.
[32:28] A: Right. Like we're organizing towards this. You, who's becoming more present, much more okay. And comfortable in her own skin, has installed this strength she's gained from making it through really difficult stuff.
[32:44] B: Okay.
[32:44] A: Right. Nobody other than the Navy seals on purpose sign up to go through difficult stuff.
[32:50] B: That's true.
[32:52] A: They do. They're crazy.
[32:53] B: Yeah. They're all talking to me.
[32:55] A: Here's the pool pond. Yeah. We become stronger when we're fully on the other side.
[33:02] B: Yeah.
[33:02] A: Not just here, but here. All right, got it. So this is where we're headed. So the last little part goes. Lots of times, stuff happens to my body.
[33:12] B: Okay.
[33:12] A: And people tend to walk around thinking that I am my body.
[33:15] B: Yeah, right. Yeah.
[33:17] A: And they relate to their body as if it's theirs, like who they are. You know, it's my nose. But what if you're not your body?
[33:25] B: That'd be nice, right?
[33:26] A: What if you have a body?
[33:28] B: Yeah.
[33:28] A: Your body's totally yours.
[33:29] B: Yeah.
[33:30] A: But it isn't actually you.
[33:32] B: Yeah.
[33:32] A: Right. My mom, you know, lost the tip of her finger in a snow cone machine accident.
[33:38] B: Oh, wow.
[33:39] A: When she goes to visit people, they don't say to her, hey, Susie, I'm glad almost all of you could come over.
[33:44] B: Oh, yeah, that's true. Okay.
[33:47] A: Because she's all there.
[33:48] B: Yeah.
[33:49] A: Even if that part of her body is missing.
[33:51] B: Right, Exactly.
[33:52] A: Got it.
[33:53] B: Yeah.
[33:53] A: Okay, so as we're looking at this kind of stuff, we want to be looking at it that. Okay. You have a body. Your body's yours, but it isn't actually you.
[34:02] B: Okay.
[34:03] A: Right.
[34:04] B: Yes.
[34:04] A: But then what are you if you're not your body? Maybe you're your thoughts. No, no. Because you have them. You're not even the thinker of them. Your brain is.
[34:12] B: Yes.
[34:13] A: Right. They're yours, not you. So you're not your thoughts. Oh. Maybe you're your feelings.
[34:18] B: Nope. Feelings.
[34:19] A: That's right. You feel different ways at different times. Well, maybe you are what you do. Yeah. But no, because you've done lots of different things. And when you stop doing one to do something else, you didn't stop existing. All right, so now we go. You're not your thoughts, feelings. You're not your body. You're not what you do.
[34:38] B: Yeah.
[34:39] A: So now do this. Think of a time when you were outside in nature. Okay. You are looking at something that in that moment, it's, like, captured your awareness, your feelings. And you're in the beauty. You're like, wow, what is it that you see?
[34:53] B: The sky.
[34:54] A: Yeah. And there's a moment as you're seeing the sky that you're feeling a sense of peace and excitement and awe and wonder.
[35:02] B: Yes.
[35:03] A: And some people might tell you, seeing that gives you the feelings. Or we could look at it a different way and say being there in experience, experiencing it, actually drew your awareness down and in towards your center.
[35:19] B: Oh, really?
[35:20] A: Because at your center, you always are peaceful and excited.
[35:26] B: That's awesome.
[35:27] A: Kind of like if I'm at the campfire, my hands are cold, and I move them down towards the flames, and I say, chantelle, this fire is getting a lot hotter. And you would say to me, no, the fire is not getting any hotter. You're becoming more aware of the heat because your hands are closer to the flames.
[35:49] B: Yeah, got it. Yeah.
[35:52] A: So we know that in your life, there have been multitudes of occasions, occurrences, stuff and things that have happened where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center.
[36:03] B: Okay. Yeah.
[36:04] A: Right. Pains, upsets, hurts you. But no matter where awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited.
[36:10] B: I believe that.
[36:11] A: Right. You know, two of us are in here. How do you know it? You look around. Senses, bringing data. Data. We go intellect. Intellect. We go knowledge. Knowledge. We go light. Light of knowledge. Light of wisdom. So, of course, you know, I work with all sorts of people that. All sorts of stuff. And I remember this one girl, like her older brother, for whatever reason, took his drumstick and, like, park it in her. Like, lots of yucky feelings about all of that. But when we work together, cleared it, it's gone. Like, the pain, the disgust, the yuck, it's gone.
[36:41] B: Yeah. Tori said that. Tori said you'll get her. You'll ask her about something, and she doesn't have the same feeling.
[36:47] A: Isn't that cool?
[36:48] B: Yeah. But now we have to figure out what causes the pain.
[36:51] A: We don't have to.
[36:52] B: Okay, no, see, you were already.
[36:54] A: See, here's the cool part. We're already doing it.
[36:56] B: Yeah.
[36:56] A: This is actually all on the way to doing it. We're Totally doing it right now.
[37:00] B: It's a lot better than I thought it was going to be.
[37:01] A: I know. That's what we're talking about.
[37:03] B: See, I'm like, okay, I can do it.
[37:06] A: Come on. Right? Yeah, this is way better. So we're all on our way to doing it. So as we were talking and all that's gone, I asked her, I go, but where was it? And as we thought, we go, it wasn't surface intellectual. It couldn't survive in light. It must have been hiding in the shadow between the lights.
[37:26] B: Yeah.
[37:27] A: Lights are now touching, shadows are gone. I said, cool. And then we started talking about going to the dentist. For whatever reason, I told her about a bad time I had. And, you know, I said, well, this is what he did. What he did, you know, put me in a chair. My arm, my feet are up, my head is dropping. It's very uncomfortable. She goes to me, okay, you're at the dentist. And then I go, well, then he positions this mirror with a light, like, right in my. Like, light in my eyes. I can't, like, see. She's like, yeah, you're at the dentist. I go, yeah. But then he took this cold metal instrument and shoved it inside of me.
[37:58] B: And she's like, oh, she really?
[38:01] A: My goodness. In your what? And I said, my mouth. Because I've got one. I'm not one.
[38:10] B: Got it.
[38:11] A: Which is the same thing that I said to her about her brother with the drumstick. I said, when you were little, he messed with yourself stuff. And she looked at me and she went, that's right, he did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and feeling.
[38:24] B: Yeah.
[38:24] A: And then she went, but you know what? I. What? She goes, well, he never touched me. He never touched the light at the center, who I really am. He never touched me. He messed with my body. And then she said to me, because that happened, there's no cell in my body right now to today that is even at all the same as it was back then. See, if you and I were to come back one year from today, 99.9999% of the subatomic particles that are making us up wouldn't be here. Not that they all leave it once. It's like Star Trek.
[38:59] B: It's over time, right? Yeah. Yeah.
[39:01] A: But isn't that cool?
[39:02] B: Yeah.
[39:03] A: So there's no single part that's the same as it was when that.
[39:07] B: That makes sense.
[39:09] A: Right? So what we want to begin to be thinking more and more about is at a different level, realizing stuff messed with your body screwed up thinking, hurt feelings. But what if you never touched who you really are that you can't be touching that way? I'm going to show you something later about what I mean by that. Who you really are can only be touched with respect.
[39:34] B: Okay.
[39:35] A: Right. Right. And mutual collaboration.
[39:39] B: Okay. Yeah.
[39:41] A: So now we've got all those pieces in place. Any questions about any of the stuff I talked about? And do you need to use the restroom?
[39:50] B: Yeah. You gotta pee?
[39:51] A: No, I don't. No, I'm okay.
[39:53] B: Today they said that you wouldn't tell me if you had a pee.
[39:57] A: Right. But if you do, this would be a good time to break. To do?
[40:01] B: Yeah, we can break real quick and ip.
[40:03] A: Okay.
[40:03] B: Yeah.
[40:04] A: Okay, Very good. I will pause this and back on. And so what we want to be doing is we want to be moving your body now. Right. So we've got all the information in. Not only have you been listening to what I've been talking about, but so is your unconscious.
[40:21] B: Okay.
[40:21] A: Right. It's paying attention, and it knows which experience experiences it already kind of like pop certain things. Right. So it knows what to do to heal. Right. Think about a cut heals on its own. We're just directing it.
[40:34] B: Okay.
[40:34] A: Why we're directing it is we've got an outcome now that's been symbolized by the Buddha.
[40:38] B: Yeah.
[40:39] A: And the rainbow, the chakra. Right. And we've got the you organizing towards it. We want to get your body to move more and more so that you're lighter and more clear and more free.
[40:49] B: Okay.
[40:50] A: Right. So how we do it is we've got the wonderful symbol, but now we're gonna add more brain levers.
[40:56] B: Okay.
[40:57] A: Right. Neuroscience teaches us that if you slightly lower your jaw. So not like, ah, I do that, but just a little. It stimulates our vagal nerve to put body into more of a state of rest.
[41:10] B: Oh, is that why I'm putting my.
[41:12] A: Right. Second thing I want you to do is just rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth.
[41:17] B: That's what I was doing.
[41:19] A: Yeah. Already? Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah.
[41:23] B: I have my jaw like this and my tongue was pressing towards my bottom. That's so weird. I'm like, does he know I'm doing that?
[41:28] A: And now what we do is we begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper as we inhale.
[41:35] B: Okay.
[41:35] A: And then a little bit longer as we exhale, so the jaw is slightly lowered. You're resting your tongue. Right. And you're breathing in a Way that's a little bit slower and deeper. Exhaling a little longer. Right. As you're doing this, Shantel, check inside. How's your body feeling now?
[41:55] B: Good.
[41:56] A: Like more tense or more calm?
[41:58] B: Tingly. Oh, my brain is a little tingly.
[42:01] A: I bet.
[42:02] B: Right.
[42:02] A: So now we want to add the fourth lever. When we get stressed and are anxious and we're all the other stuff lives is in highly elevated beta causes tunneled vision. Beta waves are good because they're what we're using now to talk, communicate. Right. They're good for focus, conversation, those things. But when they get elevated, it does this. That's where all that stuff lives. We're moving your brain waves now down into alpha waves. Alpha waves are what surfers call flow. It's alert, relaxed, and it's correlated with an expanding of awareness. So how it works is this. You're gonna have your jaw slightly lowered.
[42:42] B: Okay.
[42:42] A: You're resting your tongue. You're breathing in a way that's a little slower, deeper and longer. On the exhale, you look across and you see me. You see my nose. You stay looking at my nose. You see my fingers, but stay looking at my. My nose. As my fingers move out with your peripheral vision, begin to notice that you can pick up my fingers.
[43:07] B: That's cool. Isn't that cool?
[43:09] A: Yeah. So what starts to happen when you do this is that you're becoming more aware of space. Right. The opposite of tunnel vision.
[43:18] B: Okay.
[43:19] A: Right. Notice that you can look at me, but you can also pick up the side windows and doors.
[43:23] B: Yeah.
[43:24] A: Right. You can see what's beyond me.
[43:26] B: Yeah.
[43:26] A: You can sense what's behind you.
[43:29] B: Yeah.
[43:29] A: Underneath you and up above your head towards the ceiling. Right. Notice how you can kind of sense the space more.
[43:37] B: Yeah.
[43:38] A: As you're sensing more of this space, again, check inside. How's your body feeling?
[43:44] B: Good.
[43:45] A: Yeah. Right. Like more calm.
[43:47] B: Yeah.
[43:47] A: Right.
[43:48] B: Yeah.
[43:49] A: So now we want to have the last lever. People say, you might have said, I'm under a lot of stress.
[43:54] B: Yeah.
[43:55] A: Right. So in order to be under a lot of stress, where is the stress?
[43:59] B: Above us.
[44:00] A: That's right. You're so good at this stuff. People don't get that at all. It's so cool to be with somebody that gets that.
[44:07] B: It's so cool.
[44:08] A: Right. So we want to get you out from under it and be up above it. Having another metaphor, bird's eye view, which means I'm able to see things from up above, underneath and below me.
[44:20] B: Right.
[44:21] A: But not just perch, soaring. So the last little part is you slightly Lower your jaw. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You breathe in this way. That's right. That's a little bit slower and deeper as you're breathing in this slower and deeper way, you can look across and see me, my nose, my fingers moving out. As they move out you.
[44:45] B: Yes, now I'm looking.
[44:48] A: That's right. You're aware of more in your periphery and you actually can realize the space goes beyond this room, that the space literally goes out in all directions, that it's unending.
[44:59] B: Yep.
[45:00] A: Right. Isn't that cool? Now go ahead and close your eyes. Notice with your eyes closed, you may sense more of the space bright because there's no objects in the way to see. Then imagine what it would be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof so that you're way up above it all in the sky, having a bird's eye view, seeing things below underneath because you're above and over and all free like the bird to soar and glide. Just flow in the breeze with the wind. Or maybe flat, directionally big, wide turns, curves, archangles. That's right. Bring awareness back down and into your body so that you reassociate inside you. When you're ready, you'll take another nice deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. And again, as you're checking in, what are you noticing now?
[46:06] B: I feel calm.
[46:07] A: You do, don't you? Yeah.
[46:10] B: Right.
[46:11] A: Your body's responding to what we're doing. Ah, make sense.
[46:18] B: Yeah.
[46:18] A: We're wanting that part of your brain to become more responsive.
[46:22] B: I feel like this part of my brain is tingly.
[46:25] A: My bad. Right, Right. So what we're going going to do next is we're going to just make a request that the other than conscious part of your brain travel back through moments. Right. And they may have downlines and tentacles that go to earlier other things. But it's going to begin to group categorize and then it's going to narrow down and pick one. One moment, one time, one yucky thing happened.
[46:49] B: Okay.
[46:50] A: And you got it already.
[46:51] B: Yeah.
[46:52] A: Now how we clear it? Really simple. Wanna know how? Be with me here now.
[46:57] B: Okay.
[46:57] A: Because this is. And that isn't.
[46:59] B: Okay.
[47:00] A: Two, we're working on mutual goal. We both want for you.
[47:03] B: Yeah.
[47:03] A: Three, I'm at least a little more fun than the second moment.
[47:06] B: Yeah, Right. Got it.
[47:08] A: Second, you're gonna tell me just facts.
[47:10] B: Okay.
[47:10] A: Minute or less, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened. Then it was done.
[47:14] B: Okay.
[47:14] A: 3. When did that happen? Like, about how long ago? Yeah. Good. So there's been lots of things after that that were better than that. Well, yeah, they had to have been. I mean, you. You know, getting dressed today was better than that.
[47:27] B: Okay. Deal.
[47:28] A: Right. Brushing your teeth, having a nice cup of coffee. Better than that moment. Right. Like, we don't have to go through big things to realize that. There's been lots of things you've done after that that were more enjoyable than that.
[47:38] B: Okay.
[47:39] A: Our conversation. Way more enjoyable than that.
[47:41] B: Yeah.
[47:41] A: Right. You talking outside. Way more enjoyable than that. Right. You sipping coffee, way more enjoyable than that. So don't we have lots.
[47:48] B: Yeah.
[47:48] A: Right. Of things that were way more enjoyable than that.
[47:51] B: Okay.
[47:51] A: That we also want to have access to, to extend the timeline. Because when the moment happened, that part throws. Doesn't know anything. Doesn't even know the changes that you're making now.
[48:02] B: Okay.
[48:03] A: Right. How you've chosen you.
[48:07] B: Yeah.
[48:08] A: Right. Because you got that. It's not my time. Well, shit, now I'm gonna do something with my life because I got out of the shit that I had been circled in.
[48:20] B: Okay.
[48:21] A: And as I got a little separation in space from it, I went, wait a minute. I could have a distinctly different life.
[48:26] B: Yes.
[48:27] A: And this is where we're headed.
[48:28] B: Yes.
[48:29] A: Got it.
[48:29] B: Yeah.
[48:29] A: So we have good news to get in.
[48:31] B: Yep. Let's do it.
[48:32] A: Right.
[48:33] B: Okay.
[48:33] A: So. And then. Well, the. What happened? So you're three. When it happened. When it happened, you're where?
[48:41] B: In the courtroom.
[48:41] A: So you're in the courtroom. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime? Probably day.
[48:45] B: It was like mid afternoon.
[48:46] A: Mid afternoon. Right. And are you like. Like, where are you seated?
[48:49] B: I'm in the. I'm in the benches.
[48:51] A: So you're on the benches, right? Like, behind.
[48:54] B: Yeah, I'm looking at my mom up on the stand.
[48:56] A: Right. So Mom's up on the. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[48:58] B: And you're saying screaming her name. She's giving me away.
[49:03] A: Good. Well, so then she's getting. Going through the stuff that she's signing her. Right. Right. Good.
[49:07] B: Sign the rights over. I rode in a car with my social worker.
[49:11] A: And then the social worker took you. Right.
[49:13] B: To my first foster home.
[49:15] A: Right. And then that moment ended.
[49:18] B: Yeah.
[49:18] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more enjoyable, like sip your coffee.
[49:23] B: Yeah.
[49:23] A: Right. Or doctor. Right. Good job. Right. So notice as you were recalling it, you were a little bit there. There was some discomfort.
[49:34] B: Yeah.
[49:34] A: But not because that was such a sucky moment.
[49:36] B: Yeah.
[49:37] A: But because part of your Brain has been confusing the memory, thinking it's happening.
[49:43] B: Okay.
[49:44] A: It actually causes the sucky feelings to try to motivate you to get that moment to stop. Good news. It has.
[49:50] B: Yeah.
[49:51] A: Right?
[49:51] B: Yeah.
[49:52] A: So we never go backwards with a memory, but when we do, it literally unplugs it and takes away the charge. So we're gonna go backwards. Right. So we've got, you know, having a sip of coffee. We got talking to Morgan. Right, right, right. And then we got you being dropped off at the first foster home, and then riding with the social worker. And then the social worker and you leaving court, and then mom signing as you're screaming, and then you guys going there. And then before that, you're with mom, and then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing now, as I went backwards. Right.
[50:22] B: I didn't feel the same.
[50:24] A: I know. Isn't that crazy?
[50:25] B: That's awesome. Because I'm thinking about it. I'm going, wait a second. Hold on.
[50:31] A: Right? It's not doing the same thing. No. Right. Isn't that cool?
[50:34] B: Yeah.
[50:34] A: Right. Because your brain is beginning to read it as info about something that happened. Now, the third part is that you. Right. Doesn't. Or better yet, emotional brain doesn't get logic. That's why. How come I'm not better with these things? I know better. Why am I still. Right? Because this doesn't work with this. But it does understand patterns of association. Right. We can use the same thing it does where, you know, the person is upset at Nilla Wafers because she happened to be eating one while her parents told her they were divorcing. The Nilla Wafer wasn't the problem.
[51:12] B: Right.
[51:13] A: But they got paired. Right. The error is that the memory is and the experience are glued and in that level of the brain reading, as if they're the same thing. Yeah.
[51:28] B: Because as you're talking, my brain is, like, categorizing things that are the same.
[51:32] A: Memory is not the same thing as the experience. So, for example, you can remember earlier today sliding your flops on.
[51:42] B: Yeah.
[51:42] A: Right. You can even remember where you were when you did it. Yeah, Right. But if I said to you remember sliding your flip flops on? And then I went, hey, Chantelle, stop putting on your flip flops. You look at me and go, I'm not putting on my flip flops. Because for you, there's a really clear difference between the memory of doing it and you actually doing it.
[52:06] B: Okay?
[52:06] A: Right. If I said, you know, stop putting the orange band around your wrist, you'd go to Me. But I'm not putting the orange band. If I said, you will stop me from putting on my watch, you'd go, you're not putting on your watch. Right. Because there's a difference between the memory of it and it.
[52:25] B: Okay, got it.
[52:27] A: So you can remember being at court. You can remember Mom's signing the papers and yelling. You also can remember sliding your flip flops on today. Chantelle, stop sliding on your flip flops. Say, I'm not sliding on my flip flops.
[52:39] B: Say that.
[52:40] A: Say I'm not sliding my flip flops on. Say it.
[52:43] B: I'm not sliding my flip flops.
[52:44] A: Right. Well, then stop mom from doing that. Say Mom's not doing that. Well, then stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt.
[52:50] B: You're not putting on your shirt.
[52:51] A: Well, then you're not. Well, stop. Well, then you stop putting on your jeans. Say, I'm not putting on my jeans.
[52:57] B: I'm putting on my jeans.
[52:57] A: Well, then stop mom from doing that. Say she's not doing that.
[53:00] B: She's not doing that.
[53:00] A: Well, stop it from happening. Go. It's not happening.
[53:02] B: It's not happening.
[53:02] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[53:04] B: It no longer exists.
[53:05] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to get in that. It's data. Now, the third part, which is really, really key, and this is going to start changing a lot of things. It's like one of the parts that unlocked a lot of different pieces back then, when that was going on that earlier, you thought mom doing that had something to do with you.
[53:24] B: Yeah.
[53:24] A: Your lovability, your worth. Whether you were good enough or wanted or, Or, Or. Or wantable. Right?
[53:31] B: Yeah.
[53:32] A: What do we know from here? As an adult, you. That you wouldn't have known when you.
[53:38] B: Were three that it's not my fault.
[53:42] A: Had nothing to do with you.
[53:43] B: Yeah. Yes.
[53:47] A: But notice even right now, you fully don't have that yet. So I'm going to give you an example. Right. The kid comes home with two D's and two F's. Mom is angry. She says, wait until your father gets home. Dad comes home. Dad sees the report card. Dad storms up the stairs. As he's doing it, taking his belt off, goes into the room, grabs the kid, throws him over the bed, yanks his pants down and just starts going out of town. What are you doing? How could you do? Right. The kid is feeling. I'm getting hit.
[54:17] B: Yeah.
[54:18] A: Because I got bad grades.
[54:20] B: Yeah.
[54:20] A: But Izzy.
[54:24] B: I think he's gonna hit because his dad can't Deal with his anger.
[54:27] A: Right? Yeah. It had nothing to do with the kid.
[54:30] B: No.
[54:33] A: Right?
[54:34] B: Yeah.
[54:34] A: Right. The kid drops the tray in the cafeteria and shit splatters everywhere because he tripped and fell. Everybody's laughing at him. Right. He's mortified. Harry Potter's cloak. Get me out of here.
[54:44] B: Right. Yes.
[54:46] A: But would it have mattered? You and I as adult. Would it have mattered whether it was that kid or any other kid in that situation? Isn't that what they would have done? Laughed?
[54:57] B: Yeah.
[54:57] A: See? Would it have mattered whether it was you or any other person born to that mom at that time? Isn't that what she would have have done? Yeah. She had stuff that wasn't okay in her.
[55:10] B: Yeah.
[55:11] A: Got it.
[55:12] B: Yes.
[55:13] A: You didn't know that then?
[55:15] B: No.
[55:15] A: You felt it had to do with me.
[55:17] B: Yeah.
[55:18] A: Right. We want to get that shifted. So repeat these four words. Here we go. It's. It's not. Not about. About me.
[55:24] B: Me.
[55:25] A: Right? It's not.
[55:25] B: Yeah.
[55:26] A: Say that it's not. It's not about me.
[55:28] B: About me.
[55:28] A: Right. It's not about me.
[55:29] B: It's not about me.
[55:30] A: Right. Now close your eyes. Picture the younger you at three. Let her know, of course that moment's over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists. Let her know that mom doing that had nothing to do with you or your lovability. Had everything to do with whatever was off with mom. So that she gets. It's not about me. Let the you know that you're okay, that you're here now. Let her know about the conversation with Morgan and the cup of coffee. Let her know about. About gaining the insight to now for the first time be a co creator. And how she wants her life to go right. So that she gets it right. As the earlier you is getting it. What do you notice now happening to her face?
[56:13] B: I'm getting happy.
[56:15] A: Right. And you can open your eyes. It's not stuck there.
[56:20] B: Cool.
[56:21] A: Right?
[56:22] B: Yeah.
[56:23] A: Right. And notice that we were able to go through that more with you here.
[56:28] B: Yeah.
[56:29] A: Right.
[56:30] B: That was cool.
[56:33] A: Right? Right?
[56:34] B: Yeah.
[56:35] A: So we want to do more clearing.
[56:37] B: Okay. Healing. Okay.
[56:39] A: So again, knowing that we're headed towards the Buddha.
[56:42] B: Okay.
[56:43] A: Right. What's the symbol? That other part of your brain is going to travel moments.
[56:50] B: Yeah.
[56:50] A: Yeah. And we'll bring another to mind.
[56:53] B: I jumped way ahead.
[56:55] A: What? Doesn't matter. See here. I'm gonna give you a good thing that's really cool that you did. Do you want to know why? Because our brain is what they call rhizomatic.
[57:05] B: Okay.
[57:06] A: Right. So be here for just a Second. Yeah, not there.
[57:09] B: Okay. Okay.
[57:11] A: Just to give you this insight most metaphysical or tree trunk, root, rose trunk, rose limbs, rose branches, all connected to one thing. Rhizomes are mushrooms.
[57:25] B: Okay.
[57:26] A: They're mint leaves. There's not a single starter or a single end. They're connected through multiple layers and links.
[57:34] B: So my brain connected that one memory.
[57:37] A: Now watch. What's happening is tiny. Time doesn't matter because you can go anywhere. Like a map. Back when they used to have a map that you would look at. A map doesn't tell you where to start. It doesn't carry where to go. You can point anywhere on the map and go in any direction.
[57:53] B: Okay.
[57:54] A: Same thing with your brain. Your brain knows how to begin to widespread clear stuff. Right. And it doesn't need to go linear. Like the tree.
[58:05] B: Cool. Yeah, that's why I did that.
[58:07] A: Yeah, that's why I did that. I was like.
[58:09] B: Well, I didn't think I was gonna.
[58:10] A: So that particular moment that happened happened about how long ago?
[58:15] B: I think 25, six.
[58:19] A: Yeah. Right. And again, you want to be here as you tell me the what happened then.
[58:23] B: Okay.
[58:23] A: Because this is. And that isn't. So when that one happened, you're where I was.
[58:29] B: I woke up in the hospital.
[58:30] A: So you're in the hospital. Was there stuff before the hospital that's troubling? As you think of it?
[58:35] B: Yeah. I was in trafficking for a long time.
[58:38] A: Well, okay, so what happened that had you get to the hospital?
[58:41] B: I was hiding from my pimp.
[58:45] A: Right, like hiding like behind a garbage can?
[58:47] B: No, I got a room and I was trying to.
[58:49] A: In a room?
[58:50] B: Yeah. And then he. I was hanging out with another pimp and another girl and then all of a sudden he came through the door and he beat me.
[58:57] A: Good job. Right, so then he punched you multiple times?
[58:59] B: Yeah.
[59:00] A: And that hurt? Yeah, a lot.
[59:02] B: Yeah.
[59:02] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[59:04] B: I woke up in the hospital.
[59:04] A: How are you doing right now? Good. Yeah. You're here.
[59:07] B: Yeah.
[59:07] A: Yeah. Right. Good job. Right. So then you woke up in the hospital, Then what happened?
[59:14] B: There was these two ladies standing over me, a doctor talking to me. And I had been there for three days.
[59:20] A: Yes. Great.
[59:21] B: That's when I learned about what happened to my brain. My head was really swollen, right?
[59:25] A: Yeah. So like probably like. Yeah, right, good.
[59:26] B: No one's myself out the hospital went back to working cuz I was afraid of them.
[59:31] A: So then you sat in, that moment was over.
[59:33] B: Yeah.
[59:34] A: Right. And then later on you did something more fun.
[59:36] B: Yep.
[59:37] A: Like sip your coffee. Right? Right.
[59:41] B: Yeah.
[59:41] A: Or jump in the pool?
[59:42] B: Yes.
[59:43] A: Right. We got jump in the pool. Got talk in the morning. Right. And then before that, like, you. You've been working, and then you had signed yourself out, and then they told you what had happened, and then you woke up, and then you had gotten somehow to the hospital, and then you had gotten knocked out, and then he had been punching you. Right. And then you had been hiding from him. Yep. Right. And then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing.
[60:04] B: Yep.
[60:04] A: And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[60:08] B: Nothing.
[60:10] A: Yeah, right. You can remember him.
[60:11] B: Doesn't happen, huh?
[60:13] A: You can remember him doing that? You can remember putting on your jeans. Yeah, well, stop putting on your jeans. See, I'm not putting on my jeans. Stop him from doing that. Go. He's not doing that.
[60:21] B: He's not doing that.
[60:21] A: Where is it? Go. It doesn't exist.
[60:23] B: It doesn't exist.
[60:24] A: Right?
[60:24] B: Yes.
[60:25] A: Got it.
[60:25] B: Yes.
[60:26] A: Right. And again. That happening, did that have anything to do with you?
[60:29] B: No.
[60:30] A: Right. Close your eyes. Picture her. And let her know, over, finished, no longer exists. Not about me. Let her know you're. You're here now. Changing for the better. Co creating a new way of living for you. Distinctly different and way better than it's been. Right. And as this info gets in, what do you notice happening to the earlier you?
[61:04] B: I'm. Okay. I'm fading. Kind of like I'm talking to myself. But my image of me is going away.
[61:11] A: It's not stuck so troubled, is it? It's not frozen.
[61:14] B: I can't. I like po.
[61:16] A: Right. It's not frozen. Right?
[61:18] B: Yeah.
[61:18] A: Right. Cuz even right now, think about what happened with mom when you were three.
[61:23] B: Okay.
[61:24] A: And as you think about it right now, what do you notice?
[61:26] B: Nothing.
[61:27] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[61:28] B: Yeah. I really like this.
[61:31] A: Right. Notice that that's different than it's ever been.
[61:38] B: Yeah.
[61:38] A: Right.
[61:39] B: Okay, cool.
[61:40] A: Right. This is where we're headed.
[61:42] B: All right.
[61:43] A: Right, so now we've got the Buddha. We want you to slightly lower your jaw.
[61:47] B: Okay.
[61:48] A: Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Continue to breathe in this way. That's a little bit slower and deeper, allowing awareness to expand out, noticing more of the space all around you and even the space inside of you, because you're made up mostly of space. No cell is the same. All are changing. You're healing. Because as those moments are unplugged and cleared, all the energy stuck is released. That's right.
[62:34] B: Are you talking to me? I feel like my brain is computing things really quickly.
[62:38] A: It is, isn't it?
[62:39] B: It's like, weird. Like, my eyes keep moving and I keep going.
[62:41] A: Like, in my head, it is computing. It's getting things. Lots is happening in a different. So another metaphor would be if we plant seeds in the soil, we cover them up and we water.
[62:55] B: Yeah.
[62:55] A: A lot is going on.
[62:57] B: Yeah.
[62:58] A: Way more goes on before we ever see it pop through the surface.
[63:02] B: Kind of epic. Yeah.
[63:03] A: Right?
[63:04] B: Yeah.
[63:05] A: So with what we're doing, we're laying lots of seeds. Some are sprouting earlier.
[63:08] B: Yeah.
[63:09] A: But all of them are changing.
[63:12] B: Okay.
[63:13] A: Right. Because you're not flying. Feeling the same way about the stuff we just talked about.
[63:16] B: No.
[63:16] A: Which is really cool because you've never not felt that way.
[63:19] B: Right, Right. That's cool.
[63:22] A: Right. So again, that other than conscious part is going to travel back in another moment. Will be brought to your awareness to clear.
[63:31] B: Oh, that's tricky.
[63:33] A: I don't know whether it is. Right. Your unconscious knows. And you know how to clear it. Be with me because I'm more fun. Right. All we want to do is keep you here. Right. My job is to keep you here. If I notice you go there, I go back. Hey, get here. And because you're intending it with me, your mind is responsive and you quickly come back here.
[63:59] B: Okay.
[64:00] A: Right.
[64:01] B: Yeah.
[64:02] A: Right. We want you to feel good and clear. Clearing this stuff out. Not bad.
[64:06] B: Okay.
[64:07] A: Right. Notice how we've done that already.
[64:09] B: Yes.
[64:10] A: Good job. So that one happened when I was 18. And again, you're where? So you're 18. Daytime or nighttime? Yeah. Be here. Hi.
[64:23] B: It's afternoon.
[64:23] A: It's afternoon. Hi. Notice how you're there for. Hi. Be here. Yeah. No, I'm more fun. This is. And that isn't right. Exactly. You're not 80.
[64:31] B: Okay.
[64:31] A: Right. That's right. Good job. But you're here now.
[64:35] B: Yes.
[64:36] A: Right. So it was afternoon. You're where I was.
[64:41] B: It's hard because I didn't make it up. All right.
[64:43] A: See, that's the coolest part about it. We're going not for content, structure.
[64:47] B: Okay.
[64:47] A: It's all about how it coded. Remember? We didn't change the memory. You still remember what happened with Mom.
[64:53] B: Yeah, but my brain is bouncing between two images.
[64:56] A: I bet. What's the images of?
[64:59] B: When my mom didn't listen to me. And my grandma's standing in the glass door telling me. Because I want to know. My birth mom.
[65:08] A: Yeah.
[65:08] B: That she. She took my son from me and she went to. I knew that was gonna happen, and my mom wouldn't listen to me. So I'M standing there.
[65:17] A: So this is 18? Yeah.
[65:18] B: I'm telling her I'm your granddaughter and that's my son and I need him.
[65:21] A: Good job. Good job. Detail. Right.
[65:24] B: She said I was sick and not.
[65:29] A: Right. And then what happened? Be here. Hi.
[65:30] B: She.
[65:31] A: Hi.
[65:31] B: Hi.
[65:33] A: Good job. Right.
[65:33] B: I knew what was.
[65:34] A: So she said you were sick. Right.
[65:36] B: She says sick. He should need me more than him.
[65:38] A: Right. Good job. Good detail.
[65:39] B: Right.
[65:39] A: And then what happened next?
[65:43] B: I cried.
[65:44] A: Right. You cried. Right.
[65:45] B: And I had to leave my son, and I didn't want to. She lied to the judge and said that I abandoned him. But I really let her visit with him.
[65:52] A: Right. Good job. Right. And what happened next?
[65:54] B: I got pissed at my mom.
[65:55] A: Yeah. That's right. No one happened to be here. Hi. Hi.
[65:58] B: Hi. Hi.
[65:59] A: Notice how you're going there again. Right. Notice how much easier it is to get here. Right. So then you got mad at mom and then what happened?
[66:05] B: I stayed in that feeling for a very long time.
[66:09] A: Well, then you used.
[66:11] B: Yeah. For a long time I was a victim. But really, my son was. And I know that now.
[66:16] A: Yeah. But that moment ended.
[66:18] B: Yeah. But the hurt's still there.
[66:21] A: Would it. Okay, so let's stop and pause for a second.
[66:24] B: Yeah.
[66:24] A: First, would it be okay to get the hurt gone?
[66:26] B: Yeah.
[66:27] A: Oh, would.
[66:27] B: Yeah.
[66:28] A: If the hurt is gone, does it mean what happened was okay?
[66:31] B: No, it just means it happened.
[66:33] A: Right. Got it. You get to be okay even though what happened wasn't. That doesn't take away any luck.
[66:41] B: Okay.
[66:42] A: Right. Because your love is still there. He's not better off with you feeling shitty. That's true about what happened.
[66:48] B: That's true.
[66:48] A: Right. He's not better off with that. People don't make better decisions when they feel bad.
[66:53] B: No, they don't.
[66:54] A: Right.
[66:55] B: Okay.
[66:56] A: Right. Notice all those things that you found yourself doing.
[66:59] B: Yeah.
[67:00] A: That later on you've regretted that you did.
[67:02] B: Yes.
[67:03] A: Started happening because you were feeling bad.
[67:05] B: Yes.
[67:05] A: Right. Got it. So we don't make good decisions when we feel bad. So we're better off feeling good.
[67:10] B: Yeah.
[67:10] A: Right. This is what we want. We want you to be more okay.
[67:14] B: Okay.
[67:15] A: And even more okay with what happened.
[67:18] B: Okay.
[67:19] A: Does that make sense?
[67:21] B: Yes.
[67:23] A: Right?
[67:24] B: Yeah.
[67:24] A: Right. So that moment of him going and living with her, that moment stopped then. Yes. After that, there was, like, stuff that you wound up doing that you felt bad that you've done.
[67:36] B: Yeah.
[67:37] A: Right.
[67:37] B: Yeah.
[67:38] A: And then later on.
[67:39] B: Yeah.
[67:39] A: You had a sip of coffee. Right. You jumped in the pool. That's right. You had. That went. Oh, wait a minute. I can Change my life for the better. I'm not the only one. Yeah, right. Right. Oh. And with what I've gone through and being strong and brave and courageous, I can open up and be vulnerable and present and authentic with people and really help. Right? That's what you're up to.
[68:06] B: Yeah. Right.
[68:07] A: Right. So again, you can remember kind of getting that. You can remember talking to the Morgan, having a cup of coffee, jumping in the pool. Right, Right. And then you had. Had done that stuff. Right. And then you had left.
[68:20] B: Yeah.
[68:21] A: And then she'd had him. And then the court said.
[68:23] B: Yeah.
[68:24] A: And then you were standing outside the window.
[68:26] B: Yeah.
[68:26] A: And then you had told mom. And then before that, grandma had come and visited the baby.
[68:33] B: Yeah, Right. Yeah.
[68:35] A: Right.
[68:35] B: Yeah.
[68:36] A: And as we go through it backwards again compared to forward emotionally, how was it?
[68:40] B: I didn't have any emotion.
[68:41] A: Right. You can remember it happening.
[68:43] B: Yes.
[68:44] A: You can remember putting your shirt on?
[68:45] B: Yes.
[68:46] A: Well, stop putting on your shirt.
[68:48] B: I'm not putting it on my shirt.
[68:49] A: Well, then stop that from happening. It was not happening.
[68:52] B: It's not happening.
[68:53] A: Where does it say it no longer exists? And again, that happening, did that have anything to do with your lack of love?
[69:00] B: No.
[69:00] A: Or interest?
[69:02] B: No.
[69:02] A: Or wanting your son to be okay?
[69:04] B: No.
[69:04] A: That's right. Got it.
[69:06] B: Yeah.
[69:07] A: Right. And we also realized that there were certain lifestyle and other things that were going on in your world that probably weren't always best.
[69:14] B: Yeah.
[69:15] A: For a baby.
[69:18] B: Yes.
[69:19] A: Right. So. So. So. Yeah. Right. Right. But it happening had nothing to do with your lack of love.
[69:29] B: No.
[69:30] A: Right.
[69:32] B: That's right.
[69:33] A: So now, as we're getting it, close your eyes and let the earlier. You know that. That's. That's right. That had nothing to do with my lack of love. Right. That there were certain things that were going on with me and my world then that weren't always best for a baby. I let her know that you're okay. Let her know about getting that. Oh, my goodness, I can change my life. I'm not the only one. I can help others. Wow. That's right. Let her know you're clean. Right? That's right. And again, as all of this is getting in, what do you notice?
[70:23] B: I'm happier.
[70:25] A: Yeah. You can open your eyes. Yeah. Yeah. Right?
[70:31] B: Yeah. That was cool.
[70:32] A: I bet.
[70:34] B: Wow.
[70:34] A: Notice how things are slowing down in here? Yeah. Right.
[70:39] B: All right. I'm like, oh, wow.
[70:44] A: Right. And it's not so that it's always slow. It's so that I get range with variability that I can go fast and.
[70:52] B: Slow, fast and slow.
[70:54] A: Right.
[70:54] B: Okay.
[70:55] A: An abc. Say slow is smooth.
[70:58] B: Really?
[70:58] A: And smooth is fast. What?
[71:00] B: That's cool.
[71:02] A: Isn't it?
[71:02] B: Yeah. I like the Navy SEALs actually.
[71:04] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[71:05] B: I do. Alright.
[71:07] A: So again. As this is getting in. Notice what's happening to the feelings.
[71:12] B: Okay.
[71:13] A: Right. We want to again travel back through things that have happened. Right. In another moment.
[71:24] B: I don't have another one. Give me another one.
[71:27] A: Isn't that interesting?
[71:28] B: That's weird. I had all these things pop up.
[71:32] A: Right. But notice what's starting to happen with widespread activation.
[71:37] B: Really?
[71:38] A: Correct. Because that's what the brain starts to do.
[71:41] B: I think I have one. I've held on from me though.
[71:44] A: Yeah.
[71:44] B: Yeah.
[71:45] A: We want to do that one. Yeah. That's. That would be useful to get cleared. I don't like thinking about that one. That's yucky.
[71:55] B: Yeah.
[71:55] A: Right. But be here. I'm more fun.
[71:57] B: Yeah. You are. Okay.
[71:58] A: We're doing this together.
[72:00] B: All right?
[72:00] A: Right. I'm. I'm totally here.
[72:02] B: Okay.
[72:03] A: Right. So if you start going. I'm all. I'm gonna do everything I know to have you stay with me.
[72:08] B: Okay.
[72:09] A: Because this is. And that isn't me.
[72:10] B: Okay.
[72:11] A: You're here.
[72:12] B: Yes. I am now. Yes.
[72:13] A: That happened.
[72:14] B: Yes.
[72:15] A: Way back then.
[72:16] B: Yes.
[72:17] A: Right.
[72:17] B: Okay.
[72:18] A: You are.
[72:19] B: I am.
[72:20] A: It isn't. That's right. The only reason that you've remained troubled by it is that part of your brain doesn't know that it isn't.
[72:31] B: Yeah.
[72:32] A: That it no longer exists. That it's over.
[72:34] B: Okay.
[72:35] A: You do when you're here with me. Don't you?
[72:37] B: Yes.
[72:37] A: Know that it's over.
[72:38] B: Yes.
[72:39] A: Right.
[72:40] B: Okay.
[72:40] A: That's what we're getting in. So you stay here with me as we educate the earlier you. That that moment is over. That she survived it. That she made it through it. That she was okay. Right. Right. We also want to hold that you are much more than your body.
[72:56] B: I'm much more than my body.
[72:58] A: Right. Aren't you?
[72:59] B: Yes.
[72:59] A: Heck. What if your body's not even you?
[73:01] B: My body's not me.
[73:03] A: No.
[73:03] B: No.
[73:04] A: Right. You have one.
[73:06] B: Yeah.
[73:07] A: Right.
[73:08] B: Okay.
[73:09] A: Your body's totally yours. But it isn't actually you.
[73:17] B: Okay.
[73:19] A: Right. You're not your body. You have it. Stuff may have happened to your body. But what if it never touched who you really are?
[73:30] B: Okay.
[73:31] A: What you became aware of as you see the sky.
[73:34] B: Okay.
[73:34] A: Got it?
[73:35] B: Yeah.
[73:36] A: And I'm gonna show you. I gotta move this little thing out of the way. I want you to take. Take a hand. Hold it up like that. Right. Have the fingers together kind of look at that spot. Right there. Okay. Now, as you look at that spot, I'm gonna just slide my chair over.
[73:53] B: Okay.
[73:54] A: I'm gonna take this hand.
[73:55] B: Hand.
[73:55] A: I'm going to move it towards your hand. Just like with your peripheral vision, you're going to begin to notice and see it moving closer.
[74:04] B: Yeah.
[74:04] A: And then as it moves closer, you can begin to feel it.
[74:08] B: I look at your hand now, right? Yeah.
[74:11] A: Notice how you can begin to feel the warmth from my hand and then the fingertips and the palm. Period.
[74:20] B: Yeah.
[74:21] A: Right. You can feel this energy.
[74:24] B: Yes.
[74:25] A: And you notice that I'm not even touching your hand yet. You're feeling this energy.
[74:35] B: Yeah, that's right.
[74:37] A: Which means I'm coming closer to touching who you really are.
[74:43] B: Cool.
[74:44] A: Than anybody that ever messed with your body.
[74:47] B: Cool.
[74:49] A: Hurt your feelings. Screwed up your thinking. Because who you are can only be touched with respect and mutual collaboration.
[75:03] B: Yeah, that's right. Okay.
[75:06] A: That's right.
[75:07] B: That's cool.
[75:08] A: So now, as you let that hand drop back down.
[75:12] B: Okay.
[75:13] A: Repeat these silly words after me. I have a nose.
[75:16] B: I have a nose.
[75:17] A: I have ten fingers.
[75:18] B: I have ten fingers.
[75:19] A: I need two elbows.
[75:20] B: I have two elbows.
[75:21] A: I have ten toes.
[75:22] B: I have ten toes.
[75:23] A: I'm not my nose.
[75:24] B: I'm not my nose.
[75:25] A: I'm not my elbows.
[75:26] B: I'm not my elbows.
[75:26] A: My fingers.
[75:27] B: Or my fingers.
[75:28] A: Or my toes.
[75:28] B: Or my toes.
[75:29] A: I have a vagina.
[75:30] B: I have a vagina.
[75:31] A: I'm not my vagina.
[75:32] B: I'm not my vagina.
[75:32] A: I have an ass.
[75:33] B: I have an ass.
[75:34] A: I'm not my ass.
[75:34] B: I'm not my ass.
[75:35] A: They're mine.
[75:36] B: My mines.
[75:37] A: They're mine.
[75:37] B: They're mine. Okay.
[75:39] A: They're not me.
[75:40] B: They're not me.
[75:41] A: That's right.
[75:42] B: Okay.
[75:42] A: It's my stuff.
[75:43] B: It's my stuff, but it's not me. It's not me.
[75:46] A: Right. Right.
[75:49] B: Okay.
[75:49] A: So that's part of what we want to get in. Because we know that there have been both physical acts that have happened to external body.
[75:57] B: Yeah.
[75:57] A: And internal acts that have happened to internal.
[76:00] B: Yeah, got it. Yeah.
[76:02] A: And in some of those moments, there were moments of it that were easier to navigate through, and there were moments of it that were really much harder to navigate through. Got it. Because that's just kind of the nature of how that goes. We want to be getting in that. In those violent, unwanted moments where there's both stuff that happened to physical and sexual body, that at a deeper level we begin to realize, one, there's no part that's the same as when that stuff happened. Two, it never actually Touched who I really am. Messed with my body. Never got me. Yeah, right. We want to get that kind of news in to that more deeper part of the brain.
[76:50] B: Okay.
[76:51] A: So again, that moment, that kind of surface that we don't like to talk about because when we do, it makes us feel yucky. Happened when.
[77:01] B: I would just sum it all up with I was 3 to 11. But I think the other parts I was thinking about, I don't care about so much anymore. Oh, say more about that you don't care about so much, like the beatings and stuff. I think I'm thinking more of like the emotional part when I was in the courtroom.
[77:25] A: And that's beautiful. So you're in the courtroom again.
[77:28] B: And I had gone through all these doctor visits. I was being told what I went through wasn't. Right.
[77:34] A: Right. Good job, good detail. You're about how old when that happened?
[77:36] B: I was 11 years old, so I'm almost 12 now.
[77:41] A: Right. Good job, Good detail. Right.
[77:42] B: I'm with my grandma.
[77:44] A: Right. So you're with grandma. Right. Yeah.
[77:46] B: And. And.
[77:49] A: So you're sitting there, Right. And the judge, male or female?
[77:53] B: Male.
[77:54] A: Yeah. Right. So he's telling you kind of up above, you're down here talking.
[77:57] B: Ah. Just kind of remember what he looks like. That's cool.
[78:00] A: Isn't that cool?
[78:01] B: Yeah.
[78:01] A: Right. So we just did something for you there that was add irrelevant detail.
[78:06] B: Wow.
[78:07] A: Because as we add irrelevant detail, your brain begins to realize that's data really about something that's over.
[78:14] B: Yeah.
[78:15] A: Right.
[78:15] B: Okay.
[78:16] A: Right. So then the judge is saying the stuff. Right.
[78:20] B: He said, does anybody want to say anything at the end of the proceeding?
[78:25] A: Right. Good job. Right. Then what happened next?
[78:27] B: I said I did. And I just said, I want to know why you did this to me.
[78:33] A: To who?
[78:34] B: To my adopted family.
[78:36] A: So you're saying to the adopt. Why did you do this to me? Meaning what? It was that they did all different.
[78:40] B: Stuff, like physical to like sexual mental abuses for years.
[78:44] A: Got it. Okay. So why did you do all this stuff to me? Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[78:48] B: I cried. You're in my family. I loved you.
[78:51] A: Right.
[78:52] B: Then afterwards, my grandma's yelling at me in the courtroom.
[78:55] A: Yes.
[78:55] B: And beside the courtroom and the stairs, saying, I don't understand you. Why would you say that? And my mom is sitting with my adoptive family. My birthday mom.
[79:04] A: Right.
[79:05] B: Yeah. So it was a really confusing.
[79:07] A: Right. And then what happened next? Well, notice how the mind stopped the story at the shitty spot.
[79:14] B: Yes. I can't tell you.
[79:17] A: Right. What. What happened next is we left the courtroom. And then later on, I was talking to Morgan.
[79:22] B: Yeah.
[79:23] A: I jumped in the pool.
[79:24] B: Yeah.
[79:24] A: Right. I had that. Oh, my goodness. I. I'm not the only one. Yeah, Right.
[79:30] B: Okay.
[79:31] A: Right. So we got. Getting that epiphany talking to Morgan.
[79:33] B: Yeah.
[79:33] A: Right. Then we left the courtroom.
[79:35] B: Yeah.
[79:35] A: And then grandma saying, I can't believe you and mom sitting with that family who did all that awful shit to me. And then I had left the courtroom, and then I cried. And then I'm like, why did you do all of this awful stuff to me? And then the judge had asked, is there anybody wanting? And then they said, this stuff that happened to you was wrong. And then you guys had gone to court.
[79:51] B: Yeah.
[79:51] A: And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[79:53] B: Yeah.
[79:54] A: And again, going backwards, what do you notice?
[79:58] B: I don't think about it the same.
[80:01] A: Right. You can remember it happening.
[80:04] B: Yeah. Kinda. Really?
[80:06] A: You can actually remember it. Right. You know that it happened.
[80:09] B: Yeah.
[80:09] A: Right. But then being that way, did that have anything to do with you?
[80:12] B: No.
[80:13] A: You didn't know, even at that age, and you don't even fully have it now, that those people were really, really screwed up.
[80:21] B: Yeah.
[80:22] A: Not just the adopted family, but mom and Grandma. Yeah. Which led to you also being really messed up. Yes. But the really cool part is.
[80:33] B: Yeah.
[80:33] A: You're not like them because you're actually doing something to change.
[80:37] B: Yeah.
[80:38] A: That's the biggest difference. Right. You got born into it. You couldn't help but be it.
[80:43] B: Okay. Yeah. Okay.
[80:46] A: Got it.
[80:47] B: Yeah.
[80:47] A: But when you had the epiphany, you went, oh, my. My life and who I get to be in life does not have to be determined solely by what I went through.
[80:56] B: Yeah. I have said that. That's cool that you said that.
[81:00] A: Right.
[81:01] B: Like. Yes. I tell myself that it doesn't define me.
[81:03] A: That's right.
[81:04] B: Yeah.
[81:05] A: It's not even a part of you.
[81:06] B: No.
[81:06] A: It's stuff you did, stuff you went through, but not a part of you. So. No, it doesn't define you.
[81:12] B: Yeah.
[81:13] A: Right. But what we're installing is all the strength that one gains from going through awful moments. Because back then, when all that was going on, that you did feel a little bit like it had something to do with me.
[81:26] B: Yeah.
[81:26] A: Right. How could my birth mom, knowing what these people did to me, be sitting next to them? How come. Why is my grandmother yelling at me?
[81:32] B: Yeah.
[81:33] A: What the fuck is wrong with the picture? There's something fucking off.
[81:38] B: Right, Right. Yeah.
[81:41] A: But again, as we're looking at. Didn't have anything to do with you. Had everything to do with them not being well.
[81:45] B: Yeah, I know.
[81:46] A: Right? Got it. So now close your eyes and let that 12 year old. You know that stuff's over, finished, defeated, no longer exists. Them being that way. That stuff happening nothing to do with you. Had everything to do with what was fucked up with them. It's not about me. So she gets it. It let her know about having the epiphany, realizing I'm not the only one. And powerfully taking steps to dramatically improve life for herself and those that matter to her. To make a difference for others. All of this is getting inside. Right? What happens to that earlier, you. What happens to her face now?
[82:31] B: She smiles and she walks off.
[82:35] A: Yeah. And you can open your eyes.
[82:38] B: Yeah. That was cool, right? Yeah.
[82:42] A: Notice how these things are changing and all of that stuff layered in where it felt like it had stuff to do with my worth.
[82:51] B: Yeah.
[82:52] A: My value, my lovability.
[82:55] B: Yeah.
[82:56] A: Whether I was good enough or worth it or worthy.
[82:59] B: Okay.
[83:00] A: Makes sense.
[83:01] B: Yes.
[83:03] A: All of that is getting changed because what's getting integrated is it wasn't about me in the first place. And I am worth it.
[83:10] B: Okay.
[83:11] A: And I'm worth it to me.
[83:12] B: Okay.
[83:14] A: Right. Just think about you thinking back to the three year old.
[83:19] B: Okay.
[83:20] A: You thinking back to the stuff that happened at 18. You're thinking back to this stuff at court. You're thinking about it now. Right. But coming from the perspective of you valuing her, just thinking how brave that 3 year old was. Just think how brave the 12 year old is in front of all these people saying that.
[83:42] B: Yeah.
[83:44] A: Right. Trying to comprehend how this all awful shit could continue to happen to me. What the fuck?
[83:50] B: Yeah. That's true.
[83:52] A: Right?
[83:52] B: Yeah.
[83:53] A: But notice how much she's worth it to you.
[83:59] B: Okay. Yeah.
[84:00] A: Right now.
[84:00] B: Okay.
[84:01] A: Right. Isn't she worth it to you?
[84:03] B: Yeah.
[84:03] A: Right?
[84:04] B: Yeah. Is it weird that I think my younger me is worth it and I'm struggling with the me now?
[84:10] A: We're not here yet.
[84:11] B: Okay?
[84:15] A: Right. We're not here yet. Because what you haven't fully integrated is that change. You've changed. You're not the same as you were. You're clean.
[84:27] B: Yeah.
[84:27] A: And for how long now?
[84:29] B: I've only been clean for I think 40 days.
[84:33] A: Yeah. 40 days is really good.
[84:35] B: I know. I never thought I'd do it.
[84:38] A: I recognize that. I don't want to live the way I've lived.
[84:43] B: Yeah.
[84:44] A: And I'm interested in changing my life for the better. I entered a program whether that be because it was a good decision or like I needed to Avoid other stuff. Doesn't matter. You stepped into doing something to improve you and your life.
[85:02] B: Yeah.
[85:03] A: Right. You're getting in here.
[85:06] B: Yeah.
[85:07] A: Right. You're hearing from other people, like Tori.
[85:10] B: Yeah.
[85:11] A: 1. What changes and how different their life is from what it used to be.
[85:15] B: Okay.
[85:16] A: Right?
[85:16] B: Yes. Yeah. I am different.
[85:20] A: You are. You're not the same.
[85:21] B: Yep. Okay.
[85:23] A: Right. And that was all stuff you did. It was never who you are.
[85:26] B: Yeah.
[85:27] A: Right. And this is what we're starting to change.
[85:32] B: Okay.
[85:34] A: Right. So again, as you're checking in with your body, how's your body feeling now?
[85:40] B: My body feels light and relaxed.
[85:44] A: Yeah.
[85:44] B: It's my brain that feels kind of heavy.
[85:46] A: Oh, wow.
[85:47] B: So I'm like. It's, like, crowding up here, and I'd be like, boom, boom, boom. All these sensors are going on.
[85:56] A: Yeah. There's lots of rewiring in the neural circuitry.
[86:00] B: Yeah.
[86:01] A: Yeah. And that brain is going to travel back to another moment that would be useful for us to clear.
[86:12] B: I feel like there's some. I can't give you anything else. I don't know if my brain, like, sometimes feels like. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so you got one. I know what I see is, like, a dark tunnel, and I'm not gonna go down there.
[86:34] A: The tunnel?
[86:35] B: Yeah. In my brain. My brain doesn't want to.
[86:37] A: What if we turn the lights on?
[86:39] B: Turn the lights on.
[86:40] A: What if we instead of saw a tunnel, we opened it up with a lot of space. Right. So why watch what happens right in here?
[86:48] B: Well, you know what he said.
[86:50] A: As you look at me and you see my fingers.
[86:53] B: Yeah.
[86:54] A: And we open up to a lot more space.
[86:57] B: Okay.
[86:59] A: So it's no longer tunneled.
[87:00] B: Okay.
[87:01] A: Because I have stuff in my periphery.
[87:04] B: All right?
[87:05] A: And as I settle down in my peripheral vision, it's only about getting good news in the crazy thing to remember, because it is crazy. I'm not troubled because it happened.
[87:19] B: I'm not troubled because it happened.
[87:21] A: I'm troubled because part of my brain doesn't know it's not happening now.
[87:27] B: Okay.
[87:28] A: I do the part of me that's sitting here talking to you. But there's a whole other part of your brain that doesn't know certain moments are over. And as a protectionary mechanism, we've learned we don't go there. There's a silly Disney movie called Encanto now, and there was a song in it that says, we don't talk about Brun. No, no, no. Right. We don't talk about Brune. No. Right. Like, we don't go there. Right. So if we're gonna go there, we want to do it with our eyes open. We want to do it with wide open space. We want to do it with the lights on.
[88:08] B: Okay.
[88:09] A: Right. Because the light takes away distortion and darkness. With the lights on, I see things more clearly.
[88:16] B: Yeah. Okay.
[88:18] A: Right. The lights are on here.
[88:20] B: Okay.
[88:21] A: Between us, we. You are already having lights on. But like a tall building, the lights have been only on in the top couple force. The rest has been still dark.
[88:30] B: Yeah.
[88:31] A: We're enlightening.
[88:33] B: Okay.
[88:33] A: Up the building.
[88:35] B: Okay.
[88:36] A: Lightening up.
[88:37] B: Okay.
[88:38] A: So that you get to be more okay. In you.
[88:40] B: All right.
[88:41] A: Yeah. So what's happening now? Yeah. Amazingly resourceful. I don't know whether you fully realize that just in noticing what's going on with you.
[89:04] B: Yeah.
[89:05] A: Like, you're amazingly resourceful. And there's been a tool within your mind and body that in certain moments, you didn't have to be in your body to experience what happened to it.
[89:16] B: Okay.
[89:19] A: There's. Yeah. Which is a really, really powerful tool.
[89:22] B: Yeah. I don't think my brain likes it. You told her that it got really tight over here, like, oh, I'm in trouble now.
[89:30] A: No, but that's a really powerful tool.
[89:33] B: Yeah. Okay.
[89:34] A: Cool. To be able to do all that.
[89:36] B: All right.
[89:36] A: So you're in jail.
[89:38] B: Yeah.
[89:38] A: Right. You're about how old? What happen?
[89:48] B: I would say I'm 23.
[89:50] A: Yeah. Right, right.
[89:52] B: No, 21.
[89:53] A: No. Right around that age.
[89:54] B: Yep.
[89:54] A: And again, we can make up what we think might have happened. How you doing right now?
[89:59] B: Good. I'm filtering through it fast.
[90:02] A: Isn't that interesting? You're filtering through it fast. Now, what happens if you filter through it backwards fast? Right. And then what would happen if we had it like, you know, like a deck of cards and we. And then you filter through it so it's completely shuffled in completely different order.
[90:20] B: Okay.
[90:21] A: And then it goes backwards, right?
[90:24] B: Yes.
[90:24] A: As it goes back, I won't be.
[90:26] B: Able to do it.
[90:27] A: What do you notice happening to the feelings?
[90:32] B: I don't have any.
[90:33] A: Isn't that cool?
[90:34] B: Yeah.
[90:35] A: Right.
[90:36] B: How did my brain do that, though?
[90:38] A: You already gave me the thing that it was doing. You were already flipping through it fast.
[90:42] B: Yeah.
[90:42] A: So then all we needed to do is add. Well, what would it be like to flip through it backwards? What would be like it. To shuffle it? And now it's all like.
[90:50] B: I think I feel very thankful that you did that, because I wasn't ready to focus on it, I think. And I was trying to pick the parts that would be less painful you.
[90:59] A: Didn'T want to talk about it.
[91:00] B: Yeah.
[91:01] A: Right. So guess what? We don't always have to talk about stuff, Chantelle. To unplug the emotional effect. Because watch when you think about it now and remember it, where is it? Like, in your visual field, where do you see it? Is it in the same location it used to be or is it different?
[91:24] B: I just see a door with the light. I can't see it too much, but I can feel.
[91:29] A: Where do you feel it?
[91:30] B: In my chest.
[91:31] A: In your chest. So good. And where else?
[91:39] B: In my mind. I feel afraid, upset.
[91:42] A: Right. But there's nothing here while you're in the light with me that you're upset about.
[91:50] B: No.
[91:51] A: No. You actually like being here.
[91:52] B: Yeah.
[91:52] A: This is fun. Who would have thought that we could deal with that kind of shit?
[91:56] B: Yeah.
[91:56] A: In a way that I don't have to be in it.
[91:59] B: Right?
[91:59] A: Right.
[92:00] B: Okay.
[92:00] A: Isn't that cool?
[92:01] B: Yeah.
[92:02] A: Right.
[92:03] B: Okay.
[92:04] A: So nobody wants to go in it, right? Right. What we want to do is we want to get. So if we were to even think of already being on the other side of that, like, what would it be like if that stuff down that, you know, tunnel thing, whenever. The door, the light that you see that. I don't want to go there because, like, that represents a whole bunch of other stuff, right?
[92:24] B: Yeah.
[92:24] A: What if you were already on the other side of it and all that stuff just no longer caused any disruption in you at all? Like, what would that be like for you?
[92:33] B: Liberating.
[92:34] A: Liberating. Right. What's it like when you feel liberated? Free?
[92:39] B: I don't know.
[92:40] A: Because isn't another word for being liberated Free?
[92:43] B: Yeah.
[92:44] A: Good. So now think of the Buddha being liberated, free. And then imagine as you're breathing a little bit slower and deeper, floating up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the rooftop, so that you float way up above it all. You're a bird in the sky. Free. Liberated to soar in any direction and move all around and in all ways. That's right. Soaring, gliding, flying free, above, over it all. That's right. Lightening up as you get above and over it. The higher you rise, the smaller it becomes. That's right. That's right. And as you check right now in your body, what do you notice? How's your body feeling?
[93:47] B: I wasn't feeling my body.
[93:49] A: I know, right? Yeah, you're up above, not feeling your body. But now, as you bring awareness to body, what do you notice?
[93:57] B: Even if you're up above, I'm relaxed and I don't have A same tension I had.
[94:04] A: That's right.
[94:05] B: Yeah.
[94:06] A: This is how responsive your mind is to you. Interested in working in ways that are beneficial and best. It's happening as you rest. Click. News is getting spread through the different cells within your body so that all the cells in your body are getting the good news. Free. Liberated. No longer bound or chained or stuck free. On my way to becoming even more free. Peaceful, clear, light. Right. Deepest part realizing never got who I really am. That's right. When you're ready, you can bring awareness back down and into your body. That's right. And eyes are open. What's happening now?
[95:30] B: My brain doesn't feel as heavy.
[95:32] A: Oh, it doesn't, does it?
[95:33] B: No. My body doesn't either.
[95:35] A: Right.
[95:36] B: Yeah.
[95:38] A: Right.
[95:39] B: It's weird because my tension headache in the front of my brain, like, went off of my eyes. It just went. I felt the movement go down my face now.
[95:47] A: Slid right off.
[95:48] B: Yeah. That's weird. Right? It was like I was, like, having a conversation with my brain in there while you were talking to me. Yeah. Okay.
[95:56] A: And notice what you're noticing. That's different.
[96:00] B: Yeah. Weird. My brain feels, like, fuzzy, like I'm using parts I don't normally use or.
[96:08] A: Something different lit up at the same time. Troubling parts lit up. There's a saying in neuroscience, it's called Hebb's law. And what it means is neurons that fire together wire together. So we're taking two neural networks that were separated from a threshold and we're firing them on at the same time. You intending to be here as you remember past moments. And we fire them off at the same time. Your brain rewires. This is. That isn't okay. Right.
[96:53] B: That's weird. You think your brain. So is your brain separate from your con? I don't know.
[96:59] A: So they're all interconnected?
[97:00] B: Yeah. But I feel like there's two separate parts.
[97:03] A: Like more than two, probably.
[97:05] B: Yeah.
[97:05] A: Right. We have a trion brain. So that's reptilian animal frontal cortex.
[97:12] B: Trion is three parts.
[97:13] A: Yeah. Right.
[97:14] B: Yeah.
[97:16] A: Triune, I think, is how it's said. And then we have a head brain, a heart brain, and a gut brain.
[97:22] B: Yeah.
[97:22] A: They're also another three. Right. And then we have a left and a right.
[97:27] B: Yeah. Okay.
[97:29] A: So there's five, six, seven, eight.
[97:33] B: I would say there's eight parts to your brain, but I would put nine.
[97:37] A: Nine.
[97:38] B: Because you have your. I think you have your subconscious, your conscious, and then a part of you that doesn't interconnect with that.
[97:48] A: Yeah. So then if we think about it.
[97:50] B: Yeah.
[97:51] A: Right. There has been a part of you that has had fear about going past that door. Right, right. There's another part of you that goes, oh, well, let's bring light to it.
[98:09] B: Okay.
[98:10] A: Right, yeah. But the parts have been somewhat in conflict. Yes, Got it.
[98:16] B: Yeah.
[98:17] A: So we don't have have to go through something in full content to begin to first realize that it's over. So even if in your mind's eye, you were to float back along the timeline to one of those moments. Right. So instead of tunneling down, we kind of float up above and go to the other side where that material is. Right. We keep it far away and we make it smaller and we actually put it down by the baseboard. So the moment happened really far away. Kind of like if I were to take my screen and my phone and place it down there. Right. And that the whole incident of what happened, one of those moments through that dark doorway, whatever happened in the small little iPhone screen. Right. And then as we go through it, rerun it so that it's fast forward. Right. Like, have you ever like listened to an audiobook? Audio recording.
[99:14] B: Yeah.
[99:14] A: They can do it at regular time.
[99:16] B: Yeah.
[99:16] A: Right. Or a podcast.
[99:18] B: Yeah.
[99:18] A: You can do it at one and a quarter.
[99:20] B: Yeah.
[99:20] A: One and a half or two.
[99:22] B: Yeah.
[99:23] A: Right. And the faster they go. They go the faster. Right, yeah. So let's think of one of those moments where there's that stuffing that you don't want to go.
[99:35] B: Okay.
[99:35] A: That we just see it kind of going fast forward.
[99:40] B: Okay.
[99:40] A: But it's connecting to you. Having a sip of that coffee. Right. Going into the pool. Learning ways to self regulate. Having the epiphany that I can change my life. Right. So it goes really fast in the screen.
[99:59] B: Yeah.
[100:01] A: And then we take it backwards fast and scream. And then we have you kind of float up above the moment so that you can look from above down at what happened then and the different things that transpired. What you did, what happened to you, your body. Right, right. And what's happening now.
[100:30] B: I don't have the same feeling about the event, but the same image keeps popping in my head.
[100:35] A: Uh huh. You don't have the same feeling, but you keep seeing the same thing.
[100:38] B: Yeah. But I feel like it relates to something else.
[100:41] A: I bet. Right. So the image. Right. Is the image more like a picture?
[100:45] B: Yes.
[100:46] A: Uh huh. Black and white or color? What happens if you make it black and white? Isn't that weird?
[100:55] B: Yeah.
[100:55] A: Right. Does the picture have a frame around it?
[100:58] B: No.
[100:58] A: No. So it's like it's like what happens if we put a frame around it?
[101:04] B: I can't even think of it.
[101:06] A: Right. Think of the image. Right. And we put a frame around it and then we move it further away so we make that image smaller inside the frame. Right. What do you notice happening to the feelings?
[101:20] B: There's no feelings, I think.
[101:25] A: Right.
[101:27] B: Well, when I did that, I can't focus on that image.
[101:30] A: Right, right.
[101:31] B: I think it's more.
[101:33] A: What are you noticing in your body is you can't focus on the image anymore.
[101:40] B: My stomach hurts a little bit.
[101:41] A: Uh huh.
[101:42] B: Yeah. I think it has to do with that, thinking about it.
[101:46] A: Right. So what if your stomach didn't hurt anymore? Right. That if you just notice some of the sensations without having to do anything with or about them.
[102:00] B: Okay.
[102:00] A: Because there's really good information. Right. Regardless of what moment it is the good information. Information that we want to get in. Because there were times when you were going through really difficult experiences that you weren't sure you were going to survive. You weren't sure you were going to be okay. You weren't sure you were going to make it through it. Make sense? The really good news that you and I have from here, Chantal, is that you did make it through it. So what that means is even back then when you weren't sure you had what you needed to make it through it, you must have, because you made it through it. Right. You had what you needed inside of you to make it through. It's why you recognize that me being able to get clear and free from this stuff and even share my experience and story can be powerfully healing for others. That's right. Because you know at a deep level that we all are interconnected. We all have pains. You're not the only one. Right. And what's happening now? How's your stomach feeling now?
[103:27] B: I wasn't paying attention.
[103:29] A: Well, just check.
[103:29] B: It feels better.
[103:30] A: It does, doesn't it?
[103:32] B: Yeah.
[103:32] A: And what are you noticing now within you?
[103:35] B: That my brain is reinforcing what you said and taking the image and making it powerful.
[103:46] A: Taking the image of you.
[103:48] B: Yeah.
[103:48] A: And making it powerful.
[103:50] B: Yeah. Well, I think the moment when I did it, it was like it's. I can't explain it. I can't explain that.
[104:02] A: But the moment that you did it, you did it.
[104:05] B: I feel like my brain is showing me an experience in which I had a higher, like, I want to say, say, intellect. But certain things I did during that traumatic experiment. Experience that you can't explain.
[104:28] A: No. You sure you were connected to something? Beyond you.
[104:33] B: Everything in the world, who I reached my hand out to and asked to pray for me, who they be, who, like, who it led me to, who I was involved with. You know what I mean? How I knew that there was life inside of me, stuff like that. On a higher level, even though my test said negative, like, it's just showing me that I'm not. I can't explain it to you. So the image I had in my head when you were talking to me was reaching out my hand and I asked the man to pray for me. And it's like I knew on a higher level who he was. And it was. I was against what was happening. I didn't have a choice. It was taken from me and people involved. It was like, I can't explain it to you. I can't. I was willing to die for it because I believed in that. Does that make sense?
[105:25] A: I'm saying that was an experience that has happened.
[105:29] B: Yeah, that happened.
[105:30] A: Yeah.
[105:31] B: I was in jail and I. I can talk about it now, but I think that because what you did, my brain was trying to show me that I've had. I can't explain it.
[105:44] A: You've had experiences that you connected to something more than you?
[105:48] B: Yeah.
[105:49] A: That's what you say?
[105:50] B: Yeah. Like when I saw my son on ultrasound at nine weeks, I knew he was a boy.
[105:57] A: You connect to things that. That are beyond you. Greater than you.
[106:01] B: Yeah, Right? Yeah, but that's scary sometimes, because then you're different.
[106:07] A: How so?
[106:12] B: I told my mom about the day I was born. I chose myself. I told her what she was wearing, what kind of car she was in. I was like a ball of energy. And there was a masculine one by me. And I've never forgot this memory since I. I was a child. And when I told her, she told me to shut the fuck up because I was right about everything.
[106:30] A: Well, she told you to shut the fuck up.
[106:32] B: Yeah, but that didn't matter. The point was, is that it reinforced that it was a true memory and I never forgot it. And the masculine energy beside me asked me if I was sure about choosing myself, that my life was going to be a hard one. And I said, yes, I'm sure. So it's like it all intertwines with that.
[106:52] A: It does, doesn't it?
[106:54] B: Is that weird? Am I crazy?
[106:56] A: No. But mom saying that again wasn't about you.
[106:59] B: No. She was in shock. She was scared, she said, because I was right about everything, and how could I know that?
[107:03] A: And it wasn't about you.
[107:05] B: Yeah, she was in labor with me. And she's never told me the story. And I told her what she was wearing, how she was sitting in the car, what color the car was, and I was right. Is that not weird?
[107:21] A: It's not weird at all. But see, as you've connected to that and you recognize. Okay.
[107:29] B: And you said the conscious thing. We're all connected. I agree. It's like we really are supposed to be.
[107:35] A: Well, we're all interconnected.
[107:36] B: Yeah, but, Nora, gifts, I think, lots of times.
[107:40] A: Right. So there. There's a saying. You come from nowhere. You are now here. You'll go back to nowhere, and all it is is changing where you space it because it's N o w h e r e nowhere or N o w h e r e. It's the same word. It's just where you space it. Isn't that cool?
[108:06] B: Yeah.
[108:06] A: Yeah.
[108:08] B: I like the feeling of, like, vibration.
[108:10] A: Yeah. So the thing we really want to get in because you already know that it's happened.
[108:14] B: Okay.
[108:15] A: To the you who wasn't sure she was going to survive that, you know, serial killer guy.
[108:20] B: Yeah.
[108:20] A: To let her know that she did.
[108:22] B: I did. Yeah.
[108:23] A: Right. Wouldn't it be useful for the you who's in moments where she was really, really scared and not sure she was gonna live to let her know she survived?
[108:33] B: Yeah.
[108:34] A: Right. Wouldn't that be good news? Or are you gonna keep it for her? Don't tell her. Don't tell her.
[108:37] B: No. I think that something else told me I was, and that's where the rift in me began.
[108:43] A: Something else told you that you were gonna survive this and you listened. That's the part that happened. You listened.
[108:54] B: Yeah. Okay.
[108:55] A: Got it. That's what changed you. Listen.
[108:58] B: Yeah.
[108:59] A: Right.
[109:00] B: That was cool. Now my ears ringing, like.
[109:02] A: Right. And out of listening, it's changed your life.
[109:08] B: Yeah.
[109:08] A: And the trajectory of your life.
[109:10] B: Absolutely.
[109:11] A: Right.
[109:12] B: Yeah.
[109:14] A: So I wonder what it would be like for you here to think back to that you who listened and let her know how grateful you are that she listened and let her know who she gets to become on her way to becoming so much more. Let that. You know. Right. All the positive changes you're making now that you're valuing you, that you see the younger you as being totally worth it to you. That's right. That you're healing, that you're becoming more and more okay in you. That's right. Things are beginning to lighten up on the inside. That's right. Healing is happening. Right. I want to you notice how's your body feeling now?
[110:17] B: Alive.
[110:18] A: It is.
[110:18] B: My brain felt alive too.
[110:20] A: Yeah?
[110:21] B: Yeah. But I wasn't just talking to me. I was talking to God. That weird. I was thanking him too.
[110:29] A: Yeah.
[110:29] B: I don't know. Yeah.
[110:33] A: Good job.
[110:34] B: That's weird. I feel like I'm crazy or something.
[110:38] A: No. What I'm gonna tell you is that there may be certain people that can't hear that message from you yet.
[110:48] B: I know.
[110:49] A: Okay. That has nothing to do with you being crazy.
[110:53] B: Okay.
[110:54] A: Okay.
[110:55] B: Yeah.
[110:56] A: What I said earlier is that you have a highly developed sensory acuity. That you pay attention. Right. And that's aided you in survival. Not always been fast. Stuck on all the time. So we're right. Getting some. That was a really good breath. Getting some variability within this. Does that make sense? So this is what's ongoingly happening inside of you.
[111:25] B: Yeah.
[111:26] A: Right. So things have already begun changing for the better. Because when you think about the stuff that we have talked about. Mom stuff, grandma son stuff, 12 years old and court stuff, other stuff. When you think about those things now, notice what you notice in terms of how you feel.
[111:52] B: That it's irrelevant to what I was created for.
[111:55] A: Uh huh.
[111:56] B: That weird?
[111:57] A: No.
[111:57] B: That it doesn't define me.
[111:59] A: That's right. It never was a part of me. It's what I went through. It isn't me. Right? Yeah. Isn't that school? Yeah. What are you noticing now?
[112:40] B: That I'm not supposed to talk about anything. Like I thought. Like I feel like.
[112:50] A: You'Re not supposed to talk about it.
[112:52] B: What's it like? Stuff that doesn't pertain to what you're asking me. I think like something like that. It's like I feel like.
[113:10] A: What'S coming to mind that you now have been thinking you shouldn't say.
[113:17] B: Like when I told you about my first memory and then there was other things I was going to tell you about and I have. Like that. Like I was.
[113:28] A: I'm not. So let me. Let me ask. Let's just check.
[113:32] B: Yeah.
[113:33] A: Are those like trauma experiences? No, they're you connecting to something beyond you. Bigger than you. Don't you think? What's the. So if I'm checking. Because that's what I want to understand. Chantel. The part that you shouldn't say to me for that's creating some fear. Does that part have to do with kind of like you knew that you chose your mom, that kind of stuff? Or is it something else? No, it's that kind of stuff. Yeah.
[114:14] B: Yeah. I don't want to cry.
[114:17] A: What would make you cry? Cry sadness or cry relief like, fearful cry, I guess. What's the fear right now? Yeah. Check. Right. And what's happening now? Get over here. First of all. Right. It's all the same mechanism.
[114:56] B: Okay.
[114:58] A: How I know how to work with somebody is to know what's going on over there. My wife says I should be a better mind reader than I am. Okay. So let me know what's going on over there.
[115:11] B: That I felt like I was crazy for a really long time, and I don't think I was. And I would try to dispute it and make it like I would. I would be like, when things would occur, like, I would go up to people and tell them about their dead relatives that passed away, or I would go up to somebody and challenge them about something. Like all these crazy things I would do.
[115:39] A: Yeah. Ask three questions and kind of know more about them.
[115:43] B: Yeah.
[115:43] A: Yeah.
[115:46] B: I felt like I had gone. Gone insane. Like.
[115:48] A: Yeah.
[115:49] B: I was 30. I lost a whole year almost. It felt like I was 31. And then all of a sudden, there was this huge shift in my life. And then when I went back one day, like a Rolodex, I realized that there was all these divine interventions that I could not explain away.
[116:07] A: And isn't that cool?
[116:09] B: Yeah. But it's also dangerous, I think, too.
[116:13] A: What's dangerous about that?
[116:14] B: Because every. Like, I feel like in history, anybody that is like, that is killed. The world doesn't like different. And I view the world in a different lens. And I believe.
[116:28] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[116:30] B: I guess. Yeah. But when I tell stuff like that.
[116:34] A: No, watch. It's about having. So it's not about not sharing stuff.
[116:39] B: Okay.
[116:40] A: Right. It's about having a better filter as to when and with whom I share stuff with. Because sometimes certain people aren't ready.
[116:51] B: Yeah. That's what Tori told me. Not to do that.
[116:53] A: To hear certain things.
[116:55] B: Yeah.
[116:56] A: So not because they're not there for you to say, but it's about taking responsibility for the impact me sharing that would have on them. Do you follow me with that?
[117:08] B: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.
[117:10] A: So as I filter whether I'm gonna share something, like, let's say this guy 15 years ago, had a fling, cheated on his wife, hasn't done anything since, never told his wife.
[117:23] B: Okay.
[117:24] A: Right. And he's feeling guilty. Right. Thinking that that's in the way of him being closer to his wife because he's got this thing that he's hidden from her, kept a secret. Right. The pastor at church gives the message, don't have any secrets between each other. Right. So now he's feeling all of this and he decides to tell her, which now she's thrown up on, which has her question all sorts of other stuff. Because if you could keep me that from me for that long, then what else are you.
[117:57] B: Mm.
[117:59] A: Is it useful for him to say that information, does it do anything beneficial for her? Is she better off knowing that? Right. We could say yes. We could say no. But if he's never done anything like that and has no intention of ever do, is she better off knowing that, that information. Does that help? No. Right. So I say that because you can be. And there's so many different ways to say it. I can have a channel. I'm connected. I'm clairvoyant. I'm. You know, I don't think that's the case.
[118:36] B: I think it's something way beyond my understanding, probably. But I can tell you things about the past, and I didn't read it.
[118:42] A: Right. So. So this is the thing that we're knowing you. So everybody got a continuum. Right. I have a bigger range of emotions than most people do because I'm a highly sensitive person. You have a broader range. Right. And there are other things that we don't know that we know are there, but we don't see or feel. For example, we can turn the radio on when you get back in the car. Then immediately music will start playing. But it wasn't that the turning on the radio made the radio waves there. They were there before you turned the radio on. You just tuned into them.
[119:29] B: Okay.
[119:30] A: Yeah, got it. The dog can walk by the person that we don't know has anything in their bag and no immediately what's in their bag. They are beyond. So senses tend to be limited in scope based on life experiences and other things that have happened. You have opened up and broadened scope so that it's out of the range of what other people experience. Got it. So it's just about having a useful filter as to with whom I share information. It's why you and I can have this conversation. And I've got going.
[120:18] B: Oh, my goodness.
[120:19] A: Right. Like, I'm not doing that at all. Because I don't question that that isn't true.
[120:24] B: It's exhausting. So when I open that door.
[120:28] A: Got it. That's the door that you are confused, concerned of going.
[120:31] B: I guess so. Yeah. Huh.
[120:32] A: Ah.
[120:33] B: Because, like, if I tap into that, it's a lot of other stuff comes with that.
[120:38] A: Well, so then where we want to head for you in what we do is to get it. So that you get the value and you leave the other stuff.
[120:49] B: Okay.
[120:50] A: You follow me with that?
[120:51] B: Yes.
[120:51] A: Because you said it's kind of like all comes up now.
[120:54] B: We want to fill.
[120:56] A: Filter it.
[120:56] B: Yeah.
[120:57] A: So think of yours has been its fire hose.
[121:00] B: Yeah.
[121:00] A: Right. So I either have to have it all the way off or coming up. Right. We want to again put a nozzle so that we can turn the water down.
[121:12] B: Okay.
[121:13] A: So that it could come out more like, you know, if I want to, you know, water my yard. Then we can have it turned down a little bit more if I wanted to. To get a sip from the hose.
[121:26] B: Yeah.
[121:26] A: Got it. This is where we're at. Yeah. Right. And as you check in here, what are you noticing now?
[121:43] B: That my brain is not as scared and I don't think I'm in trouble anymore. Right. Sorry.
[121:55] A: Right.
[121:56] B: That's when I get nervous.
[121:57] A: We just want to be setting it up that it's more about with whom.
[122:01] B: Yeah.
[122:02] A: I share certain things with Tori's somebody you can share stuff with.
[122:06] B: Yeah. But now not there.
[122:08] A: What's that?
[122:08] B: She said not there.
[122:11] A: Yeah. So there are different things that are appropriate based on situation.
[122:16] B: But that doesn't make me bad. I don't think. Right. Or maybe I'm just nuts.
[122:20] A: It has nothing to do with either of that. It has everything to do with. Because of the life experience. I'll give you a different example. I have a friend that's from the Amazon, grew up in the Amazon. He can tell you without looking everything that's behind him. Because in the Amazon it was really, really important to develop the muscle. The sensory acuity of knowing what's behind me. Got it. You've developed. Yes. That you're tapped into. And you'll be able to tap into it more intentionally and on purpose. Because we're clearing up lots of other stuff. So the other stuff getting cleared takes away the fuzziness of in the connection that enables all to come out at once.
[123:08] B: Okay.
[123:09] A: Right. What we're doing is we're clearing stuff up so that we add the ability to turn it down.
[123:17] B: Cool. So I knew. I know I'm not the only one that has different things like that.
[123:23] A: No, I know lots of people.
[123:24] B: Yeah. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cuz I really thought I was going nuts.
[123:28] A: That's not the to do with that.
[123:30] B: That was crazy. I just. I don't know. I couldn't think about the.
[123:36] A: Just like sometimes you have the ability to go out of your body. Right. Not everybody develops that skill. But it doesn't mean that it's not possible. I can't do a cartwheel wheel. My daughter can.
[123:58] B: Yes.
[123:59] A: Right. I can't do have different things and different abilities. Some are hidden abilities that they didn't know they had. Got it?
[124:11] B: Yes. And when you realize it, it becomes a lot. You know, like. But then I had to look back at my life and see that obviously that had always been there because I couldn't have endured it. Or maybe that's how I rationalize things to myself. I really don't know.
[124:26] A: But so as we check in with today. Right. Just think about the stuff we talked about.
[124:31] B: Okay.
[124:32] A: Stuff that happened with mom.
[124:33] B: Yeah.
[124:33] A: Grandmom.
[124:34] B: Okay.
[124:34] A: That adopted family.
[124:36] B: Okay.
[124:36] A: Stuff that happened at 18. Stuff that happened. Right.
[124:39] B: Yeah.
[124:40] A: As you think about the moments now, what do you notice?
[124:44] B: I can't see it, but I could see light.
[124:46] A: Like does it seem like it means anything about you?
[124:51] B: No.
[124:52] A: Like mom having you signing away rights. Does that have anything to do with your lovability?
[124:58] B: No.
[124:59] A: Right. Notice how that's different. Notice how this is different than it's ever been. Right. And it can't go back the other way because when you're brain realizes that stuff was data and sees it clearly, it can't get confused again. Santa Claus will always be make believe. Once you know that he is no matter how much you want to believe in him. Got it. That's the change that's happened. And then we can get together again.
[125:28] B: Alright, Cool.
[125:29] A: You did great today.
[125:30] B: Did I?
[125:30] A: Yeah. Don't you think?
[125:32] B: Yeah.
[125:32] A: I mean check. How's your body feeling?
[125:34] B: Good. I felt like I was a Jedi in my mind.
[125:36] A: You are a Jedi.
[125:37] B: When you were talking to me.
[125:38] A: Yes.
[125:39] B: Like, because I seen this like weird looking.
[125:41] A: Totally right.
[125:42] B: Like yeah. Poo poo in my lips.
[125:43] A: And then you've got another thing along with the Buddha and the rainbow of the Sho have the lowering the jaw and the resting the tongue and the getting up above. You can utilize all of that. That will work much better. All of it continues to reinforce what we're doing for you.
[126:00] B: Okay. So like when I'm doing my Buddha.
[126:03] A: Put like lower your your jaw, rest your tongue, breathe a little bit slower. You're gonna notice things in a multitude of different ways. Some of it's going to be in the moment. Situations that normally would trigger you won't be.
[126:15] B: Okay.
[126:16] A: Sometimes a trigger will happen but it just won't get that high and it'll go right away.
[126:20] B: Okay.
[126:20] A: Right. Sometimes it'll be after the fact going hey, normally I would have been all jacked up and I'm not Cool.
[126:26] B: Okay.
[126:27] A: You're gonna notice that that's gonna be a lot different because I'm not gonna be so personally affected and ready to fight. Take an offense to everything somebody says or. Look.
[126:38] B: That's the key.
[126:39] A: Got it.
[126:39] B: When I scan the room.
[126:40] A: Don't scan the room. No, it's not. Don't scan the room. You're gonna be looking at their. Look is meaning stuff about them, not me. That's the change. You're going to be reading it more clearly. It's their. There's something going on over there with them. Has something to do with me.
[126:56] B: Okay.
[126:57] A: Right. Not me. My identity. They might be upset over something I said.
[127:01] B: Okay.
[127:02] A: But now I'm learning about that. And as I learn about it, I could be understanding and apologetic, if that would be what's best. Or I could be. Yeah, that's exactly what I said. Or I could just let it go by. Yeah, Right. So this is what you're gonna start noticing with what we've done so far.
[127:16] B: Cool.
[127:17] A: Yeah.
[127:17] B: Yeah. Okay.
[127:18] A: Yeah. And then we can get back together again. Yeah.
[127:20] B: Okay. Deal.
[127:21] A: All right. Come with me. We will have.
[127:23] B: Let me chug this before.
