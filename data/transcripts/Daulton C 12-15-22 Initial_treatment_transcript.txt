[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 15th of December. Dalton, Amanda. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. Given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, that recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals and how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Okay, cool. So one thing that we talked about up front is a. We want to really have a clear understanding as to how come it's continued to affect us and then how we're going to get it better. Second part to that is the purpose of clearing up any past stuff is because we recognize at a different level that it's been negatively affecting now.
[00:45] B: Right.
[00:46] A: So we want to be thinking then if we could change problematic ways that your brain has been working that makes you feel bad now. Like, what do we want to get better? Like, how do we want you to be when we're done so that we get a clear target and outcome, like the end state. How do we want you to be? Right. Like, first, check it out. If that stuff that you went through that was no longer caused any of the. Like, how would you actually be?
[01:22] C: I don't know. I wouldn't have anything holding me back, that's for sure. You know, I'd probably be exactly where I wanted to be.
[01:30] A: And if nothing's holding you back, like, how would you actually be?
[01:35] C: I'd be amazing.
[01:37] A: You'd be amazing. What's it like when you feel amazing?
[01:40] C: When I feel amazing, I feel accomplished. I feel like nothing can stop me.
[01:45] A: Yeah. So you feel accomplished and, like, unstoppable?
[01:50] C: Yeah.
[01:51] B: Confident. Right, Right.
[01:54] A: And how do you know when you're feeling confident?
[01:58] C: When I'm happy. You know, when. That's usually the time where I'm happiest is when I'm confident that whatever I'm doing, whether I get it right or wrong, I'm okay with the outcome.
[02:11] B: Yeah.
[02:12] A: Cool. So what we want plugged in at all times is your inner knowing that I have what I need to deal with whatever is going to come my way, and I'm able to move through it in the ways that are best for me based on situation and circumstance. I'm adaptable.
[02:32] C: Yes.
[02:34] A: Cool.
[02:34] B: Right.
[02:35] A: Free from the impact that that stuff has had. A little bit lighter.
[02:40] B: Right.
[02:41] A: Grown up. Right. Like, fully inside so that you get it, that you're on the same level.
[02:48] B: Right.
[02:50] A: Maybe even a head above, because you know more and you can see more.
[02:53] B: Right?
[02:54] C: Yeah.
[02:54] A: Got it. Like, this is where we're headed. Make sense?
[02:59] B: Yeah.
[02:59] A: And the question Isn't how it's gonna happen that we get you here. The question is, would it be okay?
[03:06] B: Right.
[03:07] A: Any downside to you being free from the, you know, hurt, pain, anger, sorrow, grief, resentment, rage, sadness, hurts of crap that's happened.
[03:17] C: Downside?
[03:18] A: Yeah. Like anything about you not being bothered by it anymore that isn't okay with you.
[03:24] C: I guess maybe it's just that I don't want to forget, you know, the pain, you know, the suffering where I've come from.
[03:35] A: Right. Why would you ever want to forget that? Why would you ever want to be living it, though? Yeah, Right. We want you to have the knowledge of where you came from and what you've gone through that reinforces you at a deep grounded level.
[03:54] B: Right.
[03:54] A: We don't forget it, we don't erase it. We still have the data. We just want all of you to know that you're fully on the other side of it. Right? Because you know. But there's a part of you that doesn't fully know. You follow me? Like, that's where the error is with this stuff is that there's just an aspect of your brain that doesn't know what you know. That's the disconnect.
[04:21] B: Right.
[04:21] A: We're going to explain how come the disconnect happens, but that's really the disconnect we want to get that good news in.
[04:29] B: Right.
[04:30] A: So as you get it that we're not actually erasing it and we get to have all of the resourcefulness, strength, courage, bravery move through what I went through. We get all that stays. It doesn't go anywhere.
[04:45] B: Yeah, right.
[04:47] A: So that I have it as I move through other stuff. Makes sense. Yeah, right? The other part where people come up with conflict, because you did one area, but the other part where people come up with conflict is if I'm no longer hurting over what happened to me, does that then mean what happened to me was okay? Because if it does, that's not okay. Makes sense, right? Where people get conflicted is they think that by my being okay, it somehow excuses what happened, means that what happened was okay. But is that really true?
[05:25] B: Right?
[05:25] A: If I'm okay now, does that in any way, shape or form mean what I went through was okay? Or do I get to be okay even though that wasn't right? When my dad punched me so hard that it busted my nose, I've got a lovely bum. Blood was all over me. You could wring out the shirt. Me not being bothered by that anymore, not hurting, not shameful, not angry, not resentful. Does that in Any way, shape or form mean, what he did to me then was okay. Got it. So I get to be okay. Even if that wasn't make sense, that's what we want to get shifted so that you're becoming much more okay in you.
[06:05] B: Right.
[06:06] A: And as this is starting to make sense, what do you notice happening to, you know, the chest and the knob and the stomach? Oh, they're not there.
[06:16] B: Right.
[06:16] A: Because you're here.
[06:17] B: Hi.
[06:18] A: This is way more fun. Right? And that's all there is for you to do in the whole process. Because it's my job to do all the work to get you better. Your job is to simply have the intention of being with me. And the reason that you want to do that is this is what's happening and the bad stuff isn't. Two, we're working on the mutual goal that we want for you, right. We're intending collaborating on it together. Three, this is more joy, right? How we clear something really, really simple requires that one thing intend to be here. Go through just the facts about what happened. Matter of fact, in a minute or less, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened. Then it was over. Three, connect it to things that you've done later in life that were more enjoyable than that. And there's lots of different things that.
[07:09] B: You can go to.
[07:10] A: Joyful things that you've done recently, right? Like getting the job, working at Lowe's, helping somebody find something. Right. Those things are like even little small things, but way better than that. Because the error is the ending was at the wrong time. The problem with the problem is that it doesn't end well, but it's because it froze the ending at the worst spot of didn't connect that ending to later. It's separated from nervous system, not on board with anything. That's the error. Does that make sense? So we want to get that thing to be shifted so that the timing is updated. All of the bad feelings that you have about the stuff that happens has happened. That's over, that's finished. It's only there because part of your brain doesn't know that it's over and finished. It's literally causing the emotions, the sensations you feel that then your mind makes the meaning, oh, it's the stuff. But it's not because of the stuff. It's actually trying to motivate you to get the stuff to stop. What that part of the brain doesn't know is that it already stopped. That's the really screwed up part, right? And it's because the Part of our brain that's trying to get us to do something works like an animal. Animals don't have emotions because of mood or affect. It's to cause action, get something to happen, do something, get something to stop. That's what's going on. So a lot of times, because in my brain, logical part, I can forecast future and I can remember past, right? So if my brain froze moment in past and now something that I'm currently experiencing reminds me of past, I'm back there because of past. I can forecast awful scenarios that would be like past make sense. So the emotional brain just doesn't know that the experience no longer exists, that it's data about something that happened versus happening. It reads that way when it's positive or neutral experiences.
[09:41] B: Right.
[09:41] A: Somebody tells us about going to Disney and how they went down Splash Mountain, Space Mountain. They had a great time, they tell us about it. But we know when they're telling us about it that they know the difference between being there.
[09:53] C: Yeah.
[09:54] A: And talking to us about being there. Like, that's clear but negative moment, it's as if I'm there, Right? Only because the brain doesn't know the moment is over. It's confusing. The thought about it, thinking it is it. That's what we want to get unplugged. So it's read as data that it's read as information. When it's read as information, the feelings go away because the brain gets. Oh, well, you know, oh, no. Well, then never mind. It's never been causing the emotions later because it wanted you to feel bad about it. It's been causing it trying to motivate you to get it to stop. And it just doesn't know that it has. Yeah, and that's the confusing part because my logical brain will go, well, why the fuck would it be doing that? That's stupid. Yes, but that part of the brain isn't logical. It works like the mind of a goat. And if a goat thinks there's a mountain lion close by, I don't care what you tell the goat now, goat, it's fine, we're good. Everything's great. We're fine with mountain lion. Yeah, fuck you, man. If there I'm looking for mountain lion, you follow me. Like, that's the problem with this thing. So the interaction between the two parts of the brain there have a malfunction when it comes to emotionally charged moments. That's why emotionally charged moments, I'm high emotion, low intelligence, because I'm taken back to about the age of a goat.
[11:19] B: Brain, right?
[11:22] A: And then what I got installed in me at that age is the good things happen because I am good. Because I am good. Good things happen to me and walk around people going, look, I am blessed because I am so good. Like God found me the parking spot right in front of Target. I didn't have to walk far. Blessed, right? You know, blessed, right? I'm blessed. Just blessed the person walking around, right? But that's the thing that we got. We got this whole meaning gets attached to negative experience. Good happens because I'm good. I got reinforced on. Dude I didn't even know woke up one morning, shit wasn't there the night before. Now it's there. Like presents for me. Get my name on them. Frick, man. Cuz I'm good, right? The threat that keeps going on, if you're bad, Santa will know. I'll put coal in your stock, right? So therefore the bad stuff is related 100% to me. Identity and behavior. Then we grow up and we lose the notion that Santa's real. But we don't lose the notion that bad things can happen without me doing anything wrong. I know it logically, but because I learned it at that emotional level that part of the brain doesn't know. So any negative thing piles on the meaning that it must have something to do with me. And a lot of times me, my identity, me, my self worth, me, my lovability me, my smarts meet, my confidence me, my like has something to do with me, right? Crazy thing. I was working with a gal who was up in Michigan. She was in a truckling situation. She didn't know it was. She thought we were like family and we just do stuff as a family. It's family stuff. And then when she finally realized that that was psychological manipulation and coercion, she left. Which is great. But she was so fucking pissed at the earlier self who even got involved with the gu. Right? Like I should have known better.
[13:27] B: Yeah.
[13:28] A: So it had to do with my stupidity and how come I didn't leave sooner and. Yeah, well you didn't leave sooner because you didn't know that you were being bamboozled until you did.
[13:40] C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[13:43] A: You had fucked up childhood and lack of family. You kept looking outside of it, but it was never there. And even this one got presented like it was gonna give you it, but it really wasn't it. It was all transactionally based. Cause then you had to go and allow people to use your body for their pleasure.
[13:59] B: Great.
[14:00] A: Awesome. That's fun. That's exactly what a gal Wants to do all the time. Go ahead, do whatever you need to do with my body. Yup, Turn me around. Okay. No, I'm great.
[14:08] B: This is wonderful.
[14:09] A: But that's like, that's the worst scenario, right? So when she finally got it, she laughed, but she was so mad. But the thing that flipped for her is as we were unraveling stuff, she was realizing that other people's crap isn't about me. And yeah, I was romanticizing and fantasizing about that situation with him, thinking, well, at least he never laid a hand on me. Yeah, great. So whether a guy's good is whether he lays a hand on you or he traffics you. But those are the only two options that we have left for men. Like, what the hell? This is crazy. We gotta get that out of the way.
[14:43] B: Right?
[14:43] A: We gotta get it. And what started to shift her is all of a sudden she started to feel, wait a minute, that stuff isn't about me. That, huh, What I know begins to integrate so that I feel it differently.
[15:00] B: Right.
[15:01] A: That's the kind of stuff that we want to get shifted, make sense. Because once that stuff shifts and my brain gets that stuff, stuff's finished, it's settled down, it's rewired. So now when I'm in the environment that I'm in currently, where all of the reminders and triggers and stuff is there, those same things are there, but they don't do that in me anymore. Like, I don't find myself having the reactivity and having to manage it. It's just not running that stuff stuff in.
[15:35] B: It makes sense.
[15:36] C: Yes, absolutely.
[15:37] A: So this is where we're headed. Any questions about that?
[15:40] C: No.
[15:40] A: Okay.
[15:41] C: I'm just ready to start.
[15:42] A: Cool. Well, right. And you just think that we haven't started already? Well, no. So great. I love it. You're like, I'm just ready to start.
[15:49] B: Yeah.
[15:49] A: Because everything that I've been saying up till now doesn't count. Isn't part of the process so good, right? Yeah. So now we want to get your body into the right spot states for healing. Right. So how we get body into the right states is we use brain levers that begin to put the body to rest. Resting allows accelerated healing. That's where we use the slightly lowering the jaw. Because when you do that, it stimulates vagal nerve, puts body into parasympathetic. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth so your jaw is lowered and your rest is your tongue. You breathe now in a way that's a little bit slower on the inhale so it goes in a little bit deeper. Just like that. And how as you exhale, your exhale becomes a little bit longer. And as you're doing this right now, check inside.
[16:49] B: How's your body feeling?
[16:56] A: Like more tense or more calm? More calm it is.
[17:01] B: Right.
[17:02] A: Then we do the thing which you can do with eyes opened or closed, which is to open your awareness.
[17:09] B: Right.
[17:10] A: That with your eyes closed, you sense more of the space around you because you no longer see objects, yet you're aware of space.
[17:19] B: Face.
[17:21] A: That's right. And then you can open your eyes and you can look out and you can see what you see. And then you can close your eyes and you'll notice that as you look out, you see the backs of your eyelids. That's right. What you can see is the backs of your eyelids. And as I look at the back of my eyelids, there's like, some darker hues and some lighter hues. And then you can open your eyes. And as your eyes are open, you see what you see. You can see it wide. And then you can close your eyes and notice that with your eyes closed, you see the backs of your eyelids. And so the interesting question becomes, without using your imagination or your memory.
[18:19] B: Right.
[18:20] A: Without using your imagination or your memory, what do you see behind you? That's right. Nothing.
[18:30] B: That's right.
[18:31] A: Nothing's there. And now, what happens if you drift back into the nothingness, that nothing's there, while at the same time your body's resting and you're becoming more okay in.
[18:46] B: You are beginning to lighten up, maybe.
[18:51] A: Even realizing that you're much more than your body, that your body isn't even you, it's yours. That's right. And then drifting out of nothingness to back here. Take a deep breath in. And eyes are open.
[19:20] C: Good.
[19:20] A: How's your body feeling now?
[19:23] C: Very centered.
[19:24] A: It is very centered. Isn't that cool?
[19:27] B: Right.
[19:28] A: Because your mind is responsive to you and interested in working in ways that are best.
[19:36] B: Right? Right.
[19:38] A: So now just think of a time when you were outside in nature. You see something beautiful. What is it that you see?
[19:47] C: When I was young, I used to go to this rock, and it was kind of like outcropping clothes. And I used to sit there for hours.
[19:57] B: Yeah.
[20:00] A: And there's moments that as you're sitting there, you're feeling just a sense of peace. It was where I would escape and wonder. And some people would tell you, yeah, of course, being there gives you the feelings. But let's look at it differently. Let's just say that being There drew your awareness down, down inside, towards your center. Because at your center, you always are peaceful with wonder. Kind of like if I've got the campfire, my hands are cold, and I bring them to the flames and I say, holy cow, this fire is getting hotter. Is it really getting hotter? I'm becoming more aware of the heat, right? So we know that there have been many times in your life where awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Upsets, anger, shames, guilt, pains, sadnesses, hurts. But see, no matter where awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited. And just like, you know, three of us are in here because you can look around. That information tends to be knowledge. People call knowledge light. Light of knowledge, center is brighter, light of wisdom. So knowledge and wisdom and Right. I work with all sorts of people about all sorts of awful stuff happened to them. I remember this one girl, her older brother used to take GI Joe figures and park them in her. So there was a lot of. Around all of that. We worked together. It's gone. All the shame, the pain there, it's gone. But I asked her the question. I go, where was that stuff? She says, it's gone.
[21:33] B: I don't feel it.
[21:34] A: I said, I know. I go, but where was it? And I go, was it surface level? She's like, no, it wasn't in the light. I go, oh, was it at your center? She's like, really? How could that survive in the light where I'm peace and excited wonder. So where was it? She goes, oh, it's the distortion that was in between the lights. I said, what happened? She goes, the lights, they're touching. The shadows are gone, right? So we walk around often thinking that I am my body. But what if you're not it? What if you have one? What if it's yours? What if there's no cells now that are the same when you were born? What if every single cell gets replaced billions of times? So you have a body, is totally yours, it isn't you. When my mom lost the tip of her finger in a snow cone machine accident, she still visits people and they don't say to her, I'm glad almost all of you came today. She's all there. Even if that part's missing. You have a body, it's yours, right? You also have a brain and it's yours, but it's not you. You're not the thinker of the thoughts you're having. Your brain is, which is a weird thing to think, but it's true. You have feelings but you're not a feeling. And there are things you do, but you're certainly not what you do. Because when you stop doing one thing to do a different thing, you didn't stop existing. So the weirdest question is, if you're not what you do, or your thoughts or your feelings or your body, then what are you?
[23:08] B: Right?
[23:08] A: Let's just say that who you are is what you became aware of as you're sitting on that rock cliff, looking.
[23:13] B: Out, experiencing that peace and wonder that.
[23:17] A: The who you are is the light at the center. People call it my soul, my spirit. But instead of it being something you have, let's think of it as you. Just like you have 10 fingers and 10 toes, a nose, two elbows. You're not your nose, your elbows, your fingers or your toes, they're yours, not you. Just like you have an ass, you're not your ass, you have one, it's yours. It's not you. You have a body. It's totally yours. It's not you. So I said all this stuff to that gal, and then I told her about this crazy experience at the dentist where he put me on a chair and my head goes down, shines a light in my eyes, shoves this thing. She's like, oh, my goodness. And you're what? I know my mouth. I'm at the dentist, right? But it's the same thing that I said to her, you know, with the brother, like when he messed with your stuff, the GI Joe. She goes, he did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and hurt my feelings. And then she looked at me, she goes, you know what, though? He never touched me. He messed with my body. There's not a single. He never touched me. He never got me. I said, whoa, that's cool. What a cool way of thinking about things. So one more time, slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue. Breathe a little bit slower and deeper. Allow awareness to expand and maybe drift.
[24:38] B: Down deep inside, down towards your center. Delight, that is you, where there's just.
[24:48] A: A calm and peaceful, peaceful and easy flowing energy. Because everything that needs to happen has already begun happening on its own. Your unconscious, wonderfully responsive, has already begun to scan and sort experiences that you've gone through, ones from long, long time.
[25:09] C: Ago.
[25:13] B: To recent.
[25:16] A: To experiences that it knows created, faulty programming that impact how you function now. So that as we bring those moments into the light and unplug the impact.
[25:30] B: They'Ve had, all the energy is repurposed, recycled for restorative healing, beginning to lighten up, connecting to more of who you really are. That's right.
[25:55] A: And of course the next time it'll be even easier to just. All the way. That's right. You can slowly find your way back.
[26:06] B: Up and up and up.
[26:08] A: That's right. Take a deep breath in and then exhale in.
[26:13] B: Open your eyes.
[26:15] A: Good job again. What are you noticing now?
[26:20] C: Now I'm just clear headed.
[26:23] A: You are?
[26:25] C: I'm able to think. I'm more aware of everything around me.
[26:31] B: Yeah.
[26:31] A: Oh, your presence.
[26:33] C: Yeah.
[26:34] B: You're clear headed.
[26:35] A: You're more able to think. You're more aware of what's all around you. You're outwardly focused.
[26:44] B: Hi.
[26:45] A: It's nice to be here. Isn't it better to be than in there? Yes, that's right. I know we're on our way to more and more of that.
[26:56] C: Yeah.
[26:57] B: Right.
[26:58] A: So now all we want to do is we want to have that unconscious part of your brain travel back down the timeline in your own personal history of things that were negative. Stuff that happened that left an imprint, that even when you think about it now or you try not to think about it, it still has that attached to it. Whether it be stuff that happened to you or stuff that you did. We're gonna have that part of your brain travel back, begin to categorize and rule. And now what it's gonna do is pinpoint and bring a particular moment to your awareness for us to clear.
[27:31] B: Right.
[27:32] A: The experience that just came to mind happened about how long ago you might have been home.
[27:39] C: It was probably seven.
[27:41] B: Yeah. Good.
[27:42] A: And the feelings as you think about it are feelings of what.
[27:47] B: Is it?
[27:47] A: Hurt, Anger, Sadness. Grief. Resentment. Guilt. Shame. Anger.
[27:51] C: It's hurt. It's a little betrayal.
[27:55] B: Oh, good.
[27:55] A: Well, the meaning. Betrayal.
[27:57] B: Right.
[27:57] A: But hurt.
[27:58] B: Yeah.
[27:59] A: Pain.
[28:00] B: Good.
[28:01] A: So would it be okay to get that gone?
[28:02] C: Yeah.
[28:03] B: Yeah.
[28:03] A: And if it's gone, does that mean what happened was okay? No.
[28:08] B: Right.
[28:08] A: So really simple. You're going to tell me the what happened while being here.
[28:12] C: Yeah.
[28:12] B: Right.
[28:12] A: Just the what happened facts. But we also want to add what's three things you've done after that that were more enjoyable than that? Right. What's one thing?
[28:23] C: One thing?
[28:24] B: Yeah.
[28:26] C: Anything. Snowboarding?
[28:28] A: Yeah, going snowboarding. Way more fun than that.
[28:29] B: Good.
[28:30] A: Something else.
[28:32] C: Walking through the woods.
[28:33] A: Yeah, walking through the woods. One other thing.
[28:37] C: Being with my dog.
[28:38] A: Yeah, being with your dog.
[28:39] B: Right.
[28:39] A: So we got being with a dog, we got walking through the woods. Right. We got going snowboarding. All those moments happen after that. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond It. So we have good news to get in.
[28:52] B: Right.
[28:52] A: So when that particular moment happened, and you were seven when it happened, you were where? So you're in Montana. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime? Nighttime. In your where? Like in a house. In an apartment.
[29:04] C: In our house.
[29:05] A: So you're in the house, Right. Good. Upstairs, Downstairs?
[29:08] C: Downstairs.
[29:08] A: Like in the living room, dining room, bedroom, kitchen, mom's room.
[29:11] B: Right.
[29:12] A: Good. And like, you're on the bed or standing.
[29:14] C: Standing.
[29:14] A: Standing. Right. Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[29:17] C: My mom had a knife to her throat.
[29:19] A: So mom had a knife to her throat. Right. And that was really fucking scary.
[29:21] C: Yeah.
[29:22] A: Right. But then what happened next?
[29:24] C: I just talked to her.
[29:25] A: So you were talking to her, right? Said, mom, take the knife away from your throat or something to that extent at some point.
[29:30] B: Right.
[29:30] A: And then what happened next?
[29:31] C: Then she gave me the knife.
[29:33] A: Then she gave me the knife. Which was better than when she had it up against her neck. Right.
[29:36] B: Good.
[29:36] A: And then what happened next?
[29:37] C: Then we held each other.
[29:39] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next? Well, then that moment was over. Right. And then later on, you went snowboarding, right? Walking in the woods, being out with your dog.
[29:50] B: Right.
[29:50] A: And again, as we went through it, you noticed there was some discomfort less because you were intending to be here, right? Now, here's the craziest part, right? You never go backwards with a memory, ever. We always go forward. But when you go backwards, it literally unplugs. It takes away the charge. So watch what happens. We go backwards, right? So we got, you know, hanging out with the dog, we got walking in the woods, we got going snowboarding, right? And then the next day started, right? And then you guys went off to bed, and then you had held her, right? And then she had given you the knife. And then you were talking to her, and then you saw her with the knife, and then you'd gone in her bedroom. And then before that, you're off doing whatever you're doing.
[30:25] B: Right.
[30:26] A: And as I went backwards compared to forward, what do you notice.
[30:31] C: It was.
[30:32] A: Isn't that weird?
[30:33] C: It was the same, but it was different.
[30:34] A: Really. Wasn't was the same information. What was different?
[30:39] C: Feeling.
[30:42] A: That's right.
[30:45] B: Right.
[30:46] A: The feeling went away.
[30:47] B: Right.
[30:48] A: Because you can remember that happening.
[30:50] B: Right.
[30:50] A: But you can also remember putting your shirt on earlier today slightly.
[30:55] B: Right?
[30:56] A: You can remember putting your hat on. You can remember taking it off.
[30:59] B: Right.
[31:00] A: That was earlier. But if I said to you, well, stop taking your hat off. I'm not taking my hat off. Yeah, right. Because, you know, there's the difference between the Memory of you doing it and you doing it. So where trauma gets stuck is the memory of what happened is confused, as if it's the experience of it happening.
[31:19] C: Yes.
[31:21] A: So we want to get that on something that you already know you're not doing, like taking your hat off. So if I said to you, dalton, stop taking your hat off, say, I'm not taking off my hat. Well then stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you're not putting on your shirt. Well then stop mom from having the knife to her throat. Say mom doesn't have the knife to her throat. Well, then stop her from doing that. Say she's not doing that. Well, stop it from happening though. It's not happening. So then where does it. Say it doesn't exist. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. And again, as that gets in, what do you notice?
[31:51] C: Not worried about it.
[31:52] A: Right. And then close your eyes and think back to the you and let him know that that's over, that you made it through it, that you're okay.
[32:02] B: Right? Right.
[32:05] A: You can open your eyes. What's happening to that younger you?
[32:11] C: Is he green?
[32:12] A: Yeah, he is, isn't he?
[32:14] B: Right, right.
[32:16] A: Cause he's okay.
[32:17] C: Yeah.
[32:17] B: Yeah.
[32:19] A: How about mom?
[32:21] C: She's okay.
[32:22] A: Oh, she's around.
[32:23] C: No, but she's okay.
[32:25] B: She's okay now.
[32:27] A: Mom wasn't well then.
[32:31] B: Right.
[32:31] A: Cause as an adult, like looking at it as an outsider, that's every, you know, parent's dream is to have their child walk in as they're attempting.
[32:42] C: Isn't it though? Yeah.
[32:46] A: Right. Top. Top five experiences on the board.
[32:48] C: Yeah. Yeah.
[32:52] A: Right?
[32:54] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[32:57] A: What are you noticing now? That was a good breath, by the way.
[33:03] C: I'm starting to realize that I guess what I. How I perceive things isn't what they are anymore.
[33:16] A: Well, now just check one other thing you want to add to the younger you, because back then that younger you thought some of that happening had something to do with you. Meaning if you were more lovable or mom had more. She wouldn't be that way. Got it. So as we look at it, mom being that way, did that have anything to do with your lovability as a 7 year old? Had nothing to do with your lovability.
[33:45] B: Right.
[33:45] A: Or did it have anything to do with her lack of love for you? Not at all. Neither of those two things. So back then, seven year old, you thought it had to do with you and. Or her lack of love for you. Yeah, got it. As we look at it, clearly had nothing to do with either of those two things.
[34:02] B: Right. Right.
[34:03] A: By the way, let him also know.
[34:06] B: That he didn't need her to be.
[34:09] A: Any other way in order for you to turn out okay. Got it. Okay doesn't mean great all the time.
[34:21] C: Yeah, of course.
[34:23] A: Got it. Okay. On the way to better. But then I'm okay. Got it. So one more time. Close your eyes. Think back to that younger you. Let them know of course it's over. No longer exists. Realizing that that happening had nothing to do with you. Your lovability or her lack of love had everything to do with that part. Being off in mom wasn't well in that way that you didn't need mom to be well in order for you to turn out okay. Now on the way to even better.
[35:02] B: Right.
[35:05] A: As the younger you is getting it again, check inside. What do you know is happening now?
[35:13] C: It's like you already knew.
[35:17] B: Right? Right.
[35:19] A: What do you notice happening to the feeling?
[35:23] C: They're not bad.
[35:24] B: Yeah.
[35:25] C: You know, the feeling's there, but it's more relief.
[35:31] B: Right.
[35:32] A: The information's there.
[35:33] C: Yeah.
[35:34] A: I'm not feeling troubled.
[35:36] C: Yeah.
[35:37] B: Right. Isn't that cool?
[35:40] A: Notice how that's very different than it's ever been.
[35:45] C: Yeah.
[35:46] B: Right. Right.
[35:51] A: Because we're re organizing how your brain had that information coded. It froze it.
[35:59] C: Yeah.
[35:59] A: At the worst spot I moved on. Other multitudes of stuff happened, but that part froze that moment. It started creating a will call it filter. An already always way of listening that started to reinforce how unlovable I really am. Because that was one moment of it. There were multitudes of other moments of it. Whether it be with mom or dad being absent or the awful guys that mom found herself breaking into the house. Right. Like it continued to reinforce how unlovable I am. Make sense? So that was the filter. So now we're taking this one and we're beginning to get a hold of it so that it stops having the same running power over you.
[36:57] C: Yeah.
[36:58] A: And what'll happen is your brain is going to travel back because as we generalize out, it's much easier to do when we have more than one. Right. Harder to do with one. I say to you orange. Cool. Yeah.
[37:16] B: I don't know.
[37:17] A: Okay. What does that mean? Right. What am I thinking about? Fruit, color, Tropicana. Like what am I thinking about?
[37:24] B: Right.
[37:24] A: If I say orange, apple, banana. If I say red, blue, green, brown. Oh, that's fruit, that's color.
[37:32] C: Yeah.
[37:33] B: Right.
[37:33] A: I don't have to list them all to have you pick it up.
[37:37] B: Right.
[37:38] A: So again your brain is going to travel back down that timeline to Another moment that would be useful to clear.
[37:46] C: Yeah.
[37:46] B: Yeah.
[37:47] A: What comes to mind now.
[37:52] C: Probably when I got. My mom got the phone call that our.
[37:56] A: That time.
[37:57] B: You're how old?
[37:58] A: And what happened?
[37:59] C: I was seven again.
[38:03] A: So you're seven.
[38:03] B: Right.
[38:03] A: And you're in that house again.
[38:06] C: Different house.
[38:07] A: Different house. Right. Good job. Downstairs.
[38:11] C: We were downstairs.
[38:12] B: Yeah.
[38:13] C: We were in mom's room.
[38:14] B: Right.
[38:14] A: Mom's room again.
[38:15] B: Right.
[38:15] A: Where all the good stuff happens.
[38:17] C: Yeah.
[38:20] A: Isn't that fucking crazy? Think about that. With lots of people. Why does it always have to be in the same fucking room? That room is fucking awful. Terrible.
[38:29] C: Yeah.
[38:29] A: It shouldn't be a bad space, but, man, I don't want to go that room. Yeah.
[38:33] C: I was actually terrified of that room. We were on the computer.
[38:38] B: Yeah. Right.
[38:39] C: And we got a phone call from my uncle.
[38:42] B: Right.
[38:43] C: And they had told us that my first cousin.
[38:47] A: Yes.
[38:49] C: Burned to death.
[38:50] B: Right.
[38:50] A: Good job.
[38:51] B: Right.
[38:52] A: And that was like, fucking weird and scary.
[38:54] C: Yeah.
[38:55] B: Right. And then what happened?
[38:57] C: What happened after? Well, I had to. My mom collapsed.
[39:01] B: Right.
[39:01] A: So mom fell on the ground.
[39:03] C: I was trying to process what exactly.
[39:06] A: What the hell does that mean?
[39:07] C: I. I knew what it meant, but I didn't understand the. The severity of it.
[39:13] A: Yeah.
[39:14] B: Right.
[39:14] C: So I was confused.
[39:15] A: Right.
[39:16] B: Yeah.
[39:16] C: Also trying to console my mother.
[39:19] B: Right.
[39:20] A: Good. So you're consoling Mom. Right. And then what happened?
[39:24] C: And then we just sat there. Right.
[39:29] A: And then what happened next?
[39:31] C: The day started over, and then later.
[39:34] A: On, you did something more fun like go snowboarding or walk in the woods. Try to go hang out with the dog.
[39:38] C: Yeah.
[39:39] A: Again, notice how the discomfort. Again, not because it happened, because brain confuses, but as we go backwards, it unplugs.
[39:47] B: Right.
[39:47] A: So we got again, you know, being with the dog and walking in the woods. Going snowboarding.
[39:52] C: Yeah.
[39:52] B: Right.
[39:53] A: And then before that, under the next day, and then we just kind of sat there for a while.
[39:57] B: Right.
[39:57] A: And then mom kind of got up. And then I was consoling Mom.
[40:00] B: Right.
[40:00] A: And then mom had fallen on the ground. And then we heard what had happened, and then we got the phone call. Then before that, we were doing whatever we were doing.
[40:07] C: Yeah.
[40:08] B: On the computer or whatever. Right.
[40:10] A: And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[40:15] C: That's better.
[40:17] B: Right?
[40:17] A: You can remember it happening, right?
[40:19] C: Yeah.
[40:19] A: You can remember taking your hat off. Well, stop taking off your hat. I'm taking off your hat.
[40:24] B: Good.
[40:25] A: Don't stop me from putting on my sneakers.
[40:27] C: You're not putting on your sneakers.
[40:29] A: Good. Well, then stop her from falling on the ground.
[40:31] C: Stop falling on the ground.
[40:33] A: Right. So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists.
[40:35] C: It no longer exists.
[40:36] A: Right. And that you, in that moment, wasn't sure we were gonna be okay.
[40:41] C: Yeah.
[40:41] A: Because at seven he thought. Because at six and five and four and three, he needed mom more. So he thought that by seven he needed mom and needed mom to be okay in order for us to be okay.
[40:53] C: Yeah.
[40:54] B: Right.
[40:54] A: Did you need mom to be okay in order for you to turn out okay?
[40:59] C: No.
[41:00] B: Right.
[41:00] A: He didn't know that.
[41:02] C: Yes.
[41:03] A: Got it. So again, close your eyes. Picture that earlier you let the earlier you know that it's over, that it no longer exists. Let him know that he didn't need mom to be well in order for you to turn out okay. Let him know that even back then he had what he needed inside to deal with whatever might show up.
[41:23] B: Right.
[41:23] A: Let him know that how he dealt with it would be exactly how he wants somebody to deal with a situation like that.
[41:30] B: Right, Right.
[41:34] A: And again as that earlier you was getting it. What do you notice happening to his face?
[41:41] C: Smiling.
[41:42] A: Yeah. And you can open your eyes.
[41:44] B: Right.
[41:45] A: And again, check inside. What do you notice?
[41:51] C: Just below.
[41:53] B: Yeah. Right, Right.
[41:58] A: Isn't that cool?
[42:00] C: It is.
[42:01] B: Yeah.
[42:01] C: I feel like my shoulders aren't clenched, My jaw is not clenched.
[42:06] B: Yeah.
[42:08] C: I feel like I've been walking around like in a constant state of just like my whole body is tensed and now I'm finally starting to feel like loosened.
[42:23] A: Yeah.
[42:26] B: Right, Right.
[42:34] A: Things are changing.
[42:37] C: Yeah.
[42:37] B: Yeah.
[42:40] A: More present, more lucid. Seeing things more clearly.
[42:46] C: Yeah.
[42:47] B: Right.
[42:47] A: Becoming more aware. What we get pre programmed to do is think that we need it from outside of us in order for us to be okay in here. But we start from the factory is already okay. It's the shit that happens to us that make us feel like we're not okay. That we need it from out there.
[43:06] B: Right.
[43:07] A: We want you to be feeling more okay in you.
[43:12] B: Right.
[43:13] A: That's what I was saying to that girl. I said you wouldn't want to feel good that you left. You wouldn't want to actually start to feel good. So whatever you do, don't feel good. Right. Now that you got that to stop.
[43:25] B: Right.
[43:26] A: That's what we want to get in. That's what's starting to happen in your brain. That's why the feeling is changing. And again, it's going to travel back in another moment will come to your.
[43:36] C: Awareness.
[43:40] A: Whether it is anything to do with mom or not.
[43:47] B: Yeah.
[43:48] A: What's coming to mind now?
[43:52] C: Drinking with my dad at a young age.
[43:54] B: Yeah.
[43:56] C: We were at our first house.
[43:59] B: Right.
[44:03] C: I was 13.
[44:04] A: 13. Right. Good job, good detail.
[44:08] C: He was explaining to me that I was an alcoholic.
[44:11] B: Right.
[44:14] C: And I was confused.
[44:16] A: Right.
[44:17] C: I didn't know what an alcoholic was.
[44:19] B: Right.
[44:20] C: I thought it was a title.
[44:21] B: Right.
[44:23] C: And I found it funny because we were still drinking as he was telling me this.
[44:30] B: Right.
[44:37] C: Then I got drunk and I woke up the next morning.
[44:41] B: Right. Right.
[44:44] A: So as you're telling me about this right now, that moment then, now what do you notice?
[44:54] C: I'm more understanding. You know, it wasn't my. I can't. I'm not blaming my father.
[45:05] A: You know, I'm drinking that often at that age was problematic drinking.
[45:16] B: Right.
[45:16] A: So the clarity is that I've had problematic drinking whether I have title or not.
[45:21] C: Yeah. Problematic drinking.
[45:24] B: Right.
[45:24] A: Because it was happening too often, too frequent, and it was also interrupting performance.
[45:31] C: Most definitely.
[45:32] A: In a social, relational, and academic way.
[45:36] C: Absolutely.
[45:37] B: Yeah.
[45:38] A: So that's how we know whether a substance is problematic. Is it negatively affecting a social, relational relationship? Is it negatively affecting performance in terms of school or job or what have you?
[45:58] C: Yeah.
[45:59] B: Makes sense. It does, yeah. Yeah.
[46:03] A: And that you didn't get it because it was paradoxical. You have this problem that we shouldn't be doing.
[46:13] C: Yeah.
[46:17] A: Yeah.
[46:18] C: Absolutely.
[46:21] B: Yeah. Right.
[46:23] A: What does that younger you back then need to know now that you know.
[46:30] C: That I just didn't understand, you know, at. That, you know, now I'm okay.
[46:45] A: Yeah.
[46:46] C: That I do understand now.
[46:48] B: Yeah.
[46:50] C: And I don't have to blame myself anymore for something I just didn't understand.
[46:57] B: Right.
[46:58] A: Or start.
[46:59] C: Or start.
[47:00] B: Right.
[47:01] A: That's what the tobacco companies did. Here, soldiers take these. They're cheap. We'll give them to you for free. We get doctors to recommend certain brands. This thing's great for us. We make a shitload of money off of people because the product that we gave them causes them to have a desire to get rid of the urge that the product that we gave them is causing in them. It'd be like soap that we washed with. That made us dirtier.
[47:32] C: Yeah.
[47:36] A: We'd feel clean for a little bit, but then. How the fuck am I dirtier now? I took a shower.
[47:47] C: Yes.
[47:48] B: Right.
[47:48] A: Like you didn't know.
[47:50] C: Yeah.
[47:50] B: Right.
[47:51] A: Cause when it started, you had no knowledge.
[47:54] C: No.
[47:55] B: Right.
[47:55] A: You were just doing the cool thing the dad was doing.
[47:57] C: Absolutely.
[47:58] A: The dad was saying it was cool to do.
[48:00] C: Yeah.
[48:00] B: Right.
[48:02] A: Got it.
[48:03] C: Got it.
[48:04] A: So again, close your eyes and picture that earlier, you knowing that that moment's over so that he sees clearly like you do. That that was problematic.
[48:24] B: Right. And he's realizing that he stopped and.
[48:32] A: That things are getting better on his way to even more better.
[48:40] B: Right.
[48:53] A: And again, check inside what's happening now.
[49:01] C: I feel good about where I'm at.
[49:04] B: Yeah. Right.
[49:06] A: Because you wouldn't want to feel really good about where you're at. So don't do it right now. Feel really good about where you're at. Right.
[49:15] B: Uh huh.
[49:16] A: Isn't that awesome?
[49:16] C: Yes.
[49:17] B: Yeah. Right.
[49:19] A: Because you didn't set it up.
[49:22] B: Right.
[49:22] A: You didn't like get. You didn't set it up to have the experience that you have had shape the decision and choices that you had to make, which weren't always full choices. They were like, you know, puppeteered choices.
[49:37] B: Yeah.
[49:39] A: Like you can do this or that. Both are things that I want. Like the magician. Go ahead, pick any card you want. I'm not going to know exactly what card you pick, so go ahead and pick any card.
[49:51] C: Yeah, absolutely.
[49:54] B: Ah.
[49:55] A: How did he know?
[49:58] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[50:02] A: So what are you noticing now?
[50:07] C: I'm not dreading being here. I'm comfortable now, you know. Yeah. This isn't as hard as I thought it was going to be. I. I had doubts about myself even being able to. To talk. No, I don't.
[50:29] B: Yeah.
[50:30] A: Pretty easy, isn't it?
[50:31] C: Yeah.
[50:32] B: Yes, it really is.
[50:35] A: Like, who would think.
[50:36] C: Yeah.
[50:37] A: That. Okay, so I talk about it while being here. We go backwards with it. I say I'm not putting my hat on and.
[50:46] C: Yeah, I'm not putting on my hat. Right.
[50:49] A: That's not happening.
[50:50] C: No, it's not happening at all.
[50:52] B: That's right.
[50:53] A: And then the emotion and the physiological tension that was attached to it releases. Now there's an opening so that what I know logically I can feel emotionally.
[51:07] B: Right, right.
[51:09] A: Try to feel Mom's knife at the throat had something to do with her lack of love for you. Yeah, Got it.
[51:20] C: Absolutely.
[51:21] A: They had more to do with her mental health challenges.
[51:24] C: Yeah. Yeah, it really did.
[51:28] A: See at 7, you also weren't aware of things called mental health challenges. No.
[51:34] B: Right.
[51:34] A: Because there's not like, oh, well, in everybody else's houses they're like this.
[51:38] B: Yeah.
[51:38] A: No, I'm like, this is the only thing I know. Yeah. Yeah.
[51:42] C: Really?
[51:42] A: I mean, everybody doesn't have these kinds of experiences. Yeah. So just check. What do you notice?
[51:57] C: I feel great, actually.
[51:59] B: Yeah.
[51:59] C: I feel really good.
[52:00] B: Yeah.
[52:03] C: Yeah. My body is just. I'm happy to be here where I am.
[52:10] B: Yeah. Right.
[52:11] C: Feel a little more anchored.
[52:13] B: Right.
[52:14] A: That's what we're wanting is you to feel much more Anchored and grounded in you. And not up here. Yeah, but down here. Because if I have it all up here, I teeter totter.
[52:30] B: Right.
[52:33] A: That's what happened with trees that got uprooted during hurricane. They're up here. They teeter totter. We want grounding to be down here.
[52:45] B: Right.
[52:47] A: So I can withstand. Make sense.
[52:51] C: It does.
[52:52] A: Because there's gonna be storms. It's shit that happens. Fucked up stuff, Crappy people. It's going to happen. So we want to have the most amount of adaptability in dealing with difficult stuff. Makes sense. So that you're becoming more okay in you.
[53:16] B: Yeah.
[53:17] A: So again, slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue. Breathe a little bit slower and deeper. Allow awareness to expand.
[53:30] B: Pay attention to the space in between.
[53:35] A: You and me and Amanda and everything else.
[53:42] B: Make a connection to the space that.
[53:48] A: Goes out in all directions beyond this.
[53:50] B: Room, the unending space. Right.
[53:59] A: Imagine floating up and out of your body.
[54:02] B: Beyond the ceiling, beyond the roof, rising way up above it, all over it. Free clarity.
[54:20] A: Like a bird to fly and soar and glide through the sky and move in all directions, in all ways.
[54:33] B: That's right. Free.
[54:39] A: To be becoming even more okay in you. Or beginning to lighten up. That's right.
[54:48] B: On the inside. On your way.
[54:55] A: Feeling better to even that much more better still. Calm on the inside.
[55:12] B: Peacefulness. Wonder.
[55:21] A: Just like the moments of sitting out.
[55:25] B: On that rock cliff looking out.
[55:32] A: That's right. Bring awareness back down and in your body. So you reassociate inside you.
[55:46] B: That's right.
[55:52] A: And then whenever you're ready, just like.
[55:54] B: That big breath in and that long exhale. Right.
[56:02] A: And what are you noticing now?
[56:06] C: Feel light.
[56:08] B: Yeah. Right.
[56:13] A: And as you're feeling light again, your unconscious is going to travel back to another moment that would be useful to.
[56:20] B: Clear, to bring light.
[56:24] A: What comes to mind now?
[56:28] C: Being molested and raped by my babysitter.
[56:30] A: That probably would be a bit of a negative.
[56:31] B: Yeah.
[56:33] A: That one happened like when you were how old?
[56:35] C: I was eight.
[56:36] B: You were eight.
[56:37] A: I kept over it.
[56:37] B: Yeah. Right.
[56:38] A: So you're eight.
[56:39] B: You're where?
[56:39] A: Well, things aren't chronological in the brain.
[56:41] C: Yeah.
[56:42] A: They're rhizomatic. They're connected through multiple layers of connections.
[56:47] C: Yeah.
[56:47] A: Not from one.
[56:48] B: Chronological. Yeah.
[56:50] A: So eight. You're aware when this happened?
[56:51] C: Montana.
[56:52] B: Montana.
[56:53] A: In the house.
[56:53] B: Right.
[56:53] A: Mom's room.
[56:54] C: No.
[56:55] A: Oh, damn. I thought everything good was going to happen in mom's room.
[56:58] C: No, wasn't in mom's room. This one was in my room.
[57:02] A: Oh, in your room.
[57:03] B: Good. Right?
[57:03] A: Even better. Yeah.
[57:04] B: All right.
[57:05] A: So you're in your room. You're in bed, sleeping.
[57:07] C: Yeah.
[57:08] B: All right.
[57:08] A: So you've gone to bed.
[57:09] B: Right.
[57:09] A: Mom and dad are out. Right. Babysitter's there.
[57:12] B: Right.
[57:12] A: You're in bed sleeping.
[57:13] B: Right.
[57:13] A: Door opens.
[57:14] B: Right.
[57:15] A: Babysitter walks in.
[57:16] C: Yes.
[57:17] B: Right.
[57:17] A: Babysitter gets in bed. Gets in bed.
[57:20] B: Right.
[57:20] A: And then does what?
[57:22] C: And then he begins to touch me.
[57:24] A: So he touches you? Right. Some of it's weird. Some of it might be feeling good. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[57:32] C: There was a lot of him asking me to do things.
[57:35] A: Right. So then he had you put his mouth on his penis or touch other areas.
[57:39] B: Right.
[57:39] A: Good. And then what happened next?
[57:41] C: And then. Then you left the room.
[57:44] A: Then he left the room. Right.
[57:45] C: And I felt confused.
[57:47] A: Right, Good.
[57:48] B: Right.
[57:51] C: But also like I couldn't say anything.
[57:53] A: Well, then what happened next?
[57:55] C: And then mom and my mom's boyfriend came home.
[57:58] B: Right.
[57:59] A: Good job.
[57:59] B: Good detail. Right.
[58:00] C: And I felt like there was a way wall between my mom and myself at that point.
[58:08] A: They. They came home. Then what happened next? Babysitter left.
[58:11] C: Babysitter left. Yeah.
[58:12] B: Right.
[58:12] A: And then that moment ended.
[58:13] C: Yeah.
[58:13] B: Right.
[58:14] A: And then later on, you did something more fun.
[58:16] C: Yeah.
[58:16] B: Right.
[58:16] A: Like go in the woods.
[58:18] B: Right.
[58:18] A: Walk with the dog. Right. Go snowboarding.
[58:21] C: Yeah.
[58:22] A: Right. So we got snowboarding and peeing out in the woods and, you know, hanging out with the dog.
[58:25] C: Yeah.
[58:25] B: Right.
[58:26] A: And then he had left.
[58:27] C: Yeah.
[58:27] B: Right.
[58:27] A: Then they got home, and then he was out of the room.
[58:30] C: Yeah.
[58:30] B: Right.
[58:30] A: And then he had stopped, and then he had you do different stuff. And then he had been touching you. And then he crawled in bed. Right. Then he walked in the room, and then he opened the door. Then before that, you'd gone to bed.
[58:40] B: Right.
[58:41] A: Then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Right. And again, what do you notice?
[58:49] B: Right.
[58:49] A: Isn't that cool?
[58:51] B: Yeah.
[58:52] A: You can remember all that happening, right? You can remember putting your shoes on.
[58:57] B: Stop putting on your shoes.
[58:58] C: I'm not taking my shoes off.
[59:00] A: No, I'm not putting on my shoes. I'm not putting my shoes on because they're on. Stop taking off your hat.
[59:03] C: I'm not taking off my.
[59:04] A: Stop me from putting on my shoes.
[59:06] C: You're not putting on your shoes?
[59:07] A: Right. Well, stop him from touching you.
[59:10] C: He's not touching me.
[59:10] A: Well, then you stop touching him. Well, stop that from happening.
[59:14] C: It's not happening.
[59:15] A: Yeah. So then where is. Doesn't exist. Right. Again, that happening. Did that have anything to do with you?
[59:21] C: No.
[59:22] B: Right.
[59:22] A: Some of it feeling good. Did that have anything to do with you wanting it. Right. Got it. Had everything to do with him and what was off over there.
[59:33] B: Right.
[59:34] A: You didn't know that then.
[59:36] B: Right?
[59:36] A: So again, close your eyes. Picture the earlier you. Let him know that's over, finished, that it no longer exists. Let him know that him doing that had nothing to do with you. Everything to do with what was off with him. Let the earlier you know that he messed with your stuff, your body, different body parts. He messed with your stuff. Let that younger you know that he never touched who you really are. Delight at the center that you became aware of as you're sitting on that.
[60:07] B: Rock, cliff looking out. Right.
[60:12] A: That he never touched who you really are. Let him know he never touched me mess with my stuff.
[60:21] B: Right.
[60:22] A: So the earlier you gets it.
[60:26] B: Right. Oh yeah. Huh.
[60:42] A: What are you noticing now? How's your body feeling?
[60:48] C: Secure.
[60:49] B: Yeah.
[60:49] A: Think back about that moment.
[60:51] B: Right?
[60:51] A: There's no cell right now that's the same as it was then.
[60:54] B: Yeah, Right.
[60:55] A: They've all been replaced.
[60:58] B: Right?
[60:59] C: Yeah.
[61:00] B: Right.
[61:02] C: Okay.
[61:04] B: Yeah.
[61:09] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[61:10] C: It is.
[61:11] B: Right?
[61:12] A: And you know what? Wouldn't most people do? Ones that are a little less and get bigger. I gotta check to see whether this shit works.
[61:20] C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No kidding, right?
[61:25] A: People don't come with like guns a blazing baby. Here's the big one.
[61:29] C: Yeah.
[61:31] A: But notice how that went fast.
[61:33] C: It did. It went really fast.
[61:37] A: Oh, it's already become like we're getting the snowball motion.
[61:42] C: Yes.
[61:43] B: Picking up steam.
[61:46] C: Yeah.
[61:50] B: Right.
[61:56] C: I like this.
[61:59] A: What's not to like?
[62:00] C: Yeah. Right. Yeah.
[62:08] B: Right.
[62:09] A: Cause just check. Notice how different it is.
[62:11] C: It really is. It's not a problem anymore.
[62:17] A: As you're thinking about that stuff. It's not hurting.
[62:19] C: It's not.
[62:20] B: No.
[62:21] C: I have heard this. You to worry about or not worry about, but think about, you know.
[62:26] B: Yeah.
[62:27] A: Or just other things to do.
[62:32] C: This stuff has been holding me back.
[62:33] A: For so long and now it's not having a hold of you at all. No. Right now you're moving forward. Not just have you already been physically moving forward because you have. Because you've already changed your life.
[62:48] C: Yeah.
[62:48] A: Because you got out of that, stopped that and changed.
[62:54] B: Right.
[62:54] A: Getting your clean and sober. Like all these things. You've already begun the behavioral stuff, which is great. This is just so that the emotional stuff catches up and that your mind body is more supportive of the forward changes that you're making.
[63:15] C: Yes.
[63:16] B: Right.
[63:16] A: To be more okay in you and a better version. Have a life that looks distinctly different than the one that you grew up with.
[63:24] C: Oh, yeah.
[63:25] A: Follow me with that. Absolutely.
[63:28] B: Right, right.
[63:30] A: That's where we're headed. That's why it's changing.
[63:34] B: Yeah.
[63:35] A: So it's another moment that comes to mind, whether it be something that happened to you or something that you did that you felt bad about.
[63:47] B: Still a lot, huh?
[63:49] A: Is there a particular moment that comes to mind?
[63:51] C: Yeah.
[63:52] B: Yeah.
[63:53] A: So you're how old and where? 14.
[63:54] C: In New Mexico.
[63:55] B: Right.
[63:55] A: Good job.
[63:56] B: Right.
[63:56] A: At least she didn't move anywhere. Yeah, no, everything was. I mean, everything was stable, first of all, because, you know, we were in multiple houses well before I was seven.
[64:04] B: Right.
[64:05] C: Yeah.
[64:05] B: Right.
[64:06] A: Second of all, like, I didn't move anywhere.
[64:08] C: Yeah.
[64:08] A: A lot of stability. Third of all, mom didn't have revolving door with like guys that came in.
[64:13] C: Yeah.
[64:13] B: Right.
[64:13] A: So lots of stability.
[64:20] C: So I was in New Mexico.
[64:22] A: Oh, that's Dave, Larry, George.
[64:25] C: Yeah, right.
[64:28] A: Hey, ed.
[64:30] C: I was 14.
[64:31] B: Yeah.
[64:32] C: I ran to the streets.
[64:34] A: Right. So you're 14, you're in New Mexico.
[64:36] C: Yeah.
[64:37] A: Don't really have a place to stay.
[64:38] C: Yes.
[64:39] A: You got like the clothes on your back. Maybe a little other.
[64:43] C: Very little right now. And I needed a way to survive.
[64:48] B: Yeah.
[64:49] C: So I resorted to stealing.
[64:51] B: Yeah.
[64:52] C: Not just from stores, but from people.
[64:54] B: Right.
[64:54] A: Well, it's better.
[64:55] C: And yeah.
[64:56] A: Stores are more dangerous people.
[64:58] C: Yeah.
[65:02] A: Way too many variables with this story, really. Not less with the people.
[65:05] C: And. Yeah. Like I.
[65:08] B: Right.
[65:10] A: So you like, might have mugged somebody. You might have like gotten in their house or. Bro.
[65:13] B: What?
[65:13] A: Like, what's the moment that's coming?
[65:15] C: There was muggings.
[65:17] B: Yeah.
[65:18] C: There was robbing the cars.
[65:21] B: Yeah.
[65:22] C: And in my head it was okay because I was doing it to survive.
[65:30] B: Yeah.
[65:31] C: And then when I finish what I was doing, I'd go support my habits, my getting of the food and maybe even a place to stay. And then I'd repeat it the next day.
[65:53] A: What had you stopped.
[65:56] B: Doing that?
[65:57] C: What had me stop? Yeah, My heart attack.
[66:00] B: Huh.
[66:04] C: I didn't stop until I was 24.
[66:08] B: Uh huh.
[66:10] C: And then I had my heart attack. Went into crime. Cardiac arrest.
[66:15] B: Yeah.
[66:16] A: You're aware when that happened?
[66:18] C: Yeah. Was in New Mexico.
[66:21] A: Still.
[66:21] B: It's really good place.
[66:23] C: Yeah.
[66:24] A: Robberies, apparently.
[66:31] C: So I woke up.
[66:32] B: Right.
[66:32] A: And so you're. You're where though? When you.
[66:35] C: I'm in UNM hospital as you woke up.
[66:38] A: But where were you when the thing happened? You went into cardiac arrest?
[66:43] C: I was actually down on my reservation in Santa Domingo Pueblo.
[66:47] B: Yes.
[66:48] C: I was chasing cattle.
[66:50] B: Yes.
[66:51] C: And my heart gave up.
[66:52] B: Yes.
[66:54] C: I was taken to the hospital. And that's when I went into cardiac arrest. My heart gave out. I woke up like. Like two weeks later.
[67:07] B: Yeah.
[67:07] C: The icu.
[67:08] B: Yeah.
[67:10] C: And I was a different person.
[67:12] B: Yeah.
[67:16] C: I didn't want to hurt people anymore.
[67:18] B: Yeah.
[67:19] C: Physically or financially? Emotionally. I just. Something changed.
[67:30] B: Yeah.
[67:32] C: Things became more important, and I didn't want to be the cause of the destruction of those important things. So it stopped.
[67:48] B: Yeah.
[67:50] A: Isn't that cool?
[67:53] C: It was. It was really cool.
[67:55] B: Yeah.
[67:57] C: And it was terrifying, too, because I no longer knew who I was.
[68:06] A: Or who you thought you were.
[68:07] B: Or who I thought I was would be better.
[68:10] A: Cause you didn't know who you were then either. No, it's just who you thought you were. That was that role that you were playing.
[68:16] C: Absolutely. But I had no ground to stand on at that point, which was what was terrifying about it. Also, I didn't know who I wanted to be.
[68:29] B: Yeah.
[68:31] C: So that was probably the most.
[68:33] A: You're becoming more clear on that now.
[68:35] B: Yeah.
[68:35] C: That was the most terrifying point in my life.
[68:38] B: Huh.
[68:39] C: Because everything that I thought was not real.
[68:44] A: And it was the first break.
[68:47] C: Literally, like I was born again.
[68:50] B: Yeah.
[68:51] C: Everything was new and real and scary. And it was just me.
[68:59] B: Yeah.
[69:08] C: And then got sent home to my. The icu, and I just felt out of place. Then the day started over, and.
[69:31] A: It.
[69:32] C: Was like taking my first steps again. Except this time I was aware of the change within me and I didn't know where I was going. I just needed to get there.
[70:05] A: And that was the start of changing your life for the better. Even if there had been ups and downs along that road.
[70:13] C: Yeah. That was. That was where everything changed.
[70:17] B: Yeah.
[70:17] A: So again, as you're thinking about it and telling us, what'd you notice?
[70:23] B: What was that like?
[70:25] C: I think that's the first time I've thought about it and actually understood the feeling that was behind it. Because I've thought about it and it wasn't. No. I guess there wasn't a feeling there because I had no feeling to compare it to. Now that I look back, it's. I finally am understanding what that feeling was of starting over and like, that it was a gift because otherwise I'd still be out there or I'd be dead. So it's. It's kind of amazing.
[71:24] A: Yeah. Pretty amazing. You are.
[71:34] C: I feel that.
[71:35] B: Yeah. Right.
[71:36] A: You're starting to connect to more of you.
[71:38] C: Yeah.
[71:40] B: Right.
[71:45] C: Right.
[71:49] B: Right.
[71:50] A: There was a restart, a reboot, an update to the operating system.
[71:58] C: Yeah.
[71:59] A: That got me out of just survival.
[72:01] B: Mode and do anything I need to do.
[72:07] C: Yes.
[72:08] B: Right.
[72:13] C: That's where I started to allow Myself to start to figure out who I actually was.
[72:18] B: Yeah, yeah. Right, right.
[72:25] A: And notice how far you've come already.
[72:27] B: Right.
[72:28] A: And how much further you've gotten.
[72:30] B: Yeah.
[72:31] A: And where you're headed. Like, it's all happening. All that stuff is happening now.
[72:36] C: It really is.
[72:38] B: Yeah.
[72:40] C: I've come further than I've ever dreamed.
[72:42] B: Yeah.
[72:43] A: Isn't that cool?
[72:44] C: It really is. It really is. And to know that this is just the beginning is even older.
[72:51] A: Right.
[72:54] B: Yeah.
[72:56] A: Cause the pathways are changing. See, here's the thing. Even if the noticing is like, you know, two ships set out to sea on parallel course courses, if we adjust one ship by a degree, it doesn't seem like it's doing anything.
[73:11] B: Right.
[73:12] A: But the further we go out into the ocean, the more vast and different the course becomes.
[73:19] B: Right.
[73:20] A: So we've already made adjustments, which, in a feed forward loop, is changing the trajectory of where you're headed and the emotionality of stuff. Isn't that cool?
[73:35] C: It really is.
[73:36] A: Yeah.
[73:36] B: Yeah, yeah.
[73:39] A: So as you think back about having robbed people.
[73:42] B: Right.
[73:42] A: Like, how do you want to be about that now? Like, is it better for you to feel bad about it or not?
[73:51] C: No. I think I blame myself enough.
[73:53] B: Okay.
[73:56] C: I really do. I think I allowed myself to suffer enough because I felt like I had to atone.
[74:03] B: Right.
[74:03] A: That was the whole good thing that you. You and the Da Vinci Code.
[74:06] C: Yeah.
[74:07] A: The white albino that just beats himself.
[74:09] C: Absolutely.
[74:12] A: Because then I'll do better next time.
[74:13] C: Yeah.
[74:14] A: Or not.
[74:15] C: Or not.
[74:16] A: Yeah. Because he definitely had better behavior next time.
[74:20] C: Yeah. Right. That for him. But, yeah. No, I don't.
[74:29] A: I don't feel that.
[74:30] C: You know, I think I've paid enough.
[74:32] B: Right.
[74:35] C: I think I've learned my lesson.
[74:38] A: Well, back then, at that time, that's what occurred for you to do. You couldn't have not done it.
[74:44] C: Yeah.
[74:45] B: Right.
[74:46] A: And because I was in the loop that I was in, it led to that. It wasn't until there was a dramatic boom that my heart stopped. And then period of time went by, and then it got started back again.
[75:04] C: Yeah.
[75:05] A: That it caused a reset and a reboot.
[75:08] B: Right.
[75:08] A: That's done that a lot for people with the pandemic. Like, oh, wait a minute, like, I'm doing something that I hate. Maybe I don't want to do that anymore.
[75:18] B: Huh?
[75:19] C: Yeah. Yeah. Really.
[75:21] B: Right.
[75:21] A: I mean, that's what happened with the pandemic for lots of people. But yours was the reboot.
[75:28] C: It really was.
[75:29] B: Yeah.
[75:30] A: Isn't that cool?
[75:32] C: Yeah.
[75:33] B: Yeah, it is.
[75:34] C: It completely changed.
[75:36] B: Right.
[75:36] A: And that's not you and that person who is doing that stuff was never who you really are. It was a way that you behaved and acted and thought.
[75:51] B: Right.
[75:51] A: And how you behave, act and think is not who you are.
[75:57] B: Right.
[75:57] A: And even when you were doing that stuff, you were much more than just that. There was much more to you.
[76:06] C: There was.
[76:07] B: Right.
[76:08] A: Now you're becoming more okay in you.
[76:11] B: Right.
[76:12] A: Isn't that cool?
[76:13] C: It is.
[76:14] A: Yeah.
[76:16] C: It really is.
[76:17] B: Yeah.
[76:19] A: So again, notice what happens when your jaw slightly lowers and you rest your tongue. You breathe a little slower and deeper and effortlessly drift inside, down in, towards. Towards delight.
[76:34] B: That is you at the center. Right.
[76:43] A: As the lights are getting turned on and the news.
[76:51] B: That's right.
[76:56] A: That's right. So now let's think of a time of you liking a fucking men.
[77:08] B: So much like being around women.
[77:09] A: Better guys are.
[77:16] C: Yeah.
[77:17] A: So because, you know, good thing that we're working at Lowe's because that is a woman predominant store.
[77:22] C: Yeah.
[77:23] A: Most of the people are going and shopping at Lowe's. Definitely women.
[77:27] C: Yes, they are.
[77:27] A: 100% of the time.
[77:29] C: It's my natural habitat. Yeah. So, okay. I was in Montana and it started when I was seven.
[77:43] B: Yeah.
[77:45] A: So think of a time. Year seven. Seven, by the way, was. Had to have been a really good year.
[77:49] C: It was a great year. Yeah. All the more, you know, extravagant parts of my life started at seven. Yeah. You know, I never even thought about that, like how most of everything started at the age of seven.
[78:10] B: Yeah.
[78:10] A: Seven had a lot of stuff. Nine also was really nice timing.
[78:14] C: Yeah.
[78:14] A: Y8. You know, there's just a lot of good years so far.
[78:19] B: Yeah.
[78:19] C: Nine to 14 is, you know, the highlight.
[78:22] B: Yeah.
[78:24] C: So, yeah, I was seven. I had watched my mom for believe two and a half years to three years get beat. So we were in our house with her boyfriend.
[78:41] B: Yeah.
[78:42] C: And he was throwing her across the house.
[78:45] B: Right.
[78:46] C: And I was in my room with my sister and my little brother.
[78:49] B: Yeah.
[78:50] C: My baby brother. And I stopped being scared.
[78:57] B: Right.
[78:57] C: What was going on out there?
[78:59] A: Well, you stepped outside and I ran.
[79:01] C: Outside and I got between my mother and her boyfriend.
[79:04] B: Right.
[79:05] C: And I started yelling at him. And that's when I started getting b.
[79:12] A: Now just check. Think about the moment. Notice the size difference. You at 7 in relationship to him.
[79:21] C: Yeah. He was mountainous.
[79:23] A: Got it.
[79:26] C: But that didn't.
[79:27] B: Right.
[79:28] C: Still didn't worry me.
[79:29] A: No, that wasn't what it was about. It was about it stopping. But we're talking about the representation of a 3 authority being above you and bigger than you.
[79:37] C: Yeah.
[79:38] A: Why there's been Issues with men. So then he started hitting you?
[79:42] C: Yeah.
[79:42] A: Like with fists or slaps or.
[79:44] C: Both.
[79:45] A: Both, Right. That hurt.
[79:47] C: Yes.
[79:48] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[79:51] C: And then my mom jumped in to.
[79:53] A: Stop him from hitting you.
[79:55] C: Yeah.
[79:55] B: Right.
[79:55] A: And then what happened next?
[79:59] C: He took off.
[80:00] A: Eventually, he might have smacked her away. And then he left the house.
[80:03] C: Yeah.
[80:03] B: Right.
[80:04] C: And me and my mom just, again, sat there.
[80:08] B: Right.
[80:08] C: Not moving or saying anything.
[80:10] A: Eventually, we had to go deal with the baby.
[80:12] C: Yes.
[80:13] B: Right.
[80:16] A: And then, of course, that moment ended.
[80:18] B: Right.
[80:18] A: And then later on, you did something more fun.
[80:21] C: Yeah.
[80:21] B: Right.
[80:21] C: Oh, it's back in the woods.
[80:23] B: Right.
[80:23] A: Back in the woods.
[80:24] B: Right.
[80:24] A: On snowboarding, right? We got snowboarding at the end of the woods. You got walking with the dog.
[80:28] C: Yeah.
[80:29] B: Right, Right.
[80:30] A: You can remember all that happening. You can remember what happened with him leaving, mom stopping him, you stopping him from mom, you yelling, you getting in front, you leaving the room. You can remember all that happening.
[80:41] B: Right.
[80:41] A: And you can remember taking your hat off. Well, stop taking on your. Well, stop putting on your shoes. We'll stop me from putting on my shoes. Stop Amanda for putting on her heels.
[80:53] C: She's not putting on her heels.
[80:55] A: Well, let's stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that.
[80:57] C: He's not doing that.
[80:58] A: Where is it? Say it doesn't exist.
[81:00] C: It doesn't exist.
[81:01] B: Right.
[81:01] A: Again. That happening, did that have anything to do with you?
[81:04] C: No.
[81:05] B: Right.
[81:05] A: Would it have mattered whether it was you in that situation or any other kid?
[81:08] C: Not at all.
[81:09] A: That's what he would have done. Got it?
[81:12] C: Yeah.
[81:13] A: So again, close your eyes. Picture the earlier you knowing it had nothing to do with me, so that he gets it.
[81:20] B: It's not about me.
[81:21] A: Nothing to do with me.
[81:23] B: Right. Yeah.
[81:31] A: Let him know that you're okay. Shoot your consciousness into the younger you so that you kind of inhabit him and ride behind his eyes and grow him up from seven into the man he is now.
[81:51] B: Right.
[81:51] A: All the way up. All the way up. Growing him all the way up.
[82:01] B: Into.
[82:02] A: The man he is today. Big, deep breath in.
[82:19] B: Right?
[82:19] A: One more big, deep breath in. And exhale.
[82:25] B: And open your eyes. All right.
[82:30] A: How's your body feeling now?
[82:32] C: It's nice.
[82:33] A: It is, isn't it?
[82:34] C: Yeah.
[82:35] A: Yeah.
[82:36] C: Yeah.
[82:37] B: Right?
[82:41] C: Yeah.
[82:42] B: Huh.
[82:43] C: Feels like I stepped into some new clothing.
[82:46] A: I bet.
[82:46] C: Yeah.
[82:47] B: Yeah. Right.
[82:51] A: Cause now think of that guy.
[82:53] C: Yeah.
[82:54] A: Who both then did stuff to mom and you.
[82:57] C: Yeah.
[82:58] A: Well, good thing I jumped in. That totally stopped it from happening to her.
[83:04] C: Right? Yeah.
[83:07] A: No, I just became a new target.
[83:08] B: Great.
[83:08] A: Cool. This is awesome.
[83:10] C: Yeah. I didn't know what I was doing.
[83:12] A: Right.
[83:12] B: Yeah.
[83:12] A: That earlier you didn't know that it wasn't gonna stop it.
[83:15] C: Yeah. Yeah, of course.
[83:16] A: Right.
[83:18] B: Right. Yeah. Right.
[83:29] A: And what are you noticing now?
[83:34] C: I don't know. I just, like. I'm kind of. I'm really enjoying this. And I'm finding it funny because, like, it's almost like when I'm thinking about that little boy, it's like he's already. He's telling me that he already knew this. You know, like. Like he's been trying to tell me.
[83:54] B: Yeah.
[83:55] C: Because it's not been him. It's been me that's holding onto this.
[83:59] A: I don't know. I don't think you've been holding it. I think it's had a hold of you, but not because you've been holding it.
[84:06] C: Yeah.
[84:07] A: It's an error in the way your brain's been working.
[84:09] C: Yeah.
[84:11] B: Right.
[84:11] A: Now things are integrating you and him whole.
[84:19] B: Right. Right.
[84:22] A: All parts getting updated, all aspects having a better understanding, becoming more.
[84:56] B: Yeah.
[85:15] A: What do you notice happening now?
[85:19] C: It's just something I like having.
[85:23] B: Like.
[85:23] C: This sensation just go throughout my body. It's almost like a scanner, I guess. You know, like light just scanning my entire body.
[85:38] B: Yeah.
[85:41] A: What are you noticing is the light is scanning your entire body.
[85:46] C: Where the light is, it's just, like, tingling as it goes up and down. It's almost like it's almost scanning, but also taking away impurities.
[85:58] B: Yeah.
[85:59] C: This goes back, back and forth. So that's like a cleansing.
[86:09] B: Yeah, it is.
[86:20] A: Clearing out the debris.
[86:23] B: The remnants, faulty programs, the glitches, the errors.
[86:33] A: The fragments.
[86:35] C: Yeah.
[86:38] A: The stuck memories, emotions, meanings.
[86:42] B: Right.
[86:55] A: I notice how much quieter it is up top.
[87:01] C: Yeah. Like, I feel like I'm noticing things for the first time. Like, even just like in this room.
[87:08] B: Yeah.
[87:08] C: Like I'm seeing more.
[87:13] B: Right.
[87:13] A: You know, just more press present and outwardly focused. Meaning you're spending a lot less time thinking or feeling about yourself. Whether that be in my own worries about whether I'm gonna do, say, act right. Or what others are thinking. Feeling.
[87:35] C: Yeah.
[87:35] A: About me.
[87:37] C: Yeah.
[87:38] B: Right.
[87:39] A: You're not so concerned about that.
[87:41] C: No, I'm more.
[87:43] A: Because you don't learn about you from other people. You learn about how they feel or think or act, maybe about something you've said or done, but not. You got it? That's what's starting to make the revolution. That's what's changing.
[88:02] C: Absolutely. It's new.
[88:07] A: Yeah, I bet. So think about, you know, like, you know, scary men.
[88:13] C: Okay.
[88:16] A: You know?
[88:17] B: Cause, you know, there might Be a.
[88:19] A: Scary guy at Lowe's.
[88:24] C: Can't think of one. I can't think of one.
[88:29] B: Right.
[88:29] A: Maybe it's an older guy. Maybe it's got a guy that's got a voice similar to the guy that was abusive. Maybe he's got a similar look. Hair color, body, mustache, whatever. Try to feel really intimidated by men.
[88:51] C: I don't want to say I can't.
[88:53] A: Good is how. It's not there. It's so good.
[88:57] C: Yeah.
[88:58] B: Right.
[88:59] A: I can't notice how it's not there.
[89:01] C: It's not there.
[89:02] B: Right, Right.
[89:05] A: Cause that part that had been regressed got all grown up.
[89:09] C: Yeah.
[89:10] B: Right, Right.
[89:16] A: And he can handle himself.
[89:21] C: I can't handle myself.
[89:22] B: Right.
[89:22] A: It's not the person who flies off the handle and gets in a fight over. It's the person who, you know, stays grounded here. But you just don't fuck with because you don't wanna. Like a lion sits there most of the time. Think of male lion. Male lion is not the hunter. Male lion isn't chasing down the gazelle.
[89:48] B: Right.
[89:49] A: Male lion kind of hangs out.
[89:51] C: Yeah.
[89:52] A: You know, watching. See if any other lions enter territory. But, like, nobody goes up to fuck with the male lion.
[90:00] C: Yeah. Yeah. No kidding. Right.
[90:03] A: Got it. For a period of time in life, you had a big targeted circle on your back with a button that said, press me and see what happens.
[90:13] C: Yeah, absolutely.
[90:16] A: People would go. Think they might even brush aside. They didn't set it all. It didn't even.
[90:21] B: Right.
[90:22] A: Yeah. That's what's changing.
[90:23] C: Yeah. Right.
[90:26] A: That's what's changing.
[90:27] C: Yeah.
[90:28] A: That's why that's different. That's why you're feeling different about it, you know?
[90:34] B: Yeah.
[90:36] C: I do feel better about it.
[90:38] A: Yeah.
[90:43] C: I thought this was gonna be a lot more difficult. So.
[90:49] B: Awesome.
[90:53] A: That's the hard part to get into people.
[90:55] C: Yeah.
[90:57] A: Is that it's not going to be as difficult as they think it will be. You already did all the hard parts. All the hard parts was making it through all the awful stuff. You already did the hardest part.
[91:11] C: Supposed to be like this.
[91:12] A: This should be a lot easier.
[91:14] C: Oh, my God.
[91:15] A: I think about it. You did the work already. You did the hard part. You made it through the awful experience.
[91:20] C: Yeah.
[91:22] A: So this should be easier than that.
[91:24] C: It is.
[91:25] A: But most people go, no, you've got to be back in it to release it because that's why you didn't let it out.
[91:33] C: Yeah.
[91:33] A: You've been holding it still. You got to release it. You got to let it go. Gotta vomit it up. You gotta. It's not any of those things. You haven't been holding it.
[91:46] C: Okay.
[91:47] A: It's been having a hold of you.
[91:51] B: Right.
[91:51] A: If all of a sudden the rib pops out because, like, I moved in the wrong direction.
[91:56] B: Right.
[91:57] A: Am I, like, doing a lot of stuff to hold on to it? I do anything.
[92:02] C: Yeah.
[92:02] A: I want it to be like. I don't want. I'm trying to do all I can to get it gone, but it doesn't quite get gone.
[92:08] C: Yeah.
[92:09] A: So I have to go to the person who knows how to, like, pop the rib back in.
[92:13] C: Yeah.
[92:13] A: Then even then, it might take a little bit for it to finally, like, sit in the right spot.
[92:18] C: Yeah.
[92:18] A: Okay. Now I don't have that.
[92:20] C: Yeah, Absolutely right.
[92:23] A: You weren't holding it.
[92:25] C: I wasn't.
[92:26] B: No.
[92:27] A: And what you had done before was just the wrong approach for this kind of stuff. It's the right approach for lots of things, just not trauma.
[92:41] B: I agree. Yeah. Right.
[92:43] A: So as you kind of think and even scan back any stuff around stuff that you've done. I know we did the thing around, like, stealing that you feel bad about having done. Like, they're still, like, lingering, like, guilt, shame, regret, remorse.
[92:59] C: Absolutely. I was in New Mexico.
[93:03] B: Yeah.
[93:04] C: I was at the skate park in downtown, and I had been walking by the. I was walking down the sidewalk, and this guy stops me and he says.
[93:21] A: Do.
[93:22] C: Do you. He's like, would you want to go with me to go get high?
[93:31] B: Yes.
[93:32] C: And I will pleasure you and give you money and drugs.
[93:37] B: Yeah.
[93:39] C: So I thought it was weird.
[93:41] A: Right.
[93:42] C: That didn't. That wasn't what bothered me.
[93:44] B: Right.
[93:45] C: What bothered me was just right after that, he asked, how old are you?
[93:50] B: Yes.
[93:50] C: And I told him I was, like, 22.
[93:53] B: Yes.
[93:54] C: He's like, I thought you were 16.
[93:56] B: Yes.
[93:58] C: So I told my two buddies, and we jumped him.
[94:04] B: Right.
[94:06] C: And we took it way too far.
[94:10] B: Right.
[94:11] A: We got drugs and money.
[94:13] C: Yeah.
[94:13] A: And beat him a little or a lot?
[94:15] C: We beat him a lot.
[94:16] B: Right.
[94:17] C: We beat him to the point where for about two or three months after, I thought he had died.
[94:24] B: Yes.
[94:24] A: Right.
[94:25] C: We stolen his car.
[94:26] B: Yes.
[94:29] C: We tied his dog to his leg.
[94:31] B: Yes.
[94:32] C: And we literally took everything he owned. He lived in that car.
[94:38] B: Yeah.
[94:40] C: And I thought we had killed him.
[94:44] B: Yeah.
[94:48] A: And then later on, you found out that you didn't.
[94:52] C: Yeah. But there was nothing like that feeling of, I may have murdered somebody. I may have taken their life despite them, or even me thinking that they were a bad person. I took their life. And that mentally shook me. I got really bad after that with.
[95:24] A: Using with using the home invasions?
[95:27] C: Yeah, with everything. Because that was the tipping point for me, alright.
[95:32] A: Because I felt like I was a piece of shit.
[95:34] C: Not only that, it's just that I. To me, murder was the worst a person could do. And that's when I just dove in. Nothing mattered, right? No one mattered. I didn't matter. It got really dark before I had my heart attack.
[95:58] A: Yeah.
[96:00] C: And I didn't know if. I didn't know if it was. I was coming back again.
[96:13] B: Right.
[96:16] C: So.
[96:19] A: So now as you tell him this, what are you noticing?
[96:24] C: I'm relieved that I'm not the person. That person that I thought I was.
[96:30] B: Yeah.
[96:31] C: I'm relieved to know that, you know, despite me making a bad judgment call at that point, I. I will never allow myself to feel that again. I will never let that opportunity to feel so dark and lost and helpless ever happen again. Because I won't be in those situations again.
[96:57] B: Right.
[96:58] C: So it's like a moment of clarity that that person that I thought I'd become just wasn't. It didn't take over. Despite the despair that I felt.
[97:14] B: That, that and that he's okay. Yeah.
[97:18] A: He didn't die.
[97:19] C: He is okay.
[97:19] A: He didn't kill him.
[97:20] C: He's okay. And I'm okay.
[97:22] B: Right.
[97:24] C: I'm okay.
[97:25] B: Right.
[97:28] A: Despite having fallen down the dark tunnel.
[97:33] C: Despite going down as far as I did.
[97:35] B: Right.
[97:36] C: Okay.
[97:37] B: Right.
[97:38] A: He needed a reboot. I mean, they literally needed to shut the whole fucking thing down.
[97:42] C: Yeah, they did. They did.
[97:45] A: And then restart the fucker.
[97:47] C: They really did. And I think it was all in, all in God's design, at least in my mind. So I'm happy. I'm happy. Even though I went through all the bad things. If I had to redo my life, I'd do it exactly the same. Cause I'm proud to be where I'm at.
[98:21] B: Yeah. I really am. Right.
[98:24] A: And you keep thinking that I had choice in the matter, but you didn't actually have choice in the matter. You were born into the situation that you were born into with the parents that you got. That led to certain options being available that aren't available. Other options weren't available. So if I bring out two outfits for my kid and I say, which one do you want to wear? And they point to one they feel like they've chosen.
[98:56] C: Yeah.
[98:59] A: But out of the two outfits that I was okay with them wearing, they didn't really choose. I chose for them.
[99:05] C: Yeah.
[99:06] A: So based on the life circumstances that you got thrown into, it led you down the thing. Make sense Then reset, restart. Right now I'm on my way to creating a life that's distinctly different than the one that I've known. Distinctly different than how I knew myself. Realizing that I'm not that person, that that person was never me, even though it was things that I did in ways that I was feeling back then.
[99:39] B: Yeah, right.
[99:41] A: That I have say now and how I want it to go and how I want it to work and what I'm doing towards all of that.
[99:52] B: Yeah, right, Right.
[99:58] A: And I don't like that I had done that stuff. But you can also get clear that based on what had been, you couldn't have not done that stuff.
[100:09] B: Yeah, right.
[100:10] A: If we look at it backwards from a scientific lens, everything that has happened couldn't have not happened exactly the way that it happened, even if we don't like that it happened that way.
[100:21] B: Right.
[100:22] A: If it happened, something caused it to happen. We don't have to know what the cause was. But there had to have been a cause that caused any of the stuff that's happened to have happened. So the factors that were going on with you, based on the experiences of what you grew up with and all the other stuff, it led you to do what you did then you couldn't have not done it, even if later on we wish we hadn't. Yeah, Right. And if I have any amount of bad feeling, it's not because of what I did. It's because I can conceive of having not done it, having not gone that dark.
[100:54] B: Right.
[100:55] A: That's where it would show up, is that I can conceive of having that done it. But here's the problem with that, Dalton. Because I can think it. My emotional brain causes me to feel, to try to get me to do it. But see, what it's trying to get me to do is stop doing that stuff three years ago, five years ago. Hurry. Timing is completely out of sorts, Right? So when our brain realizes one of two things. One, the experience no longer exists, or two, there's nothing to be done, it stops causing the feelings.
[101:25] B: Right.
[101:26] A: So I'm gonna simply say to you, well, then stop robbing those people. Quick. Say there's nothing to be done.
[101:31] C: There's nothing to be done.
[101:31] A: No. Hurry. Stop doing that. Home invasion. Quick. Hurry. Well, stop almost killing that guy. Hurry. Stop doing that. Why? Because it no longer exists.
[101:40] B: Right.
[101:42] A: And again, as it gets in, what do you notice?
[101:48] C: I feel better about myself. I feel better about who I've become.
[101:51] B: Yeah.
[101:53] A: Just think from that lens that you could he even imagined the one who was spiraling down that thing, thought he had killed somebody, the worst thing ever, and just started doing awful shit. Could that you back then even imagine where you are now? So let him know, like, show him you now. Show him how he got out of that hole. Show him that he got a gift of a restart. Show him what he's done with the gift of a restart. That's right. Hello. Right. Ah, it's like the person like, you know, because people screw up restarts, you know, I got a new liver. I'm gonna start drinking again. Yeah, you just got a new liver. What does that tell you? Maybe.
[102:42] C: Yeah, maybe you should slow down.
[102:45] A: Maybe the drinking thing is not good. Why'd you get a new liver? Because of drinking issues. Okay, good.
[102:49] C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I actually. I don't know. I took a step back, but I moved forward from there.
[102:57] A: You know, that's the thing every. So that's how the stock market works. People think that forward movement is just gradual. Always up, always towards.
[103:06] B: No, no, no, no.
[103:08] A: Because we're non linear. It goes. It drops back, it drops back further. It goes further. It changes one of these processes that doesn't go in a line linear, step by step fashion. It's unpredictable.
[103:22] C: Yeah, it is.
[103:23] A: The thing is just getting on track.
[103:25] B: Yeah, right, right.
[103:29] A: The problem isn't falling off track. The problem is not getting back on.
[103:36] C: Yeah, definitely.
[103:39] B: Right.
[103:40] A: Because I'm still going through it, I'm still organizing. But what you're gonna notice is with what we've done, dealing with the stressors, way better.
[103:49] C: Yeah.
[103:51] A: Dealing with the ongoing triggers, way better. So it's not causing the disruptions in you.
[103:59] C: Yeah, this was pretty awesome.
[104:03] A: Cool.
[104:03] B: I'm glad.
[104:04] C: Yeah. Yeah. I'm excited.
[104:12] B: Yeah.
[104:14] C: I'll have to practice this.
[104:15] A: I don't know. I don't know if you have to practice it. I think what you want to add are the breathing processes, not just in times of distress, but at lots of different times where you breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale and a little bit longer on the exhale. That's a huge process that you want to ongoingly do. But once somebody learns how to ride a bicycle, like, are we worried that they'll forget? So they've got to practice.
[104:57] B: All right.
[104:57] A: You go out and practice 20 minutes every day for the next. Once they get it, they got it. Can they become more proficient at it? Sure.
[105:08] B: Right.
[105:09] A: I first learned how to pedal. I just pedal.
[105:11] B: Right.
[105:12] A: Then I learned, you know, that, oh, if I pedal and I pull up at the same time, Then I'm pushing down and pulling up. I'm getting more force to the pedals. I can become more proficient. I don't have to worry about whether I get balance anymore because it's already changed. I got the distinction balance. When that happened, it changed because it wasn't at a. Remember it way.
[105:41] C: Yeah.
[105:42] A: It was at a nervous system, neuromuscular, skeletal system learning.
[105:48] C: Yeah.
[105:49] A: Makes sense.
[105:50] C: Really does.
[105:51] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[105:56] C: My mom would love you. That's what I've been thinking.
[106:06] A: How do you know she doesn't?
[106:09] C: Yeah.
[106:11] A: Where's mom now?
[106:14] C: I have 10. Okay. Well, I have three mothers. My birth mother's dead.
[106:19] B: Okay.
[106:22] A: Which mom were you referring to?
[106:26] C: My birth mother and my foster mother. She's. She's like a lot. She's really into Joe Dispenza and stuff like that.
[106:34] B: Oh, okay.
[106:35] C: And like, she would.
[106:37] A: She's out there then.
[106:38] C: She's way out there.
[106:39] A: Joe's pretty out there.
[106:40] C: He is out there.
[106:41] A: But Joe's got some crazy research. Hear one of the research he did?
[106:45] C: I've heard some of his stuff. Yeah.
[106:46] A: So there's research that they did where in the year 2000, they had people pray for people who were septic. They prayed for the people who were septic. They just had a sheet of people on a list and they prayed for them. And the people who were prayed for got better. More of them got better than the people who weren't prayed for.
[107:10] B: Right.
[107:10] A: That's kind of neat. They prayed in the year 2000. What they didn't know is that some of the people that they were praying for were in year 96, 97, 98, 99. And they got better by being prayed for in the year 2000. So Joe Dispenza, in the world of time is not past, present, future, all existing at the same. That's hard to wrap around.
[107:37] C: A lot of his stuff is. But he's really.
[107:41] B: Yeah. Neat stuff.
[107:42] C: It is.
[107:43] B: Yeah.
[107:43] A: Is that who you were trying to.
[107:44] C: Show me in the lobby?
[107:45] B: Oh, okay.
[107:46] A: We were talking about the shoes.
[107:47] C: She's like, I don't like him. He's weird.
[107:51] A: I haven't heard him yet, so I can't judge. He was in the book or in the movie the Secret a long time ago.
[107:58] C: Really?
[107:58] B: Yeah.
[107:59] A: The secret was, you know, how to cause life or be intentional, think it and manifest it kind of thing. But there's a problem with people who just purport. That is. Then you have to be thinking that the six or the seven year old kind of manifested that in their life somehow. There was Something that was going on that drew that person to do that stuff to you at 8. Yeah, no, no. See, that's where it becomes. That's where it loses its thing. Because if I have the. The ability to cause and create that I am the attractor factor that I make well, then I also have to take on the bad. And somehow I was doing something that. And you know what? That's not how it works.
[108:41] B: Yeah, no, that shit happens.
[108:45] A: Whether I, like, caused drew it to me.
[108:49] C: Absolutely.
[108:51] A: So we want to use stuff in the positive sometimes.
[108:54] C: Yeah.
[108:55] A: But what we're doing for you is you're becoming more present and the stuff that had been running you is getting unpleasant.
[109:01] B: Plugged in, clear.
[109:04] A: So it's a literal neural reset in the way your pathways run in your brain in response to the stuff. It's also a re education because what you're getting into the younger you is stuff that the younger you didn't know that you do know.
[109:23] B: Right.
[109:23] A: And so we're relearning in a re education is happening. So what I missed getting when I was younger is now getting put in.
[109:34] C: Yeah.
[109:35] A: Does that make sense? And it's getting put in by the person who matters most, which is you, and the person who knows best and who always has that younger you's best interest in mind.
[109:49] C: Absolutely.
[109:50] A: Got it.
[109:51] B: Yes.
[109:52] A: So you did great today.
[109:54] C: Thank you. Yeah, I feel great.
[109:56] B: Yeah.
[109:56] C: Really amazing. Thank you. Because this was not as hard as I thought it was going to be.
[110:02] B: Come on.
[110:03] A: You might be the last time. Did you really think it was going to be difficult?
[110:06] C: I. I doubt a lot.
[110:08] A: Come on. It went too. Difficult stuff, man.
[110:10] C: Yeah. You're a dude still. Yeah.
[110:12] A: You're still a dude.
[110:14] C: Yeah. No, this was. This was good.
[110:19] A: Yeah. Cool. Well, you're going to notice lots of stuff. You're going to notice it in a lot of different ways. So one of the ways you'll notice it is in the moment. I'll be in a situation that normally I'd be and I'm not. And I might in the moment think to myself, hey, normally I'd be and I'm not. Sometimes you'll go through a whole experience and then afterwards you'll be like, thinking about it, maybe talking to somebody about, hey, normally it would have been all. And I wasn't. So you'll notice it in those two ways for sure. You're going to notice it in terms of the intensity in which you get triggered to things. So the trigger might happen, but it won't go off as much.
[110:53] C: Okay.
[110:54] B: Right.
[110:54] A: It won't happen as often. It won't last as long. So the mountain that I used to have to climb over to get to the other side is now a speed bump.
[111:03] B: Okay.
[111:04] A: I don't like them.
[111:05] C: Yeah, no.
[111:06] A: But I'm beyond them pretty quick.
[111:09] C: Okay, got it.
[111:11] A: That's what you're gonna start noticing. And then in the new year, a few weeks ish from now, because I like people who out live life, we'll get back together for a follow up to be checking in with. What do you notice? What do you notice? And that's what you want to pay attention to, not what do I notice. That same and similar from how it's always been.
[111:30] C: Yeah.
[111:30] A: But what can I start to notice that's new and different for me? Just like you were in here going, wait a minute, I can kind of see more. Like I'm noticing more.
[111:38] B: Yeah, right.
[111:41] A: That's what we want you to pay attention to is what you can notice that's new and different for you in terms of how you're feeling and reacting and responding to stuff.
[111:49] C: Okay.
[111:50] B: Yeah.
[111:51] A: You did great today.
[111:52] C: Thank you.
[111:52] A: Good job.
[111:53] C: Thank you so much.
[111:53] A: All right, we'll be done for now. Look at that.
