[00:00] A: Cool. So today is the 16th of October, Alayna. This is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful, transformative, valuable, it might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:15] B: Yep.
[00:16] A: Okay, cool. So first lens to come from. We normally say that stuff, those things. This person makes me feel this way. Right. That lens is not wrong. It just gives us this much power because from that lens we can either try to change it or we can try to avoid it. But you've already discovered there's some stuff I can't change and other things I can't completely avoid and a whole bunch of bad shit that I can't get to have not happened. So we gotta do something else. Where I'm coming in is about adjusting how your emotional brain, not your logical brain, not even the part of the brain that you think of as I. Part of the brain that you would think of itself.
[00:52] B: Mm.
[00:53] A: We want to get that part of your brain to work more in the way that you want it to naturally. Right. So when a lion approaches a zebra, we all would agree lion makes zebra scared. But looking from the other lens, we go, no. Isn't it actually when the zebra itself sees senses, feels, smells, things. Lions coming. It's zebra's brain, not lion.
[01:12] B: Yeah.
[01:13] A: That's making zebra alert, motivated, stronger. We do call that scared. Yes. It does run away.
[01:18] B: Yeah.
[01:18] A: And of course, it's doing it in response to the lion approaching. But it's a zebra's brain.
[01:23] B: Mm.
[01:24] A: Got it. From that lens. There's ways in which your brain has been working that causes you to feel bad. By bad or meaning the guilty feelings. By bad or meaning the flashes, the bad dreams. By bad or meaning just underneath the surface that kind of can't see, waiting for the other shoe to drop. By bad. The staying in stuff where people aren't treating me the way that I know I want to be.
[01:41] B: Yeah.
[01:41] A: Or if I do get somebody that's do all of that to you in response to the stuff past or current or future. But you recognize that way of your brain working has been problematic. This is the issue we want to get addressed so that it stops.
[01:56] B: Yeah.
[01:57] A: Got it. So from the lens that your brain makes you feel bad. First question. Do you really think it wants you to feel bad?
[02:03] B: No.
[02:04] A: Do you think it would want you to feel good? Right. Most people think we don't want you to feel good. Most people go, yeah, of course. But no, see the crazy part, what we've discovered is you're a bright gal, I'm a pretty bright guy. But the majority of our emotional brain works like an animal.
[02:18] B: Yeah.
[02:18] A: Animals brains don't promote feelings because their brain is concerned about their mood or their esteem or their sense of self worth or whether they're confident or whether they feel good enough or lovable. It causes emotion to motivate them to do something, to get something to stop, to solve the problem. It's that simple. When the rabbit sees the fox, the brain makes it experience fear. Not because it wanted it to have a bad day, but to make it run away.
[02:41] B: Yeah.
[02:42] A: Squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire pain. But not because the brain of the squirrel wants the squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid dumb idiot because it was careless and got too close to the fire. Now all the other squirrels are going to laugh at me because I'm marred. No, just get tail out of the fire. So the crazy part for us to even consider is all of the negative emotions we experience. The hurt, the anger, the sadness, the grief, the guilt, the shame, the pain, the angers, the upsets, the worries. They're all caused by the part of our brain that works like an animal. Same purpose, motivate us, do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. Here's the glitch. Many times our brain continues to make us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. Which is why over and over, we feel bad about the same things. Good news. Many of the shit that we feel bad about are in time periods that either haven't happened or are already finished. So we don't need to solve it. What we need to update the timing. That's the error. And the error is timing. Because we have an intellectual brain that gives us time. It's why you can know about how long it took you to drive down here. You can remember the concert you went to. You can think about something you're gonna go do later this week. No other animal can do that.
[03:53] B: Yeah.
[03:54] A: Which is not a problem if it's positive.
[03:56] B: Yeah.
[03:56] A: Or if it's neutral. Because positive or neutral things, our brain also distinguishes the difference between the memory of it and it. Yeah, right. Let's say somebody tells us about a trip that they had to Key West. They took the boat from Fort Myers, right. They went down there, they had a great time. They, you know, walked up and down Duval Street. They, you know, went to Hemingway's house. They took Their picture next to the sign that said, 90 miles from Cuba. They wrote on a cute little moped, right? They tell us about the whole thing. And we know that they know the difference between the memory of doing it and doing it. That's clear. The problem is when something's negative, big negative, little negative, long time ago negative, when I was a young child, recent negative, one time occurrence, multiple occurrences. Any of the negative experiences, the weird, the bad, the scary, the awful, the confusing, the upsetting, the horrific, the catastrophic, the traumatic. Our brain confuses the memory, the data, the info, thinking it's the experience. That's why the person has the reaction. So the guy's telling us about getting mugged 12 years ago when he was in Oklahoma City, of all places, right? He gets to the part where the guy come up behind him, grabbed him by the collars, got a knife next to his throat and goes, if you even breathe, I'm gonna slip. This guy's face goes white, his voice is choked, his arms are trembling, he's got tears. We're nice, we were kindly listening, what the fuck is happening? And we all go, oh, he's reliving it. But what's really happening, Elena, is that part of his brain emotionally, is confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience.
[05:24] B: Okay?
[05:25] A: That's why he's having that reaction, which we can tell is affecting him when he was talking to us and telling us about it, because we saw. Yeah, but you know, it was affecting him even over the weekend when he was watching football with his buddies.
[05:36] B: Yeah.
[05:37] A: Who was under the surface up here. He knows he's safe. He survived. He's with us. There's no knife. He's okay.
[05:43] B: Yeah.
[05:43] A: Problem is, part of his brain never got that good news. Yeah, that's the first error. Second error is we were all trained to believe when we were young, impressionable children, one lied to by adults, people in authority, that life is good and that good things happen when I'm good. And that when I'm good, I'll get to live happily ever after. And the story of Santa reinforces the message, good things happen when I'm good. I get hugs, I get candy, I get praise, I get cookies. Some guy I don't know drops off gifts. Good things happen when I'm good. Which is great for that child and for the rest of their life, everything is always good. Never met anybody where life has been nothing but good.
[06:25] B: Yeah. No, I haven't either. Lying, right?
[06:30] A: We all have had fucked up stuff happen to us. Some people more than others. Some People in different ways or bigger ways. Yeah, but not a single one of us goes through the human experience without having something awful. And the problem isn't that we told kids life is good and when they're good, their life will be good. It's that the reverse must be true. If it's bad, it must be my fault.
[06:50] B: Mm.
[06:50] A: If it's bad, it's because I did something wrong.
[06:53] B: Yeah.
[06:53] A: So the kids parents get divorced and dad's no longer around. The little kid doesn't go, oh, my dad's a drunken alcoholic. That's why he's not around. Loser. No. Kid goes, if I was more lovable.
[07:03] B: Mm.
[07:03] A: If I mattered more, if I was worth it, my dad would be around. Right. Still feels like me.
[07:08] B: Yeah.
[07:08] A: Right. The kid's supposed to play in the All Star baseball game. Dad said, I'm coming. He never shows. Kid doesn't. Right. He's on a drunken bender.
[07:15] B: Yeah.
[07:16] A: No. Kid goes, see, if I really matter to my dad, if I was lovable, if he really cared, if I was worth caring, he would be here. Right. The girl goes out with her co worker's best friend. He's great. They had a great time. He's nice enough to drop her off at the apartment. He walks her to the door. She even gives him a kiss. He's like, oh, I'm so sorry. I really have to use the restroom. She's not gonna be a bitch. Oh, sure, go ahead and use the restroom.
[07:39] B: Yeah.
[07:40] A: She had no idea that once he came out of the restroom, he was gonna force himself on her and rape her, which is fucking horrible.
[07:45] B: Yeah.
[07:46] A: But nobody's shocked when she's blaming herself for having been so stupid and careless and putting herself in that dumb situation. She definitely should have known better. Yes. You should be thinking that your co worker's best friend is gonna do that. Yeah, I know, but because it's bad, it's my fault. Makes sense. So that's the second part. That's what's escalating. All the guilt.
[08:06] B: Yeah.
[08:07] A: Got it. And then the third thing is, once those two things are stuck, my brain is vigilant and sensitive, and it's looking for anything that's similar.
[08:13] B: Yeah.
[08:14] A: To anything that I went through that was painful. The problem is that similar is right as seen. So the dramatic example is the soldier who dies on the ground when the firework burst. But not because he doesn't know it's the 4th of July. He was at a fireworks celebration. He's the guy that lit it.
[08:30] B: Yeah.
[08:31] A: It's because a Completely different. Part of his brain confused the sound.
[08:35] B: Yeah.
[08:35] A: Thought it was a grenade. Could be a tone of voice, could be a tone of year, could be a scent. Right. I remember this girl that I worked with. She had a horrible thing. She was jogging through the park, of all things. Right. Not even at night. Like it might have been dusk. Some guy tackled her and raped her. Now, he happened to be wearing a shirt that said AC DC on it. I can't stand the band. Now we know that the issue for her when that awful thing was happening was not the name on the shirt. That is not the part that bothered her.
[09:05] B: Yeah.
[09:07] A: What he was doing. Totally did.
[09:09] B: Yeah.
[09:09] A: But because they happened at the same time, they got stuck and merged. Right. So some of them we're going to be consciously aware of. A lot of it's running in the background that I don't even know that I don't know. Yeah, but they're all triggers, right? It's kind of like, why do I allow myself to be treated in ways that I don't want to be treated yet? I'm still in it.
[09:30] B: Yeah. Yeah. It's annoying, right?
[09:32] A: Like, know better, right? I don't want to be tricked. Or. Now I'm being treated and I say, all right, when is it really gonna. Okay, so when is he gonna start being an asshole? Cuz like, I know it's just a matter of time.
[09:45] B: Yep.
[09:49] A: So we want the effect the stuff has had cleared because those three pieces have one common denominator distortion. And what I mean by that is if I took my hand and I scratch in the sand and I picked it up, it would leave an imprint. But is the imprint the same thing as my hand?
[10:06] B: No.
[10:07] A: No. My hand is very different than the thing that got left there.
[10:10] B: Yeah.
[10:10] A: Right. Is the meaning at all what happened? Did she put herself in danger? Did she let the guy use the bathroom? Right. How different is a firework from a grenade? So where therapy got it wrong is they thought that we had to dig up the bad feelings and get the bad feelings out of us. Like throwing up, which you know what, after throwing up, I've done it before. I do feel a little bit better. The problem is that we get re triggered by the same bullshit.
[10:38] B: Yeah.
[10:39] A: So instead of trying to get bad feelings out, we want to do the reverse, which is get good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know certain awful moments ended. We literally want to unplug the memory so the brain can read what happened as data about something that happened. I still don't like it, but it's no longer being experienced as happening.
[11:03] B: Yeah. Does that make sense?
[11:07] A: Right. And that's the crazy part, because in other circumstances, our brain can distinguish the difference between the memory of it and the experience of it. Like, silly one, like you put on like, you know, yoga pants today, right? And you can probably even remember where you were when you put them on.
[11:25] B: Yeah.
[11:26] A: But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your pants on, and then I went, alayna, stop putting on your pants, you'd look at me and go, I'm not putting on my pants. Just because I can remember doing it does not mean that I'm doing it now. That's crystal clear. Where all the error is, is that the memory of what happened and the experience, experience of it happening have been glued. So they're living as if they're the same thing.
[11:52] B: Yeah.
[11:53] A: So we're gonna use that silly pattern of association game to help unplug effect so it stops causing it. Does that make sense?
[12:04] B: Yeah.
[12:04] A: Right. And then we're gonna do another silly thing because we're gonna do something with memories. Because people only go memory to worst part of it.
[12:11] B: Yeah.
[12:12] A: Right. It's not connected to anything later that was more enjoyable. But we know that even the things recently, a few years ago, and then long time stuff that happened, we know that there have been things after it that you've done that were more enjoyable than those moments.
[12:25] B: Yeah, Right.
[12:27] A: So we actually have good news to get in to the part of the brain that doesn't know certain moments ended. Makes sense. And that's what we're gonna do. That's why I find this very different than therapy, which is, oh, we gotta process and I don't feel better. Right. Somebody can do a lot of processing and like in the moment, okay. But then they leave. And now like all of a sudden, just like you had to go to talk to Homeland. Right. And then all of a sudden after that, like in it, like, and then afterwards, I'm like.
[12:59] B: Yeah, it's actually funny because my boyfriend came with me down here, like, whatever. And he was like, he's like, he's like, I don't get there. But he was like, he's like, I saw what it meant did to you last night. He had to talk about. He's like, you have to talk about it all over again. And I'm like, I was like, probably. I was like, just be prepared for a shit show when you pick me up today. He was like, he's like, he's like, why, if you have trouble.
[13:19] A: Why are we doing this?
[13:20] B: He's like, why do they keep making you talk about. He's like, it's not good. I don't know. That's what he says.
[13:25] A: And that's the problem is that they keep making you talk about it, which has you re experience it.
[13:31] B: Yeah.
[13:31] A: What we're going to do is something very different. We're going to unplug it. Because what we want to get into the part of the brain that doesn't know yet is the really good news that I survived. I've defeated it. I'm okay. I'm here now. It's over.
[13:45] B: Yeah.
[13:46] A: It no longer exists. I do. That no longer exists. Right. So that's where. When you defeat something, you defeat it because you're standing and it no longer exists. That's the news that we want to get into. The part that doesn't know. Yeah, Got it. So where we're headed is the you who's present whose emotions are matching what's happening, who has flexibility in how she responds, Sometimes in a compassionate way, sometimes in a very matter of fact or firm way. Sometimes she just lets it go by because there's nothing for her to do or say. She's seeing other people's garbage as being about them. The impact that the past stuff has had has been cleared. So it's no longer weighing on her. The you that I am seeing is much more comfortable in her own skin. She's lighter and easier on herself. This is where we're headed. And again, the question isn't how it's going to happen. The question is, would it be okay?
[14:43] B: Yeah.
[14:44] A: Right. You've got the green light. So then all we do next is we put your body into the right states for healing. And we use neuroscience brain levers that are designed to put your body in a state of rest. And the reason it's rest is because that's what accelerates healing. Colds, flus, and surgery. What do we tell people to do?
[15:02] B: Rest.
[15:03] A: Right. So we've got some levers. One is really silly. It's the first one we use. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. So I don't mean like, ah, I mean just a little bit. When you slightly lower your jaw, it activates a nerve called vagal nerve, which is connected to the vital organs in the body. Starts to move the body into parasympathetic. So you're gonna slightly lower your jaw. Second lever is you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. When you rest your tongue at the bottom of your Mouth. It starts to cause a satiated, meaning a calming feeling in the body and helps to turn down some of our internal dialogue. So you slightly lower your jaw and you rest your tongue. And then the third lever is you begin to breathe. But this time it's intentional. Notice how most of the time you're breathing, you're not paying any attention at all. It's like happening for you, right? This time your breathing is going to be more intentional, so you're going to cause it to happen in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale and then a little bit longer on the exhale than how you normally breathe. So you slightly lower your down jaw.
[16:12] B: Okay.
[16:13] A: You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. And now you begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer. Right. And as you're breathing in this slightly slower and deeper way, exhaling a little bit longer, just begin to check inside. And how's your body beginning to feel now? Like more tense or more calm?
[16:42] B: Calm.
[16:43] A: Isn't that kind of cool, how that works? Now the next lever is really interesting. Remember how we talked about how when we're tense, nervous and anxious, we're like this. Well, that's what happens when our beta waves get elevated. So different bands of information exist at different brainwave states. And for waking states, we're typically in beta waves. So they're good for focus, concentration, they're good for conversation and communication. They're good for things like arithmetic or crossword puzzles. Right. But when beta waves get elevated, meaning they run at a much higher hertz. It's where all anxiety, agitation, worry, angst, upset, fear, guilt or shame, all live. And it literally causes a tunneling down of our rigid. We want to move your brain waves down. And alpha waves. Alpha waves are highly correlated with what surfers like to call flow, meaning they're just kind of going with the flow of the waves. Right. Like they can't fight waves. Right. Surfers, not.
[17:42] B: Yeah, right.
[17:43] A: A surfer learns how to ride the wave. Right. So it's like a flow state or what athletes call being in the zone. So it's alert, but it's relaxed. And what it means is we open up our field of vision so that we notice more with our peripheral vision. So how it works is again, you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, you begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and exhale in a way that's a little bit longer as you're breathing in this way, you can look across and see me in my nose. You're going to stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers. You stay looking at my nose. Nose as my fingers go out wide and with the sides of your eyes begin to pick up my fingers wiggling so that you're looking at my nose, but you can see the wiggling. And as you do this, Elena, you'll notice more space towards the side windows and doors. You'll notice the space between us and the space that's beyond me. You'll notice the space underneath you, in the space behind you, and even the space above your head. And as you're noticing more and more of this space, again, check inside. How's your body feeling now?
[18:59] B: Good. Isn't that interesting how that works?
[19:02] A: Right? And then the last little lever. Have you ever heard the phrase maybe used it yourself? I'm under a lot of stress.
[19:08] B: Yeah. All the time. Every damn day. I'm so tired. Every day I'm exhausted.
[19:14] A: Here's a funny thing. In order for somebody to be underneath stress, where must stress be? Well, watch. Isn't it weird? So in order for me to crawl underneath the bed, where is the bed in relationship to me?
[19:36] B: Above me?
[19:36] A: Yes. Have you ever noticed it feels like a weight? Yeah, feels like a weight. So we want the reversals. We want to get you out from under so that you rise up above it. Having a different metaphor. It's called a bird's eye view. Okay, we know what a bird's eye view means. I'm up above, able to see everything being underneath and below me. Because I'm over it all. Yeah, got it. So the last little part is again, you slightly lower your jaw. You rest your time. You breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper. Notice, exhale becomes a little bit longer as you're breathing in this way you can look across and see me and my nose. You stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers, they move all the way out. And with the sides of your eyes, you begin to pick up the wiggling. You notice the space towards the side windows and doors. The space between you and me in the space beyond, underneath and behind. In this space above. And how the space literally goes beyond this room, all the way out in every direction. The space is truly unending. All the way towards outer space and beyond. As you begin to notice the space, go ahead and close your eyes. And then imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling. And the roof so that you rise way up above it all in the sky. Having this bird's eye view of seeing everything as being underneath and below you. Because you're above and over it all. And not just a perch bird, a bird that's soaring through the space of the sky. Moving freely in any direction and in all ways, with maybe these big wide archives reaching turns, these long rolling, moving, flying, soaring, gliding free, above and over it. All right, bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside you. And then when you're ready, you'll take a nice big deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And again, those short moments, eyes were closed, what were you noticing within yourself?
[21:59] B: Relaxed.
[22:00] A: Isn't that cool? And so as your body staying relaxed, the other part of your brain, your unconscious, is going to travel back. See, your unconscious is literally a warehouse of everything you've gone through. The good, the bad, the ugly. And it also knows which moments left imprints, which experiences out of. Would be useful to bring to your awareness so that we can unplug and clear. And just like a rock dropping into the center of a calm lake would send ripples out. As we clear one moment, it'll start to lessen the impact of others so that as we get a constellation, constellation meaning a few of several different. It will rewire how your brain has that information coded, which is coded as happening. It'll be coding it as information about something that happened. And then what you know, which isn't my fault, will actually feel. So I get it clearly enough.
[22:56] B: Yeah, got it.
[22:59] A: Because that's really what we're changing is we're changing it in here, right? Because it doesn't matter what I knew. If I don't feel it, I can't get in. Right, Got it. Okay, so one more time. You slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue. You breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper. As you do, your eyes begin to notice more space. Right? You can close your eyes. As they do, they rest. As eyes rest, you rest. Imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body. Beyond the ceiling, the roof, so that you rise way up above it all in the sky. Having the bird's eye view of seeing everything as being underneath and below you. Because you're above and over it all. Free to be becoming even more okay in you. Free to be lightening up, more and more at peace, more and more connected to who you really are, which was never what happened to you, or even the stuff you did, who you are, is so much more than all of that. And because your unconscious knows more than you do and I do on how to heal itself, it knows which experiences would be useful to bring to your awareness for us to clear. So that as you bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate, take a nice deep breath in and a long exhale out, your unconscious travels back and will bring a moment to your awareness for us to clear. And as that moment comes to mind, you can open your eyes. Good. And we got one. The moment that just came to mind happened about home long ago.
[24:53] B: Probably like 15 years. No, 10 years ago.
[24:56] A: 10 years ago. Right. Good. So the feeling, as you think about it, is a feeling of. What is it? Hurt, Sadness. Anger. Grief. Guilt. Shame. Resentment. Regret. Remorse. Combination.
[25:05] B: All of it.
[25:06] A: So first question, would it be okay to get it going?
[25:09] B: Yeah.
[25:10] A: And if that was no longer causing any disruption, any discomfort at all, does it in any way, shape or form mean what you went through is okay?
[25:17] B: No.
[25:17] A: Good. So you get to be okay, even though that wasn't. So, as I said, really simple. You're going to intend to be with me. My job, by the way, is to keep you with me. And I have lots of different ways that are not keeping you.
[25:27] B: Yeah, I'm always all over the place.
[25:28] A: Got it. So you're going to intend to emotionally be here because this is. And that isn't. We're working towards this goal. And 3m more fun. If it happened 10 years ago. There have been other things you've done after that that were more enjoyable than that. What's one thing you've done anytime from when that ended until yesterday that was more enjoyable than that?
[25:45] B: Fishing. Yeah.
[25:46] A: Going fishing? Way more enjoyable than that. Good.
[25:48] B: Something else? Cooking.
[25:52] A: Cooking, like what? Making what?
[25:54] B: Soup.
[25:54] A: Soup. Cooking soup. Way more enjoyable than that. One other thing.
[25:58] B: Going scuba diving.
[25:59] A: Yeah, going scuba diving. All those things happen after that. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond that. So we have really good news to get in. Got it. So when that particular moment happened. When it happened, you were aware.
[26:14] B: Like. What do you mean? Like.
[26:15] A: So you were about how old and you were where when it happened?
[26:17] B: 16.
[26:18] A: So you're about 16 and you might have been. Where were you? So you're at high school. Good. Was it like in the school or out of the school?
[26:24] B: Both.
[26:25] A: So this particular moment, did it happen while you were in the school or after school? Or after school? So it was after school. Right. So you would been at school. Right. And so this was a weekday.
[26:36] B: Yeah.
[26:37] A: Right. And then you had left school and you went where? So you went home. Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[26:43] B: Snuck out.
[26:44] A: So then you snuck out. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[26:46] B: Then went to this party.
[26:47] A: So you went to the party. Right. Good. Then what happened? So you're at a party, like in the woods or at somebody's house.
[26:52] B: Someone's house.
[26:52] A: Right. Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[26:54] B: Took Molly.
[26:56] A: Yeah. So you took Molly. Right.
[26:57] B: Good.
[26:57] A: And then what happened next?
[26:58] B: You got raped by, like four people.
[26:59] A: Then you took Molly. Then those four people took you into a room.
[27:02] B: Yeah.
[27:02] A: Right. And then they pulled your clothes off. And then they pulled their down. Right. And then they put their penises in different parts of your body.
[27:08] B: Yeah.
[27:08] A: Right. Some of that might have felt good. Some of it might have been really weird. Some of them would have been uncomfortable. Right. And then what happened next?
[27:14] B: Everybody at school found out.
[27:15] A: Well, then they stopped.
[27:16] B: Yeah.
[27:17] A: Right. And then they pulled their clothes back on. And then you had your clothes back on. Right. And then eventually you left the party. And then the next day you'd gone to school and people were talking about how you had done those four guys.
[27:27] B: Yeah.
[27:27] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[27:29] B: Felt like shit about myself.
[27:30] A: Right. But then what happened?
[27:31] B: Guilty.
[27:32] A: Well, no, but then what happened? Those are all feelings. Then what happened? Well, you probably finished the school day.
[27:36] B: Yeah.
[27:37] A: Right. And then you went home, and then that was over. Right. And then maybe I said a few other times throughout that. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like going fishing or making soup.
[27:46] B: Yeah.
[27:47] A: Scuba diving. Now, notice as you were telling me about it, there was discomfort.
[27:50] B: Yeah.
[27:51] A: Not because that was such a yucky moment and it was already a little less because you're intending to be with me. Isn't that crazy?
[27:56] B: Yeah. Harder. Remember? Honestly, sometimes.
[27:59] A: Here's the crazy part. We never go backwards with a memory. We only go forward. But when you go backwards, it literally unplugs it. It takes away the charge. So watch what happens. So we got scuba diving. We got making soup. We got going fishing. And then you would finish school. Right. And then people had said, oh, my goodness, you had done that stuff with those four guys. Right. And then you'd probably gone home. Right. And then you left. And then you had your clothes on. And then they had pulled their clothes on. And then before that, they had their penises in different parts of your body. Right. And then they put you in that room. Right. And then you had done The Molly. And then you'd gone to the party.
[28:31] B: Yeah.
[28:32] A: And then you'd snuck out, and then you'd gone back home. Right. And then you'd heard about the party, and then you were at school, and then before that, you were probably back home. Right. And as I go through it backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it different? I know. Isn't that crazy?
[28:47] B: Doesn't sound as bad. I don't know why, but it doesn't. Even though it still is.
[28:52] A: It's becoming more data.
[28:53] B: Yeah.
[28:54] A: Information about something that happened versus happening.
[28:58] B: Yeah.
[28:59] A: Third, remember, emotional brain doesn't get logic. It gets patterns of association. Right. And the pattern of association is that the memory and the experience have been glued. But just like you can remember putting your pants on today, you know that you're not doing it. Right. You can remember them doing that.
[29:14] B: Yeah.
[29:14] A: You can remember sneaking out, going to the party, doing the Molly. You can remember them doing that stuff to your body. You can remember all that happening. You can remember the people saying the stuff the next day. You also can remember putting on your pants.
[29:23] B: Yeah.
[29:24] A: Elena, stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants. Say that.
[29:27] B: You're not putting on my pants.
[29:28] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you're not putting on your shirt.
[29:30] B: You're not putting on your shirt.
[29:31] A: Well, then stop them from doing that. See, they're not doing that.
[29:33] B: They're not doing.
[29:33] A: Well, then you stop putting on your jacket. Say, I'm not putting on my jacket. Well, stop me from putting on my pants. Say you're not putting on your pants. Say that.
[29:40] B: Not putting what?
[29:41] A: You. Say you're not putting on your pants.
[29:43] B: I'm not putting on my pants.
[29:44] A: Well, then stop them from telling all those people. Say they're not telling all those people.
[29:47] B: They're not telling all those people.
[29:48] A: Well, then stop it from happening. Say it's not happening.
[29:50] B: It's not happening.
[29:51] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[29:52] B: No longer exists.
[29:53] A: Bingo. Right. And as that starts to get in, what do you notice happening to those feelings?
[29:59] B: Lighter. A little bit.
[30:00] A: It is. All right. You're right, by the way, that earlier, you also didn't know that when she went to the party and did the Molly, that that was gonna happen. Because let's just check for a moment, because there's been bad feelings over, like, hey, maybe I shouldn't have gone to the party. Maybe I shouldn't have done the Molly. Maybe I shouldn't have drank or whatever it was else that I did. There Right. Well, let's just check. If you had known at 16 that by going to the party and doing the Molly and doing whatever else that you did that that thing was going to happen, would you have done the Molly?
[30:26] B: No.
[30:27] A: Would you have gone to the party?
[30:30] B: No, if I do, I wouldn't.
[30:33] A: Right, right, right. But see back then that earlier years, you didn't know that. And see from here, you've been looking at earlier you going, idiot.
[30:40] B: Yeah.
[30:41] A: You should have known better. Got it. So we want to lighten up on that earlier you. Because she didn't know last part. That earlier you has also been thinking that that happening to you had something to do with you. Did it?
[30:56] B: No.
[30:57] A: Right. Would it have mattered other as you or another girl that had taken Molly with those guys? Isn't that what they would have done?
[31:04] B: Yeah.
[31:05] A: Follow me with that. Would it have mattered whether it was you in the situation or somebody else? Right. So it had nothing to do with you. It had everything to do with what was off with them.
[31:14] B: Yeah.
[31:15] A: Right. But see, back then you didn't know that. So why don't you repeat these four words? Ready? Here we go. It's. It's not. Not about.
[31:23] B: About me.
[31:25] A: Right? It's not. Say that again.
[31:26] B: Not about me.
[31:27] A: That's right. Good. Now close your eyes. Picture the earlier you. Let her know that that moment is over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists. Let her know that that happening and nothing to do with you had everything to do with what was screwed up with them. It's not about me. Let her know that you know now that if she had known it was gonna lead to that, she certainly wouldn't have gone to the party. So that she gets it. That you get it. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about scuba diving and. And fishing and making soup. Let her know so that she gets it. And as this earlier you is getting it, what do you notice happening to her face?
[32:02] B: Lightening up.
[32:03] A: It is, isn't it? Right. And you can open your eyes. Isn't that cool?
[32:07] B: Yeah.
[32:08] A: Notice how now as you were thinking about it, we still don't like that they did it.
[32:11] B: Yeah. Emotional.
[32:13] A: Yeah. But notice how it's not emotional and sadness right now.
[32:16] B: I don't know. It feels weird. I don't know what I feel like.
[32:19] A: We just checked. Check if it's sadness.
[32:21] B: Yeah.
[32:22] A: Or is it of relief?
[32:23] B: Relief? Yeah. I don't feel sad. I just feel relief.
[32:28] A: You do, don't you?
[32:29] B: Right.
[32:29] A: Because for the first time ever, your brain is getting that it's Data.
[32:33] B: Yeah.
[32:34] A: About something that happened. It was always causing the discomfort crazily enough, trying to motivate you to get it to stop. Because it never knew that it stopped.
[32:44] B: Yep.
[32:45] A: Got it. In the moment that a rabbit is running for its life, Fox is chasing after it. There are no thoughts in the rabbit's mind about carrots. There are no thoughts in the rabbit's mind about the rendezvous it had with the cute bunny the next morning. In that moment that it's running for its life, it's fox without end. In the moment that that was going, it lived as if it was perpetually ongoing. Yeah, Right. Even those other people saying that stuff about you at school, did that have anything to do with you?
[33:17] B: No.
[33:17] A: Right. What did it matter whether it was you or somebody else?
[33:20] B: No.
[33:20] A: Right. The kid drops the tray in the cafeteria. As he trips and falls, and it splatters everywhere. And now everybody's laughing.
[33:26] B: Yeah.
[33:27] A: He wants Harry Potter's invisibility cloak. Let me get the hell out of here. He's feeling. They're all laughing at me. But are they? Would it have mattered? There's that kid or anything other kid in the school having the same accident. Got it. So what's getting in is that thing had nothing to do with you. Right? And if that earlier, you had known that that's what it was going to lead to, she clearly wouldn't have gone. Or if she had gone to the party, she wouldn't have done that.
[33:52] B: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
[33:57] A: Yeah. Got it. It's that she didn't. She didn't know. Makes sense. That wasn't even on the radar screen. It wasn't like, oh, you know, I'm gonna go to this party, right? And then while I'm at this party, I'm gonna do Molly so that later on I can be raped by five guys. Because, you know, at 16, that's what I was hoping for.
[34:18] B: Yeah. No, not at all.
[34:25] A: That wouldn't even have shown up as a. Yeah. So that's what's gonna happen. Like, that wasn't even on the radar screen. Makes sense, right? In the last little part, that earlier you thought that they messed with you.
[34:38] B: Mm.
[34:39] A: But did they mess with you? I know it feels that way.
[34:42] B: Yeah.
[34:42] A: But I want you to get a thought for a moment, right? You have a body. Your body's totally yours. Right. But is your body actually you? It's a weird thought. I say that only because my mom lost the tip of her index in a snow cone machine when she was, like, 19. Crazy accident, right? But when she Visits people. Now, they don't say to her, hey, Susie, I'm glad almost all of you could come over. They don't say that to her. Why? Because she's all there. Even if that part of her body is missing. Your body's yours, but it isn't you. There's not a single part of your body right now that's the same as it was when that happened back then. Every single cell within your body has been replaced millions of times.
[35:23] B: Yeah.
[35:24] A: Got it. So we know that you have a body. Your body's totally yours, but it isn't actually you.
[35:29] B: Yeah.
[35:30] A: Now we go, well, if you're not your body, then are you your thoughts? We go, no, you're not even the thinker of them. Your brain is the thinker of your thoughts, and your brain is an organ that you have, not actually you. So you're not your brain, you're not your thoughts, you're not your body. Oh. Maybe you're how you feel, but you feel different ways at different times.
[35:48] B: Yeah.
[35:49] A: Sometimes happy, sometimes sad, sometimes angry, sometimes glad. But you're still you, regardless of how you're feeling. So you're not a feeling. Oh, maybe you're what you do, but you've done different things at different times. When you stop doing that thing to do this thing, you didn't stop existing.
[36:02] B: Mm.
[36:02] A: So the weirder question becomes, if you're not what you do, or your thoughts or your feelings or your body, then what the heck are you? That's weird, right?
[36:10] B: Yeah.
[36:11] A: So just for a moment, thinking, think of a time when you were outdoors in nature and you see something and it's just beautiful. Right. Like, you're looking at it and it's like, wow, what is it that you see?
[36:22] B: Waterfall.
[36:23] A: Hiking isn't the moment that you're seeing the waterfall. You're feeling all that peace, wonder, excitement, all at the same time. And people would say to you, well, darling, that seeing the waterfall is going to give you the feeling. But if we looked at it differently, we could say that being there and experiencing it simply drew your awareness in towards your center. Because at your center, you are peaceful and excited. Kind of like if I take my hands towards the fire because I'm cold, and I bring them in and I go, my goodness, the fire is getting hotter. Is it? You go, no, you're becoming more aware of it because your hands are getting closer. So we know that in life, your awareness has been different places. Anywhere but your sense.
[37:03] B: Yeah.
[37:04] A: The upsets, the stressors, the angers, but always at your center your peaceful and excited. Just like, you know, two of us are in here. How do you know that? That's intellectual knowledge. They call light of knowledge at your center. It's brighter light of wisdom, right? So I work with all sorts of people. That yucky stuff. I remember one girl, older brother, Matchbox cars, drive them up for, like, park them. So she had a lot of yuck. But we cleared it, like, all of the upset, the pain, the guilt, the shame, gone. And I had to ask her the question, all that. I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone. I don't feel it. I go, I know. I go, but the question was, where was it? And we started thinking. I go, was it surface? She's like, it wasn't intellectual. I go, was it center? She's like, really? How could that survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited? I go, well, then, where was it? She goes, ah, it was hiding in the shadows, the distortion between the lights that are now touching. And I went, whoa, that is cool. And then we started talking about how people screw up identity all the time. You know, they come into my office, they go, I'm bipolar, I'm depressed, I'm borderline, I'm ocd. They think the way they feel is who they are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm upset, and you go, why? I go, you'll never believe what he did, you know, what did he do? Well, first he put me on a chair and my head went down. You're like, yeah, you're at the dentist. I go, then he shined a light in my eyes. I can't see him. Yeah, but you're at the dentist. I go, well, then he took a cold instrument and shoved it inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness. And you're what? I'm into my mouth. I'm at the dentist. But it's the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother. When you were little, he messed with your stuff. And she's like, he did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings. And then she looked at me with this, like, powerful light. She goes, you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body, but he never got me because I can't be touched in that way. And I went, whoa, that is pretty cool. So I'm going to show you something, because those guys, those boys that did that thing to you, messed with your stuff, but they didn't actually touch you, who you really are. I'll show you. Take your hand, hold it out like that. I want you to look at that spot right there. As you look at that spot, bring my hand close to your hand. So I'm going to take it out here. You can see it moving in. It's not going to touch your hand, but you're going to notice that as it gets closer to your hand, notice how you can begin to feel it, right? You can feel the warmth and the energy from my hand, which means I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with a response. Respect and only be touched, you know, when it's an intimate partnership with the love that you allow in. Right? I'm coming closer to touching who you are. So you can repeat these words after me. I have a nose.
[39:49] B: I have a nose.
[39:50] A: I have 10 fingers.
[39:51] B: I have 10 fingers, two elbows, two.
[39:52] A: Elbows and 10 toes.
[39:54] B: 10 toes.
[39:54] A: And I'm not my elbows.
[39:55] B: I'm not my elbows.
[39:56] A: I'm not my fingers.
[39:57] B: I'm not my fingers.
[39:58] A: I'm not my nose.
[39:59] B: I'm not my nose.
[39:59] A: Or my toes.
[40:00] B: Or my toes.
[40:01] A: I have an ass.
[40:01] B: I have an ass, not my ass. I'm not my ass.
[40:04] A: It's mine. It's not me.
[40:06] B: It's not me.
[40:06] A: Right? So they mess with my stuff, right? And they hurt my feelings and it screwed up my thinking. But they never touched who I really am. They never got me. So say that they never touched who I really am.
[40:18] B: They never touched who I really am.
[40:20] A: They never touched me.
[40:21] B: They never touched me.
[40:22] A: They mess with my stuff.
[40:23] B: They mess with my stuff.
[40:24] A: They never got me.
[40:25] B: They never got me.
[40:26] A: Got a deep breath in and then let that arm go. Go down. Right?
[40:32] B: Right, Right.
[40:34] A: Yeah. So just checking inside. What are you noticing?
[40:37] B: Just kind of like relief a little bit, Right?
[40:40] A: One more time, close your eyes and picture the younger you. And let her know, back then, over, finished, completed, no longer exist. They never touched me. They messed with my stuff, but they never got me. There's no part of me, me that's the same as it was back then. No part of my body that's the same as it was back then. But I'm me, always the same. Never touched me. Right? So that she gets it, that they mess with her stuff, but they never got you. Right? And that's becoming more and more clear, Right? And as this is getting in, check inside. How's your body feeling now?
[41:25] B: Relaxed.
[41:25] A: Yeah. And again, Elena, as your Body's relaxed. That other than conscious part will travel back and bring another moment to your awareness for us to clear. Right. What comes to mind? Now open your eyes. Kind of think about the stuff, right?
[41:50] B: Nothing, really.
[41:52] A: Well, if we think about the stuff that happened with the trafficking thing, that they're gonna ask you questions about.
[41:56] B: Yeah.
[41:56] A: Yeah. What is it that they ask you questions about that when you think about that stuff or when you used to. It caused a lot of discomfort. Heck, it even made you cry.
[42:04] B: Mm.
[42:05] A: Right.
[42:08] B: Just all the. I don't know. Just don't wanna have to talk about all the people I had to sleep with.
[42:13] A: Well, think about a time when someone.
[42:16] B: Was dangling me over 40. Like 45.
[42:19] A: Oh, good, that one. So you're where.
[42:21] B: Yeah.
[42:22] A: Where were you when that happened? About how long ago?
[42:24] B: Four years ago.
[42:25] A: Four years ago. Right. And you're where, like, in Pinellas County? In Chicago. You're in Chicago. Right.
[42:29] B: Good.
[42:29] A: So you're in Chicago and you're up in a tall building. Right. And then what happened?
[42:33] B: Someone's trying to rob me.
[42:34] A: Right. So someone's trying to rob you. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[42:36] B: They dangle. They're fighting or trying to take my money for my night.
[42:40] A: Right. Good job. Right. And what happened next?
[42:41] B: Dangling me over the building.
[42:43] A: So they're like, hanging you over. That was really scary.
[42:45] B: Yeah.
[42:45] A: Right. Then what happened next?
[42:47] B: I was able to get away from him.
[42:48] A: Right, Good. Right. And got away from the side. Right. Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[42:53] B: I hit him over the head with a blender.
[42:54] A: Yeah. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[42:56] B: I was running down the hall.
[42:57] A: Yes. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[42:59] B: I left.
[42:59] A: Right. And then that moment.
[43:00] B: Uber and left. Yeah.
[43:01] A: Yeah. And then later on, you did something more fun like go fishing or scuba diving or make soup.
[43:07] B: No.
[43:08] A: Well, you did make soup recently.
[43:09] B: Yeah.
[43:10] A: And that was more fun than that moment.
[43:11] B: Yeah.
[43:11] A: Right. Good job. So we got making soup, we got going scuba diving, we got fishing. Right. And then you'd gotten in the Uber, and then you called the Uber, then you ran down the hallway, then you walked in with the blender, and then you got in the way, and then you were off the edge, and then they were hanging you over the edge, and they were fighting over the money that you had made, and then you had gone up into that building. Then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Right. And again, this goes backwards compared to forward. Emotionally. How was it?
[43:33] B: Doesn't sound as bad. I don't know why or something.
[43:36] A: What's happening is it's not feeling as bad because your brain is reading it as data. You can remember that happening, Right. You can remember putting on your pants. Stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants. Well, then stop them from dangling over the edge. Say they're not doing that.
[43:51] B: They're not doing that.
[43:51] A: Well, then you stop putting on your jacket. Say, I am not putting on my jacket.
[43:54] B: I'm not putting on my jacket.
[43:55] A: Well, then stop that from happening. See, that's not happening.
[43:56] B: That's not happening.
[43:57] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[43:59] B: No longer exists.
[44:00] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. Right. Close your eyes. Let that earlier you know that you survived. You're okay. Right. She never fell, right? Yeah. Let her know. Right. Because that part was scary. Because it wasn't sure. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know it had nothing to do with you. Because in that situation, it wouldn't matter whether it was you or somebody else. Right. That's what they would have done. But let her know how resourceful she is that she got away. Right. Whacked him over the head so it was easier for her to get away, Right? That's right. And as it gets in again, what do you notice happening?
[44:38] B: Lighter.
[44:39] A: Yeah. And you can open your eyes. And that's what we want. We want things to lighten up. Yeah, Lighten up. So that you're clear. You're present. Right. And there were different moments because I worked with lots of women who've had all sorts of different stuff, right?
[44:51] B: Yeah.
[44:52] A: Lots of women who have been trafficked. There were different guys that it was at least a little easier to do stuff with than other guys where it was like, completely disgusting to have them.
[45:01] B: Oh, yeah.
[45:03] A: Like some guys, like, I could get myself. Okay. Other guys was like, I feel like dirt. Right. But the cool part is, even in those moments when it was one of those guys that you felt disgusted by.
[45:16] B: I just blocked it out.
[45:17] A: Yes, you did. Because you know what's really useful for somebody who's had stuff happen to their body? They know how to not be in their body when it's happening to their body.
[45:27] B: Yeah.
[45:28] A: Just like in a predator prey scene, there will be moments when the predator is chasing the prey and the prey realizes that it's not going to get away. So it. It literally has. The death is inevitable. Right. Because it's getting tired. There's no exit routes. It knows it's not gonna live.
[45:43] B: Yeah.
[45:44] A: There'll be a moment where the prey Animal will stop, and the body of the animal will be completely still. And in that moment, the life force that is in the animal takes the animal away. So it doesn't have to be there for what happens to the body. So for people who had lots of stuff that they had to do that was happening to their body, that they didn't get to choose whether it was gonna happen to their body or not, they're able to go, yeah, right.
[46:06] B: I'd be thinking about what I'm having for breakfast tomorrow.
[46:10] A: That's right. That's right. And the really cool part, even with the disgusting, they never touched you. Right. And there's not a single part of your body that's the same as it was back then. That's right. I know. That's the part. So close your eyes. Think back to even a time when it was somebody that was disgusting and you're just disassociating and thinking about what I'm gonna have for breakfast and let her know that guy messed with my stuff. Never touched me. There's no part of my body that's the same as it was then. All the cells have been replaced. Never got who I really am. Never touched me. Right. So that she gets it that you're okay. Right. When do you notice happening again to the earlier you.
[47:00] B: Little relief.
[47:02] A: Yeah.
[47:02] B: Emotional.
[47:04] A: Right. But not really.
[47:06] B: Yeah, just like tear. But not really. I don't know what this is.
[47:10] A: Notice how like this is when you go emotional, not like when you were talking to Homeland.
[47:17] B: Yeah.
[47:18] A: This emotional that you're feeling right now is not the same as then.
[47:21] B: Mm. No. Yeah, it's different. I've never felt like this ever. Actually.
[47:28] A: You'Ve never felt like this because your brain had never gotten that certain moments ended.
[47:33] B: Mm.
[47:35] A: That you survived it. That you're okay. That's why this is happening. And as this happens, it changes how your brain codes them and changes the trajectory of where you're headed. Because some of you're gonna notice right away different experiences and moments that you're in that used to create discomfort. You'll be in those same experiences and not feeling it. Other times you go through the experience and think back and go, hey, normally I would have been and I wasn't. So you're going to notice it in those two ways. And then the last way you're going to notice it is in a big way. It's over time. So I liken it to. If two ships got set out to sea on parallel courses, and one was a journey by a degree. When they move out from port, it doesn't seem like they're on a different course. Yeah, but we know the farther they go out in the ocean, the more vastly different their course has become. Because where are we headed? We're headed towards a you who's worth it to you. Therefore, it's not okay for somebody to treat me in ways that don't align with me being worth it to me.
[48:41] B: Yeah.
[48:42] A: Right. That doesn't mean that I can avoid every fucking asshole that's out there, because sometimes I have to work for them. Yeah, but we're seeing it clearly for what it is. And sometimes we let it slide by, and other times we're very matter of fact, firm and direct.
[48:57] B: Mm.
[49:00] A: Got it. Right. Because it's not about how you might talk to somebody else. That part's not okay for me. And there may be times where it would be okay to say that there are other times where it's not going to be okay based on knowing how they'll respond. Do you follow me with that? So what we want for you, truly, is the freedom to have your voice, but also have distinction as to where and when it makes sense to say it.
[49:28] B: Yeah, I definitely have that problem. I feel you. I definitely don't stand up for myself enough.
[49:34] A: Well, yeah, but see, this is what's starting to happen as this stuff is changing. It's showing up as that stuff wasn't about me or before it felt like it was. So there was an aspect of it that felt like maybe I deserved it, even though I didn't think I should.
[49:49] B: Yeah.
[49:51] A: And that's what's starting to change. Right. And that's why we don't have to go through every single moment of every. Every single time things happened to begin to clear. But we want to get a constellation. A constellation is a grouping of different moments and experiences so that your brain can take what it's learned and generalize it out in the same way. If I said to you, orange, apple, banana, you know it's fruit.
[50:15] B: Yeah.
[50:16] A: If I said orange, brown, red, green, you go, it's color. But if I simply said to you, orange.
[50:23] B: Mm.
[50:24] A: You don't know whether I'm talking about the fruit or the color.
[50:28] B: Yeah.
[50:28] A: Until I add a few. Right. And I go, orange, apple, banana, you go, oh, it's fruit.
[50:34] B: Yeah.
[50:34] A: If I go, orange, red, brown, green, you go, oh, it's colors.
[50:38] B: Yeah.
[50:39] A: Got it. We don't have to list every color. We don't have to list every fruit for your brain to go, oh, got it.
[50:47] B: Yeah.
[50:47] A: So, again, as we're organizing towards this future. You becoming more emotionally present and clear and light and free. That other part of your brain is going to travel back and another moment will be brought to your awareness. Right. And what moments come into mind now?
[51:10] B: More crap. It's like it's the same story.
[51:12] A: Yeah, but let's check, first of all. Let's check and see. See if it does the same thing that it used to.
[51:18] B: Yeah.
[51:18] A: So you got another one. That one happened. You're where? It's like.
[51:22] B: It's like Chicago still.
[51:23] A: So you're in Chicago. Right. Way to go, Chicago.
[51:26] B: I know. I hate them. Stupid Chicago. No, just same old. Every day, multiple people a day. It's just.
[51:36] A: So you're in Chicago.
[51:37] B: Yeah.
[51:37] A: And you're where in Chicago?
[51:39] B: The hotel. I'm in the hotels. I'm at the port apartment. It's just. It's so hard to think about. It was like, all so general. Like, it just was the same thing every day.
[51:46] A: Right. So this one, though, if we narrow it down to one time. So I might have been at a hotel or an apartment.
[51:52] B: Yeah.
[51:53] A: Where? Pick. So you're at a hotel. Right. And is it one of those ones where the doors just open out to the parking lot or is it actually a high rise? So you're in the high rise and you're indoors, so there's like a hallway and between. Right. And then what happened?
[52:10] B: The pimp I was with.
[52:11] A: Yes.
[52:12] B: Yeah. He.
[52:13] A: He was texting different people or going on back page or whatever other way that he had to bring in clientele.
[52:23] B: Yeah.
[52:25] A: Isn't it interesting? People don't always realize it must have been all at night. No, it's not always that.
[52:29] B: No. 24 7, if I didn't make at least 5k a day. Get beat.
[52:33] A: Yeah. So let's even think of one of those times.
[52:35] B: Yeah, all the time.
[52:38] A: Yeah. We know that it happened more than once, but remember, our brain does best when we narrow down to a specific. Like learning how to tie a pair of sneakers. We only learn on one pair, but once we master it, our brain applies it to the rest. So the brain is great at taking specific and generalizing out, not so good at taking general and making it specific. So if somebody said to me, my dad was a bastard. Well, we know that there are multiple times a dad acted in a certain way. So we want to narrow down to one time he did.
[53:08] B: Yeah.
[53:08] A: So we can get that one clear. So this one, the pimp trafficker who you were with.
[53:12] B: Yeah.
[53:13] A: Right.
[53:13] B: Yeah.
[53:14] A: And so you're in the Hotel. Right. He was bringing different people throughout the day.
[53:18] B: Yeah.
[53:18] A: You were doing different stuff. Luckily, their guys are pretty quick sometimes. Sometimes. Right. Other guys, you're like, really? Come on.
[53:29] B: I know, it's so annoying, right? Yeah. Right.
[53:32] A: And you can know that that stuff was happening to your body, but as you know that that stuff has happened to your body. Also know that your body's not you.
[53:39] B: Yeah.
[53:40] A: Now, because back then she didn't know that your body's not you. Right. And even let that earlier, you know that none of that touched you and that your body is not the same as it was then because all the cells have been replaced.
[53:56] B: Yeah.
[53:57] A: Right.
[53:58] B: Okay.
[53:59] A: Right. So that. That starts to get in because they never touched who you really are.
[54:03] B: Just my stuff.
[54:04] A: Just your stuff. It's like somebody fucked with my car. Yeah, right, Right. But think of a time, like, he was mad. Trafficker guy was mad because we didn't make as much money that day. Right. And what might he have done? He might have come into the hotel because he. Did he stay in the hotel room after?
[54:18] B: Hide in the closet sometimes, like a creep.
[54:20] A: Yeah. So he's hiding the closet, like, watching. Right. Weird, right? Yeah. Good. Awesome. Right?
[54:27] B: Yeah. Hit me.
[54:32] A: Yeah. Like, where he might have done what you might have been in the apartment.
[54:35] B: Split my eyebrow open.
[54:36] A: Like, how do you do that? With like a fist.
[54:37] B: Yeah.
[54:38] A: So he, like, punch you in the face and that hurt.
[54:40] B: Knocked me out like a day later.
[54:42] A: And you woke up and, like, this.
[54:43] B: Was swollen shit now.
[54:45] A: Swollen shot. Right.
[54:46] B: Disgusting. And like, all the blood vessels in my eye were, like, broken.
[54:51] A: Right. Good job. The detail. Right?
[54:52] B: Yeah.
[54:52] A: And you woke up and you saw that in the mirror.
[54:54] B: Yeah.
[54:54] A: Right. And then what happened?
[54:56] B: I was like, kind of out of it.
[54:57] A: Yeah, Right.
[54:58] B: Honestly.
[54:59] A: Right. Because that really ruined, like, money making the next day. Dude, what the.
[55:03] B: No, you. Yeah. You would make me just that day to put on makeup and keep working.
[55:07] A: Right. Like, but not in the same way.
[55:09] B: I like com.
[55:10] A: Like. Right. Good job. Good detail. Right? Yes.
[55:13] B: Concussion, Right?
[55:14] A: Yeah. Right. And other stuff happened. Right. And you can remember him hitting you.
[55:18] B: Yeah.
[55:19] A: Right. You can also remember putting on your jacket and zipping it up. Well, stop zipping up your jacket.
[55:23] B: Not zipping up my jacket.
[55:24] A: Stop hitting you. Say, he's not hitting me.
[55:26] B: He's not hitting you. Right.
[55:27] A: Well, then stop that from happening. It's not happening.
[55:29] B: It's not happening.
[55:30] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[55:32] B: No longer exists.
[55:32] A: Bingo. Right? Let that, you know, close your eyes. Let her know how her eye feels now. Right. What it looks like now. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know that it's healed. Let her know that what's happening is the physical injury, it healed. And now we're healing those emotional wounds so that she's getting it too. That you're okay. That's right. That's right. That you're okay. That it stopped. That it's over. You got away. That's right. You did. That's right. Because you're here. Hi. We know with certainty that you got away. This is not Chicago.
[56:10] B: No, it's not Chicago.
[56:15] A: Right? Yes. They call it Chicago land, like it's an amusement park. Right. All the other areas around Chicago, it's called Chicagoland.
[56:26] B: Really?
[56:26] A: Yes.
[56:27] B: I didn't know that.
[56:29] A: Like all the different townships that are around, all the suburbs, they call it Chicagoland. Right. And then you can't call it Illinois, you have to call it Illinois.
[56:39] B: What?
[56:40] A: Well, it's spelled noise. N O I S, it's. But it's Illinois. It's kind of like where I grew up. You call it elementary school instead of. Instead of elementary school. Wow. Weird, right?
[56:51] B: Potato, potatoes.
[56:56] A: Right. So how'd you get away? How'd you get it to stop?
[56:59] B: He had a stroke.
[57:00] A: He had a stroke?
[57:01] B: Yeah. It was awesome.
[57:02] A: Are you kidding me?
[57:03] B: No.
[57:03] A: Like, you're there when it happened?
[57:05] B: Well, I was in. I was in Boston working out there. He finally like trusted me to go travel myself. And then I get a call from his son, like, my dad's having a stroke. And I was like, really?
[57:16] A: Really. Oh, that's too bad.
[57:17] B: So sorry. I feel terrible. Wait a little longer to call the ambulance and kind of took a little longer than he should. They should have to call it. Cuz I was kind of keeping him on the phone. I knew the longer he would tell.
[57:30] A: Me, tell me all about it, like what happened, how did it come.
[57:34] B: Yeah, and then I flew straight next flight in the morning. Straight there?
[57:37] A: Yeah.
[57:38] B: To the hospital.
[57:38] A: He was in Chicago?
[57:39] B: No, he was in Tampa.
[57:41] A: He was in Tampa.
[57:41] B: Tampa General.
[57:42] A: Got it.
[57:42] B: Yeah, that's where he lived. And yeah, I went to hospital. His blood pressure was like over 250 or something. Yeah, something crazy because he stopped taking his blood pressure medication and he was completely paralyzed. Yeah, he was in there. So then I was, I went, I stayed by his side every day for like a week. And then I went through his phone and I found out he was also pimping out other girls. And I told him, I don't want you treating the thought of you other girls Having to go through what I did and they were younger than me.
[58:14] A: Yeah.
[58:14] B: I like told him, fuck you, and I left. And I never ever saw him again.
[58:17] A: Yeah.
[58:18] B: Never.
[58:19] A: Isn't that cool?
[58:20] B: Yeah.
[58:21] A: Good job.
[58:22] B: Yeah. I don't know how he was in there for months supposedly, but I don't know. It's like, fuck you.
[58:26] A: Yeah, you're done.
[58:27] B: Yeah.
[58:28] A: Ah. So in that moment it was clear because before that you felt like he was with you.
[58:33] B: Mm, got it. Yeah.
[58:37] A: So it wasn't until that moment that you realized.
[58:40] B: Yeah.
[58:41] A: That he was doing that to other people too.
[58:43] B: Yeah. Young, too. Awful.
[58:46] A: Right. Where before you felt like it was a partnership with him.
[58:51] B: Yeah. I hate saying that. I feel so bad when I say it's like.
[58:53] A: No, no, no, no. But that's. Here's the deal. In those moments, like, cuz, how did you first get connected to him?
[59:00] B: Yeah. It was more a relationship before anything.
[59:02] A: Yeah.
[59:03] B: Yeah.
[59:03] A: So you started dating. Right.
[59:05] B: Then all that stuff got laid out.
[59:07] A: And then he's like, did. How did the first time happen?
[59:10] B: He's like, oh, if you go to seeking your calm, he's like, you can just go to dinner with people and they'll pay for your dinner. And it was no sex, just dinner.
[59:16] A: Yeah. Right.
[59:17] B: Yeah.
[59:17] A: So then you went to dinner with them. Right. And then it moved into.
[59:20] B: Yeah, the sex part.
[59:21] A: Like a gfe.
[59:22] B: Yeah.
[59:23] A: Right. Yeah, that thing. Yeah, right. Where we go out. I have dinner, but then I'd.
[59:27] B: Yeah, afterwards.
[59:28] A: Yeah, right, right. But I was still with him. Right, got it. So that's where. What you didn't know back then is that's where the psychological manipulation, the coercion. Right. The power control stuff started.
[59:47] B: Yeah.
[59:48] A: Right. Because it wasn't like, hey, you know what I'd like to do? I like to go out with straight people and have dinner.
[59:53] B: Mm.
[59:54] A: And then I like to go out with strange people and have dinner and then have to have sex with them.
[59:58] B: And then give you all my money.
[60:00] A: Right. And then get paid for it, but have to hand it over to you.
[60:03] B: Yeah. And I don't even get anything. And he would drain it. Always drain my bank account. And it was so fucking mind blowing because I would make so much goddamn money that at the end of the month for my apartment in Tampa. We don't have enough money to pay the rent. What about the hundred thousand dollars I made you this month? Oh, you know, we don't have enough money to put you in a nicer hotel. Oh, no, you gotta eat McDonald's today. Spending too much on room Service, like, where the fuck's all the money going? I never even get to see, like, nothing. I'm like, what the fuck, man?
[60:30] A: Then.
[60:31] B: Then he would stress me out and make me have to, like, hustle to get $2,000 to pay my rent, even though where'd the money go all month?
[60:38] A: Right. Right. Well, clearly you didn't get to keep it.
[60:41] B: No. Nothing. Not a penny.
[60:43] A: Right.
[60:43] B: Yeah.
[60:44] A: Right. And again, you didn't know it was gonna be that because if we were to go back to. Prior to meeting that guy, prior to going and dating him.
[60:54] B: Yeah.
[60:54] A: If you had known back then that it was gonna lead to all of what it led to, would you have started dating him? Fucked up.
[61:03] B: Hell no. I would have found out who he is if I could predict the future and kill him and go back to my regular life.
[61:08] A: Right. You wouldn't have been done it.
[61:10] B: No.
[61:10] A: But you didn't know.
[61:11] B: No.
[61:12] A: Right. And once she got looped in it earlier, you it. She couldn't get out of it.
[61:19] B: Yeah.
[61:20] A: You follow me with that? Because that was the psychological manipulation and the coercion that had that active.
[61:29] B: Like, I always felt trapped, but I really wasn't, you know?
[61:33] A: Yeah.
[61:33] B: Like, in an open room, I'm walking the street, I'm in a different state without it. Why do I still feel trapped? You know? I always wondered that.
[61:40] A: Thought it was weird, Right?
[61:41] B: Yeah.
[61:42] A: Right. But that's what he had done, right? By setting up what he set up.
[61:50] B: Yeah.
[61:52] A: Makes sense. And that's where it was. A false sense of trust.
[61:56] B: Yeah.
[61:58] A: Trust in me. Where the hell's the money for the rent? What the.
[62:01] B: Yeah. What do you mean you don't have enough money? Where is the money? Like, how is it. Like, it's literally mind boggling, Right? He always needed money, but I'm like, where is all the money? And to find out he had other girls too. And I know I was at least making 100k a month, so I'm like, what the are you doing? You live. You're running a shitty house in Tampa. Like, you don't even have a car. Like, what, you drive a damn minivan?
[62:22] A: Yeah.
[62:23] B: Where? It's so weird. Doesn't make sense, right?
[62:25] A: Where'd it all go?
[62:28] B: It's weird. Yeah. Mm. Maybe one of his 15 kids or 20 kids now, supposedly.
[62:36] A: Oh, God. Yeah. Definitely a winner.
[62:39] B: Yeah. That's an upstanding gentleman, right?
[62:44] A: So is he who you have, who Homeland is after? Is that part of what this is about? Okay, so again, I want you to think back to the earlier you prior to ever meeting him.
[62:57] B: Mm.
[62:58] A: Because again, part of what's been going on is from here you've been looking back at earlier, you going, idiot.
[63:04] B: Yeah.
[63:05] A: How could you have done that? Right. But based on what was going on because you met him when you were how old?
[63:12] B: 20.
[63:13] A: Right. And based on what had happened.
[63:16] B: Mm.
[63:18] A: And then what had happened with what people said afterwards, what had happened with those boys. But it happened at school afterwards.
[63:26] B: Yeah.
[63:27] A: Right. All of that, you didn't know was grooming.
[63:31] B: Mm.
[63:35] A: Right. Because you asked the question earlier. How come I find myself attracting and attracted to asshole guys?
[63:44] B: Yeah.
[63:44] A: Whether that be guys that I work for that are asshole guys, like all these around me.
[63:48] B: It's funny. Insane.
[63:50] A: Right. So I'm going to tell you the reason predators are attracted to weakness. Right. Lion is king of jungle. But not because lion goes after strongest gazelle or biggest elephant. Right. Because lion could get injured if it goes after the biggest elephant or the strongest gazelle.
[64:08] B: Yeah.
[64:09] A: So what does lion go after? The baby? The old one? The one that can't fight back.
[64:17] B: Yeah.
[64:18] A: Follow me with that.
[64:19] B: Mm.
[64:19] A: That's what makes predators sharks go after. They smell the blood.
[64:24] B: Mm. Yeah.
[64:27] A: Right. Even canaries, which are lovely birds, if they are in a sanctuary all together, they all get along like a one big family. Until one gets sick or injured. And then do you know what they do to it? Peck it to death.
[64:39] B: Oh, hell.
[64:39] A: It's awful. Right?
[64:40] B: Oh, my God.
[64:41] A: So you've had an open wound.
[64:44] B: Yeah.
[64:45] A: Not a visible wound. Right. Easy to see if, like, I got, like. Oh, yeah, Right. Makeup on. It looks like. Wow. Your eye looks like you got smashed in it. Yes, I did. By him. So let's get this over with.
[64:59] B: I know. Doesn't this makeup cover up the dark purple of you so well? What about the white of my eyes being red? Like, he's so stupid.
[65:09] A: Right. But. But when all of that was going on, there was an open wound.
[65:15] B: Yeah.
[65:16] A: Makes sense.
[65:17] B: Yeah.
[65:18] A: So that would have somebody who's a predator in that way be more attracted. Makes sense.
[65:29] B: Yeah.
[65:30] A: And that they could get away with treating because that wound was still there. So even when I knew it wasn't okay. It didn't. Emotionally, it kind of felt like, well, maybe it's all I deserve.
[65:43] B: Yeah.
[65:43] A: Right. Even though I know better, it's not. It doesn't feel that way in here. So what's starting to change with that is that wound is healing. Right. Because as you think about the stuff we talked about, think about the thing at 16 and try to feel like it was your Fault.
[65:58] B: I really don't.
[65:59] A: I know.
[66:00] B: Yeah.
[66:02] A: How different that is that it's ever been.
[66:04] B: Yeah. Like, come on, why could I have done this 10 years ago?
[66:08] A: Right. Notice how it doesn't. It's like. No, not my fault.
[66:12] B: Yeah.
[66:13] A: Right, Right. Try to feel really bad about you. Right. Isn't that interesting?
[66:20] B: Yeah.
[66:20] A: Notice how that's different. Because what's starting to happen is it's changing the wiring in your brain. The wounds are healing. I wanna do one other. Cause I want you to think about something even prior to what happened at 16, that could have had to do with mom, dad, siblings, whatever. One of those other moments that eh. I don't like thinking about it. Cause when I do, it makes me feel yucky.
[66:47] B: Yeah.
[66:48] A: So if you travel that back down, what does it take you?
[66:51] B: Towards my dad, Mom's relationship.
[66:53] A: What's a particular time? What did you witness? See experience with them.
[66:59] B: Yeah. Well, when my mom found out my dad cheated on her.
[67:02] A: Yeah.
[67:03] B: Yeah.
[67:03] A: And you were there when she found out or.
[67:06] B: Yeah, I was like in the other room, but I could hear the whole thing.
[67:08] A: Right, you were in the other room and she had like found out how?
[67:11] B: She went through his phone record. Yeah. And saw the text messages back and.
[67:15] A: Forth with this other person. Then she was screaming, yelling at him. Yeah, right. Was there any like physical stuff?
[67:20] B: I don't know.
[67:21] A: I just remember throwing things, smashing things.
[67:24] B: I remember my little brother crying a lot. So I was like comforting him.
[67:27] A: Yeah, right.
[67:28] B: Yeah.
[67:28] A: Right.
[67:28] B: And then my dad the next day said that he's gonna be moving or.
[67:33] A: Move out for a little bit. Right, good. Then what happened next?
[67:35] B: They got back together.
[67:36] A: He moved out for a little bit.
[67:38] B: Yeah. Just for a little bit. Like two weeks probably. That's it.
[67:40] A: Right. So again, in that moment that they're screaming and yelling at each other and you're about how old?
[67:46] B: 6.
[67:48] A: So think about a 6 or 7 year old not knowing whether she's gonna be okay because her whole life is getting flipped upside down.
[67:57] B: Yeah.
[67:58] A: Right. Growing up, mom, dad, brother, any other siblings. Right. So that would have been a whole life intact.
[68:04] B: Yeah.
[68:05] A: Right. They have this huge thing. You're hearing all this stuff, which a lot of what they're saying you don't even understand because you're six.
[68:11] B: Yeah.
[68:11] A: But you know, it's a lot of anger and hurt in there.
[68:14] B: Just constantly yelling. They're always fighting. Always.
[68:18] A: Right.
[68:18] B: Yeah.
[68:19] A: Right. Which then also gives an indication what is relationship supposed to look like.
[68:23] B: I don't have any example of that because they don't even show any kind of anything towards each other?
[68:28] A: No, but the relationship is supposed to be A, hard, and B, you fight a lot. Right. What if relationships don't have to be hard? What if they could be easy?
[68:37] B: That's the one I'm with now. It's weird.
[68:40] A: Yeah. So what if it doesn't have to be hard? What if it could be easy? Right. And you get to lighten up because you're worth it.
[68:46] B: Yeah.
[68:47] A: Because you know it's starting to happen. You're worth it to you. You're worth it to be treated in a way that you want to be treated. Because here's the key thing about it for all women.
[68:55] B: Yeah.
[68:55] A: Women hold the keys. They've got the goods. If a guy is interested, the guy looks and likes the package. So women hold the keys. Women are the regulators. Women are the ones to determine the where, the when, the how often, the how much, and the with whom, not the guy.
[69:13] B: Yeah.
[69:13] A: When guys take control, they run recklessly. Woman gets hurt.
[69:19] B: Yeah.
[69:19] A: Right. So women hold the keys. Women have the goods. Women are the regulators. You can wake a guy up in the middle and like, oh, I'm really horny. I want him. He's like, okay, try to wake her up. Get away from me, too. I'm tired. I'm sleeping. I gotta get up in the morning. Pretty much, there's a whole different story. Guys are always yeses. Women are yeses when they want to, nos when they don't.
[69:47] B: Mm. Yeah.
[69:50] A: Right? So in this, we want to be thinking of, I'm worth it. And he's lucky. He's lucky that I'm allowing him to spend time with me.
[70:00] B: Mm.
[70:01] A: Right?
[70:02] B: Yeah.
[70:02] A: See, I wonder what it would be like to start feeling that more awesome. He's lucky.
[70:07] B: Yeah.
[70:08] A: Right. So close your eyes. Think back to the younger you, that model. Let her know that it turned out okay, that the dad came back. Let her know that they're okay. But that's not the model of relationships that you have now. Let that younger you know how worth it she is to you. Let her know how strong, resilient, powerful, and brave she is, how she got herself untangled from an intricate web to be okay in you. Let her know how things are beginning to lighten up on the inside, that you're becoming more okay in you connecting to more of who you are, knowing that that stuff may have messed with your body but never got you. That's right. Let the you know about going fishing, scuba diving. Let her know about the guy she's dating now and how Lucky. He is. That's right. That she actually feels that he's lucky. She might also feel lucky that she's with him, but that what she's learning is what it's like to be with something that's new and different, not similar and same. Right. So that you're on the way to becoming even that much more okay. In you present. Seeing things clearly and even having more of your voice. That's right. And as all of this is beginning to integrate inside. As things lighten up above and over it all. Free. That's right. To be becoming even that much more okay. In you. Or lightening up even more. That's right. All of this is integrating now inside, you're becoming even more okay. Present clear. Free. That's right. And then whenever you're ready. And you can take your time finding your way back. That's right. And a big breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Yeah.
[73:07] B: Relax.
[73:08] A: Right? Yeah. Right. Isn't that cool?
[73:12] B: Yeah. It feels good.
[73:13] A: It does, doesn't it?
[73:14] B: Yeah.
[73:15] A: Right, Right.
[73:18] B: The room looks brighter, doesn't it?
[73:20] A: Yeah, it looks brighter. Cause things are lightening up. Right. Who would have thought that in a couple hours we could do this?
[73:32] B: I know. What crazy. I'm just talking on FaceTime.
[73:39] A: Right, right. And how much better it is. And we don't have to do it in person. Right. Because you live far away. I mean, I did session with somebody in Dubai.
[73:48] B: Oh, my God.
[73:49] A: Last week. Right. And the week before somebody was in England, so.
[73:56] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[73:58] A: And you're gonna notice all sorts of things changing. Right. They're gonna be the ways that you notice it immediately. That stuff doesn't have the same feeling. I still don't like it that it happened, but it doesn't make me feel bad about me.
[74:10] B: Yeah.
[74:11] A: Right. You're going to notice being more present and reading other people's garbage as being more about them. So that you see it clearly and you feel it inside. Got it. Then there's going to be an opening for more flexibility, that emotional wound healing. So I'm less and less susceptible to that stuff. The picker adjusting so that I'm finding myself interacting with people who are more treating me in the way that I want to be treated. And when people aren't, I've got the freedom to say it at the time that it makes sense to say it. Because there are going to be times when somebody's really heated in doing all that that it may not make sense for me to come back right at them.
[74:58] B: Yeah.
[74:59] A: Sometimes it Will.
[75:00] B: Yeah.
[75:00] A: Sometimes it won't, but I've got the freedom to address it. Right? Right. Because I'm sure the company's got HR that we can go to.
[75:11] B: No, I'm so, so annoying. I'm like, I just want to quit so bad. Really close. Like, this close.
[75:16] A: Yeah. Yeah. Or we want you to be treating me in a way that, like, is best for me to be treated.
[75:22] B: The only way he'll do that is he comes see you. Because he treats everyone like, well, I'm.
[75:26] A: A great employee, and you're gonna lose me.
[75:28] B: Yeah.
[75:29] A: And this is what I need. Because the other part that happens when somebody's gone through what you've gone through is you don't always tell people what you need. What did you tell me up front? I always tend to put other people's needs first. So what you're gonna notice is it's gonna be easier for you to speak up on what you need. That'll make it feel okay for you. And then they either get to deliver or they don't.
[75:53] B: Yeah. My boyfriend does it all the time.
[75:55] A: Again, it's not about you. It's about them. But you're gonna have the freedom to say what you need.
[76:00] B: That makes sense. Now, he's always asking me, what can I do better? He likes to do, like, check ins. And I'm always like, nothing, nothing. But sometimes things bother me, but I just don't say anything.
[76:10] A: Right. You might actually say, hey, I would like this.
[76:12] B: Mm. Yeah.
[76:15] A: Right. Got it in a new job so that you get more freedom and then we can connect again.
[76:21] B: Yeah.
[76:22] A: Right. If anything comes up where you've got to, like, testify and all that, we can get you prepped and primed, ready for that as well, so. But you did great today.
[76:32] B: Thank you. I feel good.
[76:34] A: I bet, right?
[76:35] B: Yeah, I feel great.
[76:36] A: Right. That whole stuff that burdens, like, lifted.
[76:38] B: Yeah.
[76:39] A: And see, your brain will continue to intake what we've done even as you sleep and dream tonight, you're gonna notice the things that you used to have bad dreams about. They're not gonna be troubling you.
[76:50] B: Okay.
[76:51] A: Because your brain, that stuff, was unconscious processing. The dreams show up in that way, but as the brain is healing, it's healing.
[77:01] B: Yeah. I always listen to that music at night, too. Like the. All that different stuff, the alpha delta, the past life regressions, all that stuff. And I've had some crazy dreams I like.
[77:14] A: Well, if you want to go to sleep, you want to move from theta waves into delta waves, because delta waves are when we're in deep sleep.
[77:21] B: Okay?
[77:23] A: That's the key. You don't want to be in Gamma, you don't want to be in Beta. Okay, they're going to activate up here. You want to go from Alpha to Theta to Delta.
[77:31] B: Okay.
[77:33] A: Yeah. You did great today. Any questions for me?
[77:36] B: No. No. Thank you.
[77:38] A: You're welcome.
[77:38] B: Yeah. And then.
[77:40] A: This is a lot easier than you thought.
[77:41] B: Yeah. I was like, God dang it, I gotta talk all that again.
[77:48] A: Right. Notice how it's a lot easier.
[77:50] B: Yeah.
[77:51] A: Yeah.
[77:51] B: I feel great.
[77:52] A: Isn't that cool?
[77:53] B: Yeah.
[77:53] A: Right.
[77:53] B: I was feeling like crap today and he asked me too. He's like, you're really anxious. He's like, are you worried about this? I'm like, no, no, of course I am. Yes, I fucking am.
[78:01] A: How could I not be given what I've done before?
[78:03] B: Yeah.
[78:04] A: Yeah. But notice how different this is.
[78:06] B: Mm.
[78:07] A: Right?
[78:09] B: Yeah, I like it.
[78:10] A: Yeah. It's a better way to do it.
[78:12] B: Yeah.
[78:13] A: Right. And it works.
[78:14] B: Yeah. Or like, how does it? Like.
[78:18] A: Well, it's not an often thing.
[78:20] B: Yeah.
[78:21] A: Because it's really about adjusting it and getting it better. What I like to do with follow ups for people is I like them to go out and live life for three to four weeks so that they get to notice what's different for themselves.
[78:31] B: Yeah.
[78:32] A: And then we can get back together.
[78:33] B: Mm.
[78:34] A: Yeah.
[78:34] B: Okay.
[78:35] A: You did great today, though.
[78:36] B: Thank you. I appreciate it.
[78:37] A: You're welcome. All right, we'll stop with that for now.
[78:40] B: Time to go get some soup.
[78:42] A: Soup, Yeah.
