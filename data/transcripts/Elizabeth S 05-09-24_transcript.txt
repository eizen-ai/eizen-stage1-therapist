[00:00] A: All right, so today is May 9th, Elizabeth. This is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable, it might be made available in teaching and training others. And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:14] B: Yes, absolutely. That's okay.
[00:16] A: All right, so what would we want our time to do?
[00:20] B: I guess I just need a lot more freedom.
[00:23] A: Okay. How do you know?
[00:26] B: Well, I have a lot of fears with, like, going back. Not fears, like, I'm going back out to use. I have fears of people, of me overreacting with situations, because I hate the word triggers, but things cause, like, familiar familiarity, like personality types, situations, smells, etc.
[00:51] A: And does that still happen?
[00:53] B: Yeah.
[00:54] A: Oh. So where might you be when it happens? What's a recent one that you encountered where we don't like the word, but it did it.
[01:02] B: The most recent. I mean, all the time there's driving over the Skyway bridge that.
[01:14] A: Is there a particular place that you get to?
[01:17] B: Yeah, the middle bridge.
[01:18] A: Right at the middle. Right. And then what happens?
[01:20] B: And I just. I. What happened in the past is I lost a friend to suicide when I was in the car with him, and.
[01:26] A: He didn't tell me he lost him to suicide in the car.
[01:29] B: Jumped up, he got out of the car, he parked on the skyway and jumped over.
[01:33] A: Huh.
[01:34] B: And like, stuff like that. So then there's other traumas where, you know, I've been hurt or, like, physically hurt. Yes, physically hurt. And, like, personality types. So, like, even driving over the Skyway, I can get over that a little bit better than of meeting somebody. And I feel like they're manipulating me. And then I start, like, having an out. Like, I play things through my mind. Like, if he go. Or she goes crosses this far, then this is my situation out. And it's like I'm wasting a lot of time. Like, John and I talked a lot about that. Like, I waste a lot of time.
[02:09] A: Trying to figure out how to handle something if it could or if it would happen.
[02:13] B: And then I find myself, like, talking, telling myself it's okay, but it's not okay. Sometimes people aren't okay, you know, or situations.
[02:23] A: So is the worry that you're not gonna be okay?
[02:26] B: I'm worried. I'm worried that I still have a lot of misplacement of wire. Like, I'm crossed and like, somebody just reminds me of something. Sometimes I can't even put my finger on it, and. And then I'm lashing out at them. And I'm angry and, you know, okay.
[02:50] A: Let me make sure that I'm understanding. I get that. A scenario that when you go over the skyway because of what happened, that's a reminder of that. And there's still some discomfort about that. Kind of. Still a little bit of the shock because I didn't know that's what he was going to do when we stopped.
[03:07] B: And that's what I'm. Yeah. People.
[03:09] A: So there's that.
[03:10] B: You never know what people are going to.
[03:11] A: You never know what people are going to do. So that's the anxious. Is. I'm worried about what that person might do or say. And if they do this or that, then how will I handle them doing this or that? And sometimes it doesn't even go that way, but a lot of times it's using up a lot of mental energy. And then I'm having even more challenges being social because I got all that going on.
[03:35] B: Yeah.
[03:36] A: That's one aspect of it. Then the other aspect of it is sometimes somebody does something that reminds me of some other thing, and now I'm upset.
[03:42] B: Yeah.
[03:43] A: And I might lash out at them.
[03:45] B: Right.
[03:45] A: Even though I know it wasn't them, but it was like the thing that was. That had me lash out after the fact. I might recognize it and be like, I probably shouldn't have done.
[03:54] B: Right.
[03:55] A: So that's the stuff that's going on more often, more frequent than you would like it to.
[04:01] B: Yeah. And I mean, right now I'm in a bubble, and, you know, clearly where the program I'm in. I've done a lot of bad, stupid shit. I've made a lot of bad choices. So there's gonna be. Do you believe in irony? Like, I've always felt like I'm gonna die violently just because of circumstances after circumstances and how close I've come.
[04:26] A: Oh, you mean you had violent circumstances and you didn't die.
[04:29] B: Right.
[04:29] A: Huh. Wouldn't that be interesting?
[04:31] B: And then now I'm sober and I'm clean, and I'm not in making choices around, like, where you would think you're gonna die. Now I'm, like, doing the right thing, and, like, I feel like I'm gonna die violently. It's gonna be like, you know, and.
[04:46] A: Then we can sing the Atlantis Morissette song. Isn't that ironic?
[04:49] B: You know, sort of.
[04:50] A: No. I was afraid to fly, and then I get in the plane, and it's the one plane that crashes. Like, really?
[04:54] B: Yeah.
[04:55] A: Isn't that ironic?
[04:56] B: Yeah. And it really.
[05:00] A: I got it so it's a. No, it's not. It's a worry about something that there's nothing for you to do.
[05:07] B: Is it?
[05:07] A: Even if it's true.
[05:10] B: What do you mean? Run that back.
[05:11] A: I know it's a weird thing I just said.
[05:13] B: Yeah, run that back.
[05:14] A: But the worry is about something that there's nothing for you to do.
[05:18] B: Yeah.
[05:18] A: Even if it's true.
[05:20] B: Okay.
[05:21] A: All right. There's nothing right now, Elizabeth, that you can do to prevent a violent death later. There's nothing for you to do right now.
[05:28] B: Right.
[05:29] A: So I got that. Because I made it through. Now I'm doing the right thing. It'd be ironic if I actually had a violent death.
[05:34] B: Right.
[05:34] A: And now I'm worried about that I'll have a violent death. But in this moment right now, when you're experiencing some of the angst about it, there's absolutely nothing for you to do.
[05:42] B: Right.
[05:43] A: To solve it. Right. And that's what I'm understanding a little bit more, is that the anxiety is a lot of worry about what could or what might.
[05:51] B: Right.
[05:52] A: And whether I'll be okay in handling it.
[05:55] B: Right. And misreading things. I guess it's a lot of assuming, you know.
[06:04] A: Well, it's a lot of trying to forecast.
[06:08] B: Yeah.
[06:09] A: So just check with the forecasters here. How often do they get it right?
[06:15] B: I mean, it depends on where you.
[06:17] A: Are, but how often do they get it right? Not very often.
[06:22] B: Not really.
[06:22] A: They say it's going to rain or there's a percentage chance of it and it doesn't.
[06:26] B: Right. Correct.
[06:28] A: Right. So they don't get it right. Very often. They know where a hurricane is. They have no fucking idea where the hell it's going.
[06:36] B: Right.
[06:37] A: Right.
[06:38] B: Yeah.
[06:39] A: They could make predictions. How often are the predictions? Totally not at all. What happened.
[06:46] B: They do that a lot, especially when it comes to hurricanes. They can't predict them.
[06:50] A: Right. So guess what? Life is uncertain. You can't predict it. And the farther we go away from right now, the less predictive accuracy we have.
[07:02] B: Yeah.
[07:02] A: So what you're experiencing, my words, is anticipatory anxiety. I'm worried about what could. Or what might happen, how I would handle it if it does.
[07:15] B: Yeah.
[07:16] A: So think of an OR in the or. The surgeon needs to know how to do the surgery, needs to know everything that could possibly go wrong with the surgery and how to fix it if it does. And even in that very small, confined, controlled environment, they can't plan for everything. Shit happens that they couldn't have ever anticipated.
[07:36] B: Yeah.
[07:37] A: Got it.
[07:37] B: Yeah.
[07:38] A: So I would imagine you went through a whole bunch of life where there was a whole shitload of uncertainty.
[07:44] B: Right.
[07:45] A: Where in certain situations, you weren't sure you were gonna be okay, survive, make it.
[07:49] B: Yeah.
[07:51] A: Right. So when somebody has a lot of uncertainty in life, what gets thrown into their future is. Well, I need to know how to handle uncertainty if it happens.
[08:02] B: Mm.
[08:04] A: Because. But the problem is that there's a part. Not all of you, but a part of you that doesn't know certain moments when you weren't sure you were gonna survive it, that you actually had already inside what you needed to survive it. And we know that with certainty because you're here.
[08:25] B: That's a whole riddle.
[08:26] A: Do you follow me with that?
[08:27] B: Absolutely.
[08:28] A: Like, the thing that we know with certainty is that despite you being worried whether you were going to survive those moments, you did. So if you survive, then what that means is you did, even then, have what you needed to make it through it.
[08:47] B: Yeah.
[08:47] A: So the problem is we want to get installed at a deeper level. Earlier moment that you had what you needed back then.
[08:56] B: Right.
[08:57] A: To move through what showed up, even though you weren't sure. Because as that gets installed in you at a deeper level. Not an up here level, but a deeper level, I stopped being so concerned about the future.
[09:12] B: Yeah.
[09:13] A: Because I know not here, but know I have what I need inside of me to move through whatever comes my way.
[09:24] B: I don't trust myself.
[09:26] A: I'm understanding that. See, I wonder what it would be like.
[09:29] B: Yeah.
[09:30] A: And see, isn't that weird?
[09:32] B: No.
[09:32] A: You said it isn't weird that you don't trust yourself.
[09:35] B: No. Because look at all my decisions. Like, when I know to go left, I know to go left, then I go right. Anyways, why? Like, today, the water, like, I'm. And then, like, I talked to Hope, like one of the advocates, and right when I walk onto the beach, I notice the waves. I can tell. I made sure there's no rip current. I see the yellow flag. I see all the people. There's not one person in the water, but I want to go in the water then, like all the rest of the girls. And then I'm getting scared because I. I guess I did trust me because I know I can swim. But then I was like, why would I do that to them? That's not good. So I made them get out of the water.
[10:17] A: You didn't make them get in?
[10:18] B: I did not make them get in, but I made it look like it was safer than what it was.
[10:22] A: I don't know whether that's True.
[10:23] B: I don't know either.
[10:25] A: I don't know whether. No. You just walked into the water.
[10:27] B: Yeah.
[10:28] A: Well, you go, I had more awareness by seeing the different cues.
[10:35] B: Right.
[10:36] A: About what the water was gonna be like. I've had more experience in water like that.
[10:43] B: Yeah. And it. Was it unsafe? Yes. And I went into water.
[10:47] A: I'm not so sure that, like, the weird part. Why I said it's weird that you don't, quote, unquote, trust yourself is the part that I think of as self is the part that's beating your heart.
[10:59] B: Yes.
[11:00] A: The part that's breathing for you.
[11:02] B: Right.
[11:02] A: The part that digests your food. The part that sweats, the part that responds to threat. This part. And I would be thinking it would be really useful to have a trusting relationship with yourself, but not a trusting relationship with others. See, oftentimes.
[11:20] B: At all.
[11:20] A: Well, oftentimes people go, I need to learn how to trust. And they think it's. I need to learn how to trust them.
[11:27] B: No. Yeah.
[11:28] A: But trust, Elizabeth, is a bad idea in the world that we live in.
[11:32] B: Yeah.
[11:33] A: Bad idea. Right. To think that nobody's gonna have. That somebody else is gonna have my best interest at all times is a bad idea. Even when my daughter was little and she wanted to show me something in a different part of the house, and she's pulling me, she goes, close your eyes. I'm gonna take you to a surprise.
[11:48] B: Yeah.
[11:49] A: I do this, right?
[11:50] B: Yeah.
[11:51] A: I know that she's not intending to bang me into the countertop, but I'm pretty sure that she's not also aware of how big I am in relationship to her and that she could.
[12:00] B: Right.
[12:01] A: Got it. So trust isn't over there. Trust is in me. Trust is in me that I'm able to notice things sooner than later.
[12:09] B: Mm.
[12:10] A: We all have fire detectors. Not because we think our house will catch on fire, but we're also not certain that it won't. And it's not there to prevent it. It's there to let us know at the earliest sign of smoke, to give.
[12:24] B: You an extra second to get out.
[12:26] A: The earliest sign of smoke.
[12:27] B: Yeah.
[12:27] A: Not even an extra second. I want the fucker to go off immediately. I don't want it to wait until half the house is inflamed. Okay, dude, time to go.
[12:35] B: Yeah, fair enough.
[12:37] A: Got it. So you haven't been trusting yourself because you can look back and go, oh, look at past decisions I made that weren't great for me. Right. But your past doesn't dictate your future.
[12:54] B: Right.
[12:55] A: Who do you Want to be? How do you want to be when we're done? See, I would say how I want you to be is someone who's free from the effect that the past has had on her.
[13:06] B: Right.
[13:06] A: The how I want you to be is deeply connected to that inner knowing that I have what I need.
[13:14] B: Yeah.
[13:15] A: Right.
[13:15] B: Yeah.
[13:16] A: I wanted you to be much more emotionally present so that you're alert and aware, but in a relaxed way.
[13:26] B: Yeah.
[13:27] A: Got it.
[13:28] B: That's what I want to be.
[13:30] A: That knowing that it's not so much about what's going to show up, because I know I'll move through it in a way that's best for me.
[13:41] B: Yeah. And to make that a decision and be like, okay, I stand by it. It was wrong, but I'm not embarrassed by it. And it's the decision I made.
[13:49] A: Watch. The idea is different. We look at a decision as a thing.
[13:56] B: Yeah.
[13:57] A: So I made a decision. It's this thing. Just like I have a belief it's a thing. But is a belief a thing? Is a decision a thing, or is it a process? It's a process of ongoingly believing or ongoingly deciding. So it's not about always having to make the right decisions. Right. It's not about having to always make the right choice. It's about making the decision. Right. It's about when you recognize that it isn't the right decision. Adjusting.
[14:37] B: Okay.
[14:38] A: Not going down with the ship. Well, I decided it, so.
[14:41] B: Oh, yeah. I guess so.
[14:43] A: Right.
[14:43] B: Yeah.
[14:43] A: Life is constantly adjusting. Like, if we're going up a mountain and I'm like, well, this is the path we're going, but we see this other path that's a little bit better. And this one looks like it's. No, we decided on this one. Yeah. But this is a better. No, I made it. Can I not decide to go down the other.
[15:01] B: Yeah.
[15:02] A: Right. And the idea about any path is whenever you realize that you're going the wrong way, no matter how far you've gone down the path, turn around. It's the old Turkish proverb.
[15:12] B: Okay.
[15:13] A: Right. So let's think of a you who's much more emotionally present.
[15:17] B: Yeah.
[15:18] A: So that she's dealing with what is without the emotional effect of what has that at a deeper level, your brain is seeing something that might be similar to what you went through, but is also seeing it as different, not identical. Because when you get triggered by going over the bridge, that's your brain. Confusing. Similar as identical. And then the beating myself up, that we never should have stopped or I should have Known better. How could I not have known that that's what he was going to do? Got it.
[15:53] B: Yeah.
[15:54] A: So we want to get you to lighten up on you a little bit, because that's the other part with all this, is that you've been beating yourself down going, you idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot. How could you not know him? You put yourself in. Got it.
[16:05] B: Yeah.
[16:06] A: That's why there's the irony, because now that I'm finally in a position that I'm doing better for myself, that's when it's gonna fuck up. That's why. But we want you to lighten up on the earlier you.
[16:17] B: Yeah.
[16:17] A: We want you to be more. Okay. More comfortable in your own skin.
[16:22] B: Yeah.
[16:23] A: More at peace in here. And that's why it's the connection to knowing. And the only problem is, again, not all of you, but there's a part of you that doesn't know you made it through those difficult moments that you weren't sure you were going to be able to. And we want to get that part to really fully realize that you made it through it and that you're okay. Not only are you okay now, you're on your way to becoming even better.
[16:52] B: Yes.
[16:54] A: Got it.
[16:55] B: Yes.
[16:56] A: Because you're doing right steps and taking right actions. You're changing your life for the better. Right?
[17:04] B: Yeah.
[17:04] A: Got it.
[17:05] B: Yeah.
[17:06] A: So that's the you that I'm seeing.
[17:08] B: Yes.
[17:09] A: Then all we want to do is we want to get your body into the right states for healing, which are always states of rest. So as you may have done something similar with John, I have people just slightly lower their jaw, rest their tongue at the bottom of their mouth, and then go ahead and begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and then out a little bit longer. And you'll notice that as you're intentionally breathing in this way, slower, deeper, longer, that it's different than how you automatically breathe. And you might even notice that your body's becoming a little bit more calm. Right. As your body's calming down, we're going to expand awareness so that we notice more space. So you see my nose, you see my fingers? You stay looking at my nose. My fingers move out all the way. You see them wiggling with the sides of your eyes. That's right. You're aware of the space towards the windows and doors, between, beyond, under and behind. And as you check in your body, as you're more aware of the space, how's your body feeling now? Relaxed.
[18:25] B: Yeah.
[18:25] A: And as your body's relaxed, the first thing we want to do is we want to think about that moment on the skyway, because there's two pieces that are going on with that one. One piece is that you're looking back at that earlier, you going, you fucking idiot. You should have known better and never stopped. Got it. Right. And were you the one driving? No, no, he was driving. Right. But if you knew he was going to stop and get out of the car, you might not have ever gotten in the car.
[18:53] B: If I would have known he was suicide, I would have just given him the pills.
[18:56] A: That's right.
[18:58] B: So we didn't.
[18:59] A: You didn't know.
[19:00] B: Yeah.
[19:01] A: Right. So if we were to float back along the timeline prior to you ever getting in the car, prior to him ever stopping, prior to that ever happening, and if you had known back then what, you know now.
[19:12] B: Yeah.
[19:14] A: Right. Would you have done the same thing? Would you have just gotten in the car and then when he got out, saw him get out and then come. Oh, my.
[19:24] B: I don't know. I don't even think I'd be in the car.
[19:27] A: He wouldn't have even gotten in the car. That's right.
[19:29] B: Okay.
[19:30] A: You follow me with that?
[19:31] B: Yes.
[19:32] A: Right. So if we could float back along the timeline and you would know that by getting in that car, we're gonna stop at the skyway and then watch him jump over it. If you had known all of that was gonna happen, would you have gotten in the car? Got it.
[19:44] B: Yeah.
[19:46] A: So part of what's been going on is from here, you've been thinking you should have known better.
[19:52] B: Yeah.
[19:53] A: But if we floated back along the timeline, prior to that ever happening, you didn't know because if you had, you never would have gotten in the car. Got it.
[20:03] B: Yes.
[20:03] A: And we can't have guilt and regret, remorse, shame over something I didn't know was gonna happen.
[20:11] B: I was so selfish.
[20:13] A: You didn't know it was gonna happen. No. That's the meaning.
[20:16] B: Yeah.
[20:17] A: There was nothing about that. That was selfish.
[20:20] B: I mean, it was selfish.
[20:23] A: What was selfish?
[20:26] B: He didn't even want to go. I made him go because we had to go to the doctor so we could get more pills, and I had.
[20:32] A: Pills, and I made him go to the doctor.
[20:35] B: I made him drive to the doctor.
[20:36] A: And did he drive to the doctor?
[20:38] B: No, he didn't. I did not mean a lot. But he stopped on the sky.
[20:42] A: He didn't, did he? So he wasn't going to the doctor.
[20:45] B: He wasn't going to the doctor.
[20:46] A: That's right. So that had nothing to do with you being selfish?
[20:49] B: Right.
[20:51] A: Right. See, selfish is one of those things that I'm thinking back going, dummy me, what would it be like for you to lighten up on you? Because as you said, you wouldn't have gotten in the car, you might have given him some pills if you thought that the pills would have been the thing that solved his suicidal thoughts, which might or might not have.
[21:13] B: Yeah.
[21:14] A: Do you follow me with that?
[21:15] B: I do.
[21:16] A: So because your brain can second guess and come up with alternatives, it tries to make you do it right. And that's where the error has been. So first, what would it be like for you to lighten up on the earlier you and get it that she didn't know. Right. And that it's okay that she didn't know because she didn't know. How could she have known she didn't know. Right. So close your eyes, think back to that earlier you and let her know that you know she just didn't know that it was going to lead to. That had nothing to do with being selfish. Everything to do with her not knowing. Right. So that the earlier you gets it as this earlier you is getting it. Elizabeth, check inside your body. How's your body feeling now?
[22:17] B: Lower body feels tense, but my upper body feels relaxed. Now my upper body feels tense too.
[22:25] A: What's it feeling? Oh, good. What's it feeling tense about?
[22:31] B: I feel like I'm popping in and out of both. Like I relax and then I feel tense.
[22:36] A: Yeah. So as you're educating the earlier you and you're letting her know that you know that she didn't know had nothing to do with her being selfish or greedy and everything to her with everything to do with her not knowing that that was his mental state. Right. Right. As the earlier you gets the information from you, what happens to the earlier you's face? Does she look so troubled? No, she doesn't look so troubled anymore. Does she not trouble?
[23:24] B: Yeah.
[23:26] A: No. As she's learning from you that you know she didn't know. Right. So that you lighten up on the earlier you. Right. That it wasn't any intention, it's just that she didn't know. Right. What happens to the earlier you's face? I'm curious if you're noticing whether she's lightening up.
[24:09] B: I wouldn't say lightning, but what would you say? I made her stop looking down over the bridge and look at me. And then from there I'm just going. It took me a while to stop looking, being there, looking down like I'm trying to picture myself.
[24:30] A: No, you want to be here?
[24:32] B: Yeah, I want to be here.
[24:33] A: Here with me.
[24:34] B: Yeah, I'm here too, but I'm trying to be there.
[24:37] A: I don't want you to be there. I just want you to educate the younger you prior to ever getting into the car that you know, she didn't know that's what it was gonna leave lead to see if she knows prior to ever getting in the car that, you know, that she didn't know. And yeah, we don't like that she had to go through that experience then based on what was going. But it's because she didn't know what happens to the earlier you getting that you know that she was in that car because she didn't know that's what it was going to lead to.
[25:13] B: Yeah.
[25:14] A: Does she look so troubled?
[25:22] B: No.
[25:23] A: No. Right. So continue to breathe a little bit slower and deeper and exhale a little bit longer. We want to be getting in information to deeper parts of your. Your brain because there's lots of things that you look back at mad at you for having done or having not done because from this perspective, you can see what it led to. The cool part is what we didn't know because that you on the bridge wasn't sure she was ever going to be okay with that. Right. And we might not be okay that it happened, but notice how you're becoming more okay even though it happened.
[26:13] B: Yeah.
[26:14] A: Right. We don't like that it did. But we're also clear, not at an up here level, but really embodied that it couldn't have not happened. Right. And as you're realizing it now, again, check. How's your body feeling?
[26:34] B: Feeling good.
[26:36] A: It is, isn't it? Right. Isn't that kind of interesting? Right. So we have some news to get in. There are going to be particular moments. You might have already unplugged them. They might have been ones that you touched on with John or other people. But there are moments where you weren't sure you had what you needed to survive. There are moments that you were going through stuff that you weren't sure you were going to make it. We want to take a couple of those moments so that we can re educate the younger you because where are the parts frozen? And you may know a little bit of this. When we go through shocking moments, it freezes the brain where it's frozen. It tends to be a short gif of the worst part of the worst part of the worst part. And that's the one that replays over and over and over again in my head. That's why when I get triggered, it's to that replaying gif. Does that make sense that GIF is on? Because part of your brain doesn't know that that moment was over, that you survived it, that you're okay. So I always liken it that we're getting in good news. Good news to the part of the brain that still thinks we're at war, still thinks the awful moment's happening, still thinks the knife blade is at my throat, still thinks. Because that's what happens with those moments. Right? You may have touched them, so they're already diminished. But what we want to do is the third part of educating the younger you, that despite that being a scary, awful, upsetting, horrific moment, you had what you needed to make it through it. You had what you needed to survive. And even if somebody says to me, yeah, but I just barely, I go, well, in the world of survival, you either survived or you didn't.
[28:17] B: Absolutely.
[28:18] A: There's no barely.
[28:21] B: That's the trick of it. It's like after survival, then it's living that there's something after. There has to be something after that.
[28:31] A: Well, the afterwards is being present.
[28:34] B: Oh, yeah.
[28:35] A: And being more at peace and being more okay. Designing my future. How do I want to be? It's a 10x, not a 2x. It's not based on my past and where I'm at right now. It's really declaration, who do I want to be? How do I want to be in the world?
[28:55] B: Yeah, exactly.
[28:56] A: How do I want my life to go? That's why we're seeing a you who's free, who's present, who's peaceful, who's clear, who's light, who totally knows in a deep rooted sense that she's got what she needs. So as she encounters stuff, she. She moves through it in the way that's best for her. And she adjusts the course based on what's happening. Yeah, got it.
[29:18] B: And it sucks. Yeah, that's what I want.
[29:22] A: Yeah, that's where we're headed.
[29:23] B: Yeah, that's where we're headed.
[29:25] A: Right?
[29:25] B: Yeah.
[29:25] A: Right.
[29:26] B: Because I feel like I am there. And then, you know. Is that a chest?
[29:31] A: Could be. I mean, it opens up.
[29:34] B: Yep, that's what it. Yeah.
[29:36] A: Come on. Yeah, Yeah, I squirreled. No, you actually did a good thing.
[29:42] B: Cool.
[29:43] A: It's a break state.
[29:44] B: Cool.
[29:45] A: Right, so one more time, do this. Deep breath in, long exhale. Right. One more deep breath in, long exhale. Eyes are resting, closed. As eyes rest closed, you also rest. You're aware of your breath. You're aware of my voice. You're aware of background sounds. You're aware of how it feels to be seated on the couch in the way. You are noticing all of this at the same time. Your unconscious is responding to you, organizing towards the you're becoming more okay in. You are lightening up. And the neat thing is this doesn't require work or effort on your part. It's more like what happens with a cut that from the inside out, your body does all the healing. Your unconscious now is responsive and interested in working in ways that are best. And therefore it knows which moments, experiences and things that you've gone through that would be useful to unplug and clear that as those moments are unplugged and clear, they free up energy and resources within you to begin to organize towards the you present light free, dealing with things with more flow, knowing that you have what you need. All of this is transpiring now as you rest. That's right. And so whenever you're ready and you can take your time slowly find your way back up and up and up so that when you're ready, you'll take a nice big deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. And again, the short moments, eyes were closed. What were you noticing within yourself?
[32:22] B: That I feel peaceful.
[32:24] A: You do feel peaceful, don't you?
[32:26] B: Yeah.
[32:27] A: Isn't that a good news thing?
[32:29] B: Yes.
[32:29] A: Yeah. Right. As your body's feeling more peaceful, your unconscious is going to travel back down the timeline of those uncertain moments. The you weren't sure you were going to make it or had what you needed to survive it. And it's going to narrow and pinpoint a particular moment that would be useful for us to unplug and clear what moment's coming to mind.
[32:54] B: I didn't have any.
[32:56] A: You didn't? Isn't that weird? Interesting, right? Because lots of moments have already been unplugged good with John, haven't they? Just a couple. Only two. Just a couple. Well, what's another one that hasn't yet gotten unplugged that would be useful to clear up for you? You know, it's all those things because you get the discomfort of the trigger and you feel it and what does it take you towards what moments coming to mind around, gosh, I need to not trust or shouldn't or what does this. But if they do that and this and that and that, and then it's going to be. And I have to do all that mental gymnastics that you're doing, I want you to get to the discomfort. Feel a little bit of that feeling. Let the feeling tone guide you back. Let the feeling tone grow you younger and earlier. Let it take you back towards one of the first times you had that same kind of feeling. The content, meaning what it's about might be very different, but the feelings the same. And what does it take you back towards? What moments coming to mind. Younger, earlier. Younger. Right. Yeah. Think there's.
[34:21] B: There's more with what I have done.
[34:24] A: Oh, good.
[34:25] B: Is that. That's not good.
[34:26] A: Why? No, it's really good. Do you know why it's really good? Why? Well, because now it just came to mind.
[34:35] B: Okay.
[34:36] A: Something that you did.
[34:37] B: Something I did.
[34:38] A: That you have regrets and remorses, wishing you hadn't.
[34:41] B: Yeah.
[34:42] A: Yeah. So that one happened when?
[34:44] B: 2009.
[34:46] A: Good. So first question. Would it be okay for you to no longer be troubled by it?
[34:50] B: Yeah.
[34:51] A: Right. And the feeling tones when you think about it. Is it like, you know, anger, guilt. Good. So would it be okay to get the guilt going?
[34:57] B: Yeah.
[34:58] A: And if the guilt gone, does it mean what you did was okay?
[35:01] B: No.
[35:01] A: Right. Got it.
[35:03] B: Yes.
[35:04] A: You get to be okay even though that wasn't right. Makes sense.
[35:07] B: Yeah.
[35:08] A: You're being okay doesn't mean what you did then was okay.
[35:10] B: Yes.
[35:11] A: Right. But people do better being okay. Right. I don't know whether you have to do anything with it, but we're gonna unplug it.
[35:19] B: Okay, good.
[35:20] A: Right. So that moment, 2009, you're where, by the way, you've done something after that.
[35:25] B: Yeah.
[35:25] A: That was fun. Or at least more enjoyable than that. Like being in the water today. That was more enjoyable than that. Something else. Right. One other thing you've done recently.
[35:34] B: Eat ice cream in the car.
[35:35] A: Eating ice cream in the car. Good. And one other thing.
[35:38] B: Reading my book.
[35:40] A: Reading your book. Eating ice cream, going in the water. All those moments after that, part of brain doesn't know any moment beyond it.
[35:46] B: Cool. And planting in the garden.
[35:48] A: So we have good news. Planting in the garden. We got good news to get into that part of the brain. So in 2009, when it happened, you're.
[35:54] B: Where I am in Coral Shores.
[35:56] A: She's in Coral Shores. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[35:58] B: Daytime.
[35:59] A: Daytime. And like, are you inside or outside?
[36:01] B: I'm about to go inside.
[36:02] A: So you're about to walk inside. Right. Good. And then what happened next? So you go knock on the door or you just open it?
[36:07] B: No, knock on the door.
[36:07] A: So you knock on the door. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[36:09] B: The guy answered.
[36:10] A: So the guy answered. Right. Good. Then what happened?
[36:12] B: And then we just go to his living room.
[36:15] A: So you walk in. Right. Good. Right. And then what happened next? You go to the living room.
[36:18] B: I asked him to go get me some drugs.
[36:20] A: Right. So you go, hey, can you go get this for me? Right. Good. And he goes to where it was.
[36:24] B: Right.
[36:24] A: And then what happened next? How you doing right now?
[36:26] B: I'm good.
[36:27] A: Yeah?
[36:27] B: I like how you click because it, like, brings here. Yeah.
[36:30] A: Hi. Right. Yeah. Then what happened next?
[36:34] B: I unlocked the door.
[36:36] A: You unlocked his door?
[36:37] B: The front door.
[36:38] A: The front door. Because he locked it after you walked in. So then you unlocked the door. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[36:42] B: And then I let my friend in.
[36:44] A: Well. And then they came in.
[36:45] B: Yeah.
[36:45] A: Right. So then they opened the door and they came in. Right. Good. And he was still back getting this stuff.
[36:49] B: Yeah.
[36:49] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[36:51] B: I got my friend to be behind the.
[36:55] A: So then they hid.
[36:56] B: Yeah.
[36:57] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[36:58] B: And then I had said pretty much signal to him to get the guy.
[37:04] A: Right. He came back with the drugs.
[37:06] B: He walked back in the room.
[37:07] A: He walked back in the room. Right. And then the guy came out and grabbed him. Right, Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[37:12] B: We fought.
[37:13] A: You? He fought the guy.
[37:14] B: Yeah.
[37:15] A: And then you helped, too.
[37:16] B: Yeah.
[37:16] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[37:18] B: The guy grabbed the one that we were trying to rob. Grabbed a machete.
[37:22] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. Now that was scary. Right. And then what happened next?
[37:26] B: And then I got cut up.
[37:28] A: Right. So he hit you with it. Right. Good. And that hurt. Right. And then what happened next?
[37:32] B: Push him down.
[37:33] A: Yes.
[37:33] B: Tight end.
[37:34] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next? And stole his stuff, grabbed all the drugs. Right. Good. Then what happened?
[37:40] B: And then ran off.
[37:41] A: And then ran off. Right. And then that moment ended, sort of. Yeah, well, there was more to it. Well, no, no, that moment was over.
[37:51] B: Yeah.
[37:51] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more enjoyable.
[37:53] B: Yes.
[37:54] A: Like eat ice cream or read a book or go in the water.
[37:56] B: Yeah.
[37:57] A: Now, notice you were telling me it a little bit of discomfort, but less because you're here.
[38:01] B: Right.
[38:02] A: You may know, but when we go backwards, it unplugs it.
[38:05] B: Right.
[38:05] A: Did you know that watch. What happened? John said that watch you go, we got, you know, eating the ice cream, we got reading the book. We got being in the water.
[38:15] B: Yeah.
[38:16] A: Right. And then before that, you guys had run off, and then you grabbed all the stuff, and then you tied him down, and then you got him on the ground. And then we lost the machete. And then he swung the machete. And you got hit, and then you guys were fighting, and then he had come out, and then the guy came back, and then they were hiding, and then you let him in, and then you unlocked the door, and then he went to get the drugs, and then you walked in, and then he had opened the door, and then you had knocked on the door. And then before that, you'd gone there, and then before that you were doing whatever you're doing.
[38:41] B: You're really good. I will never play one of those games with you. The memory game thing. Like a memory game.
[38:50] A: So you can. Right. As I went backwards, notice what happened. Notice what happened.
[38:57] B: I laughed.
[38:59] A: Well, you didn't start to feel the same, did you?
[39:00] B: Not at all.
[39:01] A: You can remember doing that?
[39:02] B: Yes.
[39:03] A: You can also remember putting on your sweater.
[39:05] B: Right.
[39:05] A: But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your sweater on today, and I went, elizabeth, stop putting on your sweater, you would look at me and go, I'm not putting on my sweater. Right. Because you know, there's a difference.
[39:15] B: Right?
[39:16] A: Right. So you can remember doing that. Letting them in, fighting, the guy, stealing drugs. You can remember doing that. You can also remember putting on your sweater.
[39:22] B: Right?
[39:23] A: Elizabeth, stop putting on your sweater. Say, I'm not putting on my sweater.
[39:26] B: Yeah, I'm not putting on.
[39:27] A: Well, then stop putting on your necklace. Say, I'm not putting on my necklace.
[39:30] B: Say that I'm not putting.
[39:31] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt.
[39:34] B: You're not putting on your shirt.
[39:35] A: Well, then you stop robbing that guy. Say, we're not robbing that guy.
[39:37] B: We're not robbing.
[39:38] A: Well, then stop doing that. Say, we're not doing that.
[39:40] B: We're not doing.
[39:41] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[39:43] B: It is not happening.
[39:44] A: Yeah, it no longer exists.
[39:46] B: It no longer exists.
[39:47] A: And as that gets in, what do you notice?
[39:50] B: I do feel better.
[39:51] A: Isn't that weird?
[39:52] B: That is weird and cool.
[39:55] A: Right?
[39:56] B: There's a lot of shit. Then.
[39:59] A: Here'S the cool part. Once you get the ball rolling, it's easy.
[40:02] B: Yeah. Like. Yeah. Okay.
[40:05] A: Right. So now, as you're thinking about that one, is there bad feelings?
[40:09] B: No.
[40:09] A: Right. Because back then, with all the factors that were going on with you then, you did what occurred for you to do. And although we don't like it that you did it right then, now we also know that back then, with all those factors, you couldn't have not done that. Got it?
[40:26] B: Yes.
[40:26] A: And as that's clear, notice what happens to those feelings.
[40:32] B: Yeah. They don't feel.
[40:33] A: It's how they're not there. The happiness. Right.
[40:36] B: Yeah.
[40:37] A: Because you're gonna do better by feeling good. Right. What's another moment that comes to mind?
[40:48] B: I can't think of anything.
[40:49] A: Isn't that weird?
[40:50] B: It is weird.
[40:51] A: I know.
[40:52] B: Will it stay like that forever?
[40:54] A: Forever and ever and ever.
[40:55] B: You promise?
[40:56] A: You're so funny. No. Because all you are is always changing.
[41:00] B: Damn it.
[41:02] A: But I can tell you that when you unplug a memory, the brain doesn't read it as happening. You weren't feeling guilty about it because your brain wanted you to feel bad. You were feeling guilty about it because emotionally your brain was trying to motivate you to get you to stop doing that. Yeah. The timing is all out of whack. So I'm going to simply say to you, well, then, stop robbing that guy in 2009. You're going to go, there's nothing to be done. Right. So say that there's nothing to be done. No. Stop robbing him in 2009. Quick. Say, there's nothing. No. Come on, we'll go together. Hurry. Come on, come on.
[41:32] B: There's nothing to be done.
[41:33] A: Why? Because it no longer exists.
[41:34] B: Say that it no longer exists.
[41:36] A: Right. And notice how it's not there.
[41:38] B: Right. The feeling that makes sense.
[41:40] A: It's not there.
[41:41] B: It's not there.
[41:42] A: Right. You're becoming more okay in you.
[41:45] B: Yes.
[41:45] A: Right. What's another one of those moments of things that you've done that you're like, there's so many. Well, good, let's just do another. There's so many, but I can't remember any. Maybe there's not so many anymore.
[41:57] B: I hope not.
[41:58] A: We'll just check, see if there is. See, because the cool part is once your brain starts to get something, it's really a one time learner and it likes to generalize. Once I learned how to tie a pair of sneakers, I didn't have to relearn how to do it on other colors.
[42:15] B: Right. That makes sense.
[42:17] A: Right. It's easier for the brain to generalize fully and scaffold it all around when we do more than one. You know if you've ever played the Wheel of Fortune?
[42:27] B: No.
[42:28] A: Well, you've seen it.
[42:29] B: Yes.
[42:29] A: It's a lot easier to get what the phrase is when more letters are turned over.
[42:34] B: Oh, yeah, Absolutely.
[42:35] A: Right. We get the phrase and we got one letter turned over. Good luck.
[42:39] B: Right?
[42:39] A: Yeah.
[42:39] B: It's not gonna happen. I mean, it could. I've seen it.
[42:42] A: Yeah, but not very. I'd like to solve what? We have one letter. We got no letters. I'd like to solve it. What?
[42:51] B: I haven't seen it with no letters, but I've seen it with, like, the one or two. Just one letter. What?
[42:58] A: Yeah, but there might be another one or a moment of something that happened to you where you've had bad feelings that had happened to you.
[43:09] B: Why can't I think of any?
[43:12] A: I don't know.
[43:13] B: Or keep them locked.
[43:14] A: I don't know whether that's true.
[43:16] B: What?
[43:17] A: That you keep them locked.
[43:19] B: You think I keep them unlocked? They just come back.
[43:22] A: I don't know whether you keep them at all.
[43:26] B: Is that good or bad?
[43:27] A: I don't think it's up to you.
[43:29] B: Right.
[43:32] A: I don't think you're the thinker of your thoughts.
[43:34] B: I'm not.
[43:35] A: That's right. Your brain is.
[43:37] B: Yeah.
[43:37] A: So we're gonna not ask Elizabeth. We're gonna ask her unconscious.
[43:41] B: Okay.
[43:42] A: To travel back down the timeline of shit that's happened in her life, whether it be stuff that she did or stuff that happened to her that is related. That, as we clear it, clears up this whole, like, angst, oh, my goodness, I gotta turn the thing that goes on. Because the way we get to it isn't by logic. We get to it by feeling. So think about being in a situation when this guy says this thing and does it in that way. Then I gotta do, like, get that whole contorted mental gymnastic thing and feel the discomfort. Follow the feeling tone. Notice how it takes you to a moment. I know. Isn't that cool? See, you just tried to get into it through wrong access.
[44:21] B: Yeah.
[44:21] A: It's like when you talk to a guy, you can't ever ask him how he feels because he's a dude. He goes, what do you mean, how do I feel? I'm a guy. I don't feel. You have to ask him what does he think? And then he'll tell you how he feels.
[44:31] B: Oh, that's logic.
[44:34] A: So that moment. It's a good tip, right? It's another. Yeah. So that moment happened. You're how old? Where? When? How long ago?
[44:43] B: Not that long ago.
[44:45] A: No. Good.
[44:46] B: Probably 38.
[44:47] A: Yeah. So a few years ago. Ish. Right. And you're wearing. What happened?
[44:51] B: I was out by my work.
[44:54] A: So you're at work. Right. At the work. Right. Outside. Right. Daytime or nighttime?
[44:59] B: Daytime.
[44:59] A: Daytime. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[45:01] B: Got in the car.
[45:02] A: Right. So somebody was there.
[45:03] B: Yeah.
[45:04] A: Like, hey, you want to go for a ride? Like, of course I want to go for a Ride.
[45:07] B: Well, I was walking 41.
[45:09] A: Right. That's why I was going for the ride.
[45:11] B: Okay. Yeah. I had a baby kitten. I remember my kitten.
[45:15] A: So you had the kitten with you. You're like, yeah, no, it's me.
[45:17] B: And the cat just rescued the kitten.
[45:19] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right. Then what happened next?
[45:21] B: Got in the car. Yes, we did our first date.
[45:24] A: Right.
[45:24] B: At the Ramada.
[45:25] A: Right.
[45:25] B: And then after that, when he offered me more money.
[45:28] A: Right. Good job, good detail. To go somewhere else.
[45:30] B: Yeah.
[45:30] A: Right.
[45:30] B: Good stun hydraulic.
[45:32] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right. Where there's all those plants that hang from the ceiling.
[45:36] B: Yes, yes.
[45:36] A: Right.
[45:37] B: And then he. He pretty much brought me there so that he could hurt me.
[45:42] A: Oh, he brought you there and you went inside and he did what?
[45:46] B: Strangled me.
[45:47] A: Oh, so he put his arm around your throat. Right. That was scary.
[45:49] B: Yeah.
[45:50] A: Right. You weren't sure you were gonna breathe. Right. And he was saying, what were you. Were you standing around the ground?
[45:54] B: I was not. I was. We were in his car.
[45:56] A: So you're in the car. So he pulled in the parking lot and then he started.
[45:59] B: Right. He got in the back.
[46:01] A: He got in the back of it and went behind you. No, no, you both went into the back.
[46:05] B: Right.
[46:05] A: But then he was on top of you.
[46:06] B: You were having sex.
[46:07] A: Oh, good.
[46:08] B: He started choking me out.
[46:09] A: Right, while you were having sex?
[46:10] B: Yeah.
[46:11] A: Right. Because that's hot. No, I mean for some people maybe, but whatever. Alright, so he's doing that. That was scary because, like, he didn't have permission. Like, it would have been one thing if he's like, hey, is this something that you're into? And I like it. And then you said, yes, that's a whole different story. But he started doing it. That was scary. Right. Then what happened next? You were trying to push him off.
[46:26] B: Yeah.
[46:27] A: Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[46:29] B: Then the cat. The kitten? Yeah, the kitten attacked him.
[46:33] A: And then the kitten attacked him. Like, dude.
[46:34] B: And then I rolled out and then you.
[46:36] A: And then he got distracted. Then you roll out of the car.
[46:39] B: Yeah.
[46:39] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[46:41] B: Got the kitten.
[46:42] A: Right.
[46:42] B: Standing there naked.
[46:43] A: Yes. Good job, good detail.
[46:44] B: And then he drove around and tossed my stuff out.
[46:47] A: Good job, good detail. Right.
[46:49] B: And then that was it.
[46:51] A: Then it was over. And then later on, you did something more fun like eat ice cream.
[46:54] B: Right.
[46:54] A: Or read a book, Go to the beach and go in the water and Flowers.
[46:58] B: Right, Good.
[47:00] A: So we got planting the flowers. We got going to the beach. We got, you know, eating ice cream, reading the book. Right. Then before that, you Put your clothes back on. Then he dumped them out, and then he drove around. And then you had gotten 711 and.
[47:12] B: Called one of my friends to pick me up.
[47:14] A: Right.
[47:14] B: And pretend like nothing happened.
[47:16] A: Right. Because you're resourceful. I don't know whether it's about pretending nothing happened, but you were resourceful because you needed to get where you needed to go.
[47:23] B: Right?
[47:24] A: Right?
[47:24] B: Yeah.
[47:25] A: Right. And you went to a place that you could call to get somebody to get you. Yeah, Right. You're resourceful. Yeah, Right. Right. That's what had you roll out. Right. Because then you rolled out of the car, then you were underneath him, and the cat had attacked. And then before that, you were struggling, and then he had grabbed your throat, and it was hard to breathe. And then you guys were having sex, and then you got in the backseat. Then you drove to Sun Hydraulics. Then you had left the Ramada, and then you had been at the Ramada. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[47:53] B: Right.
[47:53] A: And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, what do you notice?
[47:58] B: I don't know. I blinked out. I blinked out.
[48:01] A: I'm not sure you did.
[48:02] B: I did.
[48:03] A: No, I don't know whether that's true, because watch. Think about it right now. What do you notice in terms of how it feels?
[48:11] B: Yeah, I don't feel anything.
[48:13] A: I know. That's not blanking out. That's unplugging.
[48:16] B: I feel like my brain has pressure.
[48:19] A: Oh, what's the pressure your brain has?
[48:21] B: I don't know. I can't explain it. That's what I meant. Like, I was.
[48:24] A: Oh, you mean it's, like, mind blowing, like, what's happening? It's changing.
[48:27] B: Mind blowing.
[48:28] A: It is kind of mind blowing, but that stuff can change. You can remember him doing that. You can remember putting your sweater on. Well, stop putting on your sweater. Well, stop me from putting on my watch. Say you're not putting on your watch. Well, then stop him from putting his hand on your throat. He's not doing that. Well, then stop it from happening. It's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[48:48] B: It no longer exists.
[48:49] A: Then you go, which is what we want to get in, by the way. That happening? Did that have anything to do with you?
[48:55] B: No.
[48:56] A: Right. But notice how back then it felt like it did.
[49:00] B: Wow.
[49:01] A: Like I was dumb. I should have known better. I shouldn't have put myself in that vulnerable situation. I should have known that that guy, who seemed to be a decent guy, was gonna try to choke me out and kill me or was thinking that somehow that was like some hot turn on because he watched porn one day. I don't know. Whatever it was. But it's not your choices. So you keep thinking that these are choices.
[49:20] B: Yeah.
[49:21] A: You were being impacted by the thoughts and the situation that were going on then. And you just did what occurred for you to do.
[49:27] B: Yeah.
[49:27] A: You couldn't have not done it. But that happening to you had nothing to do with you. It had everything to do with what was off with him.
[49:32] B: Right.
[49:33] A: But you didn't know that then. So close your eyes. Think back to the you let her know it's over, finished, completed, defeated. It no longer exists. Let her know that that happening had nothing to do with you. Everything to do with what was off with him. It's not about me. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Let her know that you survived it, that you're okay. Let her know how resilient and resourceful she is. Let her know that she actually remembered a number. Who the hell does that nowadays? Right? To get somebody to get her to take her where she needed to go. Right, Right. And it wasn't that she pretended like nothing happened. It's like, what am I supposed to do with that?
[50:13] B: Yeah.
[50:14] A: Right. Got it. You can open your eyes.
[50:16] B: That's how I felt. Like she was right.
[50:19] A: There was nothing else for me to do about that happening. Yeah, Right.
[50:24] B: Why do people guilt themselves? Not people, me. I'm asking me. For me.
[50:31] A: Because we have glitches and malfunctions in the way our brain works. And so two ways. One, our brain can conceive of alternatives to stuff that's already over and then cause feelings to motivate us to do the alternative thing. But we can't. But our logical brain goes, we're not feeling bad because it's trying to get us to do the alternative thing. We're feeling bad because you should have done the alternative, alternative thing.
[50:53] B: Right.
[50:54] A: But it's not that reason. It's because my emotional brain is trying to motivate me to do it. The timing is screwed up. So why guilt happens? Why resentment? Why all of those motions about things that are over are on is because of a timing error. And the timing error is that part of my brain never got that certain moments ended, that I survived them, that I made it through it, that I had what I needed, that I'm okay. Part of the brain doesn't know that you're here, that those are over. What we're getting in to, that part of the brain is how they're over. And why we're getting that in is then the resiliency gets installed. Because as at a deeper level, I get it that I had what I needed even back then when I wasn't sure I did. Right now I have what I need. Oh, wait a minute. If I had what I needed back then to get through those really difficult stuff, guess what? I already have what I need to deal with anything that might show up. And I know I'm going to deal with it better as I'm present and clear. And the thing isn't that you didn't know it here. The thing that was problematic is that you didn't fully know it here. That's what we're starting to do. That's what's starting to change. Because notice as you think about the moment, both what you did in that thing that happened to you, notice what's happening to the feeling.
[52:24] B: Yeah, it's different. It's a different feeling.
[52:26] A: Oh, how so? It's different.
[52:29] B: Peace.
[52:29] A: Like, oh, it's peace. Isn't that cool?
[52:33] B: It's definitely not guilt.
[52:35] A: Right.
[52:35] B: And it's not shameful.
[52:37] A: No. So even think about a situation where you might be encountering somebody. Maybe it's somebody at a meeting and they're sharing and you're thinking yourself what they said this thing. And it reminds me of that thing. And then I'm wondering, what if I do it now? How am I going to handle that? And what do you notice? Are you getting the feeling now? Notice how it's not happening.
[52:55] B: So the only thing I could think of, if there's a clock, you know, clocks are some kind of like, I don't know, it's like you can line it up better. Like that off thing. Like, things are clicking a little bit better.
[53:10] A: They are right now, aren't they? Yeah. Timing is getting adopted.
[53:13] B: Yeah.
[53:14] A: So it's adjusting and it's clicking in.
[53:16] B: Yeah.
[53:17] A: Right. And you're getting it because you're becoming more emotionally present. See, what we want is we want our emotions to match what's happening. And what you would recognize is that your emotions were from there. And then similar was being read as identical and then my emotions were higher. That's what you were recognizing has been problematic with what we're doing. You're becoming much more emotionally present, so your emotions are matching what's happening. You still have the wisdom from having made it through the stuff you made it through. And therefore you're much smarter and much more competent and capable. There's a reason that we have people Lead troops into battle who have already made it through battle.
[54:02] B: Yeah, that makes sense.
[54:06] A: You follow me with that?
[54:07] B: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.
[54:10] A: Right. Because they're right. Got it.
[54:13] B: Yeah.
[54:14] A: That's what's happening now is what's being installed is I already made it through battle. I'm good. I'm good with what's going to show up or what could show up. Because I got what I need and I'm aware. So I notice things better. Right, right. You weren't concerned about going in the water. Not because you blindly ran into the water. You checked the things that there were for you to check and you checked in. You knowing you're good. What you couldn't predict is whether they'd be good. I know, Right, right. And that was the concern because you care about them. Just like I know I could be fine in the water, but maybe the four year old probably not.
[54:56] B: Right? Yeah.
[54:59] A: That's any water not leaving the four year old by itself at all. Not just shark bait.
[55:06] B: But I know, like they might drown. Yeah, I know that too.
[55:12] A: Right. So as you check in, think about another scenario even just think about, you know, okay, we might be driving and we're headed over to St. Pete. Right. We've already made it through. We made it through the gate. You can kind of see the, you know, little rest area kind of go up. Right. There's now like all sorts of like curtains but. Right. You can go up.
[55:33] B: Yeah.
[55:34] A: Across the bridge. Right. And you're getting up to the top part and then.
[55:38] B: Yeah.
[55:39] A: And as you're thinking about it now, what are you noticing?
[55:41] B: Yeah. I don't have that feeling.
[55:42] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[55:44] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[55:46] A: Right. Because your brain is no longer confusing. Similar as identical. Mm, got it.
[55:54] B: Yes.
[55:55] A: Right. That's what's changing. And when those things change, they don't go back the other way. It's Santa Claus. When you get it that Santa's fake.
[56:07] B: Oh, yeah. There's no thinking that he's real again ever. Yeah.
[56:10] A: It's all pretend.
[56:12] B: Yes.
[56:12] A: When your brain gets that it's data, there's no thinking it's ever happening.
[56:16] B: Right.
[56:17] A: And the problem is that part of your brain didn't know that that was over. Part of your brain was beating you up for having not known better. Right. And then the other thing that came up. Oh, I must have been being selfish. Had nothing to do with that. You didn't know that that was what was going to happen because if you had, you wouldn't have gotten in the car. He had thought. And if he had. Had it been that it was just like he was in. But he was on his way to get more. So it wasn't that either. Right, right, right. The sucky part is that he had you be a part of it.
[56:52] B: Yeah.
[56:52] A: Would have been fine if he drove by himself.
[56:54] B: Right, right.
[56:58] A: Got it. But as you're getting it and even as you think about those other moments, the thing you did in 09, the thing that happened, notice how that's not causing the feeling. So even think about one of those scenarios. Do we need to trust others?
[57:11] B: No.
[57:12] A: Or do we need to know that you actually have what you need?
[57:15] B: Yes.
[57:16] A: Right. That you're seeing things more clearly, that your emotions are matching more of what's happening.
[57:22] B: Yeah.
[57:23] A: Yeah. Cool.
[57:24] B: Yeah.
[57:25] A: You did great today.
[57:26] B: Thank you.
[57:26] A: You're welcome.
[57:27] B: I feel better.
[57:28] A: Yeah, I bet. Yeah. Yeah. So your job? Homework? Only homework there is to do.
[57:35] B: Okay.
[57:36] A: Cool. Have some awareness.
[57:39] B: Yeah.
[57:39] A: Pay attention to what you notice that's new and different in terms of how you're feeling.
[57:45] B: Okay.
[57:46] A: In situations that normally would be, those things that set you off, they might for a moment and then go right away. Or they might happen and you might go through it and be like, hey, normally I would have been and I wasn't. Or you might go through it and after the fact, you're thinking, talking to somebody, going, hey, that normally would have been and it wasn't.
[58:05] B: Right.
[58:05] A: So I want you to pay attention to what you notice that's new and different. If there's other ones that pop, then, you know, it's very fast to get it better.
[58:12] B: Okay.
[58:13] A: Got it.
[58:14] B: Got it.
[58:14] A: Cool beans.
[58:15] B: Thank you.
[58:16] A: You're welcome. Come with me. We can head out here.
