[00:00] A: So today is the 29th of August, Elizabeth. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable, the recording might be made available in teaching and training others. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:12] B: Yes.
[00:13] A: Cool.
[00:14] C: All right.
[00:14] A: So what do I need to know? What do we want our time to do for you?
[00:18] D: So I graduated the program. Yes. So on to new, better things. But there's been a lot of, like, so with me getting my phone back and like.
[00:33] B: Yeah, yeah.
[00:34] D: But not that I did good right now, but. Yeah, but there's my tendencies, my, my manipulates, my character defects are coming in. That means that, like, I am trying to do things very in a new way, but my brain keeps being like, hey, it be so much easier. It's like I got the Mr. Hyde and Dr. Jekyll or the angel and the demon on, and it's. I've been struggling not to manipulate. And then, like, I found that, like, when I'm by myself is the worst. So I'm trying not to be by.
[01:18] A: Myself because that's when, like, that's when you're arguing with you, right?
[01:25] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[01:25] D: We'll just call it arguing with myself.
[01:27] B: Yeah.
[01:28] A: Or you're just really down on you. Or you're in the all of it.
[01:32] D: Like, I got. And then now I become more down on myself. Like, I was feeling like everything that I've been doing isn't enough. And it'd be so easy. And then, like, I.
[01:42] A: So easy to do what?
[01:43] D: To go back to manipulating and, like, how.
[01:47] A: Doing what? What would you do? Something that would be wrong.
[01:50] D: For example. So I created a Facebook account. And then people from my past seen it. And it's so easy. So easy. Like, they're just so easy. I'm like, don't you understand? I was sick. Like, you're a victim. Like, I feel like telling them you were a victim. Stop being a victim. Like, that easy. And I'm like, no, Elizabeth. Like, don't play there. Don't go there. It's not okay.
[02:17] C: Okay.
[02:17] D: And then I'm like, but I want a car. And I'm like, ah.
[02:21] A: Oh, and somebody could get you a car.
[02:24] D: Money.
[02:25] A: Get you money for a car.
[02:26] D: Exactly.
[02:27] A: Got it. And like, which that all got. That could happen. But that's not who you want to be at all, right? Okay.
[02:34] D: At all. And then it's like, then I start that. But I'm not doing enough. And I, I, I've gone on job interviews and haven't gotten any jobs. So then that, like, kind of, you know, made my self worth go down a lot.
[02:49] A: Okay.
[02:49] B: Yeah.
[02:50] D: And I talk about this with them, but I just feel like I have.
[02:52] A: Talk about this with them.
[02:54] D: Selah.
[02:55] A: Okay.
[02:56] B: Yeah.
[02:57] D: Sorry, I'm.
[02:58] A: You're doing fine. When you. When you say them, I want to know who.
[03:02] D: Yeah. So I've been up front with Selah about.
[03:06] A: About the thoughts that you've been having.
[03:07] D: And my feelings and how I feel less than and.
[03:11] B: Yeah.
[03:11] C: Yeah.
[03:12] A: And you'd like that to stop.
[03:13] D: Absolutely.
[03:14] A: So that you get to actually feel good about what you're doing.
[03:16] B: Yes.
[03:17] C: Right.
[03:17] A: That even though you've been having those thoughts and could have easily done that, you didn't. Right, right. And you wouldn't want to start to feel good about that.
[03:23] D: Right, right.
[03:24] A: Because what would it be like if you actually felt good? That even though you were having those thoughts, which makes sense to be having them because you're in the situation, you finally could.
[03:31] B: Yeah.
[03:31] A: That despite having them, you're not doing it.
[03:33] D: Right.
[03:34] A: You wouldn't want to start to feel really good about that.
[03:36] D: Right, Right.
[03:37] A: Because what would happen if you actually felt really good about what you've been doing?
[03:42] D: Maybe. Hey, it would feel like I was settling, kind of.
[03:50] A: It would feel like you were settling?
[03:51] D: Yes.
[03:52] A: If you were to actually feel good.
[03:54] D: Yeah.
[03:55] A: That despite having those thoughts, I'm not doing it somehow. That would be settling.
[04:00] D: I don't know.
[04:01] A: But see, isn't that a step in the way to who you want to be?
[04:05] D: Yes.
[04:06] C: Right.
[04:07] D: So why is it so.
[04:08] A: So I wonder what it would be.
[04:09] C: Right.
[04:10] A: So does it feel like it's settling if it's a step on the way to where you want to be?
[04:15] D: No.
[04:16] A: No.
[04:17] B: No.
[04:18] D: But there's something.
[04:19] A: Oh, good. Yeah. So what about you being okay?
[04:26] D: It's boring.
[04:27] A: What's boring?
[04:28] D: Me being okay?
[04:29] A: You being okay is boring, not boring.
[04:31] D: But there's just. I don't understand why I can't just be okay.
[04:38] A: Well, I don't know what you mean.
[04:40] D: I guess what I mean is that.
[04:41] A: It feels very uncomfortable when you feel okay. You feel uncomfortable?
[04:46] B: Yeah.
[04:47] A: It's uncomfortable to feel okay.
[04:49] B: Yeah.
[04:50] A: Okay. Because there's been lots of other chaos, conflict, drama.
[04:56] B: Yeah.
[04:56] A: And do you feel more familiar in that?
[05:00] D: Probably. Yeah, absolutely. 100.
[05:03] A: When you're not feeling that, does it feel like I don't have enough to do?
[05:07] B: Yes.
[05:08] D: And that I'm not.
[05:09] A: Or I'm not doing enough?
[05:11] D: Not doing enough.
[05:12] A: Okay. So when you're in a more settled, calm and neutral state, Feeling more okay in you.
[05:22] B: Yeah.
[05:23] C: You're feeling.
[05:23] A: Somehow feeling okay is me not doing enough.
[05:29] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[05:32] A: But don't you want to be feeling okay on the way to doing more all day?
[05:40] C: Right.
[05:41] A: So it starts with you feeling okay.
[05:46] C: Right.
[05:47] A: Because some days you're gonna have more than others in terms of energy or time.
[05:53] B: Yeah.
[05:54] A: Or space and room to do stuff in.
[05:56] B: Yeah.
[05:59] C: Right.
[05:59] A: So we want to include that too.
[06:01] B: Right.
[06:03] D: And like, I really don't want to miss. Then I battle back and forth of missing the light, not the life, but like the made up whatever in my head that makes it like. Like painting this pretty picture that that's not what the picture really looks like. But I don't know why it's plugged in. Is that a proper way of saying that?
[06:33] A: So let me make sure that I'm following you.
[06:35] D: Okay.
[06:36] A: You have been trying to make sense of. Understand why this thing is in my thoughts.
[06:48] B: Yeah.
[06:48] D: Like, why am I. Yeah. Why am I still glamorizing something that hurt?
[06:55] A: Are you glamorizing it?
[06:57] D: Yeah. Like, how so I.
[06:59] A: What do you mean by glamorized?
[07:01] D: I miss, like, the dance. Not the lifestyle, but like the. The dancing, the going to clubs, the mingling, the being seductive. And I just miss that.
[07:16] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[07:17] D: It's like a part. It was a part of me for a long time.
[07:20] A: Well, it was something you did. Not a part of you, but something you did for a long time. So something that you were used to doing that you stopped doing.
[07:27] C: Right, Right.
[07:29] A: But there are parts of your doing it that were enjoyable to do it.
[07:34] B: Yes.
[07:35] C: Right.
[07:36] A: That was all transactional.
[07:38] B: Yes.
[07:39] C: Right.
[07:39] A: I wonder how much more enjoyable it would be to do if it had nothing to do with transactional interaction.
[07:46] D: Right. And see, that's what I mean. I'm. I.
[07:49] A: That. That you could actually get, you know, maybe not right now because you can have everything you want for yourself in your life. It just not. Might not be all at once.
[07:58] B: Yes.
[07:59] A: Right. So. So. But you can set it up.
[08:02] B: Yeah.
[08:03] A: That you get to be all of that.
[08:05] B: Right.
[08:05] A: But in a committed relationship with a guy that you really like. That's a good guy.
[08:10] C: Right, right.
[08:11] A: Then all of that would be fine to do. Wouldn't it be seductive?
[08:15] B: Yeah.
[08:16] A: You know, seducing the guy that, like, you know, you're into. That's into you.
[08:20] B: Yeah.
[08:25] A: Sounds boring, Dr. Q. Oh, it does. To seduce somebody that.
[08:29] D: No, but it's.
[08:30] B: It.
[08:31] D: It's also like the. It's not even really the anything with anybody or like being a stripper. It's like, the dancing by yourself and helping, like. I don't know. I can't. It's really hard to explain.
[08:53] A: So your girls, like, the camaraderie.
[08:56] D: I don't know.
[08:58] A: The other girls there.
[09:00] D: Yeah.
[09:00] A: And, like, the energy.
[09:03] D: Yes.
[09:04] A: The time frame that you could do anything. You're young.
[09:08] D: Yeah.
[09:08] B: Is that what it is? Me, I miss being young.
[09:11] A: That.
[09:11] C: That.
[09:12] A: Yeah. That's the part that hasn't been being included.
[09:16] D: Okay.
[09:16] C: Right.
[09:17] A: Do you know what I miss that I can't do anymore? Play basketball. Oh, yeah, I played basketball. I played basketball in college. I played basketball into my 30s.
[09:27] D: Okay.
[09:28] A: I can't play basketball anymore. I missed basketball. Yeah, right.
[09:32] D: Exactly.
[09:33] A: I could do all of the things that I used to do because I was good at. I could, like, get through people. I could jump. I could move. I could.
[09:39] B: Yeah.
[09:39] D: And all that. Endurance.
[09:41] A: Yeah, I know.
[09:42] D: I missed that. I miss that.
[09:44] C: Right.
[09:45] A: So I can't do that anymore.
[09:47] D: Yeah.
[09:47] A: So what do I have to do? Can I dwell on and begrudge the fact that I don't have that part and I don't get to do that in my life anymore?
[09:58] D: Right.
[09:59] A: Or do I go, hey, you know, that part was a really great part. Those aspects. Not all of it, but those aspects. Those parts were fun.
[10:09] B: Yeah.
[10:10] A: And can those parts have been fun even if other stuff weren't?
[10:15] D: Yes.
[10:17] C: Right.
[10:18] D: Okay.
[10:19] A: So it's the reminiscing. Right. I don't get to do basketball anymore.
[10:24] C: Right.
[10:26] A: So that's something. Right. I have hurt both my shoulders golfing. So I did stem cell treatments three years ago on this one. I'm doing it on this one right now. Hopefully it heals, but I'm gonna see if I can do golf. But if I can't do golf, then I love playing golf. I'll miss not playing golf, but, you know, that's okay.
[10:49] D: So then you go on to the next part, like pickleball.
[10:51] A: I don't. Maybe I'll do pickleball. Right. Or I'll do something where. Like, what I'm doing now is I go with a group of guys and we lift weights. And then recently, the past two weeks, I've been doing the stairs every day. 20. I got. First it was five minutes, and then six, seven minutes. And then I've gotten up to it stops at 20 minutes. And my goal is to get over a hundred floors in 20 minutes. Holy crap.
[11:19] D: That's a. It's achievable.
[11:21] A: And I've done. I've done it. I haven't not. Yeah. I got to 99 today, when I got to 95.
[11:30] D: So replacement. And that's.
[11:33] A: So just don't. Just check it out right now.
[11:35] B: Yeah.
[11:36] A: Because you go, oh, it could be so easy. I could go right back into that. I could get this money from them for this little thing. And.
[11:44] C: And. And Right.
[11:47] D: But no, wait, hold on. Let me stop.
[11:49] C: Oh.
[11:50] D: So that's like where my brain takes it kind of to make it okay. Like, it's like the devil is talking in my ear. But it's that, like when somebody calls and it's like, it's just out of the blue. It's almost like you'd be easy to manipulate. I don't even have to have sex with them. It's. It's conversation dating. It's, you know, dressing up in a sexy, like, you know what I mean? That lure. That.
[12:34] C: Yeah.
[12:34] D: You know what I mean?
[12:35] C: Yeah.
[12:35] D: It's totally different. And nothing in my being wants that. Like, not even the money is.
[12:44] C: Right.
[12:44] A: You don't want that.
[12:46] D: It's not what I want.
[12:47] A: That's why it's been coming to mind.
[12:48] B: Right.
[12:49] D: Is that why it's like, not because.
[12:51] A: You want it, but to show you how much you don't want it?
[12:55] D: I hope so.
[12:55] A: Well, no. Check it out. Isn't that what it's been doing?
[12:58] B: Yeah.
[12:59] A: Because if it was showing up and you wanted it, you would have already done it. Okay, but see, you did the opposite. As it showed up, you exposed that it was showing up, you told that it was showing up, and you continued to do the thing that you wanted to do.
[13:15] D: So I'm winning.
[13:17] A: Aren't you? Well, I feel. Not just winning.
[13:19] D: It just scares me because I feel like I'm sick.
[13:22] A: No, you're changing it. Okay.
[13:25] C: Right.
[13:25] A: You are actively rewiring how your brain is organizing stuff and response to that stuff. Because that's what's changing in here.
[13:37] B: Yeah.
[13:38] C: Right.
[13:38] D: And it did. It feels good to tell them I'm not the same.
[13:41] A: Like, no, you're not the same.
[13:43] D: Whoever you.
[13:43] A: That doesn't. So that doesn't mean that you're not going to have thoughts.
[13:48] D: Okay?
[13:49] C: Right.
[13:49] A: But what. And we can't change or get rid of the thoughts once those kinds of thoughts have started.
[13:57] D: Right.
[13:57] A: Like, we can't consciously go, I'm going to think these thoughts instead.
[14:01] D: Right. I tried.
[14:02] A: It doesn't work that way. So we want to have a different thing because you've also been being disturbed. Meaning along with those thoughts of doing that, that's why it's represented as the devil. Like, it's not represented as like, you know. Yeah, you know, Giorgio Monte model.
[14:18] D: Right.
[14:19] A: It's represented as a devil.
[14:24] C: Right.
[14:24] A: So it also then when you're having those kinds of thoughts, it's causing discomfort.
[14:28] D: Right.
[14:29] A: So here's the thing that we're going to start doing. So two things. Your brain never stops thinking, right? So it is always thinking. Even at night, it's thinking. Even when you take a break, it's thinking. Your brain is never not thinking. What controls the quality, the kinds of and the types of thoughts you're having is based on the physiology and biochemistry that your body is in.
[14:57] D: Right.
[14:57] A: Okay. All of that is controlled by a thing called the vagus nerve.
[15:02] D: Okay.
[15:03] A: So the one right here, the vagus nerve, right. Is the one that connects to all of the vital organs in the body.
[15:10] B: Right.
[15:10] A: Makes sense. It has two branches. The ventral branch is when we're in a calm and neutral state, when we might be in states of excitement or entertainment or engagement, or we might be in states of being calm or peaceful or restful. That's that ventral pathway. If it goes down the dorsal pathway, the dorsal pathway is the trigger of the fight, flight and freeze mechanism.
[15:41] D: Okay.
[15:42] A: So it brings us into our reptilian brain, which is survival.
[15:47] D: Okay.
[15:48] C: Right.
[15:48] A: And when it does that, I've got all the physiology of heart beating quicker, sweaty palms, raciness tingling, breathing like. And then the quality and all that of my thoughts are the thoughts of I'm a loser, I should have known better. I'm dumb. I can't believe I did that. How could I have not known better? What's wrong with me? I'm alone, I'm all of that. Got it. So when this has been going on, the good news is that you've exposed it.
[16:18] B: Yeah.
[16:19] A: The more that you expose it, the less power it has on you.
[16:23] D: Okay.
[16:23] C: Right.
[16:23] A: If I was wearing a mask and you didn't know it and I went rawr. And you jumped and you were scared.
[16:28] B: Yeah.
[16:29] A: And then I took the mask off and we had a conversation. I say, oh my goodness. Your facial expression when I scared you was priceless. I want to do it again. Hold on, let me put on the mask. Rah. You'd be like, it's not going to do the same thing.
[16:40] B: Right.
[16:41] A: So that's really useful that it's already going to be less and less and less. Okay. The other thing that we want to do is that there's been stuff as you've been thinking those kinds of thoughts, Right. That it creates discomfort.
[16:54] B: Right.
[16:54] A: So we want to activate that because when you think about it and you're feeling it, there are sensations accompanying the feelings.
[17:04] B: Yes.
[17:04] C: Right.
[17:05] B: Yeah.
[17:05] A: And sensations, Elizabeth, are like a wave. So a sensation is not a stagnant thing. It's a moving thing. It's a wave biochemically, on its own, it can only last a maximum of 30 seconds.
[17:20] D: Okay.
[17:21] A: The reason that sometimes it feels like it goes on longer is that as it's going up, before it ever comes down, another one is triggered.
[17:29] D: No set.
[17:30] C: Right.
[17:30] A: And then another one is triggered and it kind of works like, I have a disturbing thought. Oh, no, now my heart is beating fat. Oh, no, now I'm feeling tighter. Oh, no, now it feels like Harley. Oh, no.
[17:41] C: Right.
[17:42] A: Like all of that is just building the system up. Okay, Right. So we never have the embodied experience, consciously, of the sensations changing. When we are consciously aware of the sensations changing, we're interrupting that faulty habit loop in you.
[18:04] D: Okay, so like, when I start feeling like I can't breathe, and then I breathe and I'm like, wait, I am breathing?
[18:12] A: That is what you're talking about a little bit.
[18:15] D: Okay.
[18:15] A: But more something that we're gonna do together.
[18:18] D: Okay.
[18:18] A: Okay. So what I want you to do is I want you to think of those devil thoughts.
[18:24] D: Okay.
[18:25] A: You know, maybe one of those guys from the past popped up and I wouldn't even have to have sex, but I could easily get a grand from him or whatever it was that. But, oh, God, I don't want to be that person. And that's like, whatever it is that starts to give you the discomfort, wherever you feel it in your body.
[18:37] D: Okay?
[18:38] C: Right.
[18:39] A: And where do you start feeling it in your body?
[18:40] D: In my chest.
[18:41] A: And you feel it in your chest. Now just notice the sensations in your chest. Okay. Without having to do anything with them or about them, just begin to be curious about how they're going to change. Be curious about how you'll notice them changing.
[18:59] C: Right.
[18:59] A: You can be curious by even using the sounds of curiosity. You can go, right. And as you do it, what do you notice happening to those sensations?
[19:13] D: They kind of become like, I'm not that I'm controlling, but I guess they.
[19:18] A: Kind of become like one. Oh, they kind of become like one. That's right. Yeah, they kind of become like one. And so we can't always guarantee that the sensations are going to be changing in the way that you're wanting them to change yet. But the cool part is noticing that they're changing is the thing that starts to interrupt the habit. Poop. Okay, got it.
[19:42] B: Yeah.
[19:43] A: So then we Want to be thinking about that stuff.
[19:47] D: Okay.
[19:47] C: Right.
[19:47] A: Whatever those devilish thoughts are about how I could be that manipulative person, what I used to do, and how like it kind of felt like empowering in me sometimes to like, you know, be all dressed up and know that they're like all googly and I mean, wanting me and like I'm totally like, got this.
[20:02] C: Right.
[20:03] A: You know? Yeah.
[20:04] C: Right.
[20:04] A: So feel the discomfort.
[20:06] C: Right.
[20:06] A: As you get it, notice the sensations without having to do anything with them. Be curious about how they're changing and whether they'll change in the same way they did the last time or if they'll change in a new and different way. Yeah, but as you're noticing the sensations, what are you noticing happening to those sensations?
[20:25] D: That it makes me kind of feel sick.
[20:27] A: It started to drop down here.
[20:29] C: Right.
[20:29] A: And now it's making you kind of feel sick.
[20:33] C: Right.
[20:33] A: So again, just notice the sensations as it's dropped down.
[20:38] C: Right.
[20:39] A: Get curious about how you'll notice it changing even more.
[20:46] C: Right.
[20:47] A: Then lower your jaw.
[20:51] C: And rest your.
[20:52] A: Tongue all the way. Because when you do that. Right. It'll cause a deep breath in or a yawn. Both ways. Start to down regulate the nervous system.
[21:05] C: Right.
[21:05] A: What are you noticing happening in your stomach?
[21:11] D: It lifted.
[21:12] A: It's lifted. Yeah, yeah.
[21:14] C: Right.
[21:19] A: Right. Notice how it's.
[21:20] D: And then I feel like the. A release.
[21:22] A: And now you're feeling like a release. Right, right, right. So notice you felt it here, it dropped down there.
[21:31] B: Yeah.
[21:32] C: Right.
[21:32] A: Then it felt like it lifted and you felt a release. Yes, that's right. So again. And even through your arms.
[21:39] C: Right, right.
[21:40] A: So again, think about, you know, it might be one of those times where like, you know, that that guy's an easy mark. And you remember what it was like to, you know, get dressed up and, you know, put on what you were putting on. And he knew what you look like and you had the, you know, perfume and you knew what that guy. And as you're there, you're knowing what that's like. Easy. Don't even have to do anything. Just flirty. But you know, pearly of the hair, whatever it is. Right.
[22:08] D: I don't feel like it. I don't feel it. I don't feel it anymore.
[22:13] A: You're not feeling it, are you? Right.
[22:16] B: No.
[22:16] C: Right.
[22:17] A: Isn't that an interesting thing?
[22:18] B: Yeah, it is.
[22:20] A: Yeah.
[22:21] C: Yeah. Right.
[22:23] A: Cuz how do you want to be.
[22:26] D: Like this?
[22:26] A: You. Right. Got it.
[22:29] C: Right? Yeah.
[22:31] A: So notice how this is changing.
[22:33] C: Yeah, Right.
[22:37] A: Isn't that cool?
[22:38] D: It is.
[22:38] C: Yeah. Yeah.
[22:40] A: Because I mean, you do want to get a car.
[22:41] B: Yeah, I do.
[22:42] C: Right.
[22:42] A: And I mean, one of those guys I could easily get money from to get a car. And maybe I could even get a more fancy car, a more expensive car, a better car, you know, because there's what I'm earning, you know, doing what I'm doing right now. And then, like, you know, I could get like, you know, a whole bunch of extra money. I wouldn't even have to do much. Maybe just handies. I mean, I could do hand jobs. That'd be fine. You know, maybe a quick bully. I don't know. But I mean, you know, it'd be good.
[23:07] D: It's hard to keep a straight shape.
[23:13] C: Right.
[23:14] A: What do you notice?
[23:16] D: All tingly and sweaty in the hands.
[23:19] A: Right, Right. So notice the sensations. Right. As you're noticing the sensations, get curious about how they're going to change this time.
[23:25] D: Okay.
[23:26] A: And will they be changing the same way they did the last time? Or will it be like the first time? Or will be a whole different way that they're changing this time? But get curious about them. Go. Hmm, I wonder how they're changing.
[23:37] C: Right.
[23:38] D: I wonder how they're changing.
[23:39] A: I wonder how they're changing. Knowing how I want to be is just clear and present.
[23:43] B: Yeah.
[23:44] C: Yeah.
[23:45] A: Connecting to what I'm up to. That's good for me.
[23:48] C: Yeah.
[23:48] A: So that both, when I think about it, I feel excited and good.
[23:52] C: Yeah, Right.
[23:53] A: Yeah.
[23:55] C: Right.
[23:56] A: What are you noticing happening to the sensations? You know, you might even notice them dropping the lightning and then just.
[24:06] C: Right.
[24:07] A: What are you starting to notice?
[24:16] D: My legs got tingly.
[24:18] A: They did that time.
[24:19] C: Right.
[24:20] A: So just check as you were thinking about that and it did all that stuff to your body.
[24:25] B: Yeah.
[24:25] A: Was it doing it in a way that I'm. Oh, really looking forward to it. Excited. Got it.
[24:30] D: Yeah.
[24:33] A: So isn't that the response we do want to have?
[24:35] B: Yes. Yeah.
[24:39] C: Right.
[24:39] A: That all of that feels icky and gross.
[24:42] D: Okay. Yeah, that's true.
[24:45] A: Even if it's just a, you know, quick little handy. I mean, he is a guy. He doesn't dig.
[24:48] D: Oh, my gosh.
[24:49] A: Yeah.
[24:51] D: Isn't that crazy?
[24:52] A: So just check it out.
[24:53] D: Yeah.
[24:54] A: Notice. See, the thing that it did is it made you feel gross and uncomfortable.
[24:59] B: Yeah.
[24:59] C: Right.
[25:00] A: There was a time that it didn't.
[25:02] D: Do that because I had to train my brain, not in my body, not to think like that. Like.
[25:07] A: Yeah, okay. But see, it's not making you feel icky and gross because of past experiences.
[25:15] B: Right.
[25:16] A: Do you follow me? It's icky and gross. Because if you think about doing that now with some strange, you know, fat guy who's smelly nice, you know, but he's going to give me 100 bucks. So. No, Yeah, I mean, handy's not that bad. Did I ever tell you this is the funniest story ever. Oh my goodness. My dad lives in way out boondocks of upstate New York. He was a butcher. So one season he decided he was going to, you know, with the hunters. He was going to go ahead and butcher a deer and he's like going to call his. My dad's name is Jack and he was going to call it the Jack Shack. He's telling me about this and I go, dad, I don't think that's a good idea. He goes, why? Because it's great. It rhymes. Jack Shack. I mean like, come on, like I'm Jack, it's Jack, Jack. I go, well, in Florida it means something different because. What are you talking about? I go, well, you know, I mean, people do bring their meat and they. But it's a whole different story. So if you might want somebody doing that instead of the deer, by all means. Might be more lucrative too.
[26:18] D: Yeah. Could you imagine somebody walking in there be like, what kind of establishment is this? Like, so funny. Yeah. Thank God that he ran it by you first.
[26:33] A: Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So just check. Think about it now.
[26:37] D: Uhhuh.
[26:37] A: Right. Hear the, you know, what do you notice happened to that voice, by the way?
[26:41] D: Yeah, it. I don't hear it.
[26:44] A: You don't hear it? Right, right, right. It was only there not because of a devilish voice, but to remind you how bad that stuff was.
[26:53] C: Right.
[26:54] A: And what was confusing in it is that there were some moments of me being younger where I had more natural energy and everything was a little bit tighter and I might. A little bit slender and I might have been more. Yeah. Like all the other stuff that were like, oh, right, I'm a middle aged man. Great dad.
[27:14] D: Yes. Yes. Yeah, right. It's crazy. The brain is a beautiful thing. It's nightmarish sometimes, but it's a beautiful thing.
[27:25] A: Well, we want to judge our thoughts not by truthfulness, but by usefulness.
[27:31] D: Okay.
[27:32] A: So when the thought comes to mind and it's not a useful thought, we're not trying to determine whether it's true.
[27:38] D: Okay.
[27:39] A: Is it useful to have this thought right now?
[27:43] D: Okay.
[27:43] A: And if it's not useful, go, I don't want to have this. Give me a different thought. I mean, your brain is going to constantly bring up thoughts and remember the Types of thoughts we're having are based on the physiology and biochemistry of our body.
[27:57] D: Okay.
[27:59] A: So we want to move stuff into that ventral state. Okay, so how do we do that? Well, one, you can lower your jaw all the way.
[28:06] B: Yeah.
[28:09] A: And then.
[28:11] D: So to prevent it is to not.
[28:14] A: Well, I'm gonna see if. Well, try to. Try to bring it up. I mean, because again, now that it got exposed, because you were exposing it, and now we kind of, like, notice. See if it shows up as, like, you know, something that would be desirable.
[28:26] C: No.
[28:27] B: Yeah.
[28:28] A: This guy, like, drove by and, like, he. Wherever you were, and he drove by and he kind of stopped, and he's in a cor. And he's in a Ferrari.
[28:35] D: Do I get in? No.
[28:37] C: Right?
[28:37] A: And you're, like, looking, and he's like, hey.
[28:39] D: I mean, it's guy in a Ferrari. Maybe if he lets me drive. No, I'm joking. That was a joke.
[28:49] A: I might get in the car. He's gonna let me drive, you know, Ferrari.
[28:54] D: All right.
[28:55] A: Oh, wait. I actually know somebody that got a Ferrari. My wife is already sat in it. And he's like, yeah, when I see you next and I got it, I'll let you drive it. I'm like, cool.
[29:07] B: Yeah.
[29:07] A: Oh, no, no.
[29:12] D: Sounds good.
[29:17] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So just check. What do you notice? Try to get that thing. Try to have it feel really desirable.
[29:26] B: No.
[29:26] C: Right?
[29:27] B: Yeah. No.
[29:28] C: Right.
[29:30] A: Because even though that was behavior that you engaged, and it was never part of who you are, it was just behavior you engage in, and it doesn't fit who you are now.
[29:38] B: Right.
[29:39] D: It doesn't.
[29:39] C: Right.
[29:40] D: Yeah.
[29:40] A: Right. Who you are is way different than that.
[29:42] D: Absolutely.
[29:43] A: Yeah.
[29:44] C: Right.
[29:45] A: Which is why it got exposed.
[29:46] D: Okay.
[29:47] C: Right.
[29:50] A: That's your commitment life working for you.
[29:54] C: Right.
[29:55] A: And, you know, it might mean it takes a little bit longer for me to get a car.
[30:00] C: Right.
[30:02] D: I like biking anyways. Truly.
[30:06] A: I do bicycling. Like, really pedaling. Gotta have a comfortable seat if you go. Long bike rides.
[30:13] D: I do.
[30:14] A: Long bike rides are hard. I. I was a bicyclist too. You know that? I did a. So I've run one marathon.
[30:22] B: Cool.
[30:22] A: And I've done one half Ironman.
[30:26] D: That's awesome. That's really impressive.
[30:30] B: Yeah.
[30:31] A: And that half Ironman, you had to bike 52 miles.
[30:37] D: I've done it. Not sober.
[30:42] C: Man.
[30:42] A: I wonder how that would have been if I didn't. Yes.
[30:45] B: Sat.
[30:45] D: Where is it? Sarasota. All the way to, like, the Skyway.
[30:49] A: Oh, man.
[30:50] C: Jesus.
[30:50] D: Maybe not 52 miles, but it was really close.
[30:53] A: Yeah.
[30:54] D: I think it's like 40 something miles, right.
[30:56] A: In the hot Florida sun.
[30:58] D: I think it was winter. It was winter.
[31:00] A: Still hot. Florida sun.
[31:02] B: Yeah.
[31:03] D: Yeah, it was. It was a journey for nothing. Good.
[31:08] A: For nothing. Good. Yeah.
[31:11] C: Yeah.
[31:12] A: So how's work going? How's everything else? Everything else is good.
[31:15] D: Yeah. I'm actually getting a really good promotion.
[31:18] C: Really?
[31:19] B: Yeah.
[31:21] D: But then it's.
[31:22] B: Yeah.
[31:23] D: I'm. And I know I'm on the right path and I wouldn't change it for anything because it's beautiful.
[31:28] A: Yeah.
[31:30] D: But yeah, I was. I guess the real question is why do I am accepting these friends when they're not friends?
[31:39] C: Ah, right.
[31:40] D: Then that probably like, this is how it like domino effect.
[31:45] C: Right.
[31:46] A: Facebook.
[31:47] C: Right.
[31:49] A: Not friends. No, we don't friend people on Facebook.
[31:54] C: Right.
[31:55] A: Or voyeurs.
[31:56] D: Voyeur.
[31:57] A: And you go look at other people's not friend them.
[31:59] B: Right.
[32:00] A: I don't know. I don't go on Facebook.
[32:02] D: It's not.
[32:02] A: I. I have intention. Intentionally avoided social media. I think maybe once a month I might scan a through Facebook, but I don't ever. I mean, it's rare. It's not on my phone.
[32:16] D: Right.
[32:17] C: It.
[32:17] A: Sure. I can get to it on the desktop computer. I can get to it on the iPad. I'm not on the iPad that often.
[32:23] D: Right.
[32:24] A: It's.
[32:25] C: Yeah.
[32:26] D: Not.
[32:26] A: It's not my thing. I think what I get stuck in most on my phone because there's not a lot of apps, maybe some shopping apps. Because I like to shop.
[32:35] B: Yeah.
[32:36] A: Buying sneakers. That's a. A thing that I really enjoy doing. I return a ton of sneakers myself. But I like shopping for shoes. They're fun.
[32:48] D: Me too.
[32:49] A: Yeah.
[32:50] B: Yeah.
[32:50] D: My last name's Schumacher for reason. Yeah. My own little addiction. Like peace.
[32:56] A: Cute.
[32:57] D: I like yours too.
[32:58] A: Thank you.
[32:59] B: Yep.
[33:00] A: Yeah.
[33:01] D: Yep.
[33:01] B: Yep.
[33:02] D: But life is good. So no more setting off that domino effect.
[33:09] A: Well, yeah. So are you on Facebook now? Yeah, or Instagram or those things.
[33:15] C: Right.
[33:15] A: So the people that you are friends with are people that you're actually like in physical world.
[33:23] B: Right.
[33:24] A: Friends with and people that you would. You are wanting to.
[33:29] D: Right. And like most of my friends, it's the ones that are like the men out of nowhere. And I even questioned their motives right then. And like, I've been really good about being like, I'm not that person. Like, one of the guys was like, hey, do you want to come out like c and play? And I'm like, I don't come out and play anymore.
[33:50] A: See, that's the problem.
[33:52] D: Right.
[33:52] A: Anybody that met you, that's a Guy from. That is a guy that you need to no longer associate with.
[34:00] D: Yes. And then even the ones I've never had sex with. So now they know I'm out of that lifestyle. So now they guess. I think they think I'm just gonna give it to them for free right now. Like, hey, come out. What?
[34:13] A: No, but that's not how you want to meet a guy.
[34:16] D: I know that. Like, it's not happening, so I'm, like, shutting it down. But it's. And it's been, you know what I mean, Days. And I'm like, so all these guys who I thought we were friends from, like, high school and were reconnected, but to them, I'm always gonna be what. Who they met me as. And like, I. I get it now, but it's still. This is that domino effect.
[34:47] A: You get it now?
[34:49] D: I get it now.
[34:50] A: Yes.
[34:50] D: That guys and girls can't be friends when.
[34:52] A: From your past. No, not that guys and girls can't be friends.
[34:55] D: Oh, Well, I mean, from my past, like, because they met me some as somebody else.
[35:00] A: That's. Well, it's that being friends with those people doesn't support. Support who you are now and who you're continuing to become.
[35:12] B: Right.
[35:13] A: That's the key distinction. Okay. Is that it just doesn't support who you are now and who you're becoming.
[35:20] D: Okay.
[35:21] C: Right.
[35:22] A: They're. They're not a part of your world. Yeah, right. There are people that I went to high school with that I don't associate with anymore. There are people that, like. There are people that were a part. Part of different versions of my growing and becoming more of who I want to be in this world.
[35:41] B: Yeah.
[35:43] C: Right.
[35:43] A: So that's the distinction, is that they're not supportive of who I am now and who I'm becoming.
[35:52] B: Right. Yeah.
[35:54] C: Right.
[35:54] A: So those people need to be unfriended, be friended, whatever it's called.
[35:59] B: Yep.
[36:00] A: Blah. I don't know what they do. Unfriended.
[36:01] D: Unfriended.
[36:02] A: Yeah.
[36:03] D: And I did.
[36:04] A: Because they don't.
[36:05] C: Oh, good.
[36:05] B: Yeah.
[36:06] C: Right.
[36:06] D: When the.
[36:07] B: Yeah.
[36:08] D: Because I can't. And I'm. I. I'm like, why am I arguing with somebody? You know what I mean? Like, I put it out there. That's all I'm gonna say. I'm done. Hung up the phone. Unfriended them. Don't talk to them.
[36:23] A: Yeah.
[36:24] B: Yeah.
[36:24] C: Right.
[36:25] D: So I did respect myself that way, but then it's like, yeah, my thoughts.
[36:31] A: So you did the right thing in that you didn't know when people are Doing that, what their undercurrent motives were.
[36:45] D: Right.
[36:46] B: Yeah.
[36:46] A: Makes sense.
[36:47] B: Yeah.
[36:47] A: Now you do.
[36:50] B: Yeah.
[36:51] A: Know what their undercurrent motives were. And now when in as soon as that was exposed to you, what their undercurrents and motives were, you're like, nope, done.
[37:03] B: Yeah.
[37:04] D: It feels like a win.
[37:06] A: Do you follow me with that?
[37:07] D: Yeah.
[37:07] A: Right. And you want to start feeling really good.
[37:10] B: Yeah.
[37:11] C: Right.
[37:13] A: That despite having those thoughts, I'm doing the stuff that fits who I am now and who I'm becoming.
[37:22] C: Right.
[37:23] A: I'm speaking about that because that was concerning. Yeah, Right.
[37:27] D: Yeah, absolutely.
[37:30] A: Yeah. And that's useful. I'm not hiding.
[37:33] B: Yes.
[37:33] A: I'm just keeping it to myself.
[37:35] C: Right, Right.
[37:37] A: I'm developing my networks and my connections with people.
[37:42] B: Right, Right. Yeah.
[37:45] C: Yeah.
[37:45] A: Isn't that a good news?
[37:46] D: It's a beautiful thing.
[37:47] A: Yeah, it is. Yeah.
[37:51] B: Yeah.
[37:51] D: Most of my Facebook friends are all Selah. All Selah. And a lot of the NA recovery. So. And it's good. It's a really good feeling.
[38:04] C: Right.
[38:04] A: Because you want what used to be you were supposed to accumulate as many friends as you could have on Facebook because then that would make me feel really good. I have 10,000 friends on Facebook.
[38:18] D: That's too many people.
[38:19] A: No shit.
[38:20] B: Yeah.
[38:22] A: I don't like that many people.
[38:26] D: I don't. And that's what gets me too. It's like, how. How are we not friends face to face? But then we want to be Facebook friends. We don't make that make sense.
[38:38] A: Doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense.
[38:42] D: Yeah.
[38:44] C: Right.
[38:45] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[38:47] D: So it's just good for a little bit of networking and, like, doing the NA thing.
[38:53] A: Yeah.
[38:54] D: Supporting Salah sisters and all their cool stuff. Like, Nicole did my nails yesterday. I was the first paying client. Did my nails and my toes.
[39:03] A: Nice.
[39:03] D: I gave her her first tip dollar and signed it up for her. Sort of put it on the wall.
[39:08] C: That's cool.
[39:09] B: Yeah.
[39:10] D: So, yeah, she looked nice. She posted them and now she's got more clients coming.
[39:17] B: Yeah.
[39:18] D: That type of stuff is good.
[39:20] A: That's perfect. That's what. But that means you're only connecting.
[39:24] B: Yeah.
[39:25] A: To people that you know.
[39:26] B: Yeah.
[39:27] D: Yep.
[39:28] C: Right.
[39:29] A: And know are good people. Yeah.
[39:32] C: Right.
[39:33] A: And you have ways to discern now.
[39:36] B: Yeah.
[39:39] A: Makes sense.
[39:39] D: Absolutely.
[39:40] C: Yeah.
[39:41] A: So that. Then it gets to the point that I don't even allow that to be part of.
[39:48] D: I get it.
[39:48] A: Like, that. They don't even get to, like. Nobody says that to me. Like, really?
[39:52] C: Like.
[39:52] B: Yeah.
[39:53] A: It regardless political thing. But, like, what is it? Donald Trump said Camilla Harris first said that she was Asian, and now she's saying that she was black. And Camilla Harris, again, whatever people think her response was, that's nonsense. It's just nonsense.
[40:12] B: Yeah.
[40:13] A: That's what we're talking about.
[40:15] C: Right, Right.
[40:16] A: That some. That's nonsense.
[40:17] D: It is nonsense.
[40:19] B: Yeah.
[40:19] A: Really? And that's why I say so. I want to loop it back around. So just think about, like, you know, at some point, you know, if you were to be able to be, you know, really sexy and alluring, but with somebody that you actually want to be with.
[40:30] C: Right, Right.
[40:31] B: Yeah.
[40:33] D: Sounds a lot better.
[40:34] A: It does, doesn't it?
[40:35] B: Yeah.
[40:35] A: Yeah. That wants to be with you.
[40:37] C: Right, Right.
[40:38] A: But not because they're paying you.
[40:40] B: Right.
[40:40] C: Right.
[40:41] A: Because, like, you guys developed a connection over time.
[40:44] B: Yes.
[40:45] A: And.
[40:46] C: Right.
[40:46] A: And how lucky will he be?
[40:48] B: Yeah.
[40:48] A: Yeah. You know, because he's getting a gal who's, like, interested in, like, you know, maybe seducing him.
[40:53] B: Yeah.
[40:54] A: And looking really seductive and sexy and hot and pretty feels more right.
[40:59] C: Right.
[40:59] A: Doesn't it feel more right? And really good for him. He's, like, really excited.
[41:03] B: Yeah.
[41:04] C: Right.
[41:04] A: The guy who you're into, that's into you, that you've decided that you're gonna allow to spend some time with you, is really excited when you dress like that. Yeah.
[41:16] D: So it's like both worlds.
[41:18] A: Got it.
[41:18] D: Good with both worlds.
[41:20] C: Yeah. Right?
[41:22] D: Yeah.
[41:23] C: Yeah.
[41:23] A: Isn't that cool?
[41:24] B: Yeah.
[41:25] A: Feels more natural, doesn't it?
[41:27] D: Yeah.
[41:28] A: And that's where you hold the keys and you have say. And it's always, am I going to allow him to spend time with me?
[41:35] D: Okay.
[41:36] A: And that he needs to treat me the way that I want to be treated.
[41:39] B: Yes.
[41:40] A: So I say to people, even if, like, you know, you want to go out on a date with him on Friday, but he, you know, doesn't get around to asking you until Thursday.
[41:49] D: Yeah, No, I don't go.
[41:51] B: Right.
[41:51] A: Sorry, I'm busy.
[41:52] B: Yeah, Right.
[41:54] A: I get off the phone a little bit sooner than he wants me to get off the phone.
[41:58] B: Yeah.
[41:58] C: Right.
[41:59] A: I let him know the places that I like to go eat, and then I let him know places that I'd be okay eating at if he wants to pick.
[42:06] D: Wow, this is a lot.
[42:09] A: You don't have to get options.
[42:12] D: So many options. And I noticed that about women, they don't ever know what they want. I work at Tropical Smoothie, so usually when a man and woman come in, if a man's with a woman, she never knows what she wants. If a woman's with her best friend, they always know what they want. It's very confusing.
[42:31] A: No, it isn't.
[42:32] D: Yeah, it is. How do you know? What do you know?
[42:37] A: Well, I think that there's the damsel in distress.
[42:40] D: Oh. But it's very aggravated.
[42:43] C: Guy is a decision maker.
[42:44] A: I'm going to. I know what I want.
[42:46] B: Yeah.
[42:47] D: And they always do.
[42:48] A: What can I want?
[42:49] D: Thank you. That's exactly what's going on.
[42:52] A: Do I want that or do I want to open it? I don't know if I want to open it.
[42:55] D: What do you think, dear?
[42:58] B: Yeah.
[43:00] D: Women that.
[43:02] A: But when they coming together, what if when they just going by themselves, they.
[43:06] D: Always know what they want? No, Women take a lot longer.
[43:10] A: A little bit longer.
[43:11] B: Yeah.
[43:11] D: But they always go back to like, I can literally put their food in and have it made while they're sitting there still wondering what they're going to get. And then still they get the same thing, which is fine. It's good.
[43:23] A: Even repeat customers. God. Jeez. I don't know what to get today. Oh, I'm going to get the same thing I got yesterday and the day.
[43:30] D: Before and the day before and the day before. Boy.
[43:33] B: Yeah.
[43:34] A: That's cool.
[43:35] B: Yeah.
[43:36] D: I like people watching. Very observing.
[43:41] A: Yeah. See, and that is you paying attention to what's new and different.
[43:46] B: Yeah.
[43:47] A: And that is the really essence of how to be present and be in now.
[43:54] B: Yeah.
[43:55] A: Continue to look for what you can. That's new and different in interactions and relations and. Yeah, yeah. And you're doing it.
[44:04] C: Yeah.
[44:05] A: You know, so try to get that devil voice, you know, or it might be really cool, you know, because you get a lot of money and this Guy's offering like 500 just for a quick.
[44:14] B: Yeah.
[44:14] D: No.
[44:15] B: Yeah.
[44:16] D: Nothing. It's like I feel like my brain just when I tried it pushed it out.
[44:23] C: It did, didn't it?
[44:24] B: Yeah.
[44:24] C: Right.
[44:25] A: It's not there.
[44:26] B: Yeah.
[44:26] C: Right.
[44:26] A: Because it was never a part of you.
[44:28] B: Good.
[44:29] C: Right?
[44:29] D: That's good.
[44:30] A: It was just some behavior that you did. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[44:35] C: Awesome.
[44:36] B: Yes.
[44:37] A: You're doing great.
[44:38] D: Thank you. I felt like it was a mess, but I feel powered.
[44:43] A: Yeah.
[44:43] D: Mess coming in. Power, me going out.
[44:46] A: We like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good job. All right, we can stop at that. See.
