[00:01] A: Today is the 27th of January. Finally, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is really useful, transformative, life changing. That recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Okay, cool. So I got a really good understanding of what's been problematic for you. I certainly got. There's lots of different stuff. What I want to layer in is a few different components. We look at life and I gave you some of this the last time that we talked. But we look at life typically that it's the circumstances, the situations and things that cause the feelings. Whether it's the past stuff, stuff that I went through, stuff that I'm currently dealing with, or stuff that could or might happen. It's stuff that causes feelings. Right? Guys driving down the road, asshole cuts in front of him. He slams on the brakes, he's fucking pissed. We go, why you mad? Goes fucker cut in front of me. Real simplistic. That guy made me feel this way.
[01:00] B: Yeah.
[01:01] A: Common lens, lens not wrong. Gives us this much power. Notice how it's a small box. Yeah, right. Two choices, change it. We work hard to change it, can't change it. Get the hell away from it. Which is how most of us try to deal with stuff you already know. There's some stuff I can't change, some stuff I can't fully, completely get away from, and a lot of stuff that I can't get to have not happened. We gotta do something else.
[01:28] B: I wanna get away from those too.
[01:31] A: Right? We wanna the ones that haven't happened yet. I'm still like, well, we can't get stuff that has happened to have not happened.
[01:38] B: Mm.
[01:39] A: Right? So we gotta do something else. We're going to adjust the way that the automatic emotional part of your brain reacts to stuff. I use the silly example lion approaches zebra. People go, lion makes zebra scared. We go, duh. We look at it from another lens, we go, no, it's zebra's brain making zebra alert, motivated, stronger, scared. As soon as zebra sees senses, feels, smells, thinks lines coming, that it's actually not the lion, it's really the zebra's brain that's doing it to the zebra. Even if it's doing it in response to lion approaching. Make sense. That lens says there's ways in which your brain has been working that causes you to feel bad. By bad, we're meaning that turned up impulsive. You got to do another by bad, it's the discomfort. Kind of like with my own. Right. By bad, it's the lingering effect of the past stuff that's happened by that. It's the why am I picking this wrong? Right. Your brain might do all of that to you in response to stuff, but you recognize that way of your brain working has been problematic. That's the issue that's on the table for us to get addressed. Got it. And it's really common for brain to have errors because they're complicated machines and all complicated machines break. So well, errors just malfunctions, right? The car isn't broken. We just need to fix it, tune it so that it works better. Right? So we look at it from the lens that your brain makes you feel bad. First question, do you really think it wants you to feel bad?
[03:15] B: No.
[03:15] A: No. Do you think it would want you to feel good? No. See, that's the fucked up part. What we've discovered in working with thousands of different people. You're a bright gal, I'm a pretty bright guy. But most of our brain emotionally works like an animal.
[03:29] B: Like a lizard?
[03:30] A: No, an animal. Like a rabbit or a donkey. That's why sometimes we're jackasses, right? And an animal doesn't have emotions because the brain of the animal is concerned about its mood, its self esteem, its sense of self worth. Whether it feels lovable or good enough, whether it's having a good or a bad day, it causes emotion to motivate it, do something, get something to stop, solve the problem. It's that simple, right? Rabbit sees the fox. Boom. Brain makes it experience fear. Not because it wants the rabbit to, you know, have a bad day, it'll run really fast away. Squirrel's tail, fire, pain. Not because it wants the squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid dumb moron, because it got too careless, too close to the fire. Now all the other squirrels are gonna know that it's bard. So just to get the tail out of the fire. So the crazy thing for human beings to consider is all the negative emotions we experience. Hurt, anger, sadness, sorrow, grief, resentment, guilt, shame, upset, pain. All of that shit is caused by the part that works like an animal. And the same purpose to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. Where the error is that our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. That's why, if you've ever noticed, we feel bad about the same kinds of things over and over and over. And over and over again, really good news. Many of the things that we feel bad about are in time periods that are either A, already finished or B, haven't happened yet. So we don't actually have to solve the problem. We want to update the timing. Timing is the malfunction that happens in our human brain. And the reason why timing is the malfunction is that we have this intellect which gives us time. That's why, you know, you're sitting here with me. You can remember doing something earlier today. You can think about something over the weekend. No other animal can do that, Right? That's not a problem if it's positive or neutral. Because positive or neutral experiences, the brain knows the difference between the memory of it and it. Somebody tells us about a great trip that they had to Key west, you know, they partied on Duval Street. They got to see Hemingway's house. They rode on a little moped, they went deep sea fishing, got a little blue lobster. They tell us about the whole trip. They know we know the difference, that they know the difference between remembering being there and being there. Totally clear. But negative experiences. Big ones, little ones, long time ago, recent one time, many times, any negative experience. Weird, bad, sad, awful, upsetting, scary, horrific, catastrophic, traumatic brain confuses memory. Thinking it's experience causes emotional reaction. Guy's telling us about getting mugged 12 years ago when he was in Oklahoma. Gets to the part where the guy's got a gun at the side of his head, and now his face is white, his voice is choked, his arms are shaking, he's got tears. We're kind of nice people. We were listening to him. What the fuck's happening? We go, he's reliving it. What's really happening? Different part of his brain, emotional part, is confusing that memory, thinking it is the experience. That's why he's having that reaction. Now we can totally tell it's affecting him when he was talking to us because we saw it all over him. But you know what? It was affecting him. Even over the weekend when he was playing catch with his son, it was under the surface. So we. Do we have a good way to put those things. Right? Right.
[07:07] B: Yeah. My rug's like.
[07:09] A: Exactly. That's the thing. So we know it's affecting him when we see it because it's on him. But it's affecting him even when he's not talking about it. That's the error. And the other error is that why is it still affecting him? Not because what happened was awful, bad, wrong, shouldn't have happened. They shouldn't have done it. He shouldn't have done it. It's because part of his brain never got the good news that what happened stopped, That I made it through it, that I moved through it, that I'm okay. That's the error. Brain doesn't know that it's over. That's why it's still causing the emotion, trying to motivate him to get it to stop. Good news it has so. Because we don't need to update and change the problem. It's a timing error. Timing first. Emotional memory experience glued together. That's why physical wounds heal and emotional wounds don't. I cut my arm, time goes by. Cut heels. I break my foot, time goes by. Foot heals. Dad beats me bad. When I was a kid. That still lingers. Mean person bullied me and gave me a swirly. That still lingers. The sexual violence that happened to me, that still lingers. Those experiences are over. May have been over for decades. The problem is that when they happen, they froze my brain. And my brain doesn't know that they're over. Even though I do make sense. That's the first part. Second part. We're all trained to believe good things happen when we're good. It's the message that little children get. When you're a good boy or a good girl. Life is good because things happen to people who are good. You'll get to live happily ever after because you're good. Santa Claus brings presents to those who are good. All the messages that get installed when we're the most vulnerable. His good things happen when I'm good. Okay, great. If life is good all the time. Never met anybody where life is good all the time, but be fine if it was. The problem isn't that we lied and told them that life is good. It's the second problem, that bad things only happen when I'm bad. Right? Because when I was drawing on the wall, mom came over to me and didn't like that I was drawing on the wall and she grabbed me and she yelled at me and she spanked my hiney. My nervous system learned I was doing something I wasn't supposed to do. I was being bad. Mommy got mad at me. Mommy mad at me because I was bad. Mommy spanked my hiney. I got hurt because I was bad. Bad things happen when I'm bad. And that's what gets layered in. So it doesn't matter where we are. That's the messaging. That's the religious messaging. It's useful. That's why Women get blamed for everything. Well, she did wear a low cut top. Oh, well, that meant I could manhandle her. No, well, I mean, she did wear a low cut top. I mean, all the way up to the Supreme Court. You know, the guy got the Supreme Court job because we couldn't prove that he raped her. Yeah. But it was still a question of behavior. Should we give him the highest chord? Right. Like crazy. Who also said, guess what? Roe versus Wade. Totally will stay or not. So we got all of that stuff. Bad happens when I'm bad. So when dad's gone, used to be around, now he's not around. I don't just go, it's a mom and dad issue. I don't just go, oh, my dad's a drunken alcoholic. That's why he's not around. I go, if I was more lovable, if I mattered more, if he cared if I was worth it, Daddy would be here. So again, goes back to being about me. Everything that bad always goes back to being about me. I had a kid just the other day whose mom was a real nice mom and said, you know what? When people are lonely like other kid in school, nobody was really friends. Go ahead and be friendly somebody because, you know, you want to be the nice person. Which he did befriend the kid. And unbeknownst to him, that kid was really, really not well because he had all sorts of other sexual stuff happening and wound up doing sexual stuff to the kid. And his expression was, well, I just let it happen. Which of course then makes it my fault. He was 7. Didn't just let it happen. But, you know, because it's bad, guess what? Totally my fault. Everything that goes on that's bad immediately goes back to being about me. I should have known better. I shouldn't have put myself in that situation. I was being stupid. I was an idiot. I was down my jungle all about me. The girl gets a ride home from the guy who she had been flirting with, who happened to be her co worker's best friend. Right. He was nice though. Walked her to the door. She even was ready to give him digits, give him a little kiss. When she opened the door, he had no idea he was gonna force himself in, tie her up and rape her. But nobody shocked when she blames herself for being so stupid and careless and she should have known better. What? What? But that's because it bad makes sense. So second thing that keeps it stuck, that meaning third brain, once those two are active, is on hypervigilant mode and super sensitive scanning for it, but not scanning for it with a wide open lens. Scanning for it with that narrowed lens, fucking on all the time. Looking for anything that's troubling but confuses anything that's similar. Thinking it's same soldier dies on the ground when the firework bursts. Not because he didn't know it's the 4th of July, that he was at a fireworks celebration. He lit the damn firework. Different part of his brain confused the sound, thought it was a grenade. Make sense? Hi. The gal got mugged by a guy in Target who was wearing a hoodie. Five years later, her little boy having his first friend over was cold. Like today, the friend coming over is wearing a blue hoodie. She's like, something about that kid I don't like. She's not even pairing it together with the hoodie because that's not logical. But because those things co occurred, they got stuck together. Right. That's why with grief, it's time of year and every June I get depressed. Why? Well, because In June of 2000, my grandfather died. Okay. What does June of 2022 have anything to do with? Nothing. But it's June. Is there some similarity? Yeah, it's June where the guy's making out with the gallon. It's feeling really good. He's totally turned on. She's turned on. She touches his inner thigh and he's like, what the fuck just happened to me? The girl who I'm into is just touched me in a way that should feel really good. I got. Yeah, but is there any similarity to Uncle Mac when he was 11? Yeah, to hand. Yeah, but that was grubby's sausage finger. Man hand. This is dainty female hand with pretty nails. It doesn't matter. Hand is hand. Make sense. So the brain is on overactive mode. Now the good news is all those things have one thing in common. And they're not what most therapists think. The one thing that they have in common is they're all based in distortion. What I mean by that is if I take my hand and I slam it into the sand and I pick it up, you do see an imprint. But is the imprint the same thing as my hand? No. Is the meaning at all? What happened? Did she put herself in danger? Get a ride home from her co worker's best friend? How different is a firework from a grenade? They're different things. So instead of where therapy misses the boat because therapists think that what our job is to get the bad feelings out, as if somebody buried them deep inside. It's not about doing that. It's really about getting the good news in the good news into the part of the brain that doesn't know the negative moment ended, because that's really the biggest error. The brain doesn't know that the negative moment ended. So we want to get that good news in. Grief gets stuck in the same way, by the way. Tends to be the worst moment of finding out about the loss that gets frozen. So now every time I think about the loved one, I have to go through that yucky moment before I can access any of the other joyful moments with them. Isn't that weird? But that moment in comparison to the moments that I experienced in being with them, which is there more of the moment of the lost or the moments that I got to be with them? Don't we want to place that moment so it's in context with all the other moments so I have access to more of who that person is for me? Right. We want you to lighten up on you. We want this to be a little bit quiet. We want you to experience more spaciousness, want you to experience more ease. We want you to have more room. Got it. We want you to see the both in the moment, but the up above distanced view so that you can see more. Right. Growing up in the Hudson Valley, did you ever go up in a mountain?
[16:39] B: I live in, Deacon, like Mount Beacon. I walk it all the time.
[16:43] A: Right. And when you get to the top, can't you see more? Mm, that's right. So we want you to have both an in the moment, but a broader perspective. We want things to settle down inside and you be more comfortable in your own skin. Yeah. And this is the you that I'm seeing. See, I bet right now you can think about whatever you need to think about around any of this stuff that happened and feel a little bit of that. Notice how it doesn't take a long time, but what's really cool is you did it on purpose. I kind of asked you to do what you did. That's not a problem if your brain only does it when you choose it. The problem, Emily, is that your brain's been doing it to you at times that you haven't been choosing. That's the glitch. So the you that I'm seeing, that kind of stuff, this you, she remembers having that kind of feeling, but if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't know how to get it. The you that I'm seeing is emotionally present so that she's dealing with what is happening without the effect of what has or the worry about what might. The you that I'm seeing is connected at a deep level to that inner knowing. Not here, here, that she has what she needs to deal with whatever might come her way. Therefore, she's not so concerned about pre planning makes sense. She's simply able to move in the ways that are best for her through what's showing up. God. At the you that I'm seeing has that both in the moment, that broader perspective, so that as she makes her decisions and choices, she's seen both clearly. The you that I'm seeing is much more at peace and comfortable in her own skin. That inner chatter is somewhat quiet. Got it. This is the you that I'm seeing. My question isn't how it's going to happen that I get you here. Okay. The question, is it different one? Would it be okay? Yeah, that'd be okay, right? And with it, okay, we've got a green light. Because do you know that in order to go anywhere, you first need to know where you're going? Right. If I said to you get in the car and start driving, you're like, okay, all right, three hours from now, I'm going to tell you where to go. Right. So first we need to know where we're going. Then we want to make sure it's okay with those two things. We're already closer to it make sense now. We want to go through processes that begin to change your brainwaves, because different bands of information exist at different brainwave states. And we want things to settle down and to put your body more into a state of rest. I say a state of rest because that's where what accelerates healing, colds, flus, surgeries, what do we want people to do? Yeah, Right. So we want to put your body in a state of rest and we're going to go through some processes. First, it requires you to take your gum out. So grab a tissue and put it in there. There we go. Second, the process is really simple, but the first part is really silly. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. So I don't mean like, ah, I mean just a little bit when you. No, not even that much. Maybe the width of an index finger. Right. When you slightly lower your jaw, what it does is it stimulates and activates our vagal nerve. Vagal nerve is connected to our enteric system, which is connected to all the vital organs in the body. Starts to put the body into parasympathetic response. So you slightly lower your jaw.
[20:52] B: Like I just Open my mouth, basically.
[20:54] A: Or you don't even have to have it open. You just have your teeth a little bit lower.
[21:00] B: I think I did it.
[21:01] A: You did okay. Second lever. Because these are neuroscience brain levers, they literally had scans going on in people's brains as they guided them through this process that put their body into a state of rest. Second lever. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Kind of like the tip of the tongue is against the back of the bottom teeth. So your jaw is slightly lowered and you rest your tongue. The third lever is we shift how we breathe so that you begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower, a little bit deeper, so that when you exhale, it's a little bit longer. So you slightly lower your jaw. Your tongue is resting at the bottom of your mouth. You're breathing in away. That's slower and deeper and out a little longer. And as you're breathing in this slightly slower and deeper way, exhaling a little bit longer, just check inside. How's your body feeling now? Like more tense or more calm? Calm, yeah. So then we want to add the fourth lever. When we're in highly agitated, beta waves that tunnels our vision. All irritation, agitation, anxiety, frustration, urgency, all live in that highly elevated beta. When beta drops a little, that's the part that's good for waking state. So conversation, focus, communication, social interaction, and engagement. Then we want to move down to a lower level, which is higher level of alpha, because alpha waves are correlated with what people call flow states. Surfers are in flow. Athletes call it being in the zone. So it's more both of an alert but also a relaxed state. And what it's characterized by is an expanding of our awareness this out so that we notice more space. So how this works is, again, you slightly lower your jaw. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper, exhaling a little bit longer. As you breathe in this slower and deeper way, notice that you can look across and see me and my nose. Stay looking at my nose. As you see my fingers, you stay looking at my nose. My fingers begin to open wide. And with the sides of your eyes, your peripheral vision, notice how you can see my fingers wiggling as you're looking at my nose, which means you're opening up to space towards the side windows and side doors, the space that's beyond me, the space in between you and me, the space behind you, underneath you, and up above. And as you just pay Attention and notice space. Notice how there's so much more of it. And again, as you're noticing space, how's your body feeling now? It is, isn't it? Right. Which is a nice feeling. And then we want to add the fifth lever, because have you ever said, maybe heard somebody use the phrase, I'm under a lot of stress and in order for somebody to be underneath something, where must that thing be?
[24:47] B: On top of it.
[24:48] A: That's right. So we know a solution is to get out from under it and rise up above it so that they have a different metaphor. A bird's eye view. What does that mean?
[25:01] B: That they can see it from above it?
[25:04] A: Yeah, they see things like the bird up above, seeing it all as being underneath and below them. But not just a bird that's perched in a tree, but a bird that's flying and soaring and gliding through the sky. So one more time, you slightly lower your tongue, resting your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, breathing in slower and deeper so that as you exhale, it's longer. Right. Notice that you look across and see me in my nose. My fingers, they extend out. As they extend, you're aware of space. That's right. Side windows and doors. Space beyond, space underneath and space between space behind and space up above. And how this space literally goes out in all directions, in all ways. The space is unending. Right. Now go ahead and close your eyes and imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling, in the roof, so that you rise way up above it all in the sky. You're having this bird's eye view of seeing it all as being under and below you, because you're on, above and over it, free. Just like the bird to soar through the space of the sky. Glide and fly, making these big wide turns and curves and arching angles. You soar, you glide, you fly, you move free. Bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside you. When you're ready, take a nice deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. In those short moments, eyes were closed, what were you noticing within yourself? Yeah, I bet. And so, one last piece before we go to clearing things. I'd like you to think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something beautiful. Like the moment you're looking at it, you're like, wow, what is it that you see?
[27:42] B: Sunset.
[27:43] A: Yeah. And there's a moment that as you're seeing the sunset, you're feeling that sense of excitement and peace all at the same time. And people might tell you, well, yeah, of course the sunset is going to give you those kinds of feelings. But if we came from that other lens, we could say that, no, that being there and experiencing and seeing it simply drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because at your center, you always are peaceful and excited. Kind of like if I'm at the campfire and my hands are cold, so I'm moving towards the flames, and then I say, holy cow, Emily, the fire is getting hotter. You would tell me the fire is not getting any hotter. I'm becoming more aware of the heat. So we know that there have been many times in your life where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Stressors, upsets, angers, guilt, shames, pains, sadnesses, hurts. But no matter where your awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited. Just like you can tell two of us are in here. How do you know it? You look around. Your senses bring in the data. Your intellect understands it. We call that kind of light knowledge. Light of knowledge. At your center, it's a brighter light. It's light of wisdom. So we've got knowledge, we've got wisdom. And. And I work with all sorts of people who've gone through all sorts of stuff. And I remember this one gal that I worked with a long time ago, older brother, used to take matchbox cars when she was like five or six and, you know, drive them up and park them in her. So she had a lot of gunk around it. Yuck. And as we worked together, we completely cleared all the shame, the hurt, the pain, the guilt gone. And I had to ask her the question, all that discomfort. I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone. I go, feel it. I go, I know, isn't that cool? I go. But the question was, where was it? And when we started thinking, I asked her, I go, was it up here? Was it a surface level thing? She goes, no, it wasn't intellectual. I go, oh, was it hiding in your center? And she's like, man, really? How could it survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited? And I said again, well, then, where was it? And she goes, oh, I know it was hiding. It was the distortion. It was between the lights that are now touching. The shadows are gone. I said, whoa, isn't that cool? She's like, yeah. And then we started talking about how people screw up identity all the time. People think that they are their bodies, right? I walk around while my body Is me. I am it. We think all the time that when people's bodies stop working, they stop. But what if you're not your body? What if you just have a body? What if your body's totally yours, but it isn't actually you? And I say that because my mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident. And when she visits people now, they don't say to her, suzy, I'm so glad almost all of you can show up. They don't say it. Why? Because all of her is there, even if that part of her body's missing. So you have a body. Your body's totally yours, but it isn't actually you. There's no cell within your body today that's the same. They all get replaced millions of times. Your feet alone are longer than they were when you were a little kid. Yet despite the changes, you're still you, right? So you have a body. Your body's totally yours, but it isn't actually you. You also have thoughts, but did you know that you're not actually the thinker of your thoughts? That your brain is the thinking thinker of your thoughts, not you? And that your brain is something you have? It's an organ, like your heart and your lungs. Totally yours, but not you. So if I'm not my body or my thoughts, then I must be how I feel. But you feel different ways at different times, so you can't possibly be a feeling. Well, maybe I'm what I do. Except you do different things. And when you stop doing one thing to do something else, you didn't stop existing. The weirdest question now shows up. Because if you're not what you do, or your thoughts or your feelings or your body, what the heck are you? Weird, right? So for our purposes, let's just say that the who you are is the light at the center. The who you are is what you became aware of as you see the sunset. Then, in the moment that you're experiencing it, your awareness is drawn into the center. That peace, that excitement, that light is you. The light that is you doesn't dim, doesn't go away. It might get covered, but it doesn't dim, and it doesn't go away. The light that is you is whole and complete, and there's nothing missing. And I say that again because people screw up identity. They come in and see me all the time. They go, I'm depressed, I'm anxious. I'm shy. I'm always seeing. Tell me all these diagnoses. I think that's who. They are weird. But if I go to the dentist and I'm upset and I go, you'll never believe what the jerk did. You're like, what did he do? Well, first he put me on a chair, and all of a sudden, my hand is going down, my feet are coming up. It's really uncomfortable. You're like, okay, but you're at the dentist. Okay. Well, then he shined this light right in my eyes. I can't see a darn thing. Okay, you're at the. Then he took this cold metal instrument, shoved it inside of me, and you're like, oh, my goodness. And you're. What? I said, emily, my mouth. You know, because I've got one. I'm not one, but it's the same thing that I said to the girl with the mashbox scars. I said, when you were little, he really messed with your stuff. And she looked at me, and then she started to smile, and she says, yeah, I did mess with my stuff. And for. For a long time, it really screwed up my thinking, and it hurt my feelings, fucked up a lot of what I did. And then she looked at me, she goes, baby, you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body. It hurt my feelings, screwed up my thinking, but he never touched me. I said, whoa, that's cool. And so you and I are joining forces. We're joining forces to rewire faulty programming. Some unconscious blueprints that got installed, other programming that got wired in the wrong way based on experiences that you went through that happened to you, that you did. So we're joining forces to change the way that your brain has information coded, changing the way the emotional brain automatically responds to stuff. And there's a really cool thing about energy. Do you want to know what it is when two people bring energy together? Energy is expansive. So it's not a one plus one equals two, but it expands. And so one more time, slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. That's right. And breathe a little slower and deeper, lengthening your exhale. As your awareness opens up to notice more space, the thing you'll realize is that no matter where you are and whatever is around you, there's always more space. Heck, you're made up mostly of it. If we thought of your body, the part that's truly solid, we have to go out five decimal points. It's.00001% of your body solid. The rest of you is space. That's. It's crazy that if we took an Atom which has an electron around it, a proton and neutron, and we blew it up to the size of a marble. That proton, neutron, center. The electron floating around it would be more than a football field away. Why do we feel solid? It's the ceiling fan phenomenon. When it's on high, it seems like it's a solid blade, because when I go to go through it, it doesn't. But when it's off, you can see the gaps. It's that same thing where energy plus matter, it equals this physical existence. And Einstein, who is really smart, said, energy and matter equal us. And then the second law of thermodynamics, energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. So we may begin to realize that when people's bodies stop working, maybe they don't. Maybe they just exit the body. We don't pick them up in the same way we did. But it doesn't mean they're not here. There's a lot of things that we don't sense. Like the van has a radio. And before you turn it on to hear music. Are the radio waves there? They're here right now. Do you feel them? No. So our five senses are limited in scope, limited in what we can perceive. That weird. And that's the transformation, right? If you take a glass of ice, we put it out on a patio, and an hour goes by, and we're educated. A kid. And the kid looks and goes, somebody stole your ice, and they've replaced it with water. We would giggle and laugh and then educate the child and say, nobody stole the ice. It transformed, went from solid to liquid. But the molecule H2O is the same. Our perception, how we perceive it and pick it up completely change. Kid goes, oh, yeah, now I get it. We leave the glass of water out in the patio. Week goes by, he comes back, the water's gone. He's like, somebody stole your water. It's gone. We go, no, nobody stole it. It evaporated. He goes, what's that? Well, it moved from liquid to gas. H2O molecule, totally the same. How we pick it up, completely different. He goes, yeah, right. If I don't see it, how can I feel it? We go, all right, you live in Florida. It's all around you. We put him in the desert of Arizona, and we go, try to feel it here. And we bring him back to Florida and we show him the rain cloud, and we capture the water and we put it in the freezer, and he discovers, holy shit, it's all the same. So we want to be getting into different levels, things that we didn't know back then that we do now certain levels that one certain experience ended. Because that's an error that the brain doesn't know. We want the brain to know certain things stopped, right? That that experience no longer exists. Two, what keeps it locked is the association and the patterns. Our brain works really good with associated patterns. But the associated pattern that's screwing it up is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening are glitched, glued together. They're stuck. But there are things that you can remember doing that you know with certainty you're not doing right now. Like putting your shoes on. You remember doing it. You might even remember where you were when you did it and whether you tied them or not or just slipped them on, right? But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your sneaks on, and then I went, emily, stop putting on your sneakers. You would look at me like I'm crazy and go, but I'm not putting on my sneakers. Because what's crystal clear for you is there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually doing it. That's something that we want to get in. We want the brain to get the difference that the memory and the experience are not the same thing. Because how you clear something that you went through that was troubling requires one thing, only one thing. You want to know what that one thing is? Intend to be with me. The reason you want to be with me is that this is the shit that's happening and that isn't. Two, we're working on the mutual goal that we're both interested for you. And three, I'm hoping to be at least a little more fun than a sucky moment in your life. Got it. Then we just go through facts, Matter of fact, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened. That was done. Right? Then we take it in reverse. Nobody goes backwards when you do it, unplugs it. It takes away the charge. So one more time, lower your jaw and rest your tongue. Breathe a little slower and deeper. Allow the awareness to expand by noticing more space as you notice. Notice more space. Notice what happens as awareness drops down and inside towards delight. At your center, there is an ongoing calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy. That's right. Notice what happens as you're aware of space. And you close your eyes. That's right. And then with your eyes closed, imagine floating up and out of your body. Beyond the ceiling and the roof rising way up above it all in the sky, a bird's eye view Seeing everything under, below you are above and under, over it, you're free like the bird to soar and glide and fly. And because it doesn't matter what particular order things are in, we know that your unconscious on its own will bring awareness, bring experiences to your awareness for us to clear. So you can drift back down and inside to reassociate in you taking that nice deep slow breath in, big long exhale and open your eyes. Right. And how's your body feeling now? It is. And so as we're organizing towards the you becoming more and more emotionally present, light and clear, the other than conscious part of your brain is going to travel back down the timeline in your own personal history of negative experiences. It's going to begin to categorize and group experiences, and then it's going to narrow now all the way down to a particular time, a moment experience, and bring the experience to your awareness. What experience comes to mind now? Right there. That one that just came to mind happened about how long ago you might have been, how old you might have been? 4. Good. So we want to get that moment unplugged. When you think about that moment now, the feelings are the feelings of hurt, sadness, anger, grief, guilt, shame, pain, resentment, combination. All. All good. So first question, would it be okay to get that going, meaning all those feelings, if those feelings are gone, does it in any way, shape or form mean what happened was okay? Got it. So you get to be okay even if that wasn't. Right. So that particular moment happened. When it happened, you're where?
[44:04] B: In my. In my apartment, in my living room.
[44:07] A: So you're in the living room in the apartment. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[44:10] B: Daytime.
[44:11] A: Daytime. And like, are you like on a couch or a chair?
[44:14] B: I was in a door. I just walked in the door.
[44:17] A: You walked in the door. Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[44:21] B: My grandma told me that my mom died.
[44:24] A: So grandma said, hey, I sit down.
[44:25] B: Maybe I was, I think she told me to sit.
[44:28] A: I was just like, why? What? Right. And she said, your mom died.
[44:31] B: Yeah.
[44:31] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[44:34] B: I told her she was lying. And.
[44:37] A: And then what happened?
[44:38] B: Started saying, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, and looking all around my house.
[44:43] A: Right. Good job. And what happened next?
[44:45] B: She wasn't there.
[44:46] A: Right. And then what happened?
[44:47] B: My grandma just kept crying and telling me that that was the truth.
[44:51] A: Right. And I notice how the mind likes to stop on the shitty spot. Yeah, Right. Then that moment ended. And then later on you did something more enjoyable. Right. Because we know that from four until yesterday, There have been things that you've done that were more fun than that moment. What's one thing, anytime from when that ended until heck yesterday, that was more fun than that moment.
[45:17] B: Going to the beach.
[45:18] A: Yeah, going to the beach. That was more fun. Good. Something else.
[45:22] B: Hiking.
[45:23] A: Yeah, hiking. Right. And one other thing.
[45:26] B: My son. Spending time with my son.
[45:28] A: Yeah, spending time with your son. So we got spending time with your son. We got hiking, we got going to the beach. All those moments happened after that one. There's a part of your brain that froze the moment that doesn't have any access to anything beyond it. So we have good news to get in hiding. So we never go backwards. As I said earlier, with a memory, we only go forward. But when you do, it literally unplugs it and it takes away the charge, so we go backwards. So we got, you know, hanging out with son, we got hiking, we go on the beach. Right. And then before that, you were crying, and then Grandma's like, no, it was. And then you had been calling for mom. And then you're like, you're a liar. And then she's like, I hate to tell you, but mom died. And then you would walk in the door. And then before that, you were off doing whatever you're doing. Yeah, right. And as I went through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it.
[46:23] B: Different?
[46:24] A: I know. Isn't that weird? It's because your brain is, for the first time, beginning to read what happened as data about something that happened versus happening. Got it. Second, remember, emotional brain doesn't get logic, but it does get the pattern of association. And we know that the memory and the experience have been glued, so we want to unplug it by associating other things that you already know are simply memories. So remember getting dressed, putting your sneakers on. You can remember Grandma telling you that. Emily, stop putting on your sneakers. Say, I am not putting on my sneakers. Say that. Well, then you stop putting on your jacket. Say, I am not putting on my jacket. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then stop Grandma from telling you that. The grandma's not telling me that. Say that. Well, then you stop putting your sunglasses on your head. I'm not putting my sunglasses on my head. Right. What's so stupid? Right. Just play along. Right. Stop me from putting on my sneakers. Say, you're not putting on your sneakers. Well, then stop that from happening. Say, that's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we Want to get in right now the last little component. Because what do you notice now? Yeah. That earlier you, when that happened, wasn't sure she was gonna be okay. Also thought some of that had to do with mom lack of or my lack of love ability. So as we look at it from an adult, that thing happening, did it have anything to do with you? No. Did it have anything to do with mom's lack of love for you or your lack of love for ability to have to do with something that was on with mom.
[48:23] B: She died of a drug overdose.
[48:24] A: Right. So it had something to do with what was off with mom. Makes sense, right? Had nothing to do with you. Right. That younger you also doesn't know that you're okay, that you made it through it, that you didn't actually need Mom. Then in order for you you to turn out okay. Right. In order for you to move out and be on your own, in order for you to see the sunset at the beach, in order for you to hike, climb. So we want to get that news in. So first you're going to repeat these four words. Here we go. It's not about me, right? It's not. Say that about me. Right? It's not about me. Right? Then we're gonna let the younger you know that you're okay. So go ahead and close your eyes and picture the younger you just after that happened. Let the younger you know that that moment is over, finished and completed, that it no longer exists. Let the younger you know that that happening had nothing to do with you or mom's lack of love. Had everything to do with what was off with mom. Then it's not about me so that she gets it. Let the younger you know that you didn't need mom in order for you to turn out okay and love your own son. Let the younger you know about hiking in the mountains. Let her know about seeing the beach and the sunset. Let her know. Right. About hanging out with her. Let her know that you're okay. That's right. And as that earlier you is getting it, what do you notice happening to the earlier you's face? That's right. There we go. That's a good breath. What are you noticing now?
[50:31] B: I just feel a lot better about it.
[50:33] A: I bet. Isn't that crazy? Yeah, right? That's crazy, right?
[50:42] B: Like, been in therapy since I was 4.
[50:45] A: Huh?
[50:46] B: I just think that's crazy. I've talked about it like 120 times.
[50:51] A: In my life and I'm never like. I don't know.
[50:53] B: I felt amazed because I Don't talk about her anymore.
[50:55] A: Uh.
[50:57] B: Cause I just don't bring it up in therapy.
[50:58] A: Like I've talked about it so many times.
[51:00] B: Like, what's the point?
[51:01] A: Cause they didn't let me cook on the kitchen.
[51:03] B: Yeah. Yes, precisely that. They won't let me play with it now.
[51:15] A: Yeah, right, right. Because at that time that you were in therapy, they didn't know how to get it better. They also didn't know that it probably would have been better to just do like, you know, 15 minute increments. Popping in, having a good time with you, playing a game and leaving. Popping back in, having another good time with you playing a game and leaving. So that then it would have been fine versus intense. Try to do it. Fuck off.
[51:48] B: A lot of that is I think maybe the reason I shove. I mean, probably other reasons too, but I think I put things under the rug as much as I do because it's like that was very intense.
[51:59] A: Yeah. And it didn't help.
[52:02] B: It made me feel like over pressured to stuff it down.
[52:08] A: Right. Not because they weren't well intentioned, but they did have the right tool. It's like anything. Right. I can certainly cut a tomato with a butter knife. It ain't gonna work very well. It's gonna be all sloppy. But you know, if I have a nice serrated blade, oh man, it goes right through the tomato and I get good slices. Right. The appropriate tool matters. I certainly can cut down a tree where the sawzall. But there's a different kind of tool that's gonna make that one a lot easier. So you kind of gotta match what you're doing with the right tool to get it better. Right? Yeah. Because now even as you're thinking about it, it doesn't have that same heaviness. Right. It doesn't feel like it had anything to do with you. And we also have the context that even though that happened because when that happened younger, you thought. Because it would have made sense that I needed her in order for me to turn out okay. Did you? No. Right, right, right. And you can even check the other part. You having used and having had a problem with using, did that have anything to do with your son's lack of lovability?
[53:59] B: Not at all.
[54:00] A: That's right. Had to do with mom was a little up. That's right. That's right. And see, now that gets to be embodied. So we want to do more healing because again, as we organize towards. Towards the. You becoming much more emotionally present here, dealing with what is without the effect of what has. Or the worry about what might. Because she has the internal knowing that she already has what she needs to make it through difficult stuff. That's right. Back then, you weren't sure. So you keep thinking that I need to be sure of stuff out there. No, see, we want it installed in here. That regardless of what shows on out there, I have what I need to move through it in a way that's best for me. Make sense? So again, as you slightly lower your jaw and you rest your tongue and you breathe a little slower and deeper and you expand out and you notice more space that other than conscious part travels back again through those negative experiences. And once again, we'll bring another moment to your awareness for us to clear what's coming to mind. Now.
[55:41] B: I don't know if it's a moment or romance.
[55:43] A: Well, it probably has more than one. But if it has more than one, the good news is we'll think of it as one time that it did.
[55:51] B: My dad just. Dad wasn't there. So when I was a kid, it really bothered me.
[55:57] A: So let's think of a time you might have been how old? When you thought dad should have been there and he wasn't. Or maybe he even said that he was gonna be and he didn't.
[56:09] B: Probably like every Father's Day ever.
[56:11] A: Yeah. Yeah. So this one, we'll make it up. He might have been how?
[56:17] B: No, actually he did. He called me one time. I was seven. The only time, only time he's ever called me my whole life before I met him. Yeah, but I was seven.
[56:28] A: So you were seven. You were at Grandma's. Yep. Right. Daytime or nighttime?
[56:33] B: It was nighttime.
[56:34] A: Nighttime.
[56:34] B: Right. I was on the computer.
[56:35] A: He had been on the computer. Right.
[56:37] B: He was in the second grade.
[56:38] A: Right. Good job, good detail.
[56:39] B: I was playing with a webkinz.
[56:42] A: Right. Good job, good detail. That's right.
[56:44] B: And I was telling him about school.
[56:49] A: Right.
[56:49] B: And we were on the phone for about an hour.
[56:51] A: That's right.
[56:52] B: And. And I don't really remember what we talked about, but I remember that when we hung up, he didn't say, I love you.
[56:59] A: Right. Good job, good detail. And it bothered the fuck out of him, see? So he didn't. Right. Good. In the morning, never heard from him again. And then he didn't call. Right.
[57:07] B: Never again.
[57:08] A: Right. Well. And then later on, you did something more enjoyable like go hiking, ride or see a beautiful sunset or go to the beach. Ride or hang out with your boy. Right. So we got hanging out with your boy. Right. We got seeing the sunset. Hanging out at the beach, going hiking. Right. And then he hadn't called. Right. And then he had gotten off the phone without saying I love you. And then you guys have been talking and then he had called. Right. And then before that you were doing whatever you're doing, right? And as we go backwards compared to forward again, emotionally, how was it? Say more or less. Yeah, you can remember that happening, right? You can remember him not saying I love you. You can also remember putting your socks on. Emily, stop putting on your socks. I'm not putting on my socks. Well then stop remembering getting off the phone without saying I love you. Say he's not doing that. Well, then you stop putting on that ring. Say I'm not putting on the ring. Well, stop me from putting on my ring. See, you're not putting on your ring. Well then stop that from happening. Say that's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. And again, him being that way, did that have anything to do with you? Your lack of lovability, his lack of love? Did it have to do with stuff that was off with him? Because are we thinking dad, you know, all growing up and maybe even into some time now, dad a guy 100% mentally emotionally stable and well, right. That earlier you didn't know that dad was fucked up because when we're in second grade we still have it. That parents are awesome, wonderful, great, don't make errors and are amazing because they can do everything. Got it. That earlier you thought him not being around or even saying that had something to do with you. Did it have anything to do with you? Right. In the same way the kid who drops the tray in the cafeteria and now all the kids are laughing at him because shit splattered everywhere and he's on the ground. Want Harry Potter's cloak? Get me the hell out of here. It feels her laughing at me. Would it have mattered which kid? No. Anybody having that accident, they would laugh. It's not about me. That earlier you didn't know that dad not being around and not saying that had nothing to do with you. Everything to do with what was off with him. And that she didn't need him to be there then in order for you to turn out okay and love your son. That's right. I mean, because you know, when you talk to your son, you definitely don't tell him that. Never say I love you. You do, don't you? All the time. Maybe more than a lot.
[60:12] B: More than a lot.
[60:14] A: That's right. That's right. So again, close your Eyes and picture the younger you. And let her know that moment it's over, finished, completed. That it no longer exists. That dad being that way had nothing to do with you or even his lack of love or your lack of love, of villainy. It has everything to do with what was fucked up with dad back then. Right? So that she gets it. It's not about me. Let her know that you didn't need dad then in order for you to turn out okay and love your son. To go hiking, to see beautiful sunsets, to hang out at the beach. That's right. To be doing things now that are positively healing you for you and those that matter to you. That's right. And as all of this is getting in, what do you notice happening with the earlier you? You do, don't you? Right? You're becoming more okay in you. Cuz part of the unconscious blueprint that got installed by no fault of your own had to do with feeling that them not being around meant something about me. Now the strength that it developed is I get to be fiercely independent.
[61:59] B: Super independent is with dead side.
[62:02] A: I'm just going to say fiercely independent. I don't need no one. That's right. And here's the cool part. You don't actually. But sometimes it's nice to allow others to contribute. Right. Cause you know what gives people joy? Yeah. Being a contribution. My mom. I hated her when she said this. When I was like down or depressed or upset, she goes, go out and be a contribution to somebody. Go, go open the door for an old lady.
[62:46] B: I used to hold the door open for people coming a block away. My grandma used to be so mad. She's like, stop. They're like two blocks down the street and I just be all excited. Holding like a library door open for somebody. Like when I was a kid, I just. I don't know, I think maybe.
[63:01] A: Right.
[63:02] B: I subconsciously knew that helping people was a good feeling because I always wanted to do it. I remember I made her stop and give someone my umbrella. I was in like the first grade and I made her pull over in the rain because there was a homeless person walking and they didn't have an umbrella. And I just got in this umbrella, this brand new pink umbrella I was so excited about. And I only remember it because my grandma never shut the hell up about it after it happened. Calling all our friends on the phone. Emily's the sweetest person.
[63:32] A: I mean, this person's walking with umbrella. Right? I just.
[63:35] B: I didn't do it. So she would call all her friends I did it because the person was out there with no umbrella and they're walking with a cart full of stuff.
[63:43] A: And they're just sopping wet.
[63:46] B: And I just felt so bad, like I wanted to give her everything. I didn't have any money, but whatever I could give her, I'm just like, oh, my God. You don't need any more stuff, but you need an umbrella.
[63:55] A: Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I think part of that kind.
[64:01] B: Of went away as I got older.
[64:03] A: I became more selfish. I think you became a little hardened.
[64:11] B: Now it's like, they're not my business, not my problem. Sorry about their luck. Yeah, sucks to be them.
[64:18] A: But that's what happens when we go through hard knocks. Do you know what the opposite of addiction is? It's connection. You know that in Portugal they did an experiment because normally we criminalize addiction. Go to jail, get arrested, get felonies, fucks up like your working life. And right, we criminalize people, shame them, you bad person, you. So Portugal used to do the same thing as the United States, right? And in 2012, they changed and they went, okay, we're going to get people into rehab. But the opposite of addiction, we are connection beings. We are all about connection, connecting to others. And if we've got our own trauma or own experiences that interrupt us being able to be in connection, then we connect to a substance. Right. 90% of the men who were in Vietnam fighting in the war were using heroin. Not 90% of them came back being heroin addicts. The grandmother who is on oxy because she broke her hip doesn't get off the oxy, start searching for heroin. If we have healthy connections and if we learn how to connect, the opposite of addiction is connection. Isn't that interesting? So Portugal said, we're not going to criminalize. We're going to use all the money that we did to arrest and criminalize and, you know, prosecute and use all of those funds. We're going to get them into rehab, but they're going to use all the money to get them hired to do whatever skill set that they have. And as the government will pay half of their salary for the first two years. So as a business owner, you get a person who you don't even have to pay, have to pay half their, like. It's fantastic because they learn that it's connection having, like purpose. Connection matters. And their rate of drug use they decriminalized at all has completely dropped. Isn't that crazy? Yeah, right. So part of programming is learning how to connect because it's weird. It's like these people and, like, who are they? And, like, why do they have any stake in my life? Like, it's weird, right? Like, so some.
[67:33] B: So they all vote. There's a thing where they vote on people phasing up. And that's. That's a strange. Really strange concept to me.
[67:42] A: Yeah.
[67:44] B: Bunch of people are going to vote on whether or not I'm growing the. I'm growing on my own. Me staying is growth for me. I don't.
[67:55] A: Right.
[67:56] B: I can talk to a stranger in the gas station about my fucking problems. If you got ears. I got a mouth. I don't care who you are. Like, I feel bad for the person. I feel bad for the person listening more than anything else. But I told them that at the program. I said, there's not one advocate I won't pull to talk about my day.
[68:13] A: About what I'm doing. You're the lady that goes to Publix. And when they say, so how's your day back? Well, let me tell you. Do you have a few. Go ahead, turn that light off. We're gonna chat.
[68:24] B: Keeping the clerk there. Like, it's. Yeah, it's just. And that is like, I don't have a problem opening up with anybody.
[68:30] A: But that's so good.
[68:33] B: I do have a problem with the idea that people vote on whether or not I should move along in my phases. I think that's fucking weird. Like, you all take a group vote, it becomes a popularity contest. Or if. What if they don't agree with my views on.
[68:48] A: Or maybe it's not a vote. Maybe it's gathering. What are you seeing? What are you noticing? What's been your experience of how she's been progressing?
[69:04] B: Part of me thinks I should have walked in more up so I could have got better. Maybe I should have been more.
[69:10] A: You're fucked up enough.
[69:11] B: I am up enough. But, like, I feel like maybe I should. Maybe I should have been like. Maybe I should have been like, more like, oh, I don't trust. Trust you. So that they could be like, oh, she's opening up. But I don't have an issue opening up. But they see that. So.
[69:25] A: No, yours isn't that. Yours is impulsivity. Yours is maybe not always sharing. Yours is being more measured, feeling more settled. Yours is being okay with others contributing, being okay, having others assist. Right. That's part of the whole process of them gathering. It's them assisting, not them voting. Whether you're progressing. Progressing or not. It's so good, Emma.
[70:14] B: That's what I feel like they're doing.
[70:16] A: But it. But what it is is it's them contributing, sharing what they've noticed. Has she? Because we come with different sets that work better. There are other residents that for them sharing isn't something that is natural or even okay because of how they grew up. Right. But they have a different thing. They might not be so impulsive. Right. So we all have our own stuff. But as you think about the things that we just talked about, what do you notice in terms of how you're feeling?
[71:10] B: I feel I guess more open. Like I feel like lighter and then I just feel like a little more open to suggestion I guess would be the wording.
[71:24] A: Because the thing that we're interested in doing is creating connection. What I can tell you, the people who are most successful that literally change from the situation they were in and going through all of programming and are living lives that are working are ones who develop connection. Right. We know that your strength is I can do it on my own and nobody's gonna fault that. Right. But we don't live in tribes anymore. It doesn't kind of work. Just on my own all the time time. Sometimes I need a drive with me. That's the area of growth and development for you.
[72:33] B: I've had like my friends because if.
[72:36] A: You go to jail, jail is about being separate. Not together. We're all together cuz we're in jail but we're separate cuz I'm not really there for you. You learn that really into this gal cool. I just got out. You want to leave this program that like is supposedly good for you to come see me totally clean or not?
[73:03] B: Yep, yep, sure.
[73:07] A: I'm in your sister.
[73:10] B: I see your sisters today. Every Friday I see your sister because.
[73:13] A: That was part of wanting connection. Yeah, yeah, right.
[73:20] B: Sometimes I feel like I can't not see her because I keep seeing your fucking sister. It's just like.
[73:27] A: But that's not it. That's. So this is where the area right of transformation that sets you up because what is going to be. You could leave, grab your son got rights. Wouldn't it be better for him to have a community? Wouldn't it be better sometimes for you to have somebody that you could like that already knows a community cares about him and gotta help you take care of him because it's hard to take care of a kid. I don't know what we would have done without my mom sometimes helping out with our kids. They don't have my wife's mom at all. Her dad or stepmom or stepdad. Stepdad. So that's part of it. Part of it is being able to slow down, to move fast. The Navy SEALs got it right. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. So you don't have to make any decisions. You've got time. Chord isn't for till Valentine's Day.
[75:12] B: Happy Valentine's Day. Right.
[75:16] A: And there's more for us to be doing in clearing and healing and opening up to see more than the either or so that you're much more settled. Because we already know you can do things on your own. We also know some of that is impulsive. Maybe not guided.
[76:01] B: No.
[76:01] A: Never guided by the best wisdom.
[76:04] B: Just sheer impulsively.
[76:10] A: Yeah.
[76:14] B: And rebellion. I'll fuck you. I'll do it on my own. I got this.
[76:19] A: That's right.
[76:19] B: Fuck you again.
[76:21] A: That's right. Mm. And I gotta see what's in it for me. I gotta see it is valuable for me. For me in my life. For me and what I want for me in my life. Right.
[76:51] B: It's fucked up. I, like, I don't want my kid's father in my fucking life. I don't want his dad in my life. I don't want no other fucking family in my life. But then when I think about it, I'm like, who do I have here? Like, what is in Florida for me? And it's just my dad. My dad sucked for most of my life, and now he's sober. And now he spends more time with my son than he's ever spent with me as a kid. And I can't see my own son.
[77:19] A: And he sees him yet.
[77:21] B: I haven't been able to see my son yet. And he sees him. And I think that just rubs me the wrong way. I should be happy that at least.
[77:30] A: I think maybe he's making amends. I mean, you know, if he's sober, he's got that whole big book. Maybe there's making amends. I can't do it for her, but while she's getting herself well, I can do it for him. The thing that I tell people all the time at the time, my dad was not present in my life growing up. Wound up being the biggest gift that he gave to my children. Did you know what my children get? No. A dad who's there? My dad was gone. I was 2. I'd never see him. I've got a 14 and a 10 year old. They got a lot of years that I didn't get with a dad present. A dad who's there. Right. We're interested in you becoming more and more okay. In you more and more whole. With room to breathe. To be able to move slow so that things are smooth, so that you can move fast. Yeah. And this is where we're headed. Got it. You did great work today. Okay. And we'll get together one more time before you go to court, okay? Okay.
[79:19] B: Sounds good.
[79:20] A: Awesome.
