[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 19th of July, Gabby. This is our first meeting. We're doing an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:12] B: Yep.
[00:13] A: Okay. And that recording, given what we do, becomes transformable and life changing for you, may actually be used in teaching and training people how to do this kind of work. Isn't that cool? So, like, you and I get to actually be teachers for others.
[00:27] B: That's cool.
[00:28] A: I know, right? Got to make a bigger difference in the world. So going back to the reason that we're really troubled by any of the crap we've gone through isn't because of how bad it was. It's because when it happened, part of our brain got stuck, that part, let's say, got separated. Kind of like a fragment by itself. And it's not connected to the rest of our nervous system. Which explains why anytime I think about it, I'm right there. Anytime something in my world reminds me of it, I'm right back there. So the deal isn't to out the bad feelings. It's really to unplug the memory. See, the issue is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening got glued together. So at that level, that part of the brain, the memory is the experience. That's why there's all that physio emotional stuff that goes on once the memory is unplugged, the pain that was attached to it and it's like light switch turning on, going like that. I mean, it's literally that fast. Dumb. Like that used to bother me, now it doesn't bother me. I can think about it and I used to always have this, and now I think about it, I got none of that. That's brilliant. Freaking cool. I mean, it's literally like that light switch turns on. Then once that happens, we want to put that moment back into the timeline. Because where else it's missing is that it's not connected to anything that happened later in life that was more enjoyable than the yucky thing. And all of us have had more enjoyable things than yucky things. Not that we've had more of them, but there's things that have happened after a yucky thing that was more enjoyable than the yucky things. Right. I mean, if like, you know, this guy is telling us about having been robbed when he was, you know, 19, and, you know, he's telling us about how the guy whacked him across the head and stole his wallet and left him there, well, as he's telling us about it. He gets all emotional. Yeah, but he's 49. That happened when he was 19. What is that, 30 years later? Hello. Like, can't you get. Get over it? Right? That's what people say. Why don't you just get over it? Or my favorite one that therapists love to say, I don't know if you've ever heard this before. You know, you just need to learn how to let that go. Have you heard that before? As if somehow I'm doing something to hold on. Yes. I love feeling this way. Oh, oh. It's just gotta let it go. Or my other favorite one. You know, you need to learn how to forgive and forget. Really? Well, what if it's something that's unforgivable? Because people do shit in life that's unforgivable. How do you forgive something that's unforgivable? Kind of like, how do you understand something that's not understandable? But that notion of letting go. I'm holding the pen, okay? I gotta let it go. How much effort did that take? Not much. Not much, right? So what if we're never holding those kinds of strong emotions? What if they have a hold of us, but not because somehow our brain wants us to feel like crap, but because part of it got stuck? See, we tend to look at life that it's the stuff of life that causes the feelings. Whether it's the past stuff, the current stuff, or the future stuff. It's stuff. So, guy's driving down the road, he's minding his own business. Some asshole cuts in front of him. He slams his brakes, he freaking pissed. And we go, why are you mad? And he goes, that got in front of me. That guy made me feel this way. Right. The problem in that lens is that it gives us limited power. Change it or avoid it. Isn't that how we deal with most of the yucky stuff? Right. Person's in a relationship, it's not going well, they try to change it. If they can't change it, they get the hell away from. That's pretty much how we do life. Change it or try to get away from it. But in life, there's some stuff we can't change. There's some stuff we can't fully get away from. And then there's all the stuff that's happened in our life that we can't get it to have not happened. So we gotta do something else with stuff. That's where I get to come in. It's all about adjusting how that more Emotional, preconscious, automatic part of our brain reacts and responds to stuff. So I like to use a silly example of a lion approaching a zebra. And most people are going to say it's that lion that makes this zebra scared. And we all go, duh, of course, but from a different lens. We go, wait, no, what if it's not the lion? What if instead it's something that the zebra's brain is doing to the zebra and it's doing it when the zebra itself senses, sees, smells, or thinks that lion is approaching, it's the zebra's brain that's doing it to the zebra. Yes, it's doing it in response to the lion approaching, but it's the brain of the zebra that's doing it. And what the Zebra didn't know, 15 minutes ago, the lion ate a gazelle. Lion stuffed full. I've got no interest in the zebra, but the brain of the zebra is going to err on the side of caution. Have it run it again. Right. Same thing with us. What if we looked at it through the lens that what causes us to feel react the way that we do in response to stuff past or current or future, is something that our brain is doing to us, even if it's doing it to us in response to the stuff. Because from that lens we got a lot more power. We can change stuff, we can avoid stuff, we can adjust how our brain responds to stuff. Got it. Cool. Second part to all of that, people go, you're the trauma therapist, which encourages people thinking, I have to deal with that. I do a damn good job trying to never think about that. I got these on, man. But see, nobody would care at all in any way, shape or form about any of the crap we've gone through if it wasn't somehow negatively affecting now, meaning in this present moment, people find themselves feeling ways they don't want to feel, reacting to things in ways that they don't want to react, thinking thoughts that they don't want to be thinking. And they don't know how to not do that. So the whole purpose, if we were to ever deal with any of that stuff isn't to deal with the stuff, it's to get life to work better. Now, if somebody gets like night terrors and they have bad dreams about shit that happen, well, that's happening right now to them. Well, gosh, one of the things that we want to do is to get it so they no longer have night terrors. If somebody has a more intense startle response, we'd like to get it so that that stops. If that means it clears out some of the stuff, cool. But the purpose isn't to dive into that stuff. The purpose is to get life to work better. Now, does that make sense?
[07:53] B: It's a lot of info, but I think I'm pretty much getting it.
[07:56] A: I know I'm going really fast. That's why we're recording it. Yeah. So. And the good news is, you don't have to remember everything that I'm saying.
[08:06] B: Okay.
[08:07] A: The key thing is really, is what I'm saying making sense to you? As I'm saying, pretty much like you're following the train of thought, so to speak. And I know I'm on a lot of different trains and a whole bunch of different tracks.
[08:20] B: I think the major train I think I'm.
[08:22] A: You're on. Right, Good. Alright. Because all we need to do is get on the train and then I'll take you through all sorts of different tracks. Right. And that's the other part with this kind of stuff, like recovery, you know, somebody staying clean and sober. That's your ongoing job, Right. That's why people go to groups, that's why people go to meetings. That's why people do stuff about that. That's your job to get better for you. When it comes to ways that you feel or react or think that you don't want to be thinking, feeling or reacting. What if it's not your job to get it better? What if it's mine? Isn't that a weird way to think?
[09:01] B: Yeah.
[09:01] A: No. Right. But if you go to the dental hygienist, which I went there yesterday, no cavities. I know, right? Is it her job to clean my teeth.
[09:14] B: Or is it not every day?
[09:16] A: No. My job is to do maintenance, brush my teeth. I'm not there to scrape. She doesn't hold the mirror up and hand me that tool and scrape. I don't do it. She does the work. We have collaboration and cooperation. We're working towards the same thing, which means, you know, having, you know, teeth that are cleaned. But it's really her job to do the work, not mine. What if, when it comes to these kind of ways that you feel that you don't like and you don't know how to not feel or react in ways that you don't know how to not. What if it's not your job to get it better? What if it's mine?
[09:55] B: You can have it.
[09:56] A: I know, right? Wouldn't that be cool? Then you don't have to worry, like it's not on you. Right? Because I really look at it that it's my job to do the work in collaboration. I can't do it without you being here. I can't do it without you collaborating. You're like, there's not gonna be a chance. However, we're working together towards a mutual goal. So all of that being said, sometimes. Sometimes people come in because they realize they're a lot more on edge. Meaning they're more easily irritated, agitated, aggravated. Maybe they're more quick or short tempered. They say they do things that later on they're like, they don't want to be overreactive in that way. Some people come in because they're more tense, nervous, anxious, jittery. They get like discomfort in certain social situations. They get a lot of racy thoughts. Maybe it's a lot of negative criticism, critical thoughts. Maybe it's when they lay down to sleep at night, it's on and they're not sleeping and then they're agitated that they're not able to sleep. Maybe it sometimes moves into full fledged panic or anxiety stuff. They don't want to be feeling like that. They want that to go away. Some people come in because they can. You know what? I realize that there's a lot of shit that's happened in my life. And although I know that it's over underneath the surface, it still bothers me. Meaning sometimes I think about it when I don't want to. Sometimes shit reminds me of it when I don't want it to and I got. I'd like that to be gone. Some people come in because grief stuff gets stuck or frozen, meaning they think about loved one and they feel awful or somebody that mattered to them that died and they got a lot of. And they don't want to be feeling like that anymore. Maybe it's guilt, shame, kind of remorse, regret stuff. Some people come in because they're just more down, depressed. Like I used to have a lot of energy and interest and now I'm like, I just kind of like walk around in that state. I don't want to be feeling like that either. So they want that better. So all of that being said, what is it that you would be wanting our time to actually get accomplished for you? What do we want to get better?
[12:02] B: I don't know. I'd like to not. One thing that bothers me is like rap music always triggers me.
[12:14] A: Okay.
[12:17] B: I don't know. I know.
[12:18] A: Good thing you guys only listen to classical stuff.
[12:20] B: Oh yeah, Yeah. I don't know. There's a lot of stuff in my past. But that one thing is happening right now where, like, a lot of it is going on in the house.
[12:32] A: So a lot of music, like rap music is going on in the house.
[12:38] B: Yeah.
[12:38] A: And that causes a lot of discomfort.
[12:40] B: Yes.
[12:41] A: And that reminds you of a lot of the yucky stuff that happens. We'd like that to stop. Right. Because the problem wasn't the music is.
[12:49] B: The thought attached to it.
[12:50] A: It's what was happening as the music was going on.
[12:53] B: Yeah.
[12:54] A: Right. I'll give you a silly, silly example because I think that this is funny. Probably wasn't funny at the time, but it was funny. It's funny now, and the woman can laugh about it now, but when she was nine, her parents told her and her brother that they were getting a divorce. She totally didn't want that to happen. She happened to be eating a Nilla wafer at the same time that her parents told her. So now every time she sees a box of Nilla wafers in the store, she's pissed. She goes to somebody's house that's a friend of hers who made this lovely banana pudding with whipped cream and layered it. Why do you gotta put those things in it? I know, it's funny, right? But we know that the issue for her when that situation happened was not the Nilla wafer. That isn't the thing that bothered her. It's what her parents told her. But because it was happening at the same time, her mind confused it and it got stuck together. Make sense? That's what you're recognizing with some of this music stuff. It's kind of. And then it's triggering back to. You'd like that to stop. You'd like that to be cleared so you could actually, like, hear, you know, some different lyrics and lines and, like, be okay.
[14:06] B: Well, I mean, I don't want to hear that stuff at all, but.
[14:08] A: Well, right now, because it does all.
[14:09] B: That well, just because of what it's saying, like, I don't want to listen to that stuff. But even in the van, they'll have it in their ears and be playing. And then I just. Like, I'm thinking about all this other stuff.
[14:23] A: Yeah, right. We want you to be free from the effect of all that other stuff. Yeah, that would be really cool. Right? Like, if we can just do that. We'd be thinking our time together was really valuable for you. Like, if you were completely free, like, if all that stuff that had happened, like, you could, like, think about it. You could in detail, describe it and be absolutely okay. Kind of like it would be if you were eating a slice of pizza. And people go, gabby, how can you not be troubled by that? And you go, I really like this pizza. Because the problem with all that stuff is human beings are weird. I'm particularly weird. But human beings in general are weird. Here's how we're weird. No other animal on the planet has a timeline like we do. Meaning you can know that you're sitting here now, if I asked you, you can remember something you did earlier today, and you can also think about something you're going to go do later. No other animal can do that. All other animals are locked in now. It's the only time that they have. Right. You can't tell your dog, I'll be back in an hour. And let's say it's three. Your dog's not sitting there going, five. I mean, seriously, I've had to pee for the last two hours. I thought you were gonna be back an hour. Right. That's not happening. Uh oh, now what's happening? Hold on. Right? So that doesn't happen. So the problem with human beings is our bodies are locked in now just like an animal. The problem is that our thoughts and our feelings can certainly be now based, but they can be past based. They can also be future based. It's why somebody can be thinking about something that could or might happen, and if it were to happen, it would be awful. When are they going to be feeling it? Right now, if somebody's remembering something that was awful, when are they feeling it? Right now, because their body's locked in now. It's kind of why I say to people, when we go to actually clear that stuff, the only requirement for you is to intend to emotionally be with me here now. Because this is what's happening and that isn't. And I know that I can be way more fun than sucky stuff. I don't even have to try hard. I'm way more engaging than them. Right, so. And that literally is the thing that unplugs the memory. There's a couple other pieces that we do with that, but that literally is what unplugs it. Because by being emotionally present, when you remember it, it takes it apart. Now the memory is read as data about something that happened versus how it had been stuck as happening. Make sense?
[17:25] B: Yeah.
[17:26] A: So we want to get that done. Okay, cool. I'm excited to do that. That'll be great. What else are we wanting to do for you?
[17:34] B: You tell me. I don't know. I don't know. You're gonna stop all the bad stuff, I guess, from me getting triggered with the bad stuff.
[17:44] A: Well, certainly that's one of the things that we're gonna do is get it so that you're no longer bothered by the crap that happened to you. Right. And that out of all of that, you actually feel stronger and more empowered and even better about you. Wouldn't that be even a better place? Not only are you going to be cleared and it no longer troubles you, you're actually going to feel better about you because you're like, you're actually sitting here now, meaning you made it through, like, war. There's probably some shit that happened that was close to war, and you made it and you made it through it and shit. We want you to feel really good about that. Right. Okay. What are other things or ways that you find yourself feeling or reacting that you don't want to.
[18:29] B: When somebody recently, like, somebody correcting me.
[18:34] A: Okay.
[18:39] B: I tend to get offensive.
[18:41] A: Like, somebody says, that's not right. The right word to use in that situation. Or, you know, you said, yeah, if.
[18:48] B: They correct me in any kind of.
[18:49] A: Way, don't like, yeah, the coffee pot goes over there. Not here.
[18:53] B: Right. Huh?
[18:57] A: Did you tell me to put the coffee pot somewhere else? I know where the coffee pot. That kind of thing. Okay. So somebody drop. Right. Well, that ties into this thing, right? This, this. This piece, probably.
[19:11] B: Yeah.
[19:12] A: Like, this, like, it's gotta be perfect so it can't be corrected. It would be really. It would be really cool for you to be, like, at peace and feeling good enough.
[19:21] B: Yeah.
[19:22] A: Like that. What you do is, like, good enough for you. Yeah. Okay, so we'd like to get that done so that you're not so reactive to that. Cool. What else? Are we all for you. I'm excited. This is gonna be fun. I know people go, what? You're fun.
[19:40] B: Add down there.
[19:42] A: Oh, you're doing good so far.
[19:43] B: Oh, thanks.
[19:44] A: Yeah.
[19:50] B: I don't know. I am not good, like, talking, like, I can. Okay. If I mess up something, I'll be like, it's like all or nothing. If I find myself backsliding a little bit, I'm, like, totally shot down. I won't talk. I'll go into the room by myself and just be by myself. We even went to the beach and.
[20:34] A: I was by myself because what happened before?
[20:38] B: I don't know. What do you mean? What made me feel like that?
[20:42] A: Well, you said that it's either all or nothing. And if I'm making progress and then I backslide, then I'M like, done. Okay, so something must have happened either on the way or before the beach that then you went, I'm out. I'm over there.
[20:56] B: Okay, so I am a sex addiction.
[21:02] A: Okay, maybe. I don't know whether sex is an addiction or not. I mean, you know what my PhD is?
[21:08] B: You think about it all the time.
[21:10] A: Huh. So you are like a guy then?
[21:12] B: Pretty much, if you want to say it. I don't know what guys are. I don't know. I do. I think about it all the time.
[21:17] A: Well, guys think about it all the time. Okay, women typically don't think about it all the time, but guys think about it all the time. That's why for a guy, if the girl's like, do you? He's like, yes. If it's a girl, yes. I mean, she doesn't even have to get the words out. Yes. 3:00 in the morning, he's kind of busy day. The next day he's got to wake up at six. She goes, hey, I'm low. Yes, I'm in. Right? That's like, yeah, I'm totally in. Yeah. Yep. That's the guy mentality. Women, it's not supposed to work that way, right? Women are supposed to, you know, play coy.
[21:44] B: Who said that?
[21:45] A: Who said that?
[21:46] B: That it's not supposed to work that way.
[21:48] A: Oh. Because the biology of attraction.
[21:51] B: So it's like a thing.
[21:53] A: So men get turned on by women. You gals are beautiful, sensual, provocative. Shapely, you smell good, you got different parts. Men get turned on by women. Women don't get turned on by men. I know.
[22:02] B: Women get turned on by other women sometimes.
[22:05] A: Well, and not only just by other women, but women get turned on. The mechanism that turns a woman on is being a turn on, is being a tease. Being the object of desire, knowing that the person's interested, but also knowing that they can't really have me unless I want to. Right. There's never, never, never in the animal plant ever. A female panther. Hot, right? Running after a male panther going, gaby, doesn't happen that way. She's never chasing him down. Oh, I gotta have him. Not happening. So the thing's a little off in you, but I don't know whether it's an addiction. It could be an obsession or a compulsion.
[22:50] B: Okay?
[22:50] A: Right. My PhD is in clinical sexology, of all things. Isn't that a great thing to get a PhD in? I mean, if you're gonna get a PhD in something, you might as well do it in sex, right? But it's not Necessarily an addiction, but you just find yourself thinking about it frequently.
[23:07] B: Yeah.
[23:08] A: Okay. And then, then wanting to do it. Could be guy, could be gal, could be whatever.
[23:13] B: Not necessarily wanting to do it, but my mind is like constant. Like, I don't know.
[23:23] A: I don't know. What was it that you were just seeing your picture? Well, I know, but then in your mind's eye, this.
[23:30] B: Yeah.
[23:31] A: No. Do you know what did that? This same guy that did the end tables. And that was a throw in that he gave me. And it's done on a paper bag and it's of Miami Beach.
[23:43] B: Oh, that's cool.
[23:43] A: South Beach. And of course, because it was a throw in, the most expensive piece of the art was the box that it was in. But I didn't know how else to display it to kind of show the depth of it. Yeah, Kind of interesting, right? Yeah, it's like that. I bought that in Cuba when we went to Cuba a couple weeks ago. And the most expensive part was the frame when I got back to the States because it was 25 bucks for the canvas that the warrant painted. $200 for the frame. Yay. And that's with a 70% off coupon. Can you imagine? And it doesn't have glass. Oh, my goodness. Anyway, so you find yourself thinking about it more than you wanted to be thinking about it. And are you thinking about times that you've done it or wanting to do it or what is it that you find yourself thinking about? That. Then you said, I'm a sex addict.
[24:43] B: I never thought about it there. I did go to a like a 30 day rehab thing and the lady was saying that that's what was going on. I don't know. So I kind of just came to terms with it, I guess.
[25:03] A: Right. But see the difference with an addiction, you don't have psychological or physical withdrawals.
[25:09] B: What, from having sex?
[25:11] A: From not having sex.
[25:14] B: You're asking me or are you telling me no?
[25:16] A: People don't have psychological, physical withdrawals in not having sex like they would in not using. You go through a period of time where you were using. Depending on what it is, you're going to have a physical withdrawal. Like alcohol hits the shakes. You like meth, if you do, you know, heroin or any of those other kind of pain pills. You have intense discomfort for a period of time, sweats and all sorts of shit as you're quote, unquote, withdrawing from it. It's not the same thing with sex. So sex fits. More of a compulsion, obsession. That's why I said, when you go Well, I find myself thinking about it. I go, so you're like a guy because the research goes guys think about sex every, like, 30 to 60 seconds. Right?
[26:13] B: Yeah.
[26:14] A: Okay. That we want to get shifted. So it's not, like, so much at the forefront. Right. Because we want to get the other thing shifted around either. Because guys are never going to say no. If a guy finds a girl that he's interested in and attracted to and she wants to, he's an always yes. Never know. Women are supposed to be yeses when they want to. The rest of the time it's no. You want that to kind of get regulated in you. Okay, cool. I know what to do about that, too. Get that thing organized. Right, Cool. What else are we wanting to do for you?
[27:04] B: I feel like I should have, like, wrote all of this down.
[27:08] A: No, no, it's better to come organic. And you don't even have to know because you've already told me a bunch of different things. One, we know that there's a whole bunch of stuff that's happened in life that although it's over, it's still underneath the surface, affects you. We get that for you. Sometimes this whole being corrected thing immediately gets you into a. I'm ready to throw down. Do you dare tell me that there's this whole, like, perfection thing? There's the problem with the all or nothing, which you were going to tell me a little bit more about what was going on that had you leave and be at a different part of the beach separate from the rest.
[27:46] B: So. I was recently saved when I went to jail.
[27:51] A: What does that mean, saved? Like, accepted? Jesus.
[27:54] B: Yes.
[27:54] A: Oh, cool. Good for you. Thanks. Right.
[28:01] B: I feel like so. I know.
[28:07] A: All right.
[28:09] B: I'm trying to figure out how to say it.
[28:11] A: So. Good.
[28:17] B: So masturbation is one of the things that I'm trying to not do, along with cussing and all that other kind of stuff.
[28:25] A: Okay.
[28:26] B: But that seems to bother me the most because it's so, like, big. And it's like, the biggest part of me. I feel like so.
[28:38] A: No, the clitoris is tiny.
[28:40] B: I know, but I don't know. Okay, so that's so good.
[28:50] A: You're doing great. Right? You're doing great. It's awesome. That's the thing that you're having a harder time stopping doing.
[28:58] B: No, I can stop doing that for, like, a couple weeks. But then when I did do was like, damn. Like, I felt like, oh, you felt.
[29:08] A: Really bad in having done it.
[29:09] B: Yes. And so.
[29:13] A: Because having done it then meant what?
[29:15] B: Well, it's A knowing sin.
[29:18] A: That was. So is it a sin? It is a sin according to.
[29:22] B: To me. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do it, so.
[29:31] A: Well, that's different than it being a sin.
[29:33] B: And lusting is a sin according to the Bible.
[29:37] A: Lusting for.
[29:40] B: Lusting for. Whatever is going on in my head is being or perversion or whatever.
[29:48] A: Oh, cool. So some of the things that you find yourself thinking about, you're considering, like, perversion. Nary thoughts.
[29:55] B: Yes.
[29:56] A: Okay. And those are the kinds of things that you think about that you don't want to be thinking about anymore.
[30:02] B: Yes.
[30:03] A: Right. I mean, it could be more okay to just think about vanilla stuff, but sometimes, given what you've experienced, there are other thoughts that are like, oh, okay, right. Like I tell people, sometimes porn doesn't become problematic until it starts giving unrealistic expectations in taking away interest. Because if you watch something like that, there's everything that you could possibly think of on there. And then people can think, oh, wow, everybody's into that. No, not everybody's into that. Some people are into that. But you want to have, like, those kinds of thoughts kind of begin to go away. Right. And not be so inclined to do it. But if you do do it, you don't want to have, like, all that that happens. So you could actually be maybe a little bit easier on you. Oh, that's what you mean by that whole thing of, like, either on or off. Like the perfect thing. Like, I did it right, right, right, right, right. And I screwed up. Fuck. It's not just like, oh, that's a half step on the way to stepping further forward. You didn't realize that if we're just taking steps and we want to take a big step, we have to take a half step back to launch ourselves forward. Huh. So it would be useful for you to be a little bit easier on you.
[31:22] B: Yeah.
[31:23] A: Yeah. That's a good one. That's a good response. Right. We want you to be a lot lighter and easier on you. Yeah. So that you get to be more and more good with you and at peace inside, more comfortable in your own skin. Cool. Okay. I know how to do that. Yay. Awesome. Cool. What else are we wanting to do?
[31:50] B: I'm not comfortable in my own skin.
[31:55] A: Not yet.
[31:56] B: Yeah.
[31:56] A: Yeah. I wonder what it'll be like when you are. How cool would that be?
[32:01] B: Yeah.
[32:01] A: Like when, like, you're, like, really, like, like, like good with you, like, at peace and that you're not, like, really thinking much about you. Because the Deal. When people have like they don't feel good, they think that the opposite would be to feel good about me.
[32:17] B: I didn't get that.
[32:18] A: Yeah, so people have low self esteem, like low confidence, low self worth, like they don't feel good about themselves. They think the opposite is to have a high self esteem is to feel good about me. But what if the opposite is to be not feeling much about you at all?
[32:35] B: Oh, why everybody else?
[32:38] A: No, that you're just not feeling much about you. That instead you're at peace and comfortable in your own skin. See, if somebody feels good about themselves, I mean, you wouldn't want to be around somebody who's constantly going, aren't I wonderful? Aren't I so great? Oh my goodness, I love me so much. Aren't I wonderful? Right. You wouldn't want to be around that person very often. See, the opposite isn't about feeling good about you because it's the same, same side, opposite side of the same coin. The problem is that you're thinking a lot about you. And yeah, I got that. Currently it's been more negative, critical stuff about things that you should do that you didn't do or things that you didn't do that you should have or stuff that happened. There's all that thing that's going on and where people get screwed up is they think then that the solution would be to start feeling good about me. But it isn't. It's about not feeling much about you at all. You can feel good about the things that you're doing, you can feel good about the things that you've done, but it's not feeling about you. It's being more, you know, at peace so that you're not thinking about you at all. It's just like I'm good, right? Because if I'm working with somebody, if I'm thinking a lot about me, I'm not going to do a good job with them. What are they thinking about me? Oh no, she's looking. What is she thinking now? If I'm doing that thing, I'm totally ineffective. The same thing happens with people in a group. If I'm thinking and worried about what other people might be thinking, I have these paranoid thoughts. It's pretty much I'm not going to do wrong in a social situation. I'm much better off if I'm not thinking much about me at all. But instead I'm at peace. So that's what we want, is you to be more at peace and more comfortable in your own skin.
[34:23] B: Please write that down.
[34:28] A: Well, that actually is one of the things that I shoot for, for everybody.
[34:31] B: Okay.
[34:37] A: Yeah. I mean, that is one of the things that I'm. I think that there. There are a few things that are common. I want people to be at peace inside. I want them to be comfortable in their own skin. I want them to be more outwardly focused so they're not thinking a lot about themselves or what others are thinking about them. I want them to feel good, not about themselves, but about what they're doing and the accomplishments they're making and the stuff that's happening for them. That's what I want. I want it to be quieter up top because too often we got that thing, and in particular, when we're in a bad state, it's like, really going on. I want people to be easier on themselves, a lot lighter. Because a lot of people have had yucky stuff, they tend to be really hard on themselves. Maybe some of it's about blame or remorse, regret or guilt. Or maybe some of it is they're, like, pissed at their younger self for having not known better. You've not done that. Great. That's not gonna help me out at all. Right. I want people to be good and free and realizing. The other part that I want people to realize is that other people's shit is their shit. That it's not about you. Too often we get stuck that that person being in a bad mood must be because I've done something I'm freaking done. In the house of freaking girls. Sometimes they're bitches.
[36:08] B: I don't know.
[36:09] A: I didn't do anything, but sometimes it feels like, well, I must have done. I get all that discomfort stuff must be like. And then it freaks because I didn't even do anything as this person. That kind of stuff. We want freedom there. Heck, you're not house with a bunch of girls. Sometimes who do you stop? That happens. You know, that would happen if you're just living in a house with anybody over an extended period of time. We don't always all get along. Every moment of every minute of every hour of every day. Sometimes there's shit that happens. Yeah. So we want the load to lift. We want you to be more at peace, comfortable. Yeah, that'd be good, right? We want to get it so that you're not so troubled by the thoughts that you might have that you're easier on you. We want some of the disturbing thoughts that you've been having to go away. And when we stop being disturbed by them, they stop happening. It's a crazy thing. Thoughts control us sometimes. Like a hand and a puppet controls the puppet until we expose it. Once it's exposed, it loses its power over us. No longer does the same kind of thing. That would be cool too. Yeah, Cool. Any other stuff that comes to mind for you? You've done a really good job so far.
[37:38] B: Thanks. Um.
[37:45] A: Oh, that's a good one. Are you really, like. Ah. All right. That's a really good one. Let's go down.
[37:51] B: I'm trying to avoid this one.
[37:53] A: It's so good. He keeps asking. Can't do. He was doing really good. I let him go. That arm.
[38:06] B: So when I was really little, I was masturbating. There was a dog around, and the dog came up smelling me and started, you know, licking. Yes.
[38:16] A: And some of that felt good.
[38:17] B: Right, Right. So that thought has been troubling me for, like, the past couple months now.
[38:26] A: Okay, because you've been feeling really bad over having done it.
[38:31] B: Yeah. Like shame.
[38:32] A: Oh. Would it be okay to no longer have the shame?
[38:35] B: Yes.
[38:37] A: It would be.
[38:38] B: Yeah.
[38:38] A: Yeah. Well, do you know why you're having the shame? Has anybody explained the mechanism of shame? Guilt.
[38:46] B: Cause it was wrong.
[38:48] A: No, it's actually because you can conceive of having not done it.
[38:52] B: Yeah.
[38:53] A: See, it's really weird. I'll give you a different parallel and it'll make a lot of sense. And then we can actually unplug it now. Cause that would be useful, don't you think?
[39:00] B: Yeah.
[39:02] A: Because, you know, it's okay for you to no longer feel bad about having done it. Because if you no longer feel bad about having done it, does it mean having done it was okay? Right. Oh, so you actually realize that you get to be okay even if that wasn't. But you didn't really know any different. I mean, how old were you?
[39:22] B: I don't know, like seven or eight.
[39:24] A: Seven or eight. Right, Right. And at that time, there's all sorts of experimentation about what feels good. Right. It wasn't like you were into dogs. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That Saint Bernhard baby. No. Right. It wasn't that at all. Right. And even touching at that time wasn't about being sexual. There was stuff that got exposed, probably when you were younger, but it wasn't about being sexual. Right. On their own, 7 and 8 year olds don't go, oh, yeah, I'm totally horny. They don't. It's just not. If they've had elevated stuff because shit's happened to them in their life, that might be. But it's all experimentation. It's not because, oh, yeah, I'm totally hot. Turned on already. No, it wasn't that at all. But some of it felt good. You've just been feeling bad that you did it. And the reason that you've been feeling bad that you did it is because up here you can conceive of having not done it. And therefore your emotional brain is trying to motivate you, to get you to stop doing it. The timing is just fucked up. Hurry. Stop doing that when you were seven. Quick. That's what it's doing. That's why you're feeling the bad feelings. That's what's happening. Because I'll give you the example. A year ago, this guy's brother had asked him to go on a motorcycle ride, and he didn't go and his brother died. So now he's got a tremendous amount of guilt, shame. He's thinking he's feeling that guilt and shame because he should have gone on the ride with his brother. But what if he's not feeling that guilt and shame because he should have gone on the ride with his brother? What if he's feeling it because intellectually he can conceive of having gone on that ride? And if he had gone on the ride, his brother might still be alive, and that would be a hell of a lot better. So here's the issue. Because logically, he can conceive of having done that emotionally, his brain goes, oh, if you can think it, that means we can do it. So do it. Go on the ride with your brother a year ago. Quick. What are you waiting for? Can he do it? No. That's where the error is. Here's the difference. Our logical brain gets the timeline. Emotional brain works more like an animal's brain. And an animal can only think about doing things that it can actually do. If an animal can't do it, an animal can't think it.
[42:12] B: So how do you explain an elephant?
[42:17] A: I'm not sure what you mean, Kevin. How do you explain an elephant? They're big floppy ears. The Asian ones have smaller ears like.
[42:29] B: Their brains, because they got. They're more like people, right?
[42:34] A: They can't conceive of doing things that they can't do. So here's how it works. An animal. So dogs don't lay around feeling depressed for themselves because they can't climb trees. Oh, I wish I was like a cat and I could climb a tree. I totally get them. Dog will stay at the bottom, barking at the cat, but not like, oh, man, it's not fair. You get to climb trees. Right, Right. Wolves don't go and see a bird flying. Oh, man, if I only had wings, I would totally be after that thing, going after him. Yeah. It's not happening. Porcupines aren't out in the wild trying to build hang gliders to fly, because if they can't do it, they can't think it. An animal can only think about doing something that it can actually do. So the animal brain lives that if we can think it, that means that we can do it. Right. So what's been going on is at an emotional level, because logically, intellectually, you can conceive of having not done that, having not had the dog do that thing. But that thing wasn't sexual. That thing was out of curiosity. And then it felt good. It wasn't like, you know, I'm totally. Well, now I'm into, like, you know, Dobermans. You know, I used to be in St. Bernard's and else Dobermans. It's not that at all. Out of curiosity. And some of it felt good, and it wasn't even sexual. You follow me with that? But see, all of that has been confused with this thing. Makes sense. So as we think about you being free from the impact that that's had, so you no longer have that feeling again. I'm just gonna check. Would that be okay? Yeah, it would be. So then we want to do a short little process, which you're gonna slightly lower your jaw.
[44:24] B: You're not gonna wave your hand in front of me, are you?
[44:27] A: What the hell is that?
[44:29] B: The other one is, like, Washington.
[44:31] A: Oh, wise man. Yeah, I don't get that either. I don't do this like, windshield wiper, wax on, wax off, up, down. No, I'm way more fun than that. I don't even know what. I did that at one time.
[44:45] B: Yeah.
[44:46] A: And then I realized it was not, like, all too useful. And not just not too useful for them, but for me, because I was working with Bosnian refugees who had been in prison camps, and they had horrible shit happening, and they would be, like, reliving the worst moment. I'd be going, watch my hand go back and forth. Yeah, that'll help. And it was so uncomfortable for me. I couldn't imagine what it would be like for them. Holy cow. I don't want to do that. I stopped doing all of that that way. And then we got a whole new way of working with people, because you don't have to do any of that to get it better. Right. See, that's a good pride. So we're on our way. So what you're going to do is you're going to slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, and just breathe a little bit slower and deeper than how you normally breathe. Because as you breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper, you're moving your body into more parasympathetic response, which causes your body to be in more of a state of rest. And if we're going to do accelerated healing, we want to be in states of rest, truly. It's why if somebody gets a cold or the flu or the surgery, we tell them to rest. Right. Knowing that it's okay. Your brain is already organizing towards it. So what we got to do is we want to go through the moment. Right. So that happened maybe six, seven, eight. Right. There's been something you've done after that that was more fun than that. Well, at least more enjoyable in your life. I mean, that might have felt good, but, like something you've done that you feel good about doing. What's that? You know? Yeah, a lot of stuff. Yeah. What's one thing.
[46:20] B: Are you talking about sexual?
[46:21] A: No. Anything in your life that you've done that was more. That was, you know, doesn't have that same feeling about that. Yeah. That you actually feel good about.
[46:28] B: Getting baptized.
[46:29] A: Yeah. Getting baptized. Way better than that. Right. So we got getting baptized. One other thing. Um.
[46:37] B: Having my kids.
[46:38] A: Yeah, having your kids. Right, Right. So we got having your kids back in. Right. They don't have the same feelings. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know anything past that. So you might have been aware when that happened, like in a room, on the couch, in the living room. You might have been in your bedroom. Right. And then you might have been touching and some of it was feeling good.
[46:59] B: Right.
[46:59] A: And then the dog came up and the dog started licking and some of that felt good. And you did that for a period of time and then you stopped. I mean, it's not happening now. I don't see any dog.
[47:10] B: No.
[47:11] A: Right. So it happened for a period of time. Right. And then it stopped.
[47:16] B: Yeah. That time.
[47:17] A: That time. Right. You might have done it more than once. Right. But it stopped that time. Right. And then later on. And then that was over. Right. And then later on, you did something like, oh, you got baptized. You had your kids. Right. Notice there was a little bit of discomfort as we went through it.
[47:30] B: Yeah.
[47:31] A: But not because it was yucky. Not because of the. Because your brain is confusing the memory with it happening. I know it sounds weird, right? But we're gonna go backwards. When we go backwards, it unplugs, it flattens on the neurons. It takes away the charge.
[47:43] B: Okay.
[47:44] A: So we've got, you know, being baptized. We've gotta have the kids. Yeah, Right. Then before that, we've got it stopping and then it happening and then the dog coming over and then you touching and then you doing whatever you're doing before that. Right. And as I run through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[48:01] B: It wasn't bad.
[48:02] A: I know. Isn't that weird? Here's the pattern of association thing. You can remember putting on your pants today, like where you were when you did it.
[48:08] B: Yeah.
[48:08] A: But if I said to you, remember getting dressed and putting your pants on, and said, gabby, stop putting on your pants, you'd look at me and go, I'm not putting on my pants. Because you know, there's a difference between remembering doing it and doing it. Right. Well, remember getting dressed, putting it. Gabby, stop putting on your pants. Say, I am not putting on my pants.
[48:25] B: You say, yeah, I am not putting on.
[48:27] A: Well, stop me from putting on my pants. Say you're not putting on your pants. Say you're not putting on your pants. Well, then you stop putting on your shirt. Say, I am not putting on my shirt.
[48:39] B: I am not putting on my shirt.
[48:40] A: Well, then stop the dog from doing that. Say the dog's not doing that.
[48:43] B: The dog's not doing that.
[48:43] A: Well, then stop that from happening. That's not happening. So then where is it go? It no longer exists. Right. And as you're getting that, what do you notice? Right, Right. See, that's what's happening. Your brain is actually getting some freedom from that. Isn't that weird? Alright, just check it out. Is it feeling as bad now?
[49:04] B: No.
[49:04] A: Alright, isn't that interesting? So when your brain realizes that it no longer exists. Oh, and when it also realizes that there's nothing to be done, because the shame is all about your brain trying to motivate you, to get you to stop doing that when you were seven or eight. Hurry. So I'm gonna say to you, well, stop doing that when you were 7 or 8. And your answer to me is gonna be like, well, there's nothing to be done. And I'm gonna say, no, hurry, stop doing that when you were 7 or 8. Quick. You're gonna go, there's nothing to be done. You'll go, no, stop doing that. You're gonna go, there's nothing to be done. I'm Gonna go. Why? You're gonna go. It no longer exists. So you can remember doing that? Summer. You can remember doing that? Gabby, stop doing that. When you're seven or eight. Quick, say there's nothing to be done.
[49:50] B: There's nothing to be done.
[49:51] A: No. Hurry, Stop doing that. What are you waiting for? Quick, say there's nothing to be done. No. Come on, let's go.
[49:56] B: Stop doing it.
[49:57] A: Quick. Come on. Say there's nothing to be done. Why? Because it no longer exists. Say it no longer exists.
[50:03] B: It no longer exists.
[50:04] A: Bingo. Right. And from here, you know that that happening wasn't about you being into dogs. And it wasn't even a sexual thing. It was about something that was being experimented. That felt good. Right? And as you're getting that, just check. What do you notice happening in the feeling lines? That looks different already. And we didn't even have to do any of that.
[50:31] B: Thank God.
[50:33] A: Right? See, we can actually have a lot more fun getting things to be better for you.
[50:38] B: Cool.
[50:39] A: Yeah. Because notice, check. Try to get that feeling, though.
[50:43] B: No.
[50:44] A: Well, no, you can try.
[50:47] B: Why? You want me to tell you what happened?
[50:49] A: And see, I want you to try to get. You don't have to tell it to me. You can remember.
[50:53] B: I've always. When I tell somebody, I'm always more comfortable about it.
[50:57] A: Well, I know, but you can think about having done it now, having had that happen. Try to feel that or think, you know, like, you know, this guy, God was watching him while it was happening. I mean, because that's what we screw up people with. Santa Claus and God, dude, watching us at all times. Pervert. Right? Santa Claus is kind of like a pervert. Here, a little kid. Sit on my lap. The fuck, man. Stranger game. It's freaking perverted.
[51:31] B: Oh, my God.
[51:34] A: Right? Because check it out now, knowing what you know and that you wasn't doing anything wrong then, she was learning about her own body and what felt good. And it wasn't even a sexual thing. Not at 7 or 8. Right. Got it.
[51:57] B: Mm.
[51:59] A: Right. And as you're getting all of that check, what do you notice happened to Shane?
[52:05] B: I don't really feel anything.
[52:06] A: You don't, do you? Right. Oh, you're becoming more. Okay. Oh, you mean you can actually lighten up on you a little?
[52:13] B: Yeah, a little bit.
[52:15] A: That would be good. So we're on our way and we'll do a whole bunch of other stuff that clears out a lot of other things. So we'll just schedule an appointment to get that part done. And it doesn't take a long time, and I'm way more fun, and I don't do this. Okay. Cause wasn't this more fun than you thought it was gonna be?
[52:35] B: Yeah, I didn't think I was gonna say that part.
[52:38] A: Well, nobody does. Right. But now you don't have any bad feelings about it. And it's not just because you said it. I know you say you feel a little bit better after saying it, but now, like, as you remember it and remember having it done and know everything that you know now, it doesn't have the same feelings.
[52:58] B: Right.
[52:58] A: Right. Because your brain knows that it's data.
[53:01] B: That is weird.
[53:02] A: I know. Isn't that cool? You know, it gets me excited. All right, come with me. We will head on out here.
