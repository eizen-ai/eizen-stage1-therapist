[00:01] A: Cool. So Today, again is the 19th of July, and, Gabby, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. This is recording number two, because we got to get back together today. How exciting. This recording may be made available in teaching and training professionals and how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes. Okay, cool. So first, give me a sense. How did the last little piece leave you? When you think about, you know, what we talked about when we ended, I.
[00:29] B: Actually went out there and I was trying to think about it and it wasn't bothering me.
[00:32] A: I know it's not cool. Awesome. All right, so what we really want to do is a few different things. When you had talked to me earlier today, you had talked about the whole perfectionism thing. You had talked about the either all on or none. We know that there's been a whole bunch of stuff that's happened in life that although it's over, it's still underneath the surface, impacts you. And then you also said, because this is something that impacts you at the house, certain songs, music, kinds of music, what's being said in it triggers yuckiness, even if you're just hearing it in the subtle background. And then if somebody says, no, you need to be doing it this way, that kind of reaction. So you've recognized that that stuff has been problematic. That's what we want to get adjusted. So if you weren't having that intense reaction when somebody might have corrected you, if you no longer had any of the bad feelings about the stuff that you went through, if you were finding yourself a lot more at ease and comfortable in your own skin and a lot lighter and more peaceful, what would that be like for you?
[01:43] B: It would be nice.
[01:45] A: How so?
[01:49] B: I wouldn't be so worried about everybody else. Yeah.
[01:52] A: And if you weren't worried about everybody else, you know, what they might be thinking. Like, how would that be for you? What would that be like? How would you be as a person.
[02:00] B: Knowing that, probably be more successful in life.
[02:05] A: Yeah. Right. Yeah. And how would you be, you know, inside?
[02:10] B: Calmer.
[02:10] A: Calmer, Right. What's it like when you feel calm?
[02:13] B: Nice.
[02:14] A: It is, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. So we want to do more processes that are all about getting your body into st of, as I said earlier, rest, because the mind responds and accelerated healing happens when we rest. But there are two other pieces that I want to illustrate for you that I think will tie into yucky stuff. Right. So one, as I shared with you before, we're not troubled because of how bad it was or what happened, whose fault, or any of that. It's because part of the brain doesn't know that it's over. But there's a second thing that happens when we go through negative experiences and it really impacts us because we were all lied to as children. Did you know that? We're all lied to.
[02:57] B: Mm.
[02:58] A: Parents do it, community does it, society does it. Lies to children, right? Primarily because most in our culture want our children to grow up to be good boys and good girls. So we tell them that if you're a good boy and if you're a good girl, your life will be good and you'll get to live happily ever after. And that lie gets reinforced by the TV shows, by the books, by the stories, by the movies, by the games, by that all stuff engineered for little kids. Tell them that when you're being good, good things happen to you. Mommy loves me. She's happy with me. She praises me, she gives me hugs when I'm being good. Which is great if everything in life is always good. I've never met any ever in my entire life that's had nothing but great things. I think we all have had shit that's happened, some more than others, but we all have healthy stuff. So the problem isn't just that we told kids that life is good and if they're good, their lives will be good. The evil that God installed is the opposite. Bad things only happen when I'm being bad. Mommy yells at me, mommy punish me. Mommy spanks me when I'm being bad. The bad thing happened because I was doing something wrong. Even the little 18 month old who's curious mommy knows that when he's quiet, he's doing something he probably shouldn't be doing. So she's frantically looking for him all around the house. She sees him in the bathroom. She sees he's already got the cabinet underneath the sink open. He's got the can of Comet. And you know where everything goes for a little kid, right? And she sees that happening and she shrinks, no, rushes over there, yanks it out of his hand, maybe give him a swat on his hiney. What is the nervous system of that kid learning.
[04:50] B: That he's being bad?
[04:52] A: Something bad happened to me because I was doing something wrong. Therefore bad things only happen when I'm being bad. Is that true? Do the bad things in life only happen to us when we're being bad? No. But the problem is we learn that. And that's what sticks. It's why it makes it Feel like it's my fault or I should have known better, I shouldn't have put myself in that situation or it kind of gives all of that to us. So we live in this world that teaches us that the bad only happens when we're being bad, right? So nobody's shocked when the 23 year old girl who went out with her girlfriends to the bar because she's celebrating, you know, having just gotten a job. And while she's there, it seemed like one of her girlfriend's friends knew this guy and he seemed to be nice and they were kind of flirty back and forth and he bought her a couple drinks and he seemed to be really nice and said, you know, I'll take you home. And he did. And then he raped her. Nobody's shocked when she blames herself for being stupid and careless in putting herself in that situation. Saying things like I should have known better. Right? Like she had a sign that said hi, Dragon rapeed. No, but because it was bad, it goes back to being my fault. Make sense? So that gets layered in. So not only do we have the bad things happen, it's intensified. Now it's my fault. Oh, and it's my identity. It's about my worth, my loveability, whether I'm good enough, whether I'm smart enough, all get stuck there, right? Four year old's parents get divorced. Now at four, the kid doesn't really get that it's an issue between mom and dad. The kid just knows that dad's no longer in the house. Kids thinking, well there's something wrong. Daddy used to live here, now he doesn't. And all little kids are told that the feelings that everybody has around them are because of you. Did you know that little children are always told that everybody's feelings are because of you? My mom, of all people, my mother tells my two little girls, you make grandma's heart happy. I'm like, mom, cut it out, stop putting pressure on her. Because if they can make your heart happy, they can make it sad that they cause the feelings. Oh, you make me feel so good. Oh I love you so much. Oh I'm so happy. Oh I'm so proud of you. And then the flip. I am so angry. I'm so disappointed in you. You made me feel so upset. Little kids hear it all over and over and over again that they cause feelings. So the 4 year old's parents get divorced, just knows that dad's not there. Four year old starts thinking, not logically, they're not logical. Then, well, daddy doesn't live here. Well, maybe it has something to do with me. Maybe if I was more lovable, or maybe if Daddy really cared, or maybe if I was worth it, Daddy would still be here. Nine, Dad's not in the picture. Calls him up, knows that it's his birthday. He's going to turn 10. Hey, I'm gonna take you to Disney when you turn 10. Kid turns 10, he's waiting. That morning for dad so happened to be Saturday morning. All excited, ready? Daddy's gonna take me to Disney. 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock. One, two, three. Daddy never shows. Now, the kid might know that Dad's got some issues. Oh, no. Be here with me. You started applying shit to you, Gabby, come on, get back here with me. Yeah, hi. We'll get to that thing. We'll get to that. We're doing examples over here that aren't about you on purpose. Okay, See, all we know about that is that we're gonna be all about getting you free. Yeah. Cause what's happening now? What was the thing that was just going on?
[08:59] B: Because it makes me think about my daughter.
[09:01] A: Oh, your daughter?
[09:02] B: Yeah.
[09:02] A: Oh, because you've been feeling bad over not always being present for her.
[09:06] B: Yeah.
[09:07] A: Okay, well, she's not better off with you feeling shitty. Guilt never improves performance. I know that because do you want the guy who's kicking the game winning field goal to be feeling horribly guilty over missing one at halftime? Is that gonna make him do better? No. No. Right. But aren't you doing things right now that are all about getting you to be better? Oh, and isn't that the thing that's gonna be better for her? Right? You know, actually having a healthy mom, don't you think?
[09:44] B: Yes, but it just makes. Cause what has this done to her now? You know?
[09:55] A: How old is she?
[09:56] B: Eleven.
[09:56] A: Eleven? Yeah. The good news is nothing's permanent. You're gonna get that as we clear shit up for you. You really will. I promise. But nothing's permanent. See, the neat thing about human beings is all we are is change. All we are is always changing. So we can make all sorts of changes for the better. Right? Oh, and actually might be good to be able to show, like, you know, there was fucked up shit that's went down in life and actually you can make it better. Hmm. Actually show like, resiliency and strength and courage and, you know, all of those things that are gonna be really good for, you know, a young lady. No. Right? Yeah. Yeah. So dad doesn't show now the kid at nine doesn't go, oh, shit. I know. My dad's a drunken alcoholic. He's probably on a vendor. It's his fault, his loss. He doesn't get to hang out with me at Disney. No kid's gone. If I really mattered, Daddy loved me, he would have been there. So it all goes back to me. 14, he's dating this girl, middle school. You know, middle school girls, they're totally committed all the time. Middle school girls are fickle. The wind blows and they like some other guy, right? But again, she, you know, breaks up with him, starts dating this other guy. He doesn't think, oh well, she just likes the other guy. It's not about me. She had a preference change. It's like, I like vanilla ice cream and I like chocolate. Huh. Must be something wrong with me, because if I was more lovable, then she wouldn't have left. At 19, he's dating another girl. He's grounded. He can't go to the party. She does. She sleeps with his best friend. Again, if I mattered, if I was more lovable. It just reinforces all of these bad messages that it somehow has something to do with my worth and my lovability. And I must not be good enough. So therefore, I'm not worthy of anything good. Great. So now I just settle for the, you know, whoever. And that thing goes on and on and on until we, like, clear stuff up. But see, that active does the third thing. And that is our brain is vigilant and sensitive, scanning for things that are similar to any of the stuff that was painful looking and reacting fast. The reason we react more quickly is because in an animal world, remember that part of our brain is about survival. And the sooner I react to threat in the animal world, the more apt I am to survive it. The rabbit that heard the twig snap and ran. That dude's around the one who heard the twig snap. And is that George or, uh. Oh, it got born out of us. So that's why we react to things. It's why the soldier dies on the ground when the firework goes pop. Not that he doesn't know it's the 4th of July and he's at a fireworks celebration. He lit the damn thing. Emotional brain, confused. Sound that runs us all the time until we get it all clear. So the you that I'm seeing, right, that kind of even just the thing that happened, the you that I am seeing, that stuff's been lifted. Lightning cleared so that she's free from the effect of all that the you that I'm seeing is really solid, rock solid in her recovery, first of all. But, like, solid, like good inside. Like, good with what she's up to and where she's headed, all the powerful changes that she's already making. That's the youth that I'm seeing. She's, like, at peace. There's a lot more lightness and ease. She's a lot lighter on her earlier self. There's even flexibility and freedom to be taking, you know, criticism or somebody telling her that something's not quite right as just feedback. So she goes, oh, I didn't realize that. Okay, I'll just move her over there. There's just that flexibility and flow and how she maneuvers through that stuff. That's the you that I'm seeing. Got it. Yeah. She's free, she's light, she's clear. She's at peace. She's really comfortable in her own skin. Oh, and she's a lot stronger because she's gotten all of the strength from having made it through yucky stuff, because nobody goes through yucky stuff to get stronger. But by making it through it and being on the other side of it, you have to be stronger. Right. There's a reason that somebody who's already made it through war becomes the platoon leader, not the guy who's never gone to. We don't want that guy leading the ship. We want somebody who knows how to navigate through it. Right. We want all of that installed so that you get that strength. Right, Right. So that's how I'm seeing you. If we were to symbolize that deal. Symbols work powerfully. That's why when you see a big yellow arch, you go, oh, that's McDonald's. You see a swoosh mark on somebody's sneaker, That's Nike. What do they have to do with sneakers or cheeseburgers? Not a freaking thing. But they're symbols of the company. We want to get a way to symbolize you at peace and clear and light and free. Really good with what she's up to and where she's headed so that there's, like, that sense of joy, flexibility in how she deals with stuff. That's the you that I'm seeing. Got it. And if we were to symbolize that you. We could use a wild animal. We could use something, you know, up in the sky, a natural formation of the earth, something that grows from the ground. We're going to make it at Catharizamon. Well, what comes to mind?
[15:37] B: Yeah, you want me to say anyone?
[15:39] A: What comes to mind to symbolize you. Yeah. Free, light. Clear. An eagle. An eagle. Ah. And as you see the eagle, is it moving or still? It's moving and soaring or flapping.
[15:55] B: Soaring.
[15:55] A: Yeah. So we got. Soaring eagle's a powerful symbol. Your mind selected it. See, I can give you symbols like advertisers do, and your mind will respond. But, see, the unconscious parts know what it will respond to for you. Selecting the perfect symbol, like the lock, produces the perfect key to open it. So now what we want to do is add a component. You're going to put both feet on the floor. You're going to look up with your eyes, not with your head. You're going to think soaring eagle and take a slow breath in. So look up. Think soaring eagle. Slow breath in. I know. Way too many freaking. All right, so we'll start over. Look up. Think soaring eagle. Oh, so fun, right? So look up and out. Think soaring eagle. Take a deep breath in. You already did it. I know. You're like. You're fast.
[16:50] B: No, I didn't.
[16:50] A: Breathe. We'll try it one more time. I'll slow it down. See, I used to, in the other office, have a tiny little tack that I could direct people to, but I don't have that here yet. But you're gonna just simply, like, look up, you're gonna think eagle and take a slow breath. That was it. That's the first part. You did it. Second part is gonna be the exact same thing. The. This time, though, after inhaling, when you exhale, you'll close your eyes. So look up and out. Think eagle. Deep breath in. And then exhale and close your eyes. Good. You can open your eyes. Same thing as that. This time, though, when they close, they're gonna remain closed for a few moments. You're gonna bring awareness in towards your breath. So look up and out. Think eagle. Deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Nice. Good. Now, with your eyes closed, bring awareness in towards your breath. Just notice your breathing so that as you are, you can cause it to happen in a way that's a little bit slower and slightly deeper than how you automatically breathe. That's right. Take another deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. Those short moments, what did you begin to notice within yourself?
[18:23] B: Calm.
[18:24] A: Yeah. Feeling more calm again. Accelerating the healing. One more time. Think soaring eagle. Deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Good. Keeping eyes closed. Noticing your breath that as you're causing it to happen, it's happening differently than how it automatically happens. Therefore, you're Altering your state of consciousness. Beginning to fuel the transformation. That's right. It's already happening. That's right. We just can't help but laugh.
[18:57] B: Yeah, that's right.
[18:59] A: Because we want to have a really good time. Right? So one more time, think eagle. Another deep breath.
[19:09] B: I'm gonna tell you a story.
[19:10] A: Oh, good. Tell me a story.
[19:11] B: I went to one of these. Oh, my God. What is it?
[19:17] A: It's a little worm. Apparently, we keep getting these little worms.
[19:22] B: So I went to this AA meeting, and it was like a meditation worm.
[19:27] A: Oh, boy. Geez.
[19:28] B: So I'm.
[19:29] A: That's hard.
[19:31] B: I can't remember if it probably was talking or if it was video, but it's going down behind your belly button and, like, calming or whatever. And I just couldn't control myself. I was laughing. I had to leave. I was so embarrassed.
[19:47] A: Yeah, well, I mean, they kind of direct that in such a way to make you laugh.
[19:52] B: Everybody was pretty serious.
[19:56] A: That's the problem, is that people take it too serious. Right. And this stuff that we're doing today is far too serious to not have a lot of fun. Right. So, I mean, we can only be serious to the extent that you're having fun. Then you get to have some serious fun. That's right. So I want you to think of this. Think of the time when you are outside in nature and you see something that's beautiful. What is it that you see?
[20:24] B: It's actually a tree house.
[20:25] A: Yeah. And isn't there a moment that, as you're seeing the tree house, that you're experiencing, like, a sense of excitement and peace all at the same time? And people would say, yeah, Gabby, it's the tree house that gives you the feelings. But if we looked at it from a different lens, we could say that the seeing of it, the being there, just drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because at your center, whether you realize it or not, you're always peaceful and excited. In the same way, if I'm at the campfire and I take my hands and I move it down toward the flames, and I say, oh, boy, this fire is getting hotter, Is it really that the fire is getting hotter? No, I'm becoming way more aware of the heat. So we know that there's been so many times in your life where awareness has been anywhere but at your center. The stressors, the upsets, the angst, the pains, the guilt, all of that stuff. But the cool thing is, no matter where awareness has been always at your center. You're peaceful and excited in the same Way you can know the two of us are in this room because your senses bring in the data. Your intellect organizes it. That's knowledge. People think of knowledge as light. So we'll call it light of knowledge. We could also say that at your center, it's a brighter light. Light of wisdom. So we've got knowledge and wisdom. And I remember working with all sorts of different people, but one gal comes in to mind. She had a lot of different stuff. Some drug stuff, some yucky stuff that happened, some things that happen with family members and stuff that happened later in life. But one of the things that really bothered her is when she was five, older brother, Matchbox cards up her leg. So she had a lot of. About all of that. But as we worked together, gone, like, oh, go on. And so she was sitting across me. She was present. She was feeling great. And I go, okay, you know all that. I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone. I don't feel it. I go, I know. Isn't that cool? She goes, yeah. I go, but the question was, where was it? And we started thinking, was it at the surface level, you know, up here? She's like, no, it wasn't an intellectual thing. Oh, well, maybe it was at your center. And she's like, dude, serious. How could it survive in the light? Or I'm peaceful and excited. So I asked her again. I go, where was it? And she said to me, she goes, oh, it was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I said, well, what happened? She goes, there's no touching. I said, cool. And so you know that, you know, you have a body, and your body is 100% and totally yours. But did you know that your body isn't you? I mean, I know that because my mom, when she was 17, worked at an ice cream stand that sold snow cones. It got stuck the ice, so she turned it off, jammed her finger in, and the blade, the tip, gone. That part's gone. So when she goes over to people's houses, they don't say to her, hey, I'm glad almost all of you could come over. So we know that we're not our bodies, that you have a body. It's totally yours, but it isn't actually you. And we also know that there's not a single cell within your body today that's the same as it was, that they all been replaced millions of times. Your feet alone are longer than they were when you were two. Yet despite those kinds of changes, you're you second thing. That's weird, you know, that you think thoughts, but that you are not the thinker of your thoughts. What if you're not your thoughts? What if you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? What if your brain is the thinker of your thoughts and you are not your brain? Your brain is simply an organ, like your heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, and it does what it does, but it's not actually you. So we could say that you have thoughts that yours, but your thoughts aren't you. Then we go, wait. Maybe you're your feelings, but you feel different ways at different times. What? Yes, we think of that as something we have. My soul. Right. What if we don't think of it as something we have? When I was a little kid, my mom told me a prayer. I thought it was a horrible thing she did. Why not telling me this prayer. But we had to say it every night. And I don't know why she said it at night, because it was scary. This is the prayer. You may have heard it. Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. And then she would kiss me on the forehead. She'd walk towards the door, turn the light off, say, goodnight, sweetie, I love you. And shut the door. And now I'm lying in my bed, dark, thinking about my death. Why is she telling me this now? Horrible nightmares of two large hands breaking through my window, ripping open my dead body, grabbing it from me. When I got older, I started to think of. Instead of it being something I have, let's think of my fingers and toes as things I have. Let's think of the light soul light at the center. Peace and excitement. That light as you. Because you have thoughts, you have feelings, you're you. Even though you feel different ways at different times. So you're not feelings. There's things you do and stuff you've done. But when you stopped doing one thing and did something else, you didn't stop existing. Because you can't be what you do then. And you're not your feelings and you're not your thoughts and you're not your body. And that's what leads us to the weird question. What are you? Instead of thinking of it as something you have, let's think of the light at the center as you. And you know what the coolest part about light is? You can't be touched or hurt or harmed, only experiences. The love that allows in is totally whole and complete, indestructible. And I say that because people screw up identity all the time. They tell me things like they're anxious, they're depressed, they're shy, thinking that the way that they feel is who they are. But you know, if I go to the dentist like I did yesterday, and I say to you, you'll never believe what he did. Why? Well, first he put me in a chair. Yeah. Then my head goes down, feet come up, it's really uncomfortable. Then he shines this light in my eyes. I'm blinded. Then he takes a cold instrument, shoves it right up inside of me. And you go inside your what? And I go, gabby, I'm at the dentist. My mouth. Which is the same thing that I said to that woman with her brother in the matchbox cars. You know, when you were really little, you messed with your stuff. Well, that's when she said to me, yeah, he did. And it hurt my feelings and it screwed up my thinking for a while. But then she started to smile. She goes, you know what, though? He never touched me. He messed with my body. It hurt my feelings, screwed up my thoughts, but he never got me. He never touched me. I said, whoa, that's pretty powerful. So you want to see something that's weird? You ready for something weird now? Not that this hasn't already been. I'm going to show you something. So take your arm on the pillow, take that hand, hold it up like this. Press your elbow right there. Look at that spot on your hand. As you're looking at that spot on your hand, don't do anything on purpose to move it. Notice that you can see the space around your hand. And then I'm going to take my hand from over here. And with your peripheral vision, you can see my hand moving in. But see, what's really interesting is as my hand moves in, before my hand ever ties touches your hand, you'll notice something. That's right, you can feel it. Isn't that weird?
[28:24] B: Mm.
[28:25] A: That my hand feels very different here than there. And you can see my point, that with it here, you feel it. Isn't that interesting? Alright. And as you're feeling it, don't do anything at all on purpose to move the fingers of that hand, just begin to become aware of small little vibrations as the fingers on their own begin to slowly separate. I'm not sure whether you'll notice. That's right. A little twitch or a wiggle or a jump or a jerk.
[29:05] B: Are you talking about my fingers?
[29:09] A: I know you weren't sure, were you? That's right. That's so good. But just check right now, how's your body feeling?
[29:17] B: Fine.
[29:18] A: It is, isn't it? Your body's feeling fine. Right. And see, we're all about organizing towards you being free. And because we're going to where we're headed and your unconscious knows what to do, it also knows which experiences would be useful to clear. That's right. To get you to be even more free. Right. And so as you're thinking about that soaring eagle, your unconscious is going to travel back through your timeline of things that have happened that sucked. It's going to begin to categorize and sort them, chunk them into different content, and then it's going to bring a particular moment to mind to clear. Right. More comes to mind.
[30:02] B: Um, so you got one? Yeah.
[30:08] A: Good. Happened about how long ago?
[30:10] B: A few months ago.
[30:11] A: A few months ago. Okay, so the feeling tones that come up about it are feelings of what?
[30:16] B: Scared.
[30:18] A: Scared?
[30:19] B: Yeah, I could feel it in my chest.
[30:21] A: Oh, good. Well, notice where you are.
[30:23] B: Yeah.
[30:23] A: Now not there here. Now not then here. Right? That's right. As you're noticing that, what you notice happening to the feelings as you're realizing you're here, not there. Aren't you? Here now, not there then. That's right. And see, that's what we want is you to be here now. Right. Because there's something that you back then didn't know that you know. Do you know what the you didn't know back then that you know now that you're okay here, aren't you?
[31:02] B: Yes, you are.
[31:05] A: So we actually have some good news to get in, don't we? I mean, is there anything scary about being here now with me? So what's happening now? You're so good.
[31:25] B: Yeah.
[31:30] A: Yeah. Oh, you're getting back here now. All right. There we go. Right? And we like it way better when you're here. That's right. See, here's the coolest part about all of the stuff that we're doing. Your job is to intend to be here with me. My job? Keep you here. Notice how I noticed that you were going somewhere else and I stopped because what am I supposed to do? Get you back here with me. Why? Because I'm way more fun than Sepki stuff. Right. So would it be okay for you to be free from the effect that that's had?
[32:07] B: Yes.
[32:08] A: Right. So we got good news to get in. And what's something that happened after that that was more fun than that? Oh, you got baptized. That happened after that, didn't it? Right. What's something else?
[32:19] B: I had More I didn't have my.
[32:21] A: Kids.
[32:25] B: Coming to Salem.
[32:26] A: Yeah, you got into Salem. That was better than that.
[32:29] B: Yeah.
[32:30] A: Don't you think? You left jail. Yeah, that was a better thing than that. Right?
[32:35] B: Mm.
[32:36] A: Good. So we got really good news to get in. That part of you back then doesn't know yet. See, the reason that there was that feeling is that there's a part of you that doesn't know about being at Selah, that doesn't know about, you know, being baptized, that doesn't know about getting out of jail. So we've actually got really good news, don't you think?
[33:02] B: Yeah.
[33:03] A: I mean, check it out. As that's going on, and she was scared if she knew that, you know.
[33:08] B: She got out of jail.
[33:09] A: She said, salah, she got baptized. How much better she is knowing that that stopped and it's no longer happening. She hasn't gotten that news yet like you do. You know it. I mean, you're sitting here with me, but the earlier you doesn't know that yet. Right. Right. So we're on our way to getting it clear. Right then. What's happening now?
[33:33] B: I'm still a little tense.
[33:34] A: You are? Yes. Okay. About that.
[33:39] B: Yes.
[33:39] A: Oh, so what about it's troubling for you now?
[33:49] B: Nothing.
[33:50] A: Oh. Sitting here.
[33:53] B: Just the thought of it.
[33:54] A: Oh, the thought of it. We'll move the thought way over there. Right. If we took the thought and we just went put it way over there, we kind of shrunk it so that we could see what happened way over there back then. But really small. Like, if we kind of made it as small as the screen. Right. It's like that small. Got it way over there. That small. That's what happened back then. And you're sitting here with me now, which is way more enjoyable than what went down back then. That's right. And see, all we want to do is get in the good news that what happened back then stopped. Oh. And that you made it through it, and that that experience no longer exists, which is the thing that we want to get in, don't we? That that moment's over. Right. But see, there's an aspect of your brain that doesn't know all the really good news that you have from here. Right. So that thing happened a few months ago. You're where what happened?
[35:00] B: So you're in Tampa.
[35:04] A: No, you're in Ocala. You're in Ocala. Good. In the forest.
[35:08] B: No.
[35:09] A: Oh, darn it.
[35:10] B: Darn it.
[35:11] A: Ocala forest. Isn't that like a big thing up there?
[35:14] B: Yeah, not really? Anyway.
[35:17] A: All right, so you're in Ocala. Good. It's daytime or nighttime?
[35:20] B: It's daytime.
[35:21] A: Daytime. And you're wearing Ocala in a hotel room? You're in a hotel room. Good. Right. And you're, like, in a chair? On the floor? On the bed.
[35:28] B: On a bed.
[35:29] A: You're on a bed. Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[35:31] B: I got shot.
[35:32] A: And then you got shot where?
[35:34] B: In the chest.
[35:35] A: And that fucking hurt. And you went, fuck. Then what happened next? There was blood.
[35:50] B: I didn't even realize.
[35:52] A: No, you didn't even realize it?
[35:53] B: Yeah.
[35:53] A: Kind of hurt a little bit. No, it didn't hurt at all?
[35:56] B: No, man.
[35:57] A: See, you're tough. And then what happened next?
[36:03] B: I was scared.
[36:04] A: Well, right. And then what happened?
[36:12] B: You want me to tell you everything that happened?
[36:14] A: Well, then what happened?
[36:15] B: Well, I told the guy that he needed to call the cops.
[36:19] A: Right. So he said, hey, you need to call the police.
[36:21] B: Yeah.
[36:22] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[36:24] B: He gets rid of the gun.
[36:26] A: Right. Good. And then what happened?
[36:27] B: I started shooting up.
[36:29] A: Right. Cause that would have felt better than he does. Good. What happened next?
[36:34] B: Um, I laid back on the bed.
[36:37] A: Yeah. Good job. Right. Then what happened?
[36:40] B: He came in.
[36:41] A: Yes. Good. Then what happened?
[36:42] B: Another guy came in.
[36:43] A: Good. Right. Then what happened next?
[36:46] B: I told him that he was already called, the ambulance was on the way.
[36:50] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. Then what happened? You told the other guy that the amulet was on the way.
[36:56] B: Yeah.
[36:56] A: Right. Good. Then what happened? Cause that guy was saying, hey, get rid of her.
[37:00] B: Yeah.
[37:01] A: Right. And then what happened?
[37:07] B: So the main lance came.
[37:09] A: Right. And they went up to the room.
[37:13] B: Yeah, they came to the room.
[37:14] A: They did, didn't they? That was better.
[37:16] B: Yeah.
[37:17] A: And then what happened? They put you on one of those stretcher things, and they carried you back to the ambulance, and then you were driven to the hospital.
[37:24] B: Yeah.
[37:24] A: Right. And then they did whatever they did.
[37:26] B: Yeah.
[37:27] A: Right. And then eventually, you left the hospital. Right. And then that particular time was over.
[37:34] B: Yes.
[37:34] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[37:37] B: Yes.
[37:38] A: Like get baptized.
[37:39] B: Yes.
[37:41] A: Good. So notice how there is discomfort.
[37:44] B: Yes.
[37:44] A: Again, not because that sucked, because it did. I'm not gonna lie. But see, we want to get it unplugged, right? Yeah. Because we are all about you being free. Oh. Can you imagine how, like, resilient and smart you are? I don't know whether you realize that yet, but you will get it in a moment. Right. So we got getting into Sala, and, you know, we've got getting out of jail.
[38:13] B: Yeah.
[38:14] A: Right. Then we Got getting out of the hospital, and then we have being in the hospital and then getting to the hospital.
[38:20] B: Are you going backwards?
[38:21] A: And then being in the ambulance and then getting taken to the ambulance and then being locked down on the thing and then being in the hotel room and then you telling him, yeah, somebody's already coming, and then him probably saying, we got to do something about her, and then them coming back in the room, and then you laying down on the bed and then you shooting up, and then you. Him getting rid of the gun and you saying, you need to call the ambulance and then he's getting hit. And then before that, there was whatever it was going on. Then before that, you'd gone in the hotel room and then somehow you got an oakala. Right. You run through it backwards. Compared to emotionally, how was it? Oh, now we're starting to breathe. Bye. Right, what's happening now?
[39:07] B: I'm just noticing how sweaty my hands are.
[39:09] A: Well, right. Didn't we just go through a really yucky thing?
[39:12] B: Yeah.
[39:12] A: Yeah. Right. But how's your body feeling right now? There's a good breath. Hi.
[39:21] B: Yeah, hi.
[39:22] A: It's starting to come back here right now. Right, because you can remember that happening. You remember it happening. The thing, the guy coming. You can remember all that happening. Going to the hospital, going to remember all that happening. You can remember putting your pants on today. Gabby. Stop putting on your pants. Zayn. I am not putting on my pants. Stop me from putting on my pants. Sid. You're not putting on your pants. Stop putting on that bracelet.
[39:49] B: I'm not putting on my bracelet. I'm not putting on the bracelet.
[39:53] A: Well, then stop getting hit by the bullets.
[39:55] B: I'm not getting hit by the bullet.
[39:59] A: Well, stop that from happening. See, that's not happening.
[40:01] B: It's not happening.
[40:02] A: So then where is no longer exists? See, there's no place called the past that it's in. It's not like a container called the past that stuff is existing in. It actually no longer exists. Do you have a memory of it?
[40:19] B: Yeah.
[40:20] A: Yeah, but is the memory the same thing as the experience?
[40:23] B: No.
[40:23] A: No. That's what's starting to happen. Your brain is starting to get the memory isn't the experience, that is data. Right. And how wise do you think you have to be to be so resourceful that even in a drug state and having been shot, you go, yeah, no, people are already on their way. Hello. They can't do anything. People are on their way. Right. Hello. Just check that out for a moment. Right, there we go. As we were to Think about that. You. That. Is that wise in that moment to be able to say that hello? I mean, come on, with all that shit going on for her, then, my goodness, how wise is she? Right? Well. And that's the thing that actually kept you alive. Right? Right, Right. Yeah. You might want to actually start feeling really good about how wise you actually are and resourceful. That in that moment, with all that stuff going on the way it was, that's what you did. Right.
[41:47] B: Is that better?
[41:48] A: I don't care about it. Right.
[41:52] B: Different perspective.
[41:53] A: We already hadn't been thinking of it in that way, but if we really look at it more clearly, this girl's in the distress that she's in with what happened, she's resourceful enough to get the guy, convince him, first of all, to call. You just shot me a ninacal. Okay? He goes, get rid of the thing. Another guy comes back who's saying, we need to take care of her, get rid of her. You can't do that, Tara. Len. Oh, all right. I mean, who does that? That's amazing. That's unbelievably amazing. Right? I mean, you might want to actually feel really good about that. Right? That that's how resourceful you are. That that's what came to mind to do. Right. In the midst of, like, that. That's remarkable. Amazing. Unbelievable, right? So when you think about that moment now, what do you notice? Oh, by the way, I want you to check this out. In a moment, you're going to close your eyes. You're going to picture that earlier. You, in the midst of all of that, you're going to let her know that she's okay. You're going to let her know about liking or accepting God, Jesus being baptized. You're gonna let her know. Yeah, but this is gonna be a different reason for crying. This is. Okay. You're gonna let her know that she's okay, and you're gonna let her know how much you appreciate how wise she is, that in the midst of all of that, she was able to do what she did. Right. Because you wouldn't want to feel really, really good about that. Right. So you just want to let her know that she's okay, that she made it. Right? Right. Letting that earlier, you know, back then she was in the midst of, like, doing what she was doing to stay alive. Let her know that it's over, finished, completed, that that experience no longer exists. You're gonna let her know how she's breathing now, sitting here on the couch with me. You're gonna let her know about getting out of jail, about accepting being baptized. You're about getting into Salem. You're going to let her know how much she's already done to drastically change her life for the better. Right? That's right. Right. Oh, and you didn't realize this? I'm not sure whether you realized it at the time that by, you know, shooting up, it kind of lowered blood pressure that aided in like, you know, keeping you alive at that time because you weren't doing a spike. That wasn't what was being shot up. Right, right, right. Yeah. What's happening now? What'd you notice happened to the earlier you realizing, you know, that you're okay? You're sitting here now. Oh, that was a good breath too. That's right. What do you notice? And her getting how wise and brave.
[45:57] B: Makes me feel stronger.
[45:59] A: Yeah. Right. And what do you notice happen in that earlier you's face? Knowing that she's okay when she learns that she's okay from the woman who knows, she smiles. She does, doesn't she? That's right. And that you can be so appreciative of what she was able to do in the midst of one of the most distressing things that somebody can be going through. Right? That's right. Then check. How'd your body get. No.
[46:40] B: Calm.
[46:41] A: Yeah. It's feeling more calm. What do you notice happen to feeling scared?
[46:47] B: I don't.
[46:48] A: You don't, do you? No. This is another good news thing. Yeah, Right. Things are starting to lighten up. That's right. Yeah. There we go. Isn't that awesome? That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Because we're getting free from the effect that that's had.
[47:25] B: There we go.
[47:29] A: That's right. And what are you noticing now?
[47:41] B: I actually thought of another.
[47:43] A: Right. Because your brain's like shit. If you can get that, do another.
[47:48] B: Let's do another.
[47:52] A: I know another one. Yay. Right. That one happened when?
[48:00] B: A couple weeks before this.
[48:01] A: A couple weeks before that. Right.

[50:44] B: And he's like. I don't know if he's the one who called the cops.
[50:52] A: Yes.
[50:54] B: But he's, like, freaking out.
[50:56] A: Yeah. Right.
[50:56] B: He doesn't want the cops in there. He's a drug addict, too.
[50:59] A: He's got his son. Yeah. Good job, good detail. Right.
[51:02] B: So he lets me take a shower.
[51:05] A: Yes.
[51:05] B: He gives me clothes.
[51:06] A: Yes. Good job, Good detail. Which was Better sleep there. Yeah. Good job. Good detail.
[51:11] B: So when I wake up to his sister coming in and he's not there and it's her room.
[51:16] A: Good job, Good detail. Right.
[51:17] B: It was very embarrassing. So now I'm having to leave.
[51:21] A: Right. So then you left.
[51:22] B: I have nowhere to go. I have no shoes on.
[51:24] A: Right.
[51:25] B: It's daylight now.
[51:26] A: Yes.
[51:26] B: The lady that owns the place is knocking on doors.
[51:29] A: Good job, good detail.
[51:31] B: So I'm worried she's gonna knock on his door.
[51:33] A: Right. Good job.
[51:35] B: And she knows that he beats me and stuff.
[51:40] A: Yes.
[51:42] B: So she just let me, like, hide till somebody came that I knew to pick me up.
[51:49] A: Right. And then somebody came and. Gotcha. And then that moment ended.
[51:53] B: Yeah.
[51:53] A: And then later on, you did something, you know, or fine, like get out of jail.
[51:58] B: Yeah.
[51:59] A: Right. And, you know, be baptized. Yeah. If I can get in the Salem. Right?
[52:04] B: That's right.
[52:04] A: So we got getting in the Salem, being baptized. We've got, you know, getting out of jail. And then you're with that person. And then she had let you wait, and then you had seen her, and then you left that room, and then the sister came home, and then you had woken up, and then you had gone to sleep, and then you'd gotten the clothes on, and then you'd taken the shower, and then the guys, like, panicked. And then he had let you in, and then you ran it back across, and then you were across, and then you're back, and then you left the police, and then you said your sister's name, and it was over there. And then you'd gone over towards the police, and then he was out, and then you had ran out, and then he stopped, and then he told you not to say anything. And then he had been hitting you with the gun, and then he had dragged you in the room, and then he was hitting you multiple times, and the body, face, and then he'd grab you by the hair, and then he had come out of the room, and then you'd come out of the room. And then before that, you were doing something else. We go through it backwards compared to forward. Again, emotionally, how was it?
[53:04] B: Not so bad.
[53:05] A: Right? Because your brain is getting that. It's data. Right? Right. So you can remember him doing that, Grabbing you, hitting you, gun, the whole thing. You remember all that happened. Please come in. Do you know why that happens, by the way? Think of it this way. Animal in the midst of threat has a tendency to empty bladder and bowels. Why? A full balloon is easier to pop than a deflated balloon. Seriously. So you pick Up a rabbit and the rabbit's scared. What does it do? Pops out a turd. Right, because it. I'm telling you, a deflated is safer than an inflated. Right? So that's what happens. Happens in the animal world all the time. Right? So you can remember doing that. You can remember hitting. You can remember pulling your hand. You can remember putting your shirt on. Today, Gabby stopped putting on your shirt. I'm not putting on my shirt. You stop putting on your sandals.
[54:19] B: I'm not putting on my sandals.
[54:20] A: Well, stop me from putting on my sneakers.
[54:22] B: You're not putting on your sneakers.
[54:23] A: Well, then you stop him from hitting you.
[54:25] B: He's not hitting me.
[54:26] A: Well, then stop me from putting on my watch. Stop him from pulling you by your hair.
[54:31] B: He's not pulling me by your hair.
[54:32] A: Well, then stop that from happening.
[54:34] B: It's not happening.
[54:35] A: Yes. So then where is it? Kuwait. No longer exists. It no longer exists.
[54:40] B: It no longer exists.
[54:41] A: Right. Which is what we want to get in, right? And just think, like, you know how resilient you are, right? To be able to make it through that. You're, like, expert. You can like Pac Man, Ghost, get Knee Man. Oh, over that way. I'll come back. That's my hail. That way. I'll come in here. That's triple right, Right, Right. So again, all that happening. By the way, did that have anything to do with you? Oh, see, this is where we're stuck again. Goodness, I thought I brought that up. See, because you've been thinking it did have something to do with me. Yeah. What if it didn't have anything to do with you at all? See, would it have mattered whether it was you or any other gal at that time doing that kind of stuff with that kind of guy? Isn't that how he would have been? I mean, think about it in a different way. Kids walking in the cafeteria. He's 13, got a tray filled with food. He just happens to trip. You know those invisible things that kind of run in front of us sometimes when we trip? One of those things got him. Tripsy falls. He falls on the ground. The trace splatters, shit is all over the place. Right? Cafeteria, which was once loud, goes completely silent. Everybody turns. They all look, they all see that he fell, and they all start laughing.
[56:15] B: Ha.
[56:15] A: Loser.
[56:16] B: Idiot.
[56:17] A: They're all making fun, right? Picking at the guy. The kid wants Harry Potter's invisibility clothes. Put it on, get the hell out of here. Right. He's feeling. They're all laughing at me. But would it have mattered whether it was that Kid or any other kid in the school having that accident. Isn't that what the kids would do? Had everything to do with what was going on. Wasn't about the kid. Kid comes home with two Ds and two Fs on his report card. Mom looks at wait until your father comes home. Dad comes home. Dad was expecting to get lucky. Mom's pissed, Dad's not pissed. Sees the grades really even more mad. Takes the belt off. Beating the kid with the belt all over. Not just the part with the leather part, but the buckle just whacking him. Kid's feeling like I'm getting hit because I got the four grains. But is he? No. See, isn't there like a thousand different ways a dad could handle that situation other than hitting him with the belt? So did it have to do with the kid or his grades? Or did it have to do with what was going on with dad? It had to do with what was going on with dad. See, what's been going on with this thing is that earlier you've been thinking that it had something to do with you. You cuz as we're looking at it from where we're sitting now, did it have anything to do with you? No, no. Had a lot to do with what the hell was going on with him. Right. You were just trying to navigate. Oh, and there was fucked up stuff cuz drugs were involved too and other things probably weren't involved as well. Right. There was all sorts of shit that was happening. Right, right. But you didn't like go into it ahead of time. Signing up, hey, you know what would be really cool? I'm gonna sign up to hang out with this guy that fucking hits me, makes me do all this shit and then shoots me. That'd be fucking cool. I mean, pick me, pick me, pick me. None of that was happening, was it? You didn't have any of those thoughts going into it? No, no. That you didn't know any of that. Right. So that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with stuff being off with him. Right, right. Which we want to get in. Now you're getting it right? There we go. So I want you to repeat these four words after me. Here we go. It's. It's not about. About me. It's not. It's not about me. It's not about me. Right? Now close your eyes. Picture that you back then after it's over, let her know that it's over, finished, completed. That it no longer exists. That him being that way had nothing to do with you and everything to do with stuff. Being off with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it right. Then let her know about all the positive changes you've already made. Right. On your way to being a lot lighter, a little bit more peaceful and clear. Right? Yeah. And what's happening now?
[59:38] B: The next dog.
[59:39] A: Not that.
[59:40] B: Not that. That was just weird.
[59:48] A: Isn't this thing way different than that?
[59:50] B: Yes.
[59:51] A: Yeah.
[59:52] B: This is way better.
[60:03] A: People forget that. The only purpose is just they, you know, have the intention of being with me. I don't have to try really hard to be more fun than really sucky stuff. I can do it. So the next one came to mind. Good. This one happened when?
[60:20] B: Few days before.
[60:22] A: Days before that one. Good. And then, you know what's the thing that happened?
[60:28] B: Walking.
[60:29] A: You're at that hotel.
[60:31] B: Damn that place.
[60:34] A: We are not going to that hotel. All right. So you're outside walking. Yes. Right. It's daytime or nighttime?
[60:44] B: Nighttime.
[60:45] A: And you're by the hotel?
[60:46] B: I'm at the hotel.
[60:47] A: You're at the hotel. Just walking on the outside of the hotel.
[60:49] B: Walking across the parking lot. Walking across side of the hotel.
[60:54] A: Got it. Good. And then what happened next?
[60:56] B: I go in this room.
[60:57] A: Good job.
[60:58] B: And I am. I am buying drugs.
[61:09] A: Right. So you're going in the room, you're getting some stuff.
[61:11] B: Right?
[61:11] A: Right.
[61:12] B: The guy wants more money.
[61:13] A: He does. Right.
[61:14] B: He thinks I have money.
[61:15] A: Right. Good job. Right? Yeah.
[61:16] B: There's two other women in there.
[61:18] A: Yes.
[61:19] B: So he tells me to take off my clothes.
[61:20] A: Good job, Good detail.
[61:22] B: And I'm like, are you serious?
[61:23] A: Right. But of course he has his stuff. So it's like, fuck.
[61:27] B: Yeah.
[61:28] A: Right. Good.
[61:28] B: And I'm not taking my.
[61:29] A: No, of course not. Right. Then what happened?
[61:31] B: And he jumps up and he grabbed me by the throat.
[61:35] A: Good job. Good detail. Right.
[61:37] B: And then what happened? Choking the shit out of me.
[61:40] A: Right. Good. That hurt.
[61:42] B: Yes.
[61:42] A: Right. So check it out. Right. Now your throat. Just check. Check it out. Right. It's okay. That's right. There we go. Right. So he had his arms around your throat. And then what happened next?
[61:58] B: He's yelling at me.
[62:00] A: All right, good. Then what happened?
[62:02] B: Then he lets me go.
[62:03] A: Yes. And then what happened?
[62:04] B: I take my clothes off.
[62:05] A: Good job. Right. And then what happened?
[62:06] B: He gives me drugs.
[62:07] A: Right. Because he saw that he didn't have any extra money.
[62:09] B: Yeah.
[62:10] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[62:11] B: He tells you to come back to the room.
[62:13] A: Then you put your clothes back on. Yeah. Right. And then he said, don't come back to the room.
[62:18] B: Looking like that?
[62:20] A: Looking like that.
[62:21] B: Like in a T shirt and sweatpants.
[62:24] A: Oh, you should be dressed up, like, in a suit.
[62:27] B: Like, better.
[62:30] A: Oh, you should definitely be in a suit or a jumper. Heels.
[62:38] B: Like I'd be.
[62:39] A: Yes, definitely in heels.
[62:41] B: Like, looking better.
[62:42] A: Oh, okay. Makeup on. Right. To come over to get drugs.
[62:46] B: Yes.
[62:46] A: Because you definitely need to look good to have them. So I said, don't you dare come looking like that again. Okay, cool. And then you left. I didn't realize that there was a look I had to have before I walked into the. Wasn't going for an interview. Why should you check? Right. Then that particular time ended.
[63:20] B: Yes.
[63:21] A: Right. And then later on, you've done lots of things that are way better. Right. Right. Good. By the way, as you were recalling it, did you notice the same kind of feeling or was it already last?
[63:34] B: It was last.
[63:35] A: It was, wasn't it? You can remember him doing that?
[63:38] B: Yeah.
[63:38] A: Right. You can remember, like, washing your hair, like, earlier today or last night. Gabby, stop washing your hair.
[63:46] B: I'm not washing my hair.
[63:47] A: Well, stop him from putting his arms around your toe. Well, then you stop putting in your pants. Well, then stop me from eating dinosaurs.
[63:55] B: You're not eating dinosaurs.
[63:57] A: Stop that from happening. It's not happening. Where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[64:01] B: It no longer exists. Right.
[64:03] A: And again, him doing that, did that have anything to do with you?
[64:06] B: No.
[64:08] A: Had to do a lot with stuff being off with him. That's right. All right, so again, close your eyes. Picture that earlier. You let her know that that's over, finished, completed, that it no longer exists. Let her know that she's okay. Let her know that that happening and everything to do with stuff being off with him so that she gets it. Then let her know, you know, about being baptized meant, say, let all of the powerful things that she's already doing to drastically improve her life. That's right. Oh, right. Because you're already beginning to see yourself as more than just that. There's a lot more to you than that, isn't there? Yeah. Oh, and that you get to be worth it to you, that is. Oh, you're really beginning to feel like you're worth it to you. Right. Another good news thing. That's right. Right. And then you'll start to get that you're good enough for you. Because how can you not be good enough when you're being who you really are? I mean, what's not good enough about you when you're being you? What's happening now?
[65:32] B: I'm calm.
[65:33] A: You are, aren't you? And you can remember those things.
[65:39] B: And.
[65:39] A: It'S not doing anything. Right. Let's check how resilient she is. Right, Right. What kind of skill set does that take to be able to tell the guy you need to really call the animal? Oh, no, he already did. Right, Right. And that was the catalyst to get you out of there. Oh. And alive out of there. But you are now, aren't you?
[66:30] B: Yep.
[66:31] A: Right. Oh, see, there's a good friend. That's right. Right. Because your body's getting it too. Right. What's happening now?
[66:47] B: I just can see myself getting, like, more relaxed.
[66:50] A: You are just right.
[66:52] B: It's nice.
[66:53] A: It is. It's. Yeah. The stuff's getting cleared. You're getting to have more freedom. Right. And actually realizing how strong that earlier you was to be able to make it through all that. Right. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So when you think about those string of things that happened then, what do you notice? Now?
[67:36] B: I'm relaxed.
[67:38] A: Yeah.
[67:41] B: Feel more confident.
[67:42] A: Yeah. Anything about that stuff happening then that's at all troubling you now? Is there any anger or hurt or guilt or sadness or shame? No. Right. Notice how different that is? Isn't that cool? It is. Yeah. Right.
[68:11] B: Very cool.
[68:12] A: Yeah. So we're on our way to be getting all sorts of stuff lifted and cleared. Right, Right. And you get to actually, from this moment, be really appreciative of how resourceful that earlier you was. Right. Going through what she went through, being able to get her out of that. Hello. Right. Yeah. So are you a Floridian?
[68:45] B: No. I mean, I guess I am now.
[68:47] A: Well, but where. Where are you from?
[68:50] B: Maryland.
[68:51] A: Oh, you're a Marylander? Maryland, yeah. Okay. And did you grow up in Maryland? So, like, grow up, go to school for a period of time, and then is that where the extended family people are, like, dad, mom.
[69:15] B: My dad is in Maryland.
[69:17] A: Your dad's in Maryland?
[69:18] B: My mom lives in Williston.
[69:21] A: The hell is that four hours from here? Williston is a place in Florida?
[69:26] B: Yeah.
[69:27] A: Oh, geez.
[69:28] B: It's like, this way.
[69:29] A: My bad. I've never had one. Well, that's cool.
[69:38] B: My sister. One of my sisters is in Maryland, and the other ones are here in Florida.
[69:49] A: Okay. Are they up in Williston, too, the ones that are in Florida, or are they in different places?
[69:57] B: Yes, except for one sister is in Dunellyn.
[70:04] A: I've heard of Dunellyn.
[70:05] B: You have?
[70:06] A: I have. Why?
[70:07] B: Because of the river.
[70:08] A: I don't know why. I think I've driven through there by there. 41 yeah. Wasn't it on the way to tallahassee.
[70:18] B: Instead of 75 to 41?
[70:20] A: Yeah. All the way up the coastline. Tallahassee. But I also know Dunedin because I was in Clearwater for a period of time, and that's close to Clearwater.
[70:33] B: Never heard of it.
[70:36] A: There you go. Yeah. Cool. All right. So we got that stuff cleared. Yeah. What else? Because we're doing. Did you know, by the way, that when those moments get cleared. Right. So in our brain and our body, energy is having to be used to deal with yucky stuff, whether we consciously think of it or not. So as those moments get brought into the present moment and the impact that they've had, clear, all the energy that was stuck in dealing with them get released to be able to be renewing restorative, healing energy inside of you, directing towards other areas.
[71:25] B: You ready?
[71:26] A: You got another one? I'm ready. This one. You're how old? What happened?
[71:34] B: This was just a few months ago.
[71:37] A: No, that was a really good time of your life.
[71:39] B: Oh, yeah.
[71:42] A: I can't wait to think back about that. Fondly. Those few months of my life, they were just wonderful. Yeah. Are you at the hotel? Cause that's a great place to hang.
[71:55] B: It's a different.
[71:56] A: Damn it. It's a different hotel and in Ocala. All right, so it was all at a different hotel. Daytime or nighttime?
[72:08] B: At night.
[72:09] A: Right. And you're outside.
[72:13] B: I'm in. I'm outside in a car.
[72:17] A: You're outside in a car. Good. Front seat, Back seat. Front seat, Front seat.
[72:20] B: I get a call.
[72:21] A: Right.
[72:21] B: Because I do. Back page.
[72:22] A: Good job.
[72:23] B: Back page.
[72:24] A: Right.
[72:24] B: And our. No, it was a text message.
[72:27] A: Text message.
[72:28] B: And they're telling me they have so much money and they're just driving through.
[72:32] A: Yes.
[72:33] B: Whatever. Whatever. So I'm in a rush to get back to them.
[72:35] A: Hotel room. Good job, good detail. And you're driving in a rush to get. Somebody else is driving you back to the hotel room.
[72:42] B: Right.
[72:42] A: Got it. Good. Right. Now what happened next?
[72:44] B: I get in the hotel room and I left the swip to the door, the lock like this.
[72:50] A: Yes.
[72:51] B: So somebody knocks.
[72:53] A: Yes.
[72:54] B: I tell them to come in.
[72:55] A: Yes.
[72:55] B: It's a girl. And she's got brass knuckles. So she starts punching me in the back of the head.
[73:00] A: Good job, good detail. Not hurt.
[73:02] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I, like, got a hold of her.
[73:13] A: Yeah.
[73:13] B: But she's still hitting me in the.
[73:15] A: Back of the head.
[73:15] B: And she's telling me to let her go.
[73:17] A: Good job, good detail.
[73:18] B: So I let her go.
[73:19] A: Yes. No one else.
[73:20] B: She Left.
[73:21] A: Oh, she stopped hitting you.
[73:22] B: Yes.
[73:23] A: Huh. Wasn't that good? Yeah. And then she left. Right. And your head still was like. This was not what I was expecting. I was gonna do the other thing or whatever. So then what happened?
[73:44] B: I realized that I'm wet because I've wet myself.
[73:47] A: Yeah, of course.
[73:47] B: Right.
[73:47] A: And my head, you know now why that happens?
[73:50] B: Yes.
[73:50] A: Right.
[73:51] B: My head is busted and open.
[73:53] A: Yeah. Right. And it's bleedy very badly. Yeah. Right. Tell what happened.
[73:58] B: I call somebody and telling them to come pick me up. And now I'm calling the dude that choked me. It was his girlfriend.
[74:10] A: Good job, good detail. Right.
[74:12] B: And I'm calling him.
[74:13] A: Yes.
[74:14] B: Because he's my drug dealer.
[74:15] A: Good job, good detail.
[74:16] B: But we're also having sex.
[74:18] A: Right. Good job. Right.
[74:18] B: That's why she did that.
[74:19] A: Yes. So he's an honorable guy.
[74:22] B: Oh, yeah.
[74:25] A: That's right.
[74:27] B: Pretty much that.
[74:28] A: Right. Then that time ended. Yes. That other person never came through. What?
[74:33] B: No, that was her.
[74:35] A: Oh.
[74:35] B: She set it up.
[74:37] A: Ah, sneaky.
[74:38] B: Yeah.
[74:43] A: All right, so, but as you went through, what'd you notice?
[74:48] B: Relaxed.
[74:49] A: Isn't that weird that you were telling me about this thing that sucked and you weren't all like, in it? Hmm. Isn't that interesting? Right, Right. Because you know what the other thing that your brain starts to do? Really cool that it does this. It's really good at taking specifics and then generalizing. It's not good at taking a generalization and making it specific. It's why when we learn how to tie a pair of sneakers, we typically learn on one pair. It's not like your parents put out 12. Okay, so these are green. This is how you do the green ones. These ones are blue. This is how you do the blue ones. We learn on one. But once you've mastered it on one, can't you do it on all? Well, I know these are boots, so they're a little different. I know what I'm doing. Same thing you learn on the bicycle that you learn. It's not the same one that you would ride. No. But once you've got balance, your brain generalizes it to all other two wheeled items, even motorcycles.
[75:55] B: That's interesting.
[75:57] A: Same thing with cars. You don't have to drive the same car that you learned how to drive on.
[76:04] B: Okay, I see what you're saying.
[76:05] A: It generalizes. It's the same thing. If I said to you orange, I could be thinking about fruit. I could be thinking about color. But if I said to you orange, apple, banana, you go, oh, fruit, you get it? Your brain starts to generalize. So with all of that similar construct of that stuff. Stuff, your brain is beginning to generalize. Well, if that's not happening, that's not happening. That's not happening. Well, then that can't be happening because you can remember hitting you and then being bloody. Then you're getting repaired because. Jack, is it bloody enough?
[76:41] B: No.
[76:42] A: Right. That's right. You can remember putting your pants on.
[76:46] B: Yes.
[76:46] A: Gabby, stop putting on your pants then. Stop her from doing that.
[76:50] B: She's not doing that.
[76:51] A: So then where is it? They no longer exist. Nice. Did she at least leave the money?
[76:56] B: No. Shit. God damn it.
[77:00] A: I mean, it would have been one thing, like. I mean, I shouldn't get. I was only doing the thing for the cash anyway. Fuck, I didn't even get the cash. Totally was a different thing than I was thinking about cash. Right. Right. Yeah. Ah, there we go. Right. It started off, filter in. Yeah. Things are starting to lighten up. Right. So you can think about the soaring eagle. Take a deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. With eyes closed, they rest. As eyes rest closed, you can also rest. And your brain is getting all that it's already gotten and learned, and it's beginning to integrate it all the way through, all the way down and in.
[77:53] B: That's right.
[77:54] A: That's right. It's all happening. Oh, you didn't realize that laughing is the same thing as meditation? You didn't know that, did you?
[78:06] B: No.
[78:06] A: Right. But it is. It really is the same powerful trance. It's just a funnier one.
[78:15] B: That's cool.
[78:17] A: It is. Yeah. Right. That's why I like to laugh a lot. I like to have fun. People say to me all the time.
[78:25] B: You deal with really shitty stuff that's happened to people.
[78:27] A: I go, I know, it's fun. What is wrong with you? They go, well, being with me is more fun than the yucky stuff. And that's all we're interested in doing because we just need your brain to realize that it stopped and see some of that bad feeling about you. Your brain's gonna travel back to even earlier, other stuff. Right? And it's gonna travel back, back, back, back, back, and it's gonna bring another moment to mind, which might have happened when you were how old.
[78:55] B: This wasn't too long ago either.
[78:58] A: Oh, good. Right. Yeah. But just check. Think about it. Tell me about it. What do you notice? Even as you just run it through.
[79:07] B: It stopped.
[79:08] A: It did, didn't it? Right. Oh, you stopped it.
[79:14] B: My thought, when I was digging, it said, it stopped.
[79:18] A: Oh, it stopped. Right, right. The thing that was troubling you just a moment ago, that wasn't that long ago, right? Your brain just went, oh, stop. You went, oh, all right. And now as you think about it, it doesn't have any of that stuff. Right. Isn't that cool?
[79:36] B: Yeah.
[79:39] A: Well, you're a fast learner. That's good. That was easy. Why don't we start off with that one? Right? But see, there were messages that you got when you were little younger, stuff along the way that might have assisted in aiding you down the path that you went. Selah likes to talk a lot about root. Right? And we know that one of the commonalities, I don't like to call it a root, but it's a commonality. Commonality of people who have been trafficked, drugged, all that stuff. Commonality has something to do with like childhood sexual stuff. That's a commonality. We need lots of people who have. Have had that too. It doesn't mean it's the root because it would mean anybody who was sexually abused then would have to have been trafficked later. And unfortunately, there's a lot of people in life, or fortunately, I don't know how to say that, that have had sexual abuse that weren't trafficked. The problem is lots of people had sexual abuse. It's crazy. It is.
[80:50] B: It's crazy.
[80:50] A: I got two little girls, I got a nine to five year old.
[80:55] B: Serious.
[80:56] A: Just like a concern that I have. We're supposed to go and hang out with cousins whose mom just left because her husband was beating her and I don't know what other stuff they got experienced, like, deal with fucking shit. There were little girls.
[81:21] B: Don't let them out of your sight.
[81:23] A: Sometimes it feels that way. But then we also want them to, like, experience life. We want them to be able to go, you know, the problem with society is that we've shrunk what kids can do. Like, when I was a kid, I used to go out and ride my bike all around the neighborhood and the blocks and all that. Be out in the woods and do all those kinds of things. Now my kids have to go on play dates where I have to be there. That's not fun. I mean, maybe for them, not for me, and not really good for them either. I don't know what the answer is. I just don't know what the answer is. Right. But we want to get all that stuff cleared up. Cause aren't you on your way, by the way, to becoming an even better mom now? Where are the kids now my daughter.
[82:14] B: Is with her dad and my son is with my husband.
[82:18] A: Okay, cool. And they're in relationship to here? Where? Four hours away in that small little town. Oh, in Ocala. Okay. Okay. How old is your son? Your daughter's 11, right? He's 6. He got pretty similar split. Yeah. And you're on your way to getting way better. Does your husband get to know where you are? He does. Okay. Does he have any interaction? Have you been able to talk to him? Yeah. I don't know where you are in programming because there's, you know, levels.
[83:02] B: Yeah, they're giving him a background check.
[83:05] A: Hmm. Is he an okay guy? Cool. Well, that's good. Yeah. So we want to get all sorts of other things cleared too. And we're on our way to be getting things to be a lot lighter and lifted. Right. Because you're not feeling troubled by that stuff, are you? Isn't that weird? I mean, you probably didn't think like, oh, really? You know, we're. That's gonna.
[83:32] B: It's weird cuz it's so simple.
[83:36] A: Isn't that crazy? People make it too hard. They do this kind of shit. See that thing over there? Wipe that thing out. Turn it over this way and do that. It is simp. But it takes somebody having to jump in because a lot of people go, you know, somebody might have done the thing when you started to have tears. They'd start thinking about themselves. And I stopped going, hey, hi. What's happening now? Hey, stop applying it to you. Get it over here. Right, right. And then we're able to move through stuff. Right? Yeah. Because it's a collaborative process. We're doing it together. Right, right. What's happening now?
[84:44] B: I'm feeling better.
[84:45] A: You are, aren't you?
[84:46] B: Yeah.
[84:48] A: So is there anger, hurt, pain, guilt, stuff around anything? With mom, with dad, with. Because I see that dad doesn't have any positives other than that he, you know, is, you know, the thing that had you be here. So that's really. I mean, that'd be the one positive. Like you're human and you're pretty darn amazing.
[85:23] B: I love my dad, but my mom. Everybody say, you're just like your dad. You look just like your dad. You're just like.
[85:38] A: That's always great for a girl. Awesome. So I look like a hairy man.
[85:42] B: Cool.
[85:44] A: Wow, that's great. Thanks.
[85:49] B: No, not like that.
[85:51] A: I like it when people go, oh, they look like your. They look like their mother. Thank goodness. I don't want my two girls looking like me. That Would be awful for them. I'm lucky I'm a guy. It's not really about what we look like. Thank goodness. Or at least not just what about it.
[86:14] B: My dad's had a very bad drug problem.
[86:17] A: Yeah.
[86:19] B: And eating disorder. He just ain't all there anymore. Yeah, he's in and out of mental institutions.
[86:35] A: He's not well.
[86:37] B: Not at all.
[86:37] A: Right. So are you like him? No, you're not, are you?
[86:43] B: Mm mm.
[86:44] A: No, you're not. I mean, you might have some DNA from him.
[86:48] B: The shitty ones.
[86:50] A: Well, I told that to my daughter too. I'm sorry, sweetheart. You got all the bad qualities from me. You're emotional, you cry, you are sensitive. That was not good as a boy to be sensitive and cry. I would though. I'd get all cry when I was a little boy. I'd cry, my feelings would hurt. My feelings were on my ceiling. People would say something mean. Not a good aspect. My mom though told me one time, I think it was pretty, pretty wise of her. Whether she believed it or not, she goes, you know your emotions, it's gonna be your biggest strength in life. The thing that was like Achilles worst part about me. So that's gonna be your strength.
[87:41] B: I like your mom.
[87:42] A: I know. Isn't that cool? It was really cool. And she's not highly educated. I mean she graduated high school, wasn't it?
[87:50] B: Yeah.
[87:52] A: What a cool thing to say.
[87:53] B: Yeah.
[87:55] A: Cause I am, I'm like emotional. My wife laughs at me sometimes because I cry to my like I'll get inspired, like have tears. A little embarrassing.
[88:04] B: Oh my gosh.
[88:08] A: What are you gonna do? But see, there was a time when people are telling you that you're just like your dad. Right. Like mom would say that when she'd see you act a certain way. You're just like your father or those things. You look like your dad. Do you look like him? I mean, does he have long hair?
[88:34] B: No. No.
[88:38] A: He doesn't, does he? Feminine qualities.
[88:41] B: I have his eyes.
[88:43] A: Oh, well, there you go.
[88:44] B: His facial structure.
[88:45] A: Uh huh. So not really.
[88:49] B: Not really.
[88:53] A: Right, right. So might want to educate an earlier younger you. But she's not just like her dad. She's totally different. She's you. Right, right. What's happening now?
[89:29] B: I want to be angry at him.
[89:31] A: Oh, you do? Yeah. Yes. Okay, let's do it. Get angry at him. What do you want to be angry at him about?
[89:49] B: That I got hooked on drugs.
[89:54] A: His fault? Yes. Cuz he gave them to you. No. Fucker. That would be really shitty. I would have put that on the bad thing.
[90:07] B: I just let people tell me these things and then I let that be my identity.
[90:12] A: Right. Oh, see, that's the problem. You were thinking it was you, but it isn't, is it?
[90:18] B: No.
[90:19] A: No. And are you using now?
[90:21] B: No.
[90:21] A: No. Isn't that cool? How long? Clean, clear now.
[90:30] B: I don't know. Two or three months.
[90:33] A: That's awesome. That's way cool. Good job. Yeah. Right. Because you were thinking that if, you know, you didn't get that part of genetics that somehow using would have not led to being addicted to it.
[90:52] B: Yes.
[90:53] A: Oh. I mean, are there people out there that can really, like, you know? Yes, there are.
[90:58] B: Yes.
[90:59] A: Huh. Shit. I don't know any of those people.
[91:01] B: Really?
[91:02] A: I do know people who can use hard drugs and not get hooked on them.
[91:08] B: Yes.
[91:09] A: Seriously?
[91:10] B: Yes.
[91:11] A: Huh. Wow. They can use them just like recreation.
[91:15] B: Yep.
[91:16] A: Like, oh, you know, I decided to, you know, she had a little heroin last weekend. I'm fine now.
[91:24] B: I wouldn't take it that far.
[91:25] A: Okay.
[91:26] B: Thank goodness.
[91:29] A: You mean, maybe somebody could smoke a little pot, smoke some crack. Smoke some crack and not go back to crack?
[91:36] B: Yeah.
[91:37] A: Well, not yet.
[91:41] B: True.
[91:44] A: Right. But you stopped.
[91:54] B: Mm.
[91:55] A: Right. Didn't you? I did. You did, didn't you? Right. So you're not doing it now.
[92:00] B: Mm. Mm.
[92:01] A: Right.
[92:02] B: But the music makes me think about it. I'm not smoking crack, but, like, it puts me back in certain people. Like, thinking about them or being in certain places.
[92:17] A: Yeah.
[92:18] B: And then it makes my move.
[92:19] A: Foul. Well, I want you to check it out right now.
[92:24] B: You play some rap music?
[92:26] A: No. Why don't you just think about.
[92:28] B: Think about what?
[92:29] A: The rap music. Maybe a place or a song that you might hear that normally would take you back. Oh. What's happening?
[92:42] B: It's not so bad.
[92:44] A: It isn't, is it?
[92:45] B: Mm.
[92:52] A: You're so good.
[92:55] B: This is actually fun.
[92:57] A: Right? Who would have thunk it? Who would have thunk it? We could deal with really heavy, awful stuff and have it be fun. Huh? From Zephyrils. Zephyrilis.
[93:23] B: Zephyrhills.
[93:23] A: Oh, that's it. Yeah. That's way up there. Like pinellas passed up on that side.
[93:34] B: It's not.
[93:35] A: Isn't it? It's not. I don't know where it is, then, clearly. Is it in Polk?
[93:42] B: I don't know.
[93:49] A: I know they make water.
[93:51] B: That's about it, right?
[93:55] A: Yeah. So you wanna be angry at him?
[94:01] B: No.
[94:02] A: Oh, well, are you?
[94:04] B: No.
[94:07] A: Huh.
[94:10] B: Don't want it to be, though.
[94:12] A: You want it to be?
[94:13] B: Yeah. I don't want to.
[94:14] A: Huh. Well, try.
[94:17] B: Try to be angry.
[94:18] A: Yeah. Hmm. Are you trying or not trying?
[94:30] B: I feel like I don't need to.
[94:32] A: You feel like you don't need to, huh? Isn't that cool?
[94:36] B: Mm.
[94:37] A: Right? Not a good news thing. You ever heard the saying, it makes me so mad, it makes me sick? It actually, you know, anger blocks healing because in the midst of threat, which is where anger would be, healing drops. Right. If bullets start flying through the windows, we're not going to look for the broom to sweep up the glass. Gotta make it nice and tidy. That's not what we're interested in doing. Right.
[95:38] B: No.
[95:38] A: You're realizing that you're not just like him. Yes, that's right. You're you. Completely distinctly different than him. Right. Because you've stopped. Right. Oh, isn't that cool?
[96:06] B: It is.
[96:11] A: Yeah. What's happening now?
[96:16] B: Now I'm digging for more stuff.
[96:18] A: Yeah? Is it coming?
[96:21] B: Uh, I'm looking for more, like big stuff. But if I have to dig, apparently ain't that big.
[96:39] A: Right. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. Right. You're getting to be more free and actually, you know, more good with you. Right.
[97:01] B: It's nice.
[97:02] A: It is, isn't it?
[97:04] B: I just hope I can keep this. When I walk out the door.
[97:08] A: Where's it gonna go? I don't know.
[97:09] B: Might come back.
[97:12] A: It's not just contained in here.
[97:14] B: Okay, well, shit.
[97:19] A: Right? Because it goes with you. I mean, who has it happened to?
[97:23] B: Me.
[97:23] A: Right. Right. See, the thing you are going to begin to realize is that stuff's changed. And as that stuff changes, you're going to notice more things that are new and different for you. You won't be troubled by that stuff because you can try to feel troubled by it. You know, think about the guy and, you know, putting his hands around your throat because you didn't take your clothes off. You must have more money.
[97:55] B: Right?
[97:58] A: Right. It doesn't have the same thing. Right, Right. You're not even feeling bad about what happened when you were a kid.
[98:08] B: No.
[98:09] A: No. Right, right, right. See, and the difference is you've never not been able to see. You've always felt bad about that. Since the thing happened. You had always been scared. And you're not feeling those feelings now. Right. Which means your brain is getting it. And when you learn that Santa, that you know, pervert, watches little children all the time, isn't real, can you go back to believing in him? Can you think he is? That's how it works. So what will happen as you move forward through your day is your brain will continue to integrate and generalize what it's got and learned. And of course, when you sleep tonight, the first few hours of sleep is about the physical restoration of the body. The last few hours of sleep is about emotional restoration and the integration of new learnings. So you'll notice all sorts of things being different and we'll get back together again. But you're already noticing feeling a lot lighter, feeling more comfortable with you. I actually really appreciative of the wisdom you have inside because. Damn, that was freaking resourceful. I mean, amazing. Right? Right. And then since then, all of the amazing, powerful changes you've already made. Yeah. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So you did great work today.
[100:27] B: Thanks. Craw veins.
[100:31] A: That's right.
