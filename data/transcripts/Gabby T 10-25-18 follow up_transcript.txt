[00:00] A: Cool. So Today is the 25th. 25th of October. And, Gabby, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. Want to make sure that's okay with you? Yes.
[00:10] B: Yes.
[00:10] A: Okay. So for a few days, you felt better?
[00:14] B: Couple days.
[00:15] A: Yeah, a couple days. Okay. And then what's happened is you hear people tell stories of things and then you see it in your mind's eye.
[00:26] B: Yeah.
[00:26] A: Okay. And when you see it in your mind's eye, is it more like a movie or a photograph?
[00:32] B: More of like a movie.
[00:34] A: Okay. In color or black and white?
[00:37] B: In color.
[00:38] A: In color. Is it life size?
[00:42] B: No.
[00:43] A: So it's smaller or bigger?
[00:45] B: It's small.
[00:46] A: It's small.
[00:47] B: Yeah.
[00:47] A: So it's a small movie. So maybe like on a tv, it might be big.
[00:52] B: I don't know. I'm trying to think as I'm thinking of it now, it's small, but, like.
[00:57] A: When it happens, when it pops in.
[01:02] B: It'S probably like this in my head.
[01:05] A: Okay. Okay. And does it have, like, a frame on it, like a border around it when it's like that in your head? I know these are weird questions, right?
[01:17] B: No. But I'm going with it. No, I don't think so.
[01:21] A: Okay. Okay. Is there anything outside of it that you weren't including in it that if you did, it would have the picture not be a problem anymore?
[01:30] B: I don't know.
[01:31] A: You don't know, huh? Well, I wonder what would happen if you were to include more into the picture. Because what you're trying to do, Right. The solution that you've been looking at is trying to stop the pictures from happening or the movies. Right. Because you hear something, somebody says something, and then you're all of a sudden, like, seeing it.
[01:50] B: Right?
[01:51] A: Right. So there are two things that go on. What do you have to be good at doing in order to have that as a problem? Like, what's the hidden ability? Well, you can vividly, realistically imagine things happening.
[02:06] B: Yeah.
[02:07] A: Which can be really cool for, like, you know, what you want to create for you in your life. To vividly imagine and see it happen would be really useful to create in creating what you want for you in your life. Don't you think? Right. So that's one thing that's like a hidden ability, because in order to have that problem, you have to have some sort of ability to be able to do it.
[02:28] B: Okay. So I got superpowers.
[02:32] A: You do. We all have some superpowers. Right. And that one's actually a useful one if it's Used in a different way. Right, right. It's kind of like, you know, people talk about obsessive compulsive stuff. Like, I have a sense of thought, which if the obsession is on something that the person, you know, wants to be doing, it can be a really good propulsion method. Right. Like, it can motivate them to continue to do it. Like, if somebody's obsessive about exercise, we're not going, oh, that's really bad that they have to, you know, get up and do their workout. Oh, geez. Nobody complains about that. You know, I work out every day. Oh, wow.
[03:13] B: But this is different.
[03:14] A: Well, I know, but, like. So that's a compulsion. Okay, so. But the idea is hidden abilities are useful to have. But the second part is you've been trying to stop it from happening. Right? Cutting it out.
[03:31] B: Yeah. I guess after a while, because I've been just letting it roll off and that was cool for a couple days. But then once it continues and can, you know, I'm just like. It gets annoying because I feel like, you know, when somebody pulls a cucumber out of the refrigerator and my thought goes to something else with the cucumber, that's pretty bad.
[03:57] A: Well, it's a. I mean, that's what people do. That's why they call them forting slips. Is that a banana in your pocket or are you happy to see him?
[04:07] B: But a lot of people aren't thinking like that, and it is driving me nuts.
[04:11] A: Okay, but see, that's kind of a form of humor. I mean, it really is. Like, comedians think that way all the time.
[04:22] B: But I don't want to be a comedian.
[04:26] A: Right. So part of what's been going on is that you've wanted to stop yourself from having those kinds of thoughts. And then the movie that goes along with it. Right. And does the movie, like, play out what would happen with it? I try to stop it, but, like, that's the movie that's going on.
[04:45] B: Yeah.
[04:45] A: Okay. So the question becomes, we can do something that's about taking it out. But I wonder what would happen if you added more.
[04:56] B: If I was sitting and thinking about the thought, it probably wouldn't be good stuff I was adding.
[05:00] A: Well, what if you were to add more of everything else that you weren't thinking about? That has nothing to do with the problem that if you were to put it in, it would cease to have. That be a problem. Okay, Right. I mean, because the idea goes, if we are all about cutting things out, we think of it being like a tree branch to Cut damage, We can cut that one off. Doesn't harm the tree. Right. And they used to think that you could do that with your brain. Here we'll do a lobotomy. We'll just cut that portion out. And then it really fucked the person up. Like really, really screwed the person up. Because what they didn't know is that our brain isn't like cancer is another thing that we do where we cut it out, we cut it and then we burn it with radiation and chemotherapy to try to eradicate it. That's how we do stuff. But our brain is more rhizomatic. Rhizomatic is everything is interconnected. So when they remove that part, they just remove that part. All the other connections that went along with everything else in multiple layers and in different ways. So then the idea comes, what if you added more of all of the other things that you weren't thinking about? Like all the other uses of a cucumber other than that one. Right. Like in salads. Right, right. That you weren't including. Right. Or like that tomato thing that they make where they put some like Italian dressing and they chop tomatoes and they chop cucumbers up and they make this kind of. Maybe they put it with like little tabbouleh or some kind of other stuff like that. Like there's lots of different uses. Right. That you weren't adding. So I wonder what happens if you add it.
[06:53] B: So continue. So, okay, so you're telling me the. That when I get these kinds of thoughts to add something to it.
[07:07] A: Well, all of the other uses, everything else that isn't a part of the problem.
[07:15] B: Okay, so can I give you another example?
[07:18] A: That would be great. You're awesome.
[07:20] B: Okay, so when somebody is seeking, saying in a group that they were molested or something when they were a child, and now I have a vision of this in my head. How what am I adding to that?
[07:37] A: What's everything else that wasn't going on?
[07:39] B: I don't know. Like.
[07:44] A: So what's all of the material of information that was going on before the molestation? And everything else is sense it that's not included in that thought that's running in your head. It's weird, right? I mean, I guess, see, what happens is you get hyper focused on that, right? So that becomes exclusionary, meaning that's what you're thinking of. Just that what I'm suggesting is what happens if you add more to it. And we want to do actually processes so that you don't have to be doing it yourself, that it just Starts doing it, that all the other content starts get added to it. Right. Because the problem with the problem is that it's not connected to anything else. It's kind of a disintegrated part of the nervous system. What we know about the neuroscience of transformation is if we've got a problematic neural network that gets lit up and. And it's not connected to anything else, and that's what we focus on. Right. If we start lighting up other neural networks and they don't even have to relate to that at all, but the lighting up of any amount of neural networks, the boundary threshold that keeps this one separate dissipates. So think of like, there was a wall that kept that separate from everything else. When we start lighting up new neural networks, the wall that was there dissipates and goes away. So now it becomes a part of the whole. And then the brain reconsolidates, so it stops being problematic. It kind of mixes it all together. So that's no longer an issue. Which is kind of what we're wanting to have happen to it. No longer being an issue.
[09:41] B: Yeah.
[09:42] A: Right. Yeah. Which would be really good for you, don't you think? Yeah. Okay, so that's something that we want to do. So, though, and let me ask this other part. So the part that's disturbing for you is that your brain immediately goes to something sexual in nature. Like the example of the cucumber. You were thinking of all the other. The sexual uses of a cucumber.
[10:12] B: Right. Or if, like, somebody's bending over, you know, I have a sexual thought about. Instead of just, oh, she's picking up whatever that fell on the floor.
[10:26] A: It's.
[10:28] B: Something's going in her kind of, you know, okay, so it's like everything is. My mind is taking it to the.
[10:42] A: Sexual thing, which would make a really funny comedy.
[10:46] B: I don't think all the women at the house are going to think funny.
[10:50] A: I'm thinking like, you know, a TV show would make a funny comedy.
[10:54] B: No, it would not. No, it wouldn't.
[11:02] A: It could make a pretty funny comment.
[11:04] B: Not when you're, you know, believe in Jesus and you're, like, trying to not. You know what I'm saying? I don't want to have immoral thoughts all the time. And, you know.
[11:17] A: Okay, is that the part that's disturbing you most? What is it you're thinking that, you know, Jesus wouldn't be okay with you having those kinds of thoughts. Your daughter.
[11:28] B: I think that he understands, but I think that I want to move past.
[11:37] A: That, you know, well, how would you be if you were already past it?
[11:43] B: I wouldn't be feeling so shitty about it all the time.
[11:47] A: Okay, and if you weren't feeling so shitty about it, how would you actually be?
[11:52] B: I don't know.
[11:55] A: Well, I mean, let's just think. Because you know what you're really good at doing?
[11:59] B: Imagining stuff.
[12:01] A: You are, right? So imagine a you who's like completely beyond past all that stuff that's not even showing up anymore, doesn't even know, right? Like that's completely done. Like how would you actually be, like how would you be as a person knowing that that's like completely done over? You're free. Like how would you be, what would it be like?
[12:27] B: I don't know. Because my whole life, this is like my thoughts all the time.
[12:34] A: Well, not all the time.
[12:35] B: Majority of the time you. It's like majority of the time, there's.
[12:41] A: Not any time that you're not.
[12:42] B: I probably think maybe five minutes I have a thought come into my mind that's like sexual.
[12:46] A: Uh huh. Okay. Right. And if that was no longer going on and you weren't having those kinds of thoughts, what would that be like?
[12:59] B: I don't know.
[13:00] A: See, this is part of the problem. Just, you know why? Because you're not actually seeing yourself different. See, I wonder what it would be like. See, I'm going to start talking about this because this is really cool. Because this is like the real big key, you know what you're not seeing. Like you're, you're. What, what do we say your hidden ability is? You're really good at making in detail vivid movies, right? So let's make an in detail vivid movie of a you who's completely free from all and those thoughts don't even show up. Like how would that be for her? How would she be feeling inside? What would that be like? What else would she be able to be thinking about that? Isn't that what are all of the other things that she could start paying attention to that have nothing to do with that? And then if she's paying attention to all of those other things, how would she be feeling? How would she be as a person? How would she be about herself? That's what we want to start thinking about. You know why? Because once we start creating that, then we give your brain something to organize towards, right? So what would that be like? Like if you're completely done with that, it's not even showing up, nobody can go on anymore.
[14:08] B: That would be amazing.
[14:09] A: That would be amazing. Oh, and how would you feel like, if you're, like, amazing, like, what would it be like for you to be amazing?
[14:17] B: Dang. I could focus on a lot of other stuff.
[14:19] A: Oh, right, you could focus on a lot of other stuff. And if you're focusing on a lot of other stuff. Right. How would you be feeling? Right.
[14:25] B: How would you be getting things accomplished?
[14:28] A: Well, isn't it amazing that you still do, even if you have those thoughts, get things accomplished?
[14:33] B: Currently, I don't know what I'm really getting accomplished so far.
[14:39] A: You don't?
[14:40] B: No. When it comes to, like, GED and, you know, stuff like that, I mean.
[14:45] A: Okay. I mean, you are doing that.
[14:48] B: Yeah.
[14:48] A: Yeah. So you're in process. Right. Isn't that interesting that you're already in process?
[14:54] B: Yeah, but I don't want to be sitting there trying to work all my math work and thinking about other sexual thoughts. You know, I would like to be able to focus on what's going on.
[15:07] A: Yeah. So if that's happening. Right. That you're actually focusing on what's going on, what would that be like for you? Like, just check for a moment. Gabby, how would you be as a person knowing that you're completely free from all of that and you're able to focus on and think about whatever it is that you want to be focusing on or thinking about? Like, what would that be like? Like, how would you be. I got that this has been a long standing thing and it happens, and you haven't been liking that it's happened in particular because you've got a much more connection with higher power. You've got much more connection being in, like, you know, the presence of the Lord and God and Holy Spirit and all that other kind of stuff. So how would you. With that? I'm just curious. How would you be knowing that you're completely free from all that? Like, what would that be like?
[15:57] B: Free?
[15:58] A: Yeah. And what's it like when you feel free? You're not going to get it looking that way. You're going to get it looking up that way. I promise. Wow.
[16:13] B: I don't know.
[16:14] A: I know. Because you keep looking towards the past, you're gonna need to look up this way. Well, I'm gonna tell you the secret. Right. You're gonna need to start looking up to where you begin to conceive of things. See, that's visually remembering, and this is visually conceiving. It's kind of why I put my hand up. Like, how would you be? Because I want you to look there. When you start looking there, that's when you Begin to conceive of like, what that would be like. Because like I'm already seeing a you who's a lot lighter, who's a lot more carefree and a lot more easygoing. She's much more at peace inside and comfortable in her own skin. She's even lighter and easier on herself.
[17:03] B: I'm light.
[17:06] A: She's even lighter and easier on herself so that she begins to experience more joy in what she's doing. Yeah. What would that be like for you to be more joyful, more easygoing and lighter and more carefree and peaceful?
[17:32] B: I would be happier. I know that.
[17:34] A: Yeah. What's it like when you feel happy?
[17:40] B: I want to not.
[17:41] A: That's so good. Right? You're doing great. Yeah.
[17:51] B: I would be able to focus and I'd accomplish things and. Yeah.
[18:00] A: Maybe even like feel good.
[18:01] B: Yeah.
[18:02] A: About what you're accomplishing.
[18:04] B: Yes.
[18:05] A: Right. And when you actually feel good, like how's your body when you're feeling good? Lighter. Oh, it's lighter. Right. Okay. So we think of a you who's light and carefree, a lot more easy going. Right. And as you start to think of that, what's that? Like, notice how you're already starting to access some of that feeling now. Right. Because the only time that we can really do effective change work is now to change it for later. But we need to do it now because that's where we are. Right. So my job whenever I'm meeting with somebody is to get them into the states that we want them to be in while they're with me so that we can start to get the resources going. Right. And you get to be lighter and more carefree and easier on you and more peaceful and like truly connected. Right. Because when we think about our brain, this is a really interesting thought. I don't think I've shared it with anybody in the house or that. But like we have multiple brains, head, heart and gut. When we think of our head brain, our head brain is the one that's more and most closely in alignment with God.
[19:28] B: Now I'm going to disagree.
[19:31] A: Watch, I'm going to give you the thought. So head brain is idea brain, insight brain, it's knowledge, it's wisdom, it's all that stuff up there most highly connected with God, heart, brain, most connected to Jesus. Love, interest, passion, connection, taking care of, handling, Holy spirit, gut, strength, courage, Holy spirit, gut, brain, they're all a part of the whole, but it's what they're more in alignment with. Jesus is all about passion, love, interest, understanding, compassion, Mm. Right.
[20:17] B: So I tried to explain that to somebody.
[20:20] A: Oh, boy.
[20:20] B: And, well, I tried to say to my mom, she's like, what? No, no, no.
[20:27] A: Right. Well, mom didn't have the context.
[20:32] B: Okay.
[20:33] A: I'm not sure mom realizes that we have more than one brain.
[20:37] B: True.
[20:39] A: So it would be hard for her to clean the whole rest of the stuff if she doesn't have the contacts. Right?
[20:46] B: Yeah.
[20:47] A: Yeah. Right. So if we think of you as being lighter and more carefree and peaceful and easier on you, and if we were to symbolize you that way.
[21:03] B: Wild.
[21:03] A: Animal, something up in the sky, a natural formation of the earth, something that you'd see in nature, what comes to mind to symbolize a you who's peaceful and light and carefree?
[21:19] B: Hmm. I don't know. Let me think. We'll just say the sun.
[21:28] A: The sun. Yeah. Right. Because you know what? The sun is a big wildfire. It is, Right. That's one representation. But the sun is something that's really powerful. I mean, it provides light to all things. Right. It provides energy for growth, healing and change. Right. It is cool. Right. And the sun is something that's restorative and self generating. Right. It doesn't need outside things to shine bright. It's sourced and powered from within. Right. So that's a powerful symbol. So then you want to activate in your brain that symbol. So you're going to look up and out and think sun and take a big deep breath in. And that's the first part that was easy. Right. Second is the exact same thing. This time though, after inhaling, you exhale and close your eyes. So look up and out, think sun, big breath in, and then exhale and close your eyes. Good. And then you can open your eyes. Same thing as that. This time though, when you close your eyes, you're going to keep them closed for a few moments and bring your awareness in towards your breath. So look out, the sun. Deep breath in, Exhale. And eyes are closed. Eyes closed, they rest. So that as your eyes are resting and closed, you can also rest. You notice that you can hear my voice. You can be aware of your breath both at the same time. The unconscious parts of your mind are responding towards what the sun symbolizes. Beginning to lay the foundation to make change. So that you become light and carefree and more and more at peace. Easier on you. That's right. And then when you're ready, take a big deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Good. Those short moments that eyes were closed, what did you begin to notice within Yourself.
[24:01] B: Calm.
[24:02] A: Yeah. Feeling more calm. That's right. So one more time. Look up and out. Think sun. Deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Good. Eyes close. They rest. As your eyes are resting closed, you also rest. Aware of breath, my voice, other sounds, how it feels to be sitting. The way you are able to notice all of that. Into space. Same time the unconscious parts of your brain are responding towards you. Who's becoming lighter and more carefree. To care less about those things that don't matter and more focused on the things that truly matter to you and where you're headed, so that it's even easier. Do all of what you want. Your unconscious is organizing towards that now, and you don't have to do anything to make it happen because change is already underway. That's right. And then when you're ready once again, take a slow and deep breath in. And then exhale. Good job. That's right. And then one more thing. You're going to just put both hands like this. Take a big deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. Your eyes closed. They rest. As your eyes are resting and closed, you rest. Don't do anything at all. On practice to move your hands or your fingers. Just begin to notice which hand you'll notice movement first. And I'm not sure whether the movement you notice will be a twitch or a wiggle or a vibration or a jump. And it may be the left one that's right for you, or the right one might be the one that's left. Either way, your unconscious knows how to heal itself. It has direct access to the control panels and the neural circuits in your brain. It knows how to rewire inside so that things become lighter and easier. That's right. To be even more carefree, to care less, to care more, to just be free and light and easy. And you might even be curious to know whether you'll know which hand is moving first. That's right. And you don't even have to know everything else that's also happening while you're resting. That's right. That's right. And then there's the other things that I haven't said and you are noticing that are also happening. And then there's the things that you and I weren't even thinking about that are beyond what we've considered or under all that we know. Because what we know about the rhizome is that it's always ongoing underneath all things. And in between, it's the space. That's right. The space and room for things to Quiet up to yet stay connected to what truly matters to me. That's all. And then what will happen is your unconscious knowing what's happening within and knowing what to adjust will begin to turn. Travel back through the timelines in your own history to a particular experience where that kind of thinking got initiated. That's right. And it might not seem like it relates to anything at all or logically connected. Relax. But see, as your unconscious travels back, back, back, back, back, it'll bring to your attention a particular experience to clear. And as it does, you can take a big deep breath in and exhale. Open your eyes. Good job. Tell me what experience came to mind.
[29:51] B: So I'm in the basement with my cousin.
[29:54] A: Yeah. And you might have been about how old? Six. Yeah. So you're like six years old, you're in the basement with your cousin. Boy or girl? Boy. And then what happened?
[30:07] B: And I don't know, it was like we were playing some kind of game. But I was sitting on top of him.
[30:13] A: That's right.
[30:14] B: And it was just like the feeling, like it felt good.
[30:19] A: That's right, it did. And then what happened?
[30:25] B: And I think we had like a sword or something. And I don't know, it was like tucked in here on him.
[30:40] A: That's right. And.
[30:44] B: I don't know that's really all that was.
[30:46] A: And then what happened?
[30:49] B: I don't remember.
[30:50] A: Well, you might have felt that.
[30:52] B: He probably did. I didn't, but I just remember there being like a sword.
[30:58] A: Right. But sitting felt good. Right. And then what happened? So then there was the sword. And then what might have happened next? Yeah, well, you might have done something next.
[31:28] B: I don't think so.
[31:30] A: Well, you would have done something because that's still not right.
[31:34] B: Probably got up.
[31:35] A: Probably got up.
[31:36] B: Right.
[31:39] A: And then you would have played a different game or some other thing. And then that ended. Right. And as you were recalling that, did you notice any discomfort?
[31:52] B: A little bit.
[31:52] A: Uh huh. Right. And the discomfort comes not because that happened, but because the brain freezes it and doesn't know that it's not happening. Which is why we developed that silly thing of going backwards. So what's something other than that that you did later that was more fun than that or at least different than that?
[32:11] B: You want another time with my cousin?
[32:13] A: No, just anything else in life that you did that was fun, you know, from then until yesterday.
[32:22] B: Hung out with my mom.
[32:24] A: Yeah. So you had hanging out with your mom and son. Right. And then before that you guys were playing a different game and then you had gotten off and then you were on and it felt good. And then you had sat there, and then you were playing a different game. And then you were doing whatever you were doing. Then you had gone down the basement, right? And then before that, you're upstairs, Right. And then you were doing whatever you're doing. And again, as we run through backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it.
[32:52] B: Funny?
[32:52] A: It was funny, right? You can remember all that happening, right? You remember putting in your earrings. Cabby, stop putting in your earrings. Well, stop sitting on him. Stop that from acting. Say it's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists, which is what we want to get in. Right? And what we know about different body parts. His body parts are designed to feel good when touched. Right. So it's not uncommon for people to go, my body betrayed me because this bad thing happened and I didn't really want it, but it felt good. Like, not in that situation. I'm talking about in general, in life. There's many people that I've worked with that'll go and, sorry.
[33:37] B: That'S gross.
[33:38] A: I need to get that off. I had to get Plentron for whatever it is. Well visit that I have coming up. So that was the thing that was left, right. So lots of people will say things like, my body betrayed me because it felt good. Or, you know, that person told me that I was turned on because, you know, I was wet. Well, body parts touch in certain ways are designed to feel good. Not because the person wanted the thing to happen, but because the body part touched in a certain way. That's how it responds. Make sense. So lots of that kind of stuff goes on. What we want to be getting in is now. When you think about that moment, do you notice any discomfort? No, that one doesn't have any of those feelings. So what's another moment that bubbles up? Because this whole thing that goes on where you find yourself seeing this movie of whatever it is that they talked about or this or this bent over or. And then all of a sudden, it's got a background sexual connotation to it. Right? Because that's really the issue. Is it in the background, there's like a sexual connotation to it, whatever that might be, right? So that discomfort that you get in, having had that feeling, and then those movies that go along with it, videos that go along with it. Take that feeling tone and let that feeling tone guide you back. Let the feeling tone take you back, growing you earlier and younger. Younger and earlier.
[35:33] B: You're saying, what? Cause I get shame I know. Okay, well, I don't. Okay.
[35:44] A: It's that feeling tone. Right. And we want to travel that feeling tone back, back, back, right towards one of those, like, leverage points. Really's got a charge earlier, younger. Right. Where you have that same kind of feeling, which may or may not have anything to do with what you think. But, see, your unconscious knows better than you. What does it take you to?
[36:17] B: Being in my room?
[36:19] A: Yeah.
[36:20] B: Same cousin.
[36:21] A: All right, so you're in your room. Good. You're about how old? Same age. Same age. Right. So you're in your room.
[36:26] B: Yeah.
[36:26] A: Right. And you're with a cousin. Right. And then what happened?
[36:32] B: I'm laying down on the floor, and he's on top of me.
[36:35] A: And he's on top of you. Right. Good. And then what happened?
[36:38] B: And he wasn't, like, in me or anything, but he's, like, rubbing on me.
[36:44] A: Right. Good. So kind of grinding.
[36:46] B: Yes.
[36:47] A: Right. Good. And then what happened?
[36:48] B: And then he got up and that was done.
[36:50] A: Right. Well. And some of that felt good. Right. And then what happened?
[36:56] B: I don't know.
[36:57] A: Well, then he got up.
[36:58] B: Yeah.
[36:58] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[37:00] B: What about playing my game?
[37:01] A: Right. Good. And then you guys left your room. Well, at some point, you had to.
[37:07] B: Yeah.
[37:08] A: You're not still there. And then you're hanging out with your mom and your kid.
[37:13] B: Yeah.
[37:13] A: Right. So we got hanging out with your mom and your kid and then leaving the room and then playing the game and then him getting off and then him grinding and then you being on the ground, and then you guys going in your room, and then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing. Right. And again, as we run through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it.
[37:30] B: Confusing?
[37:32] A: Well, did it have the same feeling, Tony? No. Oh, it didn't, did it? You can remember all that happening? You can remember putting in your earrings. Cabby's not putting in your ear. Well, then stop him from doing that. Well, then you stop doing that. Well, then stop it from happening. It's not happening, they said. Then where is it going? No longer exists.
[37:48] B: Right.
[37:48] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. And again, by the way, did you know that little kids, even if they haven't had any, like, sexual stuff happen in their life, you know, have this whole thing called Dr. Say what it's like. I'll show you mine if you show me yours. In particular, if it's different than mine. Dead kids have this game called doctor Right, where it's not about a sexual thing, but it's about Trying to understand different body parts because mine's different than yours. Right. Isn't that interesting? Okay, right. But see, there's been bad feelings attached to that. Well, are they there now? Are the bad feelings there now? Right. Because that maybe feeling good to you wasn't because you were interested in having sex with your cousin. You were six. I know what the hell that is.
[38:50] B: Really?
[38:54] A: You follow me with that? Yeah, it wasn't like, oh boy, I'm really horny, let's do this thing. No, but you know what guys tend to do? Go fast. Because guys are ready to go like this. Yes, I'm ready. Right. You know what really works for women? Going slow. But you know, high school goers, like heavy petting kind of thing. All the touching before it gets to actual doing is the thing that gets her going. Right? Right. So you liking that enjoying him grinding wasn't because you wanted to be sexual with him.
[39:34] B: Right?
[39:34] A: Right. But because body parts fits in certain ways of desire feel good. But see, you didn't know that then.
[39:41] B: Well, after that, then I did. So then it started.
[39:46] A: Well, after that, then you did. Well, I don't think that you knew that certain body parts took me. Certain ways are designed to feel good.
[39:54] B: No, no.
[39:56] A: Right. That you didn't know in particular then you thought it was because you were into doing that thing with him, which is why they were. Shame. What's happening now.
[40:15] B: I'm trying to understand.
[40:17] A: Yeah, I know, I'm told. Which is really good. Cuz that means it's not how you've been thinking about it.
[40:31] B: Well then later.
[40:34] A: What? Later on? No, that same day.
[40:44] B: I knew then that I wasn't. That's not cool.
[40:50] A: You thought. Right? You knew him being on top of you and grinding wasn't a right, yet there was a part of it that you liked.
[41:01] B: Right?
[41:02] A: Right. You didn't like it because that's what you wanted, because you knew it was wrong. It felt good. Not because you liked it. It felt good because body parts touched in certain ways are designed to feel good. So that's what I mean by when I said earlier my body betrayed me. Like, how could this thing that I know is wrong and bad feel good? Okay, that's where this whole thing has been problematic. So what we want to do is have you educate the younger you that it wasn't something that felt good because you wanted it, but because body parts touch in certain ways are designed to feel good. Make sense? And what happens if you close your eyes and you picture that younger you knowing that it's over, finished, completed, no longer exists. And she learns that it didn't feel good because she wanted it. She knew it wasn't okay that it felt good. Just because body parts touched in certain ways are designed to feel good. Had nothing to do with you. You. And to do a body part and tension this one so that she gets it. And as she gets it, what do you know what is happening to the younger y.
[42:59] B: Pushing him off?
[43:02] A: Yeah. Oh, you mean she gets to have more control.
[43:09] B: Mm.
[43:11] A: Isn't that interesting? Right? Because where she was confused, she knew it was wrong, but thought she wanted it, thought she liked it. And why am I liking this thing that's bad. That I shouldn't do it wasn't even that she was liking it. It was feeling really good. And not because she liked it, but because the body part touched in a certain way was designed to feel good. And as that gets in, what happens to the younger used face? I wonder what would if, you know, you let her know that she's okay, and then that's okay. Because it wasn't that she really was wanting that. She didn't know what any of that all meant. It didn't feel good because she was into it. Right. Have you ever been in a pool, hot tub? There's jets that come out, right? And if the little kid puts their thing up next to it, whether it be the boy or the girl, and the water rubbing against it feels good. Is that like a sexual thing for them? Like they're like really into water jets? No, it's just that that feels good, right? Not because they're wanting, you know, they're into water jets. It's because the body partition, in a certain way, is designed to feel good. Right. What's happening now? That's a better problem happening now.
[45:15] B: You're asking about younger me.
[45:18] A: Not just happened. Right. Right now with you.
[45:27] B: I guess I'm more okay. That's just a random thing I'm saying. I don't even know.
[45:32] A: Well, check. How's your body feeling right now? I'm ready. You are, aren't you? Right. And when you remember that happening, is there the discomfort or the shame about it? Right. Because she's not feeling like she was being babbled on. What's happening now?
[46:07] B: I was gonna say I don't think that I've felt, like, bad or wrong.
[46:12] A: Where's the shame?
[46:15] B: It's shame now.
[46:17] A: Oh, shame now? About that then. No.
[46:21] B: Oh, maybe.
[46:24] A: Well, check it out. Is it there? It isn't, is it? So you feel different about that now, right? I told you a little story about the kids that get picked on the most. I think so are the ones that they show that it bothers them the most. Right. And then if they're not bothered by it, then. Then they don't get picked on as much. I wonder what that's like. Because, you know, the more troubled you are by the thought, the more you have it. Right. And if we take away the construct of feeling bad, then it opens up the avenue to think all the other thoughts about everything else that you weren't thinking about when you were having the thought. And how many other things do you think are going on other than that? There are a lot. Right. Oh, and what's happening now?
[47:38] B: I'm not caring so much.
[47:40] A: No, you're not caring so much. Right. And if that, you know, feeling, that shame feeling kind of travels you back again to another kind of one of those leverage points, you know, earlier, younger you, all the way back, what's another moment that comes to mind where there's been that same, kind of like.
[47:59] B: There was now, this is the same time era.
[48:05] A: Yeah.
[48:06] B: So I had a little boy that I always hung out with.
[48:08] A: Yes. Right.
[48:09] B: And I was at his house.
[48:14] A: Yes.
[48:14] B: And so his parents, I don't know, they were watching porn or something, but they had shut the TV off. But when we turned it on, that is what was playing.
[48:23] A: Good job, good detail. Right.
[48:25] B: So then I remember me and him being in his room.
[48:29] A: That's right.
[48:29] B: We were in his closet. And then we're, like, touching each other.
[48:32] A: Of course. Right. Out of curiosity. Right. Given what you saw. Right, Right. And you had different body parts and some of the touching thoughts. Good. Right. But not because you wanted to have sex, because you didn't even know what all that stuff was. Right. And some of it felt good. Not because you were into him, but because the body part touched that way is designed to feel good. So then you came, then you got out of the closet, and then that time is over. And then you're hanging out with your mom. So you're hanging out with your mom. And then you were out of the closet, and then you were touching different body parts, and something felt good. Then you'd gone to the closet. Then you guys had maybe turned off the tv, and then you saw that on the tv and then you turned on the tv and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Then you got over there. Right. And again, as we run through it backwards, compared to forward emotional analyzing.
[49:28] B: Like it wasn't even there.
[49:31] A: You can remember all that happened. Can we stop putting in earrings? Well, then stop doing that. Well, stop him from doing that. So then where is it? Right. And again, as that gets in, what do you notice happening to those feelings? Right. Because the you is realizing. Close your eyes, picture her and let her know. Tell. And it wasn't because she was into him or had nothing to do with wanting to have sex. Had everything to do with, like, experimentation. Mine's different than yours. And then body parts touch in certain ways, are designed to feel good. It might even have been a little ticklish at that time. That's right. That's right. So that she gets it. And that's why kids play doctor. Right. In particular, if they got one that's different than theirs. Right. Because it's curiosity. Right. Not sexual. Right, Right. So that that younger you gets all of that from you. And as she does, what do you notice happened to the younger you?
[50:51] B: She doesn't care.
[50:53] A: She doesn't care. That's right. That's right. She doesn't care. Right. Oh, what's happening now?
[51:15] B: It's hard for me to think of my face when I'm little in that situation. Like, I get it, she doesn't care. But that's just me trying to be extra, I guess, right now.
[51:29] A: Well, she doesn't care, does she?
[51:31] B: No.
[51:31] A: No. Right, right. Because she's not thinking she's bad and wrong anymore. Right. Checking out. Is she, you know, feeling shameful, thinking that she's bad and wrong? No. You got, like, you know, a smart, little curious kid. Right. And I wonder how, you know, other places, curiosity can really serve you well in all the other situations, like being curious about something, you know, wanting to learn and know. You know, like when you're, you know, studying math, kind of being curious. Oh, okay. I wonder how that goes. Right? I wonder how much that will serve you. Well, you know, being curious. Right. And what's happening now?
[52:32] B: Thinking about putting curiosity to my math, actually.
[52:40] A: Right.
[52:42] B: That would be cool.
[52:43] A: Yeah, it will. Right? Right. Because it's easy to daydream when we're not interested in what we're doing. Right. And you might want to take smaller chunks of it instead of a big chunk of math, one might want to shrink it to a smaller chunk, do a shorter piece of it than the big thing all at once. Yeah. Cool. So just check now. You know, font might pop, because, you know, that's.
[53:33] B: Well, I could give you a million thoughts.
[53:35] A: I know. But I want you to just check. How are you feeling about them now? Because remember, Gabby, the issue isn't the content, it's the structure. How are you feeling?
[53:49] B: Like they don't really matter.
[53:51] A: Yeah. Right. And as that happens, they don't show up as often. That's how it works. Right? Like, the less I'm disturbed, the less stuff happens.
[54:05] B: Mm.
[54:10] A: And see, when you change the structure about it, it's not bad feelings. Right? Right. Isn't that, like, there's some sort of statement that says, you know, guys think about sex every, like, 25 seconds.
[54:26] B: Yeah. That sucks.
[54:32] A: Just goes by. Hey, teenage kid. Wind blows oh, Jesus. What the fuck was that? Turned on by wind now. What the hell? The guy's tired. He's a little bit sleepy. And it rubs. What the.
[54:53] B: I'm like, right.
[54:57] A: It must be the wind.
[55:00] B: Yeah.
[55:00] A: Right now. Right. See, now that that's exposed and it got cleared up, you're going to notice a lot of differences with that. Becoming more. Okay. Right. You know, carefree to care less. Right. And then become more curious about the things that you do care about. You know, like getting your ged. Right. That's right. What's happening now?
[55:35] B: Like, how do I feel?
[55:36] A: No, just what's happening. Yeah. What do you notice with you? No.
[55:39] B: Trying to find something else. Because I don't feel, like, shitty about those.
[55:48] A: I know, right? Isn't that cool?
[55:50] B: Yeah.
[55:50] A: Yeah. Which was the construct that was underneath feeling shitty right now. You're not. Right. Isn't that better? Yeah. You did great today. Thanks. You're awesome. You really are. Because, like, you, like, put shit out there, man. You're not, like, high. You're like, fuck, man. This is it. Do something. It's awesome. See, that's really cool. Yeah. That's powerful. Right? Cause you're a big change agent for you. Yeah. Cool. All right, we'll stop with that for now.
[56:26] B: Cool beans.
