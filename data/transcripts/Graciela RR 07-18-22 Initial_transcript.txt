[00:00] A: Okay, so today is the 18th of July, Graciela. This is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful and valuable, that recording may be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:19] B: Yes.
[00:19] A: Okay, cool. So, Menu. Some people, when they come in to see me, what they recognize is that they're a lot more on edge. Meaning they're more easily irritated, agitated, aggravated. They're quick, they're short tempered, they're reactive. They get set off by stuff all the time. They say they do shit that later on they're like, fuck, I wish I hadn't said or done that. They don't want to be so reactive, right? Other people come in and it's the opposite end, right? They're more tense, nervous, anxious, they have uneasiness, they get discomfort. In certain social situations, I. People are always like thinking shit about them or ready to, right? Sometimes it's like they have social anxiety stuff. Sometimes it moves into full fledged panic. Sometimes it affects sleep. They lay down at night trying to sleep, and this thing's fucking overactive. They don't want to be feeling like that. Other people come in and they go, you know, for me, there's shit that I've gone through some of it a long time ago, and I know it's over, but having gone through it, underneath the surface, it still affects me. Not every moment of every minute of every hour of every day, but if I do think about it or if something reminds me of, I'm like that, right? I'd like that to stop. Some people go, well, for me it's like loss. Like there are people that I was really close with that I passed away. I might have been there, I might have seen. And every time I think about that person, I'm just like, still in the. Of all of that. They don't want that to be going on. Some people, it's more. They're down, depressed. They used to have more of a zest or an interest in life. And now they're like having a hard time even getting themselves on a fucking bed to do things that they even used to like to do. Like, what the fuck? Nobody used to like to do that. I'm having a hard time. Like, they don't want to be feeling like that. Some people, it's like relationship stuff. They might have a significant other that they're just not seeing eye to eye. And that's off kilter. Some people it's unwanted or just cravings, desires. So those are the kinds of things that I know how to get better. That being said, I'd be really interested in understanding what it is that we want our time to do for you. Meaning if we could truly change for you problematic ways that you feel, think, act or react. What do we want to get better?
[02:36] B: I'm definitely very, very depressed, very anxious. A lot of self esteem issues, like anxious in social situations. And also like socially paranoid, I guess you can say with like, you know the thing about, you know, like, oh, people are talking about me, whatever that thing goes on. Also not able to say no.
[02:55] A: What does that mean?
[02:56] B: Like just like can't set boundaries very well.
[03:00] A: Like how does that show up?
[03:01] B: Like letting people take advantage of me. So there's, I'm trying to think. What else? There's so much, honestly, I think also like intrusive thoughts that I have and deal with.
[03:22] A: What does that mean?
[03:23] B: Just like unwanted, like trauma, brain thoughts. I don't know how to explain it.
[03:31] A: So intrusive thoughts, meaning you are finding yourself thinking about bad shit that happened.
[03:36] B: Yeah, but like not even some other stimulus. It's just like, do this shitty thing or like this shitty thing's gonna happen to you. And it's like just this repeating thought that just like over and over and.
[03:47] A: Just like if you don't do the thing, then the bad thing's gonna happen.
[03:51] B: No, not even like that. Just like, just like, it's like if you're sitting at the edge of a bridge. This is not what happens to me. This is an example of something similar. Sitting at the bridge and your brain's like, jump. You should just jump. You should just jump off the bridge.
[04:07] A: Not even for a reason.
[04:07] B: Not even like, oh, I'm suicidal. Not even. But it's just like, oh, it's just like compulsions. Like I don't know how to explain it. Or just like, oh, this bad thing's gonna happen to you and you can't avoid it and it's just unavoidable. And then that thought repeats and repeats and repeats.
[04:21] A: Oh, the rumination of the thought. Rumination, yes, that's the word. Right. Like over and over and over again, think the same thought and it's typically a troubling thing that could or might happen. That would be bad if it did. Yes. But that's the thing that keeps coming. Okay, so we'd like that to stop.
[04:36] B: Yeah.
[04:37] A: How has it been in when you said down depressed so like, give me a sense of. The words are broad in terms of how they impact people. So when you say depressed, like, how so?
[04:49] B: I think, like, very. Just like, is anything ever gonna get better? I don't think it will. What's the point anymore?
[04:57] A: Okay. That's the depressed part.
[05:01] B: Yeah.
[05:01] A: Like, I'm kind of in this hopeless state. I don't know how to not feel the way that I've been feeling. And what's the point if that if it's all gonna be the same as it's always been. Fuck. Might as well better not be here kind of thing sometimes.
[05:18] B: And it just got so much worse.
[05:20] A: So it's like, you know, for a.
[05:23] B: Little while I had like, some hope and like a sense of like, connection and spirituality or whatever.
[05:29] A: Okay.
[05:29] B: And then this past shit happened and just like ripped it away from me. It was like the last bit of hope I had.
[05:36] A: Okay. And even just thinking about it, there's all that stuff, okay. So we'd like that to stop. And whatever effect that that shit has had on you cleared and gone. So it doesn't weigh on you. Like it has been. Okay. And that's where you get the unwanted, intrusive, repetitive, ruminating thoughts. But then there's also, well, if it's not gonna get any better than this and it got worse. Fuck, why am I even, like, still here? And now I'm like dragging myself out to go do the next thing. Whatever it is. Does it feel sometimes like there's a heavy weight? I was hearing that out of what you were saying, but not saying, like there seems to be like a really heavy weight. Like it's hard. That much harder to get up and do. Okay. And it's also sounding like whatever it was that more recently happened has still had a real heavy effect on you too. That was kind of like there was earlier shit along the way and. But I did have a little hope and that thing came down and now. Okay. Okay, so I'm following you with that. What have I missed, really trying to.
[07:04] B: Think just that, like, anxiety, rumination, I don't know. Nothing much that I can really think of.
[07:11] A: Say more about anxiety. How does that show up?
[07:15] B: It's just. I know it's not like I've ever, like, physically let it show ever, because I've had it for so long that I just deal with it really well. I mask it very well, but I have really terrible social anxiety.
[07:31] A: So does that mean that you're. When you're interacting with others, like, more self conscious? Okay, so you're Thinking a lot about you and you're concerned about what they might be thinking about, how perceived.
[07:46] B: Yeah.
[07:47] A: Okay. And then with that conversation going on, it's a little bit awkward to actually have a conversation with somebody else. Yeah, right. Like, if I've already got that going on and worry, like, it makes me a little cumbersome or clunky in how I try to interact, which makes that words. Do you get the afterwards kind of wishing I shouldn't have said that thing? Okay. That's when I was checking. Because that's one of those things that's common with people, is that then afterwards, not only do I have the discomfort while I'm in this situation and really thinking lots about me and worrying about what they might be thinking about me afterwards, I'm judging how I did it. And never in, like, wow, that went better than I thought it was. It's always, boom. I should know, right? It's never like, I did really well. No, it's always the negative. I should have been more this way. Or I shouldn't have said that. Or this thing should. Yeah, that kind of thing. Okay. So that's going on also, like, irritability.
[08:48] B: And just, like, general, like, why the fuck I'm. You know, like, it doesn't matter. Those are also just depression symptoms. I'm trying to think is all I can think of right now, honestly.
[09:03] A: Okay. Well, yeah. Has anybody ever explained to you why shit that has happened can continue to haunt us even when it's over? No. Nobody's ever like, really explained it.
[09:20] B: No, I can figure, but I don't think I have, like, a.
[09:23] A: So. But it's weird. So I'll give you what I mean by weird. If I told you about falling out of a tree when I was 8 and I broke my arm. Right. I'm 48 years old now, so that's 40 years ago. If, when I was telling you about it, I started to well up an emotion like it was when it happened, you would look at me like, the fuck is wrong with him? His arm is fine. Why is he all upset? On the flip side, if I told you about what my Uncle Mark did to me when I was 8, when I spent the weekend at his house and I started to get all emotional about it, you'd be like, yeah, of course. Isn't that weird?
[10:05] B: Yeah, that is right.
[10:07] A: We go, physical wound heals emotional wounds. But we have the saying, time heals all of them. Yeah. Not the emotional ones. Why don't the emotional wounds heal? Isn't that weird?
[10:20] B: It is.
[10:23] A: And you would think, let's say at 48, I know what my Uncle Mark did wasn't my fault. Like, I totally know that. And I know that some of what he did may have felt good to me, but not because I wanted it. Not because I'm into him or I'm gay. But that body part, touched in that way, is designed to feel good. Like I can have done the intellectual work to have forgiven him, realizing that he was a damaged individual and that's why he was all fucked up and did fucked up shit, right? Like I could, right? Like, so I could do all of that work, right? I can know why inside do I still battle the shame and the guilt and the anger? You would think once I got it, I would feel different. Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. Because we are not intellectual beings who feel. We are feeling beings with the ability to think and all our feelings become primary. And so the real reason that that long standing emotional wound hasn't healed yet isn't because it can't. It's because when it happened emotionally, the brain short circuited. It caused a glitch, a hiccup. When that hiccup, glitch happened, that part of that moment got frozen. It got disintegrated from the rest of my nervous system. The rest of me moved on. That part never did. So the error is that at that level, that part of my brain doesn't know that negative experience is over.
[12:16] B: So you still.
[12:18] A: I know it. That part of my brain does it. That's why any thought about it, any reminder of it can still trigger it. It's why you might be talking with somebody that you're good friends with and they start telling you about something that was troubling and they're no longer with you. It's as if they're back there in that moment. You're like, hi, I'm nice. They go back there, right? So that's the error that's happening in most of us, is that when it comes to those emotional wounds, it's not that I buried it. Because that's the notion that therapists learn. People repress, they bury, they shove under the carpet, they lock behind closed doors. Our job as the therapist is to provide a warm, nurturing, safe, supportive, kind environment. And then, you know, encourage the person to dig up those painful emotions, right? It's like eating popcorn, watching the horror movie in their car. It's fucking awful. But the idea was we've got to get those bad feelings out of you. What if people don't have bad feelings trapped inside. I mean, after throwing up, I do feel a little bit better. Yeah. Not gonna lie, right? You know, I don't know if that stomach. Oh, yeah, I feel a little. But I can still get re. Triggered by the same shit. It doesn't actually get it gone. So if I work with my therapist and I process through that really painful thing that happened with my. And I understand it more in that moment, I feel a little bit of relief. I go out into the environment. I'm making out with the gal that I'm interested in, you know, we're both wanting to be intimate with each other. She then touches my inner thigh. And I do this still. And I'm going, what the fuck is wrong with me? The girl who I'm into that we both want to be intimate with each other is touching me in a way that should feel good to me. But I got. Yeah, but is there any similarity to Uncle Mark when I was eight? Yeah, it's a fucking hand. It's on my inner thigh. Yeah, but that's dainty female hand. That was grubby man. Sausage. Finger hand. Yeah, but hand is hand. The brain confuses it. So when that stuff is active, the error that happens in our brain is that similar gets read as identical. Right? That's why the soldier dies on the ground when the firework bursts in the air. But he's the guy that lit it. It was a fourth of July party. He knew that other part of his brain, though. Thought it was the mortar, the grenade. You follow me with that? I do. That's the thing. That's why those things continue to loop on us. Our brain emotionally never gets the good news that the moment stopped. Second thing is when it freezes, it tends to freeze it at the worst spot of it. And then the memory is gone. It doesn't, like, take it to finality. And then I went on and did these other things. No, no, freezes at the worst fucking spot, right? I had a guy whose wife died. They'd been married for 42 years. He came in three years after her passing because every time he thought about her, he was in horrific pain. Because every time he thought about it, the moment that was there first was him kissing her pulled forehead as her body was willed to the hearse, right? With that moment there, what is it blocking his access to all the other moments that he had with her through 42 years of marriage? And which is there more of that one moment or all the other ones? He couldn't access the other ones without going through that loss. So that loss then clouded any good time and caused pain. We had to get that unplugged so that his brain could read that moment as data. Data about something that happened versus happening. So the air is when it freezes, that part of the brain reads that experience as always ongoingly happening, not as data about something that happened. That's why I tend to be more sensitive, more vigilant, more reactive. That's why life experiences. Even the faintest scent of a Can set me off. Why am I so sensitive to everything in life? Right. Somebody looked at me a certain hell. I'm like, what the fuck? You know, that kind of stuff. Because my brain has errors, mis fires. It doesn't have the good news that I actually made it through that awful one. I totally know that I made it through the awful one. There's a part of my brain that never got the good news. And of course, that's the part that beats my heart and breathes for me. That's the part that creates all of my preconscious unconscious responses to the world. We have good news to get in. Right? There's not a single one of us that can go through the human experience and have not experienced traumas. I would tell everybody that we all have at least a little bit of post traumatic stress. You can't go through this and have not had shitty things happen. Some people way more than others. Some people in bigger, awfuler ways than others. But there's not a single one of us that goes, yeah, no. Life has been nothing but a dream. Milk and cookies, peaches and cream. It doesn't happen. And it doesn't matter where you grow up and what socioeconomic status you come from. We all have shit that happens along the way. So that's where the major error is. Is that part of my brain doesn't know certain negative things are over, even though I do. And that's why similar gets mapped across to same. Yeah. What was just coming up? You're doing great.
[18:45] B: Another thing I wanted to say that I struggle with.
[18:49] A: I just thought of it. Yeah.
[18:50] B: Was like dissociation.
[18:52] A: Perfect. Which would be great to do if it's on purpose. Right?
[18:58] B: It's terrible.
[18:59] A: Not terrible. When it's on purpose. When I go to a doctor's appointment and they have to do, like the other day I had to have, like, some injections done in my knee. They're gonna spray a little cold spray and then jab the needle in. It's useful to dissociate when I had to have them stick A needle in me. Pull bone marrow out of my pelvis. That's a painful procedure. Nice to not be in my body as it's happening. Right. The problem is when disassociation happens, when it's not on purpose. And then all of a sudden I'm like, fuck, where the hell. That was I.
[19:30] B: Right.
[19:30] A: Yeah, exactly. As I come back, like, shit. That kind of thing. Kind of like a blackout. Like, okay, not good. That kind of thing. It's really rough.
[19:43] B: It makes everything, like, daily just like. I'll clearly lose myself.
[19:49] A: Yeah. And again, think of that. If I was drawing or I'm really into a movie or painting as I'm listening to music or doing, and I lose myself in it and time disappears. Not a problem. Problematic in other ways. Like if it's, again, not intentional or it doesn't have the boundary guidelines around it, that's where it becomes a little bit problematic. And you were saying earlier that I don't see. Set good, firm boundaries. So give me a sense of, like, how that might show up for you.
[20:36] B: Not, like, accepting what I'm worth, like, letting someone physically take advantage of me. Yeah. I don't know what else to really say about it.
[20:47] A: So you might be in a relationship with somebody. No, I'm not.
[20:51] B: Just like, in general. Like, sometimes I go seeking experiences because I don't have, like, anything right now. So it's like, I don't know, like, I'll, like. I don't want to talk about it right now. I just want to unpack a lot.
[21:08] A: Of things today so you don't have to unpack anything. What I would tell you is before you unpack things, it would be useful to have a clear understanding of. Of how come it's continued to impact you and how we're going to get it better. So I don't need to know any of this shit that you've gone through to get that it's had a negative effect. Got it. I actually like people to feel good when they're with me. I don't want them to be there. Got it. That's what was happening. You started thinking about a yucky thing that happened. Yeah. Okay, so be back here because I'm more fun. Got it. My job through this whole thing is to keep you here, right? Yeah. And what I'm getting is sometimes you allow certain things or certain things happen to you that you wouldn't have wanted to have happen. And you've been thinking sometimes that has to do with me not, like, owning my own value or worth. And then I like it makes me feel worse. Okay. That's all we need to know about that. Good. And you want to definitely keep breathing because I don't know if you know this, but when we get upset and we're emotional, we hold our breath. That's the difference really, between anxiety and excitement, fear and being excited. Because, you know, somebody will use the phrase, like my mom says it all the time. It's the weirdest thing. She goes, I'm really anxious to see your girls. Now, I don't think that that means she's like, tense, nervous, worried. She's totally meaning she's excited. Right. So you can use anxious to mean excited. But other people, I'm really anxious, they're not excited. Right. So the difference is we actually hold our breath. That's true. Isn't that weird? I didn't understand now that I thought about it yet. Right. So we want to continue to breathe. Breathing, of course, even having a little bit of intention on it means I've got to be focusing on what's happening, not going back there. That's why we're bringing you back here, because you were going back there, and I like it better here. So you. I might not be the funnest person to be around, but I'm more fun than that. So I want you back here. Got it? And then here's the last little part. Only because you brought that thing up, that is a component that keeps some stuff stuck when we're little children and very, very impressionable, right? So from ages, let's say, zero to six or seven, little children are really naive. They're really impressionable. They believe the people around them telling them things like little kids believe the tooth fairy, unicorns, Santa Claus are all real. Right? We don't be nice, but we don't anymore any of that stuff. Right? So here's the error. When I'm little, I'm lied to by my culture, by my society, by the adults and people in authority around me. And the lie is, first of all, if you're a good boy or if you're a good girl, your life will be good. Good things happen when you're being good. You get praise, hugs, kisses, candy, presents. Right? When I'm being good, good things happen, which is great if for that person, life is always good. Right? But the flip then also has to be true. If good things happen when I'm good, bad must happen because I'm bad, because I did something wrong. It must have been my fault. I should have known better. I shouldn't have Put myself in that situation. So mom and dad divorce. The kid's 6, doesn't really get the whole thing. Now dad's gone, kid's not thinking, oh well, dad left mom, dad left me. Now dad doesn't show up. Kid may know that dad drinks alcohol, but doesn't really know what an alcoholic is. Maybe dad's got drug issues or all sorts of other fucked up shit happening to dad. Kid doesn't go, oh well, my dad's a fuck up. Kid goes, see, if I was more lovable, if I was worth it, my daddy would be here. When dad said at 12 he's gonna take him to Disney and doesn't show, the kid doesn't go, oh, fucking loser dad. He doesn't get to go to the coolest place in the world with me. No. Kid thinks, see, if I mattered more, see, everything goes back to somehow. It must have something to do with me. Women get it worse because, you know, we live in this patriarchal, you know, Christian based world that says, you know, it was Eve's fault. Fucking bitch. She brought the apple and I'm Adam. I can't, you know, Eve waving stuff around. I can't not do what Eve wants. But we literally bring it back. So what do we do with women? She goes out and, you know, some guy, you know, molests her, you know, assaults her. Yeah, but what were you wearing? Did you have any drinks? Oh, okay, yeah, because I wore a pretty dress and I did have, you know, a martini. I guess that means I get to get assaulted. Like what the fuck? Yeah, right, Like, I mean, if you think about it, that's the thing that people spin around all the time. That somehow. Yeah, it must be my fault. It must have something to do with my worth, my lovability. Whether I'm good enough, smart enough, pretty enough, tall enough, I don't wear the right clothes, I'm not in the right environment, I don't have the right friends. Whatever it is, it all gets back to mapping across, to somehow being about me. Does that make sense? A lot of sense, yeah. So that being said, we all have different programs. So think of our brain liking it to a computer that have different programs, right? So if we go on Google and we type in in the search engine, it brings up a bunch of information. There's a. That's all I'm seeing at the surface, but there's a lot of code that's in the background that I don't know, that enables the search engine to take what I wrote and pop up these things. Even if I go to a particular site, there's a whole bunch of code that's enabling the site to show me what I'm actually seeing. So we have to think of it that our brain has a lot of programming and coding in it based on experiences that we've gone through along the way that are automatic. That's why I said disassociation isn't a problem when it's on purpose. It's problematic if it's happening when I'm not choosing it. That's where it becomes an issue. Really not a problem if it's only going on when I decide that kind of thing. Right. So in terms of how do we want things to be for you? Well, one, we want the impact that the stuff that you've gone through has continued to have on you. We want that impact cleared and gone. We want that weight lifted so that you're free from the impact that it's had on you. Got it. Two, we want you to be much more okay and at peace in you. Not that it means any of the shit that happened was okay or even shit that I did that now I regret that I did, is okay. But we still want you to be okay because you being okay now doesn't mean any of that stuff is okay. Makes sense. We want to get it so that when you're interacting with other people or going into a group situation, you're not finding yourself thinking or feeling much about you at all. We'd like that to be quiet and you're more outwardly focused, that you're, like, paying attention and learning about them. Some of that you might learn about how they might be thinking or feeling about you, but it's not doing any of that thing inside. Got it. We want you to be a lot lighter, right? So that we have access to, you know, seeing and being on the way to creating, like, newer, better versions of how I want life to go for me. Yeah. Cool. Well, good. I like that too, because as you are talking to me, my job is in hearing what you're telling me to get a sense of. How has your brain been working in that way? How has it been negatively affecting you and your world? We don't worry about all the ways that it works that serve you. And clearly there has to be lots of ways that your brain works that serves you or you wouldn't be here. You follow me with that? So we don't have to touch any of the things that work really well. We just want to adjust the parts that have been problematic so that Those parts work more in the way that you want it to. Got it. And that's really what I start to think about when somebody comes in to see me. And then I want to give you a different lens to look at stuff through. So before I do that, any questions about what I just illustrated? Kind of like how come it sticks? That part of the brain doesn't know the meaning stick. Stuff that somehow makes me feel worse about me. It must have been my fault. And then, of course, my brain confuses. Similar as saying yes and how many questions. Right. That stuff makes sense to you? Yeah. You're following me. Good. So then the. The other part is, you've also recognized that sometimes you seek or go do things that afterwards you wish you had to get that adjusted. So that's at the forefront. Right. So, like, things become undesirable when what they lead to. I see first. Here's what I mean by that. If you and I are in Tampa and we're at the top of a tall building, they're having, like, some sort of, you know, roof rooftop party. And it is so hot, like, you know, August. It's beating sun. We are both drenched in sweat. There's no breeze. There's no nothing. It's just that sticky heat. And we're both thinking, gosh, it would be really nice to feel a cool breeze. And somebody goes, well, why don't you jump? You'll feel the cool breeze. Then we know that we wouldn't ever jump. Why? Because I don't think we'd be enjoying the breeze. Because we know what the hell's at the bottom. Follow me with that. So when something in what I know is, what it leads to is I see that first, then the action of doing the behavior is undesirable. If I don't. If it doesn't show up until after that. Like, that happens with drugs often. Yeah. Like the person not wanting to do the drug, but they do the drug, and then after they've done the drug, they're feeling bad that they did the drug.
[32:31] B: Yeah.
[32:31] A: It would be better if they had that first because then it would prevent them from doing it in the first place. But it happened, so the timing is off. Right. That happens for people who want to regulate. Like, maybe it's okay for me to go out and have a drink or two, but I don't want to have like three or four. But when I'm out and I'm already doing it, then it leads to. Now I'm regretting that I did because I'm Bloated, I. Whatever. All that other stuff, right. Even if I'm drinking mocktails, right. I'm not actually having, like, the alcohol, Right. But I did too many. But I don't realize that I've done too many until after the fact. We want to get that stuff adjusted so that it's not just running in us. So the lens we look through in life tends to be the lens. And it's not a wrong lens. It just doesn't give us a lot of power that. It's the circumstances, it's the situations, the things that make me feel how I feel, whether it be stuff that I did or stuff that happened to me. Right? So the simple example is the guy's driving down the road, he's got his kid in the backseat, right? They're singing along to, like, you know, silly kid songs. Some guy cuts in front of him right now, he's slamming his brakes, he's swerving. He gets off so he doesn't hit the car and he's flipping pissed. The kid's screaming in the backyard, right? Like. And we go, hey, man, what just made you mad? He goes, that fucking asshole caught in.
[33:54] B: Front of me pissed me off.
[33:56] A: Simple. But that's the lens we tend to look at stuff. When that thing happened, I felt like this. When I did that, it made me feel this way. When that person did this thing, I felt this way. Right. It's the stuff that causes the feelings. Again, that lens is not wrong. It just gives us limited power because we have two choices. Try to change it, work hard to change it. If I can't change it, try to get away from it. I can't always get away from it. Right? That's the issue. There's some stuff I can't change. There's some stuff I can't fully get away from. There's a bunch of shit that's happened. I can't get the bad shit to have not happened. So we got to do something else. That's where I get to come in. My job is all about adjusting how that emotional brain reacts and responds to stuff. So the lens, again, it's going to be silly, is when a lion approaches a zebra, you and I and most everybody else would simply say, the lion is now making the zebra scared. Yeah, I don't disagree with that at all. Right, Right. But if we look at it in another lens, we go, wait, no, isn't it actually when the zebra itself sees senses, feels, smells, thinks lions approaching, isn't it really the zebra's brain? Yeah, not the lion that's now immediately making all of zebra alert, much more motivated and a hell of a lot stronger. We call it scared. It runs away. Yes, the brain of the zebra is doing it to the zebra in response to the lion approaching. But it's the zebra's brain that's doing it. Got it. So from this same lens we could say that there's been ways in which your brain has been working that's been causing you to feel bad. By bad we're meeting that more down, depressed, harder to even have energy. If it's always going to be like this fucking got word right. By bad or meaning the lingering effect of the past. By bad that seeking behavior that later on I wish I hadn't done. By bad or meaning the discomfort in the certain. Your brain might do all of that shit to you in response to stuff, current stuff, past stuff, future stuff. But you've been able to recognize that way of your brain working has been problematic. This is the issue that's on the table for us to get addressed so that it stops doing that to you. Right. We can't get rid of everything that presses the button. Be better if we could just unplug the button so that even if I'm in a situation that gets it pressed, it doesn't do that shit. That's where we're headed. Got it. Does that make sense? Cool. Any questions about that part? So when we look at it from this lens that your brain makes you feel bad. First question. Do you really think it wants you to feel bad? No. Do you think it would want you to feel good? No. I know. Isn't that fucked up?
[36:55] B: Well, it probably wants you to like just be aware and alert. Like in like regards to like close.
[37:01] A: Really really close. Slightly different though. What we've come to discover is that you're a bright guy, I'm a bright guy. But most of our brain emotionally doesn't give a rat's ass how we feel. Not because it's not concerned about our well being. But that's not the purpose of the emotion. The simplistic purpose of the emotion, same for all animals is to motivate it to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. Right. If the fox sees, or the rabbit sees the fox approach, the brain of the rabbit immediately causes all of rabbit to become sk scared. So it runs away. Not because it wanted it to have a bad day. If the squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire, the brain makes it experience pain. Not because it wants the squirrel to hate itself. And Feel like a stupid, dumb moron. And now it's going to be embarrassed because all the other squirrels are going to make fun of it being marred, right? It's more simple. Get the tail out of the plant. So it's crazy for us to even consider sometimes is that all the negative emotions we experience, the hurt, the anger, the sadness, the grief, the guilt, the shame, the resentment, the pain, all being caused by the part of our brain that works like an animal. And the same purpose motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. Where the error comes in is that many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. Which is why we have a tendency to feel shitty about the same things over and over and over again. Really good news. Many of the things that we feel bad about are in time periods that are already finished. Much of the things that we feel bad about are in time periods that are done. So we don't need to solve the problem. We want to update the timing. And the error in the timing is that we as human beings have that other part to our brain, our intellect. And with our intellect, it gives us time. That's why you can know you're sitting here now with me. You can think about something you're going to go do later today, and heck, you can probably remember something you did over the weekend. No other animal can do that. That's not a problem if it's a positive experience or if it's a neutral experience. Because in those two instances, our brain totally gets the difference between the memory of it and it, right? Somebody tells about a trip that they had to Key west, right? They partied on Duval Street. They saw Hemingway's house. They went out deep sea fishing. They took their picture next to the sign that said 90 miles from Cuba. They rode on the tiny moped, right? They tell us all about it. We know when they're telling us that they know the difference between the memory of it and the experience of it. But negative things as we talked about weird, bad, awful, sad, upsetting, scary, horrific, catastrophic, traumatic. Our brain confuses memory, thinking it's it. Guy tells us about being mugged. It happened 12 years ago. We get to the part where the guy has now got the gun pointed against the side of his head, clicking it back. And now his face is white, his voice is choked, his arms are trembling, he's got a tear. But we're nice. We were kindly listening to what the fuck is happening with him. And we all know he's reliving it. But what's really happening is part of his brain is confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience. That's why he's having that emotional reaction. And we can tell it's affecting him when he was talking to us because we saw it all over him. Right? But it was also affecting him even over the weekend when he was playing in the pool with his kids. It was under the surface. Logically, he knows he's safe, he's with us, he survived, he's okay. There's a freaking gun. Problem is that other part never got the good news. So where most therapy because we gotta get it out, we gotta do a reconnaissance mission. We have really good news that a part of the brain never got. Which is certain things are over. I survived it, I'm okay. May not be great, but I'm okay. I'm here. I'm out of that gay. You know what I mean with certain things, Things like I wasn't sure. Like the guy who got separated from his troops in battle when the war ended and his side won, but he doesn't know he's still in the jungle. When we find him, we have actually got good news that the war has ended and he gets to come home. And for that guy, that would be really kick ass good news. Right. So there's aspects of your brain that froze certain moments that doesn't have the good news. We have the opportunity to get good news in to that part. Does that make sense? Yeah. So with that being said and already kind of having a good idea of how we want you to be. Right? Because I noticed even earlier before. Right, but I bet even right now don't do a lot. But I bet right now you can think about any of the stuff that's happened and feel just a smidge of the bad feelings. Right? Doesn't take a long time.
[42:23] B: Yeah, whatever I want.
[42:27] A: See, the good news is you did that on purpose. That wouldn't be a problem if it only happened when you chose to do it. The problem is that your brain has been doing it to you at times that you're not choosing. That's the glitch. That's where the you that I'm seeing, that kind of stuff, this you, she remembers having had all that, but if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't know how to get it. It's like clear, that stuff's gone, that weight's lifted, she's free. The you that I am seeing is much more emotionally present and Much more at peace and much more comfortable in her own skin. So that when she's interacting with others, this thing's quiet. She's not thinking or feeling much about herself at all. Got it. This is where we're headed, right? And with it being really cool and it's okay with you. We're already on the way to it. See, just by considering and conceiving of it is already on the way to it. Right. If I said to you, all right, crosscale, go ahead and get in your.
[43:28] B: Car and start driving right now. I don't have a car.
[43:31] A: Right, right. But like, but even if I said that get in your car and start driving, you're like, okay, and three hours from now, I'm going to tell you where to go. You're like, I'll stop. Oh, wait, I could be three hours in the wrong direction. Right. So we first need to know where we're going. And it's okay. Doing that is already on the way to it. Then what we want to do is we want to put your body into the right states for healing. And see, states are really cool things. They're literally the container that holds how I think, how I feel and how I act. And the state that we want your body in when we're doing healing is a state of rest. It's why colds, flus, surgery, what do we tell people to do? Right, Got it. So we have some really cool, neuroscientifically proven levers that are designed to put the body into a state of rest. The first lever is really cool, but really silly. It's about slightly lowering your jaw. So I don't mean, ah, just a little bit. When you slightly lower your jaw, what that does is it activates a thing called the vagal nerve. Vagal nerve is a nerve that's connected to all of our vital organs and starts to put the body into more parasympathetic response. So you slightly lower your jaw. The second lever is you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth so your jaw is lowered. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. By resting your tongue. What that does is it starts to cause a satiated feeling in the body, beginning to turn down some of the internal dialogue. The third lever is all about how you breathe. So what we'll have you do is you'll begin to breathe in a way that's just a little bit slower on the inhale and a little bit deeper. And then the exhale becomes just a little bit longer than how you automatically breathe. So your jaw is slightly lower, you're resting your tongue, and you now breathe in a way that's right, that's a little bit slower and deeper so that the exhale becomes a little bit longer. And as you're breathing in this slightly slower, deeper, longer way, just check inside. How's your body feeling now? Yeah. Notice how it's feeling a little more relaxed now. The fourth lever is also kind of interesting, and I'm going to explain a couple pieces to this one. So different bands of information exist at different brainwave states. We have multitudes of different brainwave states. So beta brainwaves are what we're in for most waking states. So it's good for this kind of thing. Conversation, communication, social interaction. It's good for focus, concentration, things like arithmetic. Arithmetic, right. But when beta waves get elevated, meaning they run faster at a higher hertz, it's where all of the anxiety, irritation, frustration, angst, upset, worry lives. And what it literally causes in us is it causes a tunneling of our vision. Like it narrows our vision. That makes sense. Have you ever seen a horse race? Yeah.
[47:10] B: Horse blind race.
[47:11] A: Right. They can't put them on this way because the horse is like, what the fuck are those things? They have to go behind the horse. But what does it do? It narrows and they don't see in the periphery. Now they're able to focus on where they're headed. Fine for the horse. Right. But it puts us in those narrows. So then if I'm in a narrow vision and I'm looking at you through here, what can I not see? I can't see my hand over here, can I? I can't see it over here. When do I see it? Not until it's right there. So that's why I have a lot more of that angst up, because I'm in such a tunnel vision. And that's what happens when beta gets elevated to do healing, we want to move your brain waves from beta, lowering it down into alpha waves. Alpha waves are highly correlated with what surfers like to call flow, what athletes might call being in the zone. It's much more of a relaxed but also alert state. So it's not like I'm numbed out. Right. Because you wouldn't want that in sports.
[48:23] B: And I want more of that in my life. More flow.
[48:26] A: Yes.
[48:27] B: So that's really cool.
[48:31] A: Right? So this is what we're engineering. And what enables it is it also enables us to expand awareness. So how the process works is again, you're going to slightly lower your jaw you're going to rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You're going to begin to breathe in a way so that as you breathe in, it's a little slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. And as you breathe out, the exhale becomes a little bit longer than the inhale. And as you continue to breathe in this way, you can look across and you can see me. You can focus in on my nose. As you look at my nose, you'll see my fingers. Now what you do is continuing to breathe, you stay looking at my nose as my fingers move out, so that as my fingers move all the way out, with your peripheral vision, you can see them wiggling. Isn't that interesting? Which means you're opening up to more of the space. Notice that with your side eyes, you can pick up the side windows and door. You can see me, but notice the space beyond me. And even sensing the space behind you, the space that's underneath and the space that's up above. And as you're noticing that's right, more of the space again, check. How's your body feeling now? And the last little lever. And this is a neat lever too, because you may have said or heard other people say before, I'm under a lot of stress. Now, in order for somebody to be underneath stress, where must the stress be? Yeah, over on top. What did we talk about with the depression? It's felt like there's been a wait on me. Got it. So we know that the reversal would be to get out from under it and to rise up above it, having what we call a different metaphor, a bird's eye view, which of course is a view from above, seeing things underneath and below you. But not just a bird that's perched, a bird that's free to soar through the sky, through the space. So we're going to add this lever. So one more time, you slightly lower your jaw. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower, a little bit deeper, so that the exhale becomes a little bit longer. You look across and you see me. You see my nose. You stay looking at my nose. You with your peripheral vision, as your awareness expands, how begin to notice my hands and fingers all the way out here. Which means you're becoming more aware of the space towards the side windows and doors, the space between the space beyond me, the space behind you, underneath the couch, and even up above. And you might even realize that this space goes well beyond the room that Space literally goes all the way out in all directions and that it's unending in all ways. Go ahead for a moment and close your eyes. And now with your eyes closed, you no longer see the objects, but you sense maybe even more of the space. Imagine what it would be like to float up and out of your body, well beyond the ceiling, well beyond the roof, so that you're way, way, way up above, above it all in the sky, having a bird's eye view of being able to see all of it underneath and below you, because you're above and over it, free like the bird to fly through the sky, to move, to glide with big wide turns and curves, arching angles, soaring, flying, gliding, moving all around in all ways, in all directions, free. Bring awareness back down and into your body, reassociating inside you. When you're ready, take a nice slow, deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And again. Those short moments, eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself? Your body copying itself. Yeah, right. And see, your unconscious has been paying attention to all of this. Listening at the same time. That part of your brain is a warehouse of everything you've ever gone through. The good, the bad, the ugly. It knows what moments in life got frozen. That as we bring a moment into the light and unplug the effect it has, it rewires inside, frees up energy to organize towards the future. You we're both collaborating and intending towards. Right? So the real mechanism of how do you unplug anything that has been troubling for somebody is really, really simple. Right. It requires one thing and I'm pretty sure you can do it, and that is have an intention of emotionally being with me here. Now, the reason that you want to intend to be here is that this, what we're doing, is totally what's happening and that shit isn't. Two, we're working on a mutual goal that you and I both are wanting for you and we're interested in getting to in three, I'm hoping I'm at least a little more fun than the worst moment of your life. Yes. Okay, good. So what will happen is that other than conscious part is going to travel back, it's going to narrow and pinpoint, and it'll bring a moment to mind. May not be the worst of the worst, but it's going to bring.
[54:52] B: It has already, I bet.
[54:53] A: Right. So it's right. So again, so how we clear it is you're just gonna tell me facts what happened in a minute or less. It'll go, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, and it's done. The thing that just came to mind happened about how long ago?
[55:10] B: Couple months ago.
[55:11] A: A couple months ago. The feeling tones that come up, are they feelings of hurt, anger, sadness, grief, guilt, shame, regret, remorse.
[55:17] B: A combination dial come regard, remorse and pain.
[55:23] A: So first question, would it be okay to get that gone?
[55:27] B: It's not even. It's kind of like a more general thing.
[55:31] A: Would it be okay to get the remorse and the pain gone? Yeah, that's what my question was. You're doing great, by the way. Right. If you no longer have the remorse of the pain, does that in any way, shape or form mean that what happened was okay? Right, got it. You get to be okay even if what happened wasn't. Make sense? Yeah. So if that happened, you know, a few ish months ago, there have been things that you've done after that moment that were more enjoyable than that moment. Right. What's one thing, anytime from when that ended until heck, just yesterday, that was more enjoyable than that moment.
[56:14] B: Drank bubble tea with my friend.
[56:16] A: Drinking bubble tea, that was way more enjoyable than that. Right, Good. Something else.
[56:23] B: Man, that's hard. I don't know.
[56:24] A: I don't know if it's that hard. Washing your hair probably was more enjoyable than washing my hair. Right. So we don't have to go to the top 10 experiences. So we got washing your hair, we got drinking the bubble tea. One other thing that you've done after that that was more enjoyable.
[56:41] B: See Eli.
[56:42] A: Again. Seeing Eli. Right. So we got seeing Eli, we got have the bubble tea, we've got Washington. All of those moments happen. After that moment, there's a part of your brain that froze the moment that doesn't know anything beyond it. So we have good news to get it right. And the last little thing I'm going to tell you before we clear anything is the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening have been glued together. So the memory is living as if it's the experience. Now, consciously you can understand that. But that emotional part of the brain doesn't get logic. What it does get is patterns of association. Right? And what I mean by that is when we pair a pattern of association, the brain will get it. So, for example, silly one, but you can remember earlier today putting your dress on. You can probably even remember where you were when you did it. But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your dress on? And then I went, graciela, stop putting on your dress. You look at me and go, Exactly. I'm not putting on my dress. Right. Because you clearly know there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you doing it. They're not the same thing. If I said to you, well, stop putting on your shoes, you go, I'm not putting on my shoes. Because again, you can remember doing it, but you know, there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually doing it. If I said in a silly way, well, then stop me from putting on my shirt, you'd look at me and go, you're not putting on your shirt. Yeah. Right. So we want to utilize that as we clear stuff. So as you're intending to be here with me, that thing happened a few months ago. When it happened, you were where? So you're in Miami. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[58:42] B: It was daytime.
[58:42] A: Daytime. And you're where in Miami?
[58:44] B: At my apartment.
[58:45] A: So you're at the apartment. Right. Good. And then what happened? You're like, in the living room, kitchen, dining room.
[58:49] B: I'm in the. I mean, it's not a lot of rooms.
[58:52] A: Right.
[58:52] B: The living room, kitchen room.
[58:53] A: Right. Good. So you're in the living kitchen room. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[58:58] B: It's basically just like a friend. It was the loss of a friend, but it was the last time I saw them.
[59:05] A: So they had come over. Right. And they were there?
[59:08] B: Yeah, well, it was. She was there momentarily.
[59:11] A: She was.
[59:11] B: She just came to pick up some stuff.
[59:13] A: Right, Good. So she came to pick up some stuff. Right. And then what happened next?
[59:16] B: And then she. What else did she do? Came to pick up some stuff. She basically just, like, gave me a look, and, like, we didn't really talk much.
[59:27] A: Right.
[59:27] B: Good job.
[59:28] A: Detailed. So you got the look. Right. And then what happened next?
[59:30] B: She left.
[59:31] A: Then she left. Right. And then what happened?
[59:33] B: And then I was there crying for.
[59:36] A: A while after she left. Because she had left.
[59:39] B: Yeah.
[59:40] A: Right. And then you were crying. And then what happened next?
[59:42] B: I don't remember.
[59:43] A: Right. Because our mind likes to stop the story at the shape. Right. And then what might have happened later? Because it would have. Right. You had bubble tea with friends. Yeah. Right. And you saw Eli.
[59:54] B: Right.
[59:55] A: And you washed your hair.
[59:56] B: Yeah.
[59:56] A: Right. Now, notice even as you were recalling it, there was discomfort. Not because that was a yucky moment, but because your brain was confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience. It was causing the discomfort to try to motivate you to get that moment to stop. Good news. It has.
[60:17] B: That's so cool to understand.
[60:18] A: Finally, the way that that works. Right. Now, here's the last little piece. We never go backwards with memories. When people tell you something, they always go from the beginning of it towards the end of it. They never go from the end of it back to before it ever happened. But when you go backwards with the memory, it literally unplugs it. It takes away the charge. So we go backwards. So we got seeing Eli, we got having bubble tea with friends. We got washing your hair. Right. And then you had been crying, and then she had left. And then she had given you that look. And then she had come over to get something. Right. And then before that, you knew she was coming over. And then before that, you probably got up.
[60:53] B: Yeah.
[60:53] A: But before that, you're doing whatever you're doing right now. As I went backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it?
[61:00] B: Better.
[61:01] A: Right. Isn't that weird? Yeah, it is. Right? Your brain is beginning to read it as data about something that happened versus happening. Third, we use the pattern of association. You can remember her coming over and giving you that look, right? You can remember putting your dress on. Oh, Graciela, stop putting on your dress. I am not putting on my dress. Will stop me from putting on my pants. And you're not putting on your pants. Well, stop her from giving you that look. Say she's not giving you that look. Well, then stop that from happening. Say that's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists, which is what we want to get in. Right. As that starts to get in again, what do you notice happening to the feelings?
[61:40] B: They're so doing.
[61:41] A: I know. Isn't that interesting?
[61:43] B: Yeah.
[61:43] A: Right. Right. Now close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You just after that was over, letting her know that it's over, that that experience no longer exists. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about drinking bubble tea. Let her know about seeing Eli. Let her know about washing her hair. Let her know so that she gets it right. And as the earlier you is getting it, what do you notice happening to her face? Slightly.
[62:09] B: Yeah.
[62:09] A: Notice how she's not stuck. Isn't that interesting? What's happening now?
[62:13] B: Crying.
[62:14] A: Oh, but not of sadness. Check it out. Yeah. Or just check. Think. Is it sadness? Oh, isn't that interesting?
[62:24] B: It's always just melancholy. Like when I figure something out or like get over something.
[62:28] A: I don't know whether that was melancholy.
[62:32] B: I think it's kind of a good. It's a good feeling, but it's also like a strange nostalgia. I guess you could say nostalgia better, but like, it's leaving. I don't know how to explain what I'm feeling.
[62:43] A: Right. You just did it because you noticed that the tears actually wasn't of sadness. The tears were of relief. Relief was that moment used to be running in me and now my brain is reading it as data. I still might not like that it happened. Right? So the key thing for you to know is we're still going to remember stuff that happened. And I still might not like it that it happened, whether it be shit that I did or shit that people did to me. But what you're going to notice is that charge, the thing that used to cause all the emotion that's going to be unplugged. Because what we truly want for you is we want you to have the experience of still having data, because data makes us more wise. Right? It's why in certain Native American traditions, we want to trust the elders because they've got more experiences, they're more wise. Right. We're not good. If my experiences still make me emotional, then I'm less able. So the best example I can give you, and I'll leave you with this thing, is think of like a wolf going out hunting in the woods, right? She steps in a hole and hurts her paw. But now she knows there are holes, and knowing that there are holes, wolf is more aware and avoids stepping in other holes. She's outwardly focused, right? She's not thinking about herself, right? She's not going, idiot, stupid wolf. I should have known better. Should never stop him alone, right? That's not happening to wolf. Hunter goes out hunting, steps in the same hole that wolf did. Hunter's pissed. First at the asshole, put the hole there without a sign. Second, at himself for not paying attention, being a stupid moron. How could he have not seen that? Hunter being preoccupied is also thinking about all the other times that he did. Stupid dumb shit.
[64:51] B: Yeah.
[64:53] A: Being preoccupied in that way, hunter is more likely to step in another hole. Got it? Yeah. So we want. Not that people go through difficult shit to get stronger, but after we fully make it through difficult shit, we are. Can be a side effect. Stronger. Right? The only people that I know that sign up to go through difficult shit and get stronger are Navy seals. But those guys are fucking nuts, right? The rest of us, shit just happens, right? So we want you fully free from the effect so you get all the resources and the power. We want to get it where we're headed as a you. So that when you're interacting with other people, there's a sense of calm and Ease and comfort in you and a freedom in how you speak. Got it. We want that weight that's been on you lifted so that you're directing more of how you want things to go. And if there's little obstacles in the way, you've got way more flexibility in how you maneuver around them. Think about how water runs down a hill. Very rarely, rarely is it in the straight line, but depending on the obstacles, the terrain, it might go around, it might go under, it might go to the side. Right. It does all sorts of different ways. That's where we're headed. Make sense? Yes. Cool. So any questions for me about what we've done so far today? Not for me. No. Okay. Anything that I can clarify or elaborate?
[66:36] B: I don't think so.
[66:38] A: Okay. So what I tend to do is the next time that we get together, we have a chunk of time. So like a two and a half, three hour chunk of time all at once. The reason we do that is it's much more useful when we're clearing stuff up to be task versus time oriented. Right. So most therapy is time they, you know, meet with the person for 50 minutes on a weekly basis. They do it for weeks, months, and years. And progress is slow. We're thinking more like what somebody goes in if they had an issue with their knee, the doctor is going to take MRIs and X rays to find out what's wrong with the knee. Once the doctor knows what's wrong with the knee, the doctor knows about how long it's going to take to get it better. And then the doctor schedules a chunk of time to actually do the procedure. So when the person leaves, it's done. The doctor does it in the middle. Go. Okay. We'll connect the next 10 to next Tuesday. So when we're looking at this stuff, we want to have the whole thing and we want to clear things in a way that's light and easy with you having the intention of being here with me because I'm more fun. Got it. Cool. All right, so any other questions for me? Okay, we will stop with that for now. You can come with me. We'll.
