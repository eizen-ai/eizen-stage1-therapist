[00:00] A: Let's see. Today is the 25th, 25th of August, and Graciela, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. Given what we do is useful, valuable and transformative, that recording may be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes. Cool. Okay, so then the frame just to kind of review a little bit of it. We normally look at life through lens. That. That thing made me feel this way. That stuff makes me feel like this. Those things that happen make this go on in me. That stuff causes feelings. That lens isn't wrong. It just isn't very powerful. Two choices. Change it, avoid it. Which is how we deal with most of the troubling stuff in life, right? But some stuff I can't change. Some stuff I can't completely get away from. A lot of shit I can't get to have not happened. We gotta do something else. Where I'm coming in is we're gonna adjust the way that the automatic, preconscious, emotional part of your brain reacts and responds to stuff past, current, future. I gave you the silly lens of lion and zebra that people go, lion makes zebra scared. We go, duh, of course. But then we look at it from the other lens, we go, wait, no, it's actually when the zebra itself sees or senses or feels or smells or thinks that lion's coming, it's really zebra's brain not lying. So in that lens, we're gonna say that there's been ways in which your brain has been working that causes you to feel bad. By bad, we're meaning those memories that create that. By bad, we're meaning the angst and disruption dysregulation when I'm in certain social situations. By bad, we're meaning this negative pattern that I keep fighting myself and picking up. Right? Your brain might do all of that to you in response to something stuff, but you recognize that way of your brain working has been problematic. This is the issue that's on the table. Got it? So that's where once we know that that's the problem, then we start thinking about how do we want you to be? Because I bet right now you can think about any of the troubling stuff that's happened recent or long time ago and feel just a little bit of the bad feelings. Notice it doesn't even take a long time, but you can do it on purpose. Not a problem if it only happens when you do it on purpose.
[02:20] B: What happens when you trouble goes, right.
[02:21] A: The problem is that your brain does it to you. Not uncontrollably, your brain errors, misfires, it does it to you at times that you're not choosing. That's the glitch, right? So the you that I'm seeing when we're done, that kind of feeling, that kind of stuff, this you, she remembers having had it, but if you asked her to get it, she would not. Again, it's like cleared, it's gone, right? So that you could tell her about or ask the future you about something she went through that normally would have emotion. She can tell you in detail about what happened while being present here. No reaction. Got it. This is the you that we're headed towards. Got it. The you that I'm seeing, as I said, is much more outwardly focused. So that she's not spending time thinking or feeling about herself, that literally she's learning about others and others feelings and maybe others feelings about her, which could be her look or what she said or something she's done. And then again, based on who it is, the you that I'm seeing has flexibility in how she responds. Because sometimes based on who it is, she may have done something that hurt their feelings and she didn't want to. So that you I'm seeing has that ease in, you know, being compassionate, caring, understanding, nurturing, support. At other times it was real, like clear. So she's real firm and direct. At other times the shit just goes by and she's on her way to neck because it's got no stick to it. Got it. This is the you that I'm seeing. Makes sense.
[03:58] B: Makes sense.
[03:59] A: And again, you don't have to see this you just like I do. Because the question isn't how it's going to happen. The question is, would it be okay, Right? The you that I'm seeing is also doing things that for her make sense. So both in the moment that she's doing it, she's feeling really good and after she's done it, she's glad that she did. Got it. This is where we're headed. Make sense. And again, all of this is going on and with it being okay with you, your brain is already organized. That's the coolest part about our brain. Once we're clear and we have a clear intention on where we're headed, it already starts to organize. We're going to do processes that increase your body's and brain's responsiveness towards the future you. Because that's what we want to do. We want it to be more and more responsive so that it naturally your brain works in the way that you would be wanting it to. Right. So then we have really cool processes that we utilize that also put the body into more states of rest. That's where the process goes. When somebody slightly lowers their jaw, just slightly lowering their jaw, begins to activate their vagal nerve in a more parasympathetic way. When you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, that starts to turn down our internal dialogue and begin to satiate the body. When now you begin to breathe in a way that's just a little bit slower. That's right. And a little bit deeper on the inhale, so that when you exhale, it becomes just a little bit longer. Doing this process starts to put the body more and more into the states of rest. Because as you're doing it now, are you noticed feeling more tense or more calm? That's right. Then we do the process of moving from the highly elevated beta into alpha waves. Alpha waves are more like flow states. They're about being in the zone. They're alert but relaxed. And they're correlated with expanding awareness. So how it works is you slightly lower your jaw and you rest your tongue and you breathe in this way that's slower and deeper. You look across and you see me. You see my nose, but you see my fingers. Now stay looking just at my nose. And as my fingers move out, notice that your awareness can expand to your peripheral vision. And even as you're looking at me, you can see my fingers wiggling with the sides of your eyes. What that means is you're becoming more aware of this space in this room. And see, there's space between us and there's space behind me. There's also space behind you and underneath, and there's space up above. But again, as you're starting to connect to more of the space, how's your body feeling now? Yeah, isn't that cool? And so, as your body's more relaxed, I want you to think. Think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something that's just beautiful. So the moment you're looking at it, you're like, wow, what is it that you see?
[07:26] B: Sunrise on this big strip of plain in Gainesville, Connecticut.
[07:32] A: Yeah. Right. So there was a moment that as you're seeing the sunrise against the plane that you were feeling, feeling like a sense of peace, all wonder, excitement. And people would probably suggest to you, well, duh, being there and experience that is going to give you those feelings. But if we looked at it from that other lens. We could also say that being there and experiencing it simply drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because at your center, you always peaceful and excited. Kinda in the same way, if we're out at the campfire and my hands are cold and I bring them down towards the flames and I say, holy cow, Graciela, the fire is getting a lot hotter. And you would look at me and go, no, the fire is not getting any hotter. You're becoming more aware of the heat because your hands are getting closer to the flame, right? So we know that in your life experiences there have been other times where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. The stressors, the upsets, the angst, the guilt, the shames, the pains, the worries, etc. Right? But no matter where awareness has been, always at your center. You're peaceful and excited. Just like, you know, two of us are in here. How do you know? You look around, your senses bringing data. Your intellect organizes data. That's knowledge. People refer to knowledge as light. We'll call it light of knowledge. At your center, there's a brighter light. It's light of wisdom. So now we've got light of knowledge, we've got light of wisdom. And I work with all sorts of people who have gone through all sorts of stuff, right? I worked with this one gal one time, and, you know, she had a lot of yucky crap happening to her. And like, one of the things, when she was little, like five, six, her older stepbrother used to take Matchbox cars, drive them up her leg and park them. So you can imagine just all the weirdness with that. But we cleared it all out. Like, all the pain, the anger, the shame, like, all gone. And I asked her the question. I said, you know, all of that discomfort, that dysregulation, I go, where was it? And she looks at me and she's got the most peaceful and glowing smile on her face. And she goes, it's gone. I don't feel any of it anymore. I go, I know, isn't that cool? She's like, yeah. And I said to her, I go, but my question was, where was it? And as the tube started thinking, I go, was it at the surface level? And she's like, no, man, it wasn't intellectual. I said, oh, maybe it was hiding at your center. And she's like, dude, really? How could that kind of stuff survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited? And so I asked her the question. I go, well, then, where was it? She thought for a moment. She goes, huh? Well, it was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I said, what happened? She says, the lights have joined, shadows are gone. I said, whoa, isn't that cool? And she said, yeah. And then we started talking about how people tend to over identify as their body. That people tend to walk around thinking that I am my body, my body is me. But I said to her, though, my mom, when she was 19, lost the tip of her finger in a snow conversion accident, right? But when she goes to visit people now, they don't say to her, hey, Susie, I'm glad almost all of you could come over. They don't say that to her. Why? Because she's all there, even if that body part is missing. So we started talking that there's no single cell within her body that's the same as it was what happened with her stepbrother. There's no cell that's the same. Every cell has been replaced millions of times. Her feet alone were longer than they were when they were 2, 3, 4, 5. Yet despite the changes, you're still you. She goes, whoa. I go, well, now here's something weird, because if you're not your body, what if you're not also your thoughts? And she goes, well, what do you mean? I go, well, what if you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? She's like, what? I go, yeah, what if your brain is the thinker of your thoughts? She goes, okay. And I go, what if you have have a brain? Your brain is in you, kind of like you have a heart and you have lungs and you have a liver. They're all yours. None of them are you. And I'm like. She's like, okay, so I'm not my thoughts. I go, right? And then I said to her, I go, what about your feelings? And she goes, but I feel different ways at different times, so I can't possibly be a feeling. That's right. Then we're like, well, what about what you do? And she goes, well, jeez, there's a lot of things that I've done over time. And when I stopped doing one of those things to do a different one, I didn't stop existing. And I went, right. So then we had to ask the really weird question, because if you're not what you do, and if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not your feelings, and if you're not your body, what the heck are you? Right? And so we started thinking, and she's like, oh, well, maybe who I Am is what I became aware of. And for her, it was seeing a deer at the rise of the sun off in the distance in the dew on the grass. She said, what if who I am at the center is light, peace, excitement? What if it's my life experiences that slam that makes me not always feel it, but what if at the center, I am that peace, that light, that excitement? Like what you became aware of as you see the sunrise across that plane, right? And as she started thinking about that, I go, well, that's right, because when you were little, right, I told her about this story of me going to the dentist. She's like, okay, I don't really like the dentist. Even though I've got a lot of friends that are dentists, I don't really like the dentist, right? But I'm there, you know? I go, you'll never believe what he did. And she's like, what did he do? I go, well, he put my head down. She's like, okay, but you're in the dental chair, and you're at the dentist, right? And then, you know, he shines a light in my eye. I'm blinded. I can't really see very well. She's like, yeah, that's what they do. You're at the dentist. And I go, well, then he shoved this cold instrument right up inside of me. And she's like, holy. And you're what? I go, yeah, my mouth. I'm at the dentist, right? And then I go, but wait a minute. That's the same thing that we could say about your brother when you were little, that stepbrother. I go, when you were little, he really messed with your stuff. And she looked at me and she goes, whoa, that's right. He did. He messed with my stuff. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and my feelings. And then she went, but you know what? He never actually touched me. He messed with my body, but he never got who I really am. That light at the center, he never touched me. And I went, whoa, that's pretty powerful. So again, go ahead and slightly lower your jaw, resting your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, breathing in this way that's a little bit slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. So that as you breathe in this slightly slower and deeper way, awareness begins to expand out. You notice more of this space to the sides. You can simply close your eyes. With eyes closed, you might notice more of the space because you no longer see the objects. You can also realize the space goes beyond the this room all the way out in all directions, that the space is unending. Imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body so that you rise way up above the ceiling in the rooftop. You're all the way up in the sky above it all free like a bird, to fly freely, soar and glide and move around in all directions, in all ways. Soaring, gliding, moving, flying. More and more is underway as you rest. Which means the next time you rest with eyes closed, it'll be even easier to sink in deeper towards delight at your center, that calm and peaceful flowing energy. Begin now to find your way back down and into your body to reassociate. When you're ready, you'll take a nice deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And again. Those short moments eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself? A lot calmer. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. And I'm gonna show you something that's kind of weird. Are you ready for it? So I want you to take your hand and kind of hold it out like that. That hand's fine. I want you to just look at that spot right there. Now, as you look at that spot, come a little bit closer, and I'm gonna bring my hand towards your hand. And you'll notice that as you look at that spot, you can see with your peripheral vision my hand moving closer. But you'll begin to notice something, that as my hand gets closer, you're beginning to feel the energy that's right between my hand and your hand. Isn't that interesting that you can feel the energy? So without me touching your body, you can sense and feel it, Right? Which means right now I'm coming closer to touching who you really are. That's right. Than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings. Because who you are, Graciela, can only be touched with respect. That's right. That's right. With your full intention to collaborate towards this mutual goal, you might start noticing small movements within the fingers, twitches, jumps, chirps. You might. That's right. Notice your eyes blinking and closing and maybe even wanting. That's right. To stay closed so they rest. And then when I tap the back of that hand, that hand will drop down and you'll also drop down inside towards that combination. Now drop down, down, down, down, down, down, deeper down inside towards this calm and peaceful and easy flowing energy, the light that is you at your center. That's right. That's right. All of these processes are formatting brain for more healing, rewiring, renewing, and restoring. That's right. When you're ready. Once again, taking your time. Slowly find your way back. Up and up. Take a deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And again those shoulder. What were you noticing within yourself?
[20:14] B: A huge sense of calm. Sinking into myself.
[20:18] A: That's right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. And see, we have the opportunity to free up all sorts of energy. So anytime we've gone through a troubling moment that got stuck at a deeper level, energy is being consumed to ongoingly deal with it. As we bring those moments into the light, the collaboration, the intention we have and unplug the effect they've had, all the energy that was being used to deal with it gets released to be recycled for renewative restorative healing. So we know that we go through troubling moments. They freeze and short circuit in the brain. Part of my brain, not my logical part, not the part that I think of as I, but part of the other aspect doesn't know it's over. Right. Add to that because when I was little I was trained to believe that the good things happen because I am good identity. Therefore all bad things happen because there's something wrong with me. That message gets installed along with a negative experience that makes me feel worse. And because they're still active, my emotional brain is highly vigilant and super sensitive. Looking for anything that could be a reminder of that. Looking for anything that was similar to that. But setting off. But what it does is it also causes a blind spot. So therefore, even though I know certain things, I've got a blind spot that I can't see the danger right in front of me. Because all of that stuff is in the way. Makes sense. That's why I find myself desiring people that then do physical harm and feeling like I somewhat deserve it. Got it. And it's okay to be in sex play where there's physicality. If it's intentional on purpose and I'm choosing it, that's a whole thing that goes on. But it's all about intentional on purpose and I'm choosing it. Got it. Where that hasn't always been the case with some of the things that have been underway for what has happened with you. Got it. So we want to get it so that your brain, once the moments are unplugged and the meaning is adjusted so that what I know, I feel, then my brain stops confusing using similar as same. I will experience more distance in kind of an up above lens so that I see it clearly and I'M able to move my course better. Got it. So one last time, slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue. Breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper. That's right. Allowing awareness to drift down deeper inside. That's right. You can sense more of the space towards the sides of the room and beyond. The space between you and me and behind me, the space underneath you and behind you, the space up above. How the space is unending in all directions. That's right. And again, as all of this is happening, how's your body feeling now? It is. And with your body feeling relaxed, we're going to ask that unconscious part of your brain to travel back down that timeline in your own personal history of negative experiences. Recent one, long time ago, Big ones, small ones, one time, occurrences, multiple of a combination. It's going to begin to scan and sort and group. And then it's going to narrow and pinpoint and bring an experience to your awareness that would be useful for us to unplug and clear. So again, as we're organizing towards this future you, that other then conscious part is traveling back. It's sorting, scanning, grouping, and we'll narrow, pinpoint, and bring a moment to mind. Right. What particular experience comes comes to mind?
[25:22] B: Supposed to be an isolated moment.
[25:24] A: It can't be like a general. So the general would be that it happened more than once. Right. So how we clear something is we want to think of a time that it happened. And then your brain will generalize. Right. Kind of like how we learn how to tie a pair of sneakers. It's typically on one pair. And then once we get it, it goes on to all other pairs. Right. Same kind of scenario. Brain does. Great. So a particular moment that comes to mind happened about how long ago or you might have been out?
[26:06] B: I'm thinking about when my ex girlfriend unpacked all of my things when I.
[26:11] A: Was leaving her house and she thought.
[26:12] B: Everything all over the place.
[26:14] A: Right.
[26:15] B: And that was when I was 18.
[26:18] A: Yeah. Good. So as you're thinking about it now, what's the feeling tones that are coming up? Is it hurt? Sadness? Anger.
[26:28] B: Anger and fear.
[26:30] A: Anger and fear. Good. So would it be okay to get the anger and the fear gone? Yes. And if the anger and the fear is gone, does it in any way, shape or form mean what she did was okay? Got it. You get to be okay even though that wasn't. Third part though is there are things that you've done after that moment that were more enjoyable than when she was doing that. What's one Thing. Anytime from when that happened until yesterday, that was for you, a more enjoyable moment than that moment.
[27:03] B: Ice cream with my friend?
[27:05] A: Yeah. Getting ice cream with your friend in Dunedin, that was way more fun than that. Good. Something else. Have you ever gone to Casatina in Dunedin? No. Oh, my goodness. If you like Mexican, there's a restaurant called Casatina. I used to go. We used to live up there. And that would be like our go to place to go. Okay, so we got getting ice cream and then eating something else.
[27:35] B: Going to Rainbow Springs.
[27:37] A: Yeah, going to Rainbow Springs. Right. And one other thing.
[27:42] B: Making new plants and putting them in my bag of plan Acres.
[27:46] A: Making new what?
[27:47] B: Potting new plants.
[27:48] A: Oh, plants. I thought you were saying making new plants. I'm like potting new plants. All of those moments happen after that. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond that. So we have good news to get in. Right. So when that moment happened, you're about 18 when it happened. You're where?
[28:06] B: I was in my old house.
[28:08] A: So you're in the old house. Right. And you're like in the living room or the kitchen or the dining room.
[28:12] B: Kind of a one room thing.
[28:13] A: Yeah. So you're like in that room. Right, Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[28:17] B: She walked in when she got home from work.
[28:19] A: Right. So she walked in. Right.
[28:21] B: Packing my things up to try.
[28:23] A: She saw you packing stuff up. Right. And she was like, what the. Right, good. And then what happened next?
[28:27] B: She starts screaming at me.
[28:29] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened?
[28:30] B: She threw like a bunch of objects at me, like glass.
[28:33] A: Right. So she threw stuff. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[28:36] B: She took my bag and she dumped it everywhere and she was like screaming at me.
[28:39] A: Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[28:41] B: I repacked everything.
[28:42] A: Right, Good. And then what happened?
[28:43] B: I was able to finally get out of the house.
[28:46] A: Right, so you grabbed your stuff and got out of the house. Right. Good. In the morning, got in my friend's mom's car and got in your friend's mom's car. And then you left. And then that moment ended. Right. And then later on you did something more fun like have ice cream and then eat. Right. Or plant those pot or. Yeah, repot the plants. Repot the plants. I got that. I'll get there. Right. And again, as you're noticing going through it, right. There was a little discomfort, but less because you were intending to be here. When we go backwards, it'll begin to unplug and take away the charge. Right. So we Got potting the plants, Right. We got eating the ice cream. Right. And then there was another one that you did. Oh, Rainbow River. Right, right, right. And then before that, you would go on to wherever you were going, and then you got in your friend's mom's house car, Right? And then you'd grab your stuff, and then you'd repack your stuff. And then she had thrown your stuff all out, and then she was throwing shit at you, and then she was screaming and yelling, and then she had come in. And then before that, you were packing. Right. And as we go backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it? I know. Isn't that easy?
[29:59] B: Yeah.
[29:59] A: Crazy, right? You can remember her doing that, but you can also remember put putting your pants on. And if I said, you remember getting dressed, putting your pants on, and I went, graciela, stop putting on your pants. Right. You would say that, but you'd also say, I'm not putting them on. Because, you know, there's a difference between your memory of doing it and you actually doing it. Right. Where it's been stuck is the memory is being read as the experience. We want that shit. So you can remember her doing that. Screaming, yelling, throwing the stuff, dumping your clothes out. You can remember putting your pants on, right? Graciela, stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting in my pants. Say that. Well, then stop putting on your glasses. Say, I'm not putting on my glasses. Well, then stop her from screaming and yelling at you. Say she's not screaming and yelling at you. Well, stop her from dumping out all your stuff. Say, she's not doing that. She's not dumping out my stuff. Well, then stop that from happening. Go. It's not happening.
[30:51] B: It's not happening.
[30:52] A: Right. Where does it say, it doesn't exist? It doesn't exist. Do I have a message memory of it? Sure. But is the memory of it the experience? No, because that experience no longer exists. Got it. Now we want to have you close your eyes. Picture that earlier you letting her know, of course, the moment's over, that experience no longer exists. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about eating ice cream and going to Rainbow river and repotting those plants. Right? Let her know that that gal doing that had everything to do with whatever was going on with her. It's not about me. It wasn't about me. It was about her. So that the earlier you starts to get it. And as this happens, what do you notice happening to the earlier you? Right. Notice how she's not looking so troubled and you, you can open your minds. Right. Isn't that a good news thing? Right. Because what's starting to happen is we still have data, but it's rewiring how the data is being coded in my brain. Yeah, right. Because as you think about that moment now, what do you notice? Yeah, it doesn't do any of the stuff. Right. Isn't that cool? So again, we're organizing twice towards this future you. Right. And as we do, the other than conscious part travels back. Excuse me, all the way back to another moment that would be useful to clear.
[32:28] B: I think when I first met my traveler.
[32:31] A: Yeah, right. That happened when?
[32:34] B: That happened earlier, I think last year. This. Earlier this year.
[32:41] A: Earlier this year. Right. Like summertime or. No, would have been winter time. It would have been fall. Spring.
[32:50] B: Yeah, spring. Like kind of winter and spring time.
[32:53] A: Yeah. Right. And though what happened? So when that thing happened, you're where?
[33:00] B: I'm in one of his girls houses.
[33:03] A: She at one of the girl's house houses. And like you had gotten there by like seeing her and Uber and he.
[33:08] B: Had like found me on a website online, basically.
[33:10] A: So he had found you on a website because you had like posted whatever you posted. Right. He found you, he said, come on over. You took the Uber, you went over. You're in one of those houses. Right. Good. Then what happened next? It was daytime or nighttime?
[33:21] B: It's daytime.
[33:22] A: Daytime. Right.
[33:23] B: We just talked for a little bit.
[33:25] A: So you talked to the girl or. So you talked to him. Right, Right. And he's like saying, okay, this is what we can do and how. And.
[33:34] B: He was like, oh, let me try you out or whatever.
[33:36] A: Right, good. Right. And then he said, let me try you out. Right. Then what happened?
[33:40] B: Then we had sex.
[33:41] A: So then he like, your clothes came off, he put his penis in your vagina, he had sex with your body. And then what happened next? He stopped talking a little bit. Yeah, he stopped and then that was over. Then you probably put clothes back on. Right. Then what happened next?
[33:57] B: We continued talking.
[33:58] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right. Then what happened?
[34:01] B: And then I left.
[34:03] A: And then you left. Right. And then that particular moment was over. Right. And then later on you did something more fun like get ice cream with a friend. Yes. Or go to the Rainbow river or repot the plants. Right. So we got repotting the plants, we got going to Rainbow river, we got having ice cream with a friend. Right. And then you left and then you were talking and then you had your clothes back on and then he had stopped and then he had sex with Your body. And then he said, let me try it out. And then you guys were talking and then you'd gone over there, and then you'd gotten in the Uber. And then before that he had contacted you. Then before that you posted whatever you posted. Right. And as we go backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it? Easy. Right. Isn't that interesting? Right? You can remember that happening. You can remember him doing that. You remember him saying, well, let me try out. You can remember all that going on. You can remember putting your pants on.
[34:48] B: Right?
[34:48] A: Right. Prasiella, stop putting on your pants. Well then stop him from doing that.
[34:53] B: He's not doing that.
[34:54] A: Well then you stop going over there.
[34:55] B: I didn't go over there.
[34:56] A: No, I'm not going. Right. Good job. Right. There we go. Good job. Right. Well then stop putting in your earrings.
[35:01] B: I'm not putting on my earrings.
[35:02] A: Well then stop that from happening.
[35:03] B: It's not happening.
[35:04] A: Yeah. Where is it? Say it doesn't exist. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. And again, as that starts to get in, what do you notice happening with the feelings dissipated. Right. Right. Because what's going on is data is now being read as data about something that happened versus where it's been stuck as happening. Make sense? Yeah. And again, as you're checking inside, what do you notice? Right. And even when you were telling me about it, normally there's more. Right. And notice how as you're intending to be here. So there's a guy long time ago who wrote the yoga sutras. So this is like thousands of years ago. Right. And his name was Patanjali. But he has something that's really cool. He. He said, when you hold two opposing views or two opposing things at the same time, the higher order will always emerge. So as you're intending and collaborating with me in being present, what starts to happen to earlier other things is the higher order emerges that that can't be happening. Your brain never makes you feel bad about something that's over because it wants you to feel bad. The error is that it doesn't know the thing is over and it's causing you to feel bad and try to motivate you to get it to stop. That's the crazy part about our brain. Like, who would have thought that that's what's going on? But with all lingering emotional distress, that's what happens. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And again, as you're checking in, what do you notice happening now? How's your body feeling? A lot more relaxed. It is. Right. And again, we're Going to have that other than conscious part travel back and another experience will be brought to your awareness.
[37:32] B: I'm just having trouble remembering a lot.
[37:35] A: Of things today for some reason. I'm not sure that's true.
[37:39] B: Yeah, I just didn't want to bring them up.
[37:44] A: You.
[37:46] B: I never remember.
[37:48] A: Well, they're there. And see, here's what's starting to happen. Right. What is your brain beginning to do? Well, it's taking ones first that are a little less severe, meaning that didn't already have as much emotional disturbance attached to them. Right. So if I bring something up that's got some emotional dist. Disturbance, but not like the. The brain does that to start to get the ball rolling. Right. To start the process happening so that as it clears this one, now the brain going, oh, wait a minute. What we're doing is working and I'm feeling different. Okay. Now I'm going to bring this next one out. Oh. What we're doing is changing so that what starts to happen is we want. When we get to one that was difficult, harder, had more emotion, that it's even easier for your body to stay in a calm and neutral state and for you to be present here with me. Right. There's nothing that somebody tells me that shocks me. Right. So I remember working with a guy one time. He was a. He was probably the most Ultraman man that I'd ever met. He was an army Ranger. He was like twice the size of me. He was incredibly brilliant. But he told me he had gone to a therapist one time and he started telling her about the war atrocities that he had experienced. And she started crying, which is not going to be very helpful for him in getting better. Right. So the thing for you to know is we're in this thing together. My job is to keep you present with me. Right. I'm paying attention to what's going on over there. If I notice you going back, I'm gonna do everything I can to get you back here with me because I'm not interested in you re experiencing or reliving bad moments. Right. We definitely want to bring them into the light so that we can unplug them. But it's a lot easier. Easier when we're here and doing it. Got it? Yeah. Good. That happened when? When I was.
[40:33] B: 12.
[40:34] A: 12, right. So the thing happened when you were 12. When it happened, you're where I was.
[40:40] B: I was outside.
[40:41] A: So you're outside, right? Like outside, like in your neighborhood outside? Yes. You're outside in the neighborhood. Good. And daytime or nighttime? Daytime. Right. And you're, like, out on the street or. I was. Parker.
[40:52] B: Basically, I was from my house, and then I walked over to a park. And I was at the park.
[40:56] A: Right, so you'd walked over to the park. Right. And then you're at the park, like, on a bench or, like, on a swing or.
[41:00] B: I was. Well, I walked from my house with this guy.
[41:04] A: Yeah, Right. So this guy had come over to the house.
[41:06] B: Yes.
[41:07] A: Right. And then he's like, let's go to the park. And so then we went to the park. Pray. Good. Then what happened next?
[41:12] B: And then he basically he, like, tapped me.
[41:17] A: Right, so you walked to the park, and then, like, he threw you under the ground.
[41:20] B: Yeah.
[41:20] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next? And that was weird and scary.
[41:23] B: Yeah, he assaulted me.
[41:24] A: Right, so, like, he hit you?
[41:26] B: He had.
[41:26] A: He had sex? Well, he, like, beat me. Right, so he hit you. Right. And then he pulled your pants down. Right. And then he probably put his penis maybe in your mouth, maybe in your vagina, maybe in your butt. Right. He would have done all that, Right. As he was, like, holding you down. Different things. You might have fought a little bit. You might have just stopped after you realized that if I fight, I get hurt more. Right. How you doing right now? Notice how you're being here with me. Right?
[41:56] B: Just trying to, like, do the breathing thing in the mouth thing. Sometimes I get distracted.
[42:00] A: So do I. Tomorrow. Right. So then what happened next? So he's doing that. You're being hit. He's did the stuff with your body. Right. And then what happened?
[42:14] B: And then I kind of, like, passed.
[42:15] A: Out at a point. All right, good job. Good detail. Right, and then what happened?
[42:18] B: And then I woke up and he was gone.
[42:20] A: You woke up and he was gone. Right. And then what happened next? Which was better, Right, Right. And then what happened? And then you walked home, Right. And maybe went inside, maybe took a shower. Right. And then that moment was over. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like repop plants. Right. Or eat ice cream. Right. Or go to the rainbow River. Right, Right. And again, you notice some of the discomfort less because you're intending to be here. Got it. So now we want to go backwards, right? So we go backwards. We've got rainbow. We got eating ice cream. Right. And then we've got repotting plants. Right. Then you're back home. Right. Then you'd walked home, and then you had woken up. And then before that, he had left, and then you had passed out. Right. And then he had done all that stuff to your Body punched it, slapped it, hit it, pulled it, put penis in different spots, right? Then he had thrown into the ground, right? And then you guys would go into the park and he's like, hey, let's go to the park. Right? And then you were at home, right? And then before that, he came over at some point before that, you're doing whatever you're doing, right? And as we go backwards again, compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[43:34] B: It was easy.
[43:35] A: That was like nothing, right? You can remember it happening in him doing that. You can remember it happening to your body. You can remember putting on your, you know, sandals, flip flops, you know, stuff slides. You can remember doing it. And then stop putting them on. Say, I'm not putting them on. Well, then stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that. Right. Where is it? Say it no longer exists. Right. Next little component that you back then would have felt that happening had something to do with me. Right? But let's check back then. Did that you have any indication or did she know that by going to the park with him, that's what was gonna happen? Right. Got it. Like, if we look at it from here and we could float back along the timeline to prior to that ever happening and that you back then had known that if I go to the park, that's what's gonna go on, would you have gone to the park? Got it. So what we know is that earlier you didn't know that she didn't have access to that information that wasn't even on the screen of something that was possible. Make sense? So therefore, him doing that, did that have anything to do with you? No. Had everything to do with whatever was off with him. But again, back then, that earlier you felt like it meant something to do with me. Right. And what if. What if some of that was going on? Some of it felt good, right? Because sometimes different body parts touched in different ways are designed to feel good. Right? And we know that there is a very thin line that shifts from when pain is pleasure and where pleasure is pain. Right? We know that. I mean, you've got lots of tats. I've got some tads. There's a component of getting a tattoo that is painful. There's a component of getting a tattoo that's pleasure, and there's a very thin line. You follow me with that, right? At 12, you didn't know any of that stuff. Again, it would have thin thought if body responded somehow that means something. Like, I had a woman one time, and, you know, she was telling the Guy, no, I don't want this. And he said to her, you're telling me no, but your body's telling me yes. Which really screwed her up for a period of time because she's like, how could my body respond when what was happening was wrong and I didn't want it right? That would be really confusing until we get to the part where we go, well, wait a minute. That's what a body parts designed to do. So if it's touched in a certain way, whether the person wants it or not, that's what it does make sense. Like if I'm ticklish and somebody tickles me in the spot that I'm ticklish, I can't not be ticklish there. I can try my darndest to not, but got it. So we want to get all of this information in. So go ahead and close your eyes. Picture that younger 12 year old you letting her know that that moment's over, finished, completed, defeated. It no longer exists. Let her know that that happened and nothing to do with you. Everything to do with what was off with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Let her know that you, you get she didn't know. So that she's realizing that you're more okay with what she did because, you know, she just didn't know, right now. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about going and getting ice cream. Let her know about repotting those plants. Let her know about going to the Rainbow river, right? So that she gets it. And as she's getting it, what do you notice happens to the earlier you? She is, she's feeling better, she feels a lot more sooth. That's right, that's right. And you can open your eyes, notice how she's feeling a lot more soon. She's not so troubled and not feeling so bad. And see, the cool part is, as we start getting things adjusted and it starts to shift the camera lens outward, I begin to read other people's stuff as being about them, not me. Second part to it, we know that. Well, I can tell you my experience, there's not been a single person, male or female, that I've worked with who has been trafficked that didn't have some form of early childhood sexual violence or abuse, right? So then we go, well, if somebody has that, that doesn't mean that everybody who's been sexually abused gets trafficked, Right? But that's a common thread, so to speak. And what makes somebody more susceptible to it happening later again in an ongoing way because it's not uncommon at all for somebody to have had one thing to then add another and then another and then another. Right. Where this other person never had it and they didn't have any. Like how does that work? Right. So one of the things that we know about predators is predators are attracted to quote unquote, weaknesses, not strength. Right. A lion who's mighty and king of jungle doesn't go after the big giraffe, the largest elephant, the biggest of the gazelles to prove how mighty and strong lion is. Lion goes after the weak, lion goes after the ones that get defend themselves as well. So for example, if I'm in the water and I've got a large cut and it's bleeding in the water, the sharks are picking up the blood and I'm going to become more desirable because I've got an open wound, got it. Versus somebody who's in the water who doesn't have a wound at all. They probably are avoiding that. Make sense. So what makes somebody more susceptible is that if those wounds are still open and they're emotional so they aren't open. Like I've got a cut that's open, right. Because I can see the cut open and somebody could pour salt on my wound and that would hurt. Right. But it's what I call a hidden, somewhat invisible because I don't see see it. But somebody who is predatorial has the lens on that they see it in the same way. We could say somebody who's an addict, goes to a brand new city that they know nobody and within an hour or two they found drugs. Well, how do they do that? Person who doesn't have any access and never used drugs, they're not going to find them. Why? Because that person can sniff it out, smell it out, know where to go, know who, what to look for. Right. Because there's all sorts of indications or indicators that somebody looks for that. Somebody who's never had that experience won't even see make sense. It's one of those things that flips reality for people. In the same way that I went from not knowing how to ride a bicycle to now knowing, I can't go back to the world of not knowing. Right. So it's that kind of thing. So with those wounds open, I'm more susceptible to predatorial behavior. What we're in the process of doing is healing those wounds. Right. So I'm no longer appealing to that kind of guy. Make sense? Yes. That's what we're interested in. Getting shifted. Right. What are you noticing Happening in you again. How's your body feeling?
[52:11] B: Relaxed.
[52:13] A: Yeah. Isn't that kind of interesting? And even though we dealt with something that was trouble, your body's relaxed, which is normally unusual for your body to be relaxed when you think about something that was troubling. You follow me with that? Right. Like the experience of body being relaxed after talking about something that was troubling is a kind of unusual experience. Right. This is what's starting to happen because changes are underway. Right, Right. And again, you can slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue. Breathe in this way. That's a little bit slower. Rest with your eyes closed. Eyes closed, they rest. When they rest, you rest aware of my voice in the background sounds and how it feels to be seated in the way you are noticing it all. All at the same time. At the same time, your unconscious is responding to you. Responding by healing, rewiring, reorganizing and restructuring. That's right. So that even more is happening because there's what you consciously know, and then there's everything else that's going on that's not conscious. Like when planting seeds in the soil. You plant them, you cover them, you water them. Something starts to happen immediately, but you don't see it right away because it's happening under the surface. The seedlings are beginning to grow out roots. Right. Lots happen with those seedlings before you ever see the results. That's right. Which is also what's happening now because there's what you're consciously already noticing. But then there's so much more going on at the deeper level. That's right. So that when you're ready once again, you can take your time finding your way back up. That's right. And up and up. Take a deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Right. And what's happening now. Yeah, right. And I should. More calm that other than conscious part will travel back into deeper, maybe even more troubling moments. And again, as it scans and sorts, it'll select a particular moment for us to clear what's coming to mind.
[55:09] B: Now, there's a lot about, like this part of the abuse that I don't remember because my brain really hasn't talked it out.
[55:15] A: Yeah.
[55:16] B: But I can kind of.
[55:18] A: All right, so here's the cool part about that. And I don't know if you've ever heard this before, but there's a thing that our brain does when it fully gets that whatever is going to happen is inevitable. And there's nothing that I can do to stop or prevent It. So how it works in the animal kingdom. Think of a rabbit running for its life from the fox. And the rabbit is far enough away that the fox hasn't caught it. But the rabbit is having the realization that its energy is getting depleted, it's getting tired, it's not seeing any exit roots. It's not going to make it right. And when the rabbit, all the rabbit realizes that its death is inevitable, there will be a moment that that rabbit will stop. The body of the rabbit will be completely still, and it'll be moments before predator fox ever pounces. In the moment that the body of the rabbit is completely still, life force of rabbit exits. That's why the body still makes sense. So what I know about people who have had multiple occurrences, they may remember a first moment of it. They may remember an ending moment of it. They don't remember any of it in between, and they don't remember any of it in between, not because they can't remember, but because they were taken away so they didn't have to be there for what was going on to their body. Got it. So that may be a similar thing that's going on with you. I had a woman one time who was in a torture situation where a guy was coming with the hot embers from his cigar ready to burn her face. And she felt the cigar getting close. You could feel the warmth of the ambers. And then boom, was gone. And she didn't wake up till after all of it was over. I would say wake up. She didn't come back into her body until all of it was over. And there was something she could do because she heard people out the door behind. Come on, we can get you out of here. Back in my body. Follow me to that. Yeah. So that particular moment that's like coming to mind that you have bits and pieces of that happened when I don't.
[58:09] B: Know how young I was until I was 11.
[58:11] A: Yeah. So it happened multiple times and with similar people. Same people, same person, same. Okay. Step grandfather. So let's think of a time, maybe first time, what have you, doesn't matter when. But what is it that might have happened, could have happened, did happen.
[58:29] B: Sorry. I was playing with my dollhouse.
[58:32] A: Right. So you were like at your house, playing with the doll house or at his house, your grandma's house, and you're playing with the dollhouse. Right. And that was fun. Right. Then what happened?
[58:40] B: He pick me up and brought me.
[58:42] A: Into the computer room. So he brought you over into the computer room. Right. Good. Right. Then what Happened next? He put me on his lap in.
[58:48] B: Front of the computer.
[58:49] A: Right? So he put you on his lap in front of the computer. Right. Good. Then what happened? How you doing right now?
[58:53] B: Like, touching makeup.
[58:54] A: Okay. Yeah. Right. So he started touching your body in different parts. Some of it might have felt good, some of it was weird. Right. And then what happened next?
[59:01] B: And he.
[59:05] A: It's all fuzzy, right? Yeah. And you can make it up. See, that's the coolest part. See, the neat thing about this, Graciela, is it's not so much about content, it's about context, meaning how it got coded.
[59:19] B: Right.
[59:20] A: So if you make it up, it'll be structurally similar enough for the brain to unplug it.
[59:26] B: I'm going to combine two events.
[59:28] A: Yeah. Beautiful. Right?
[59:29] B: So it put me in the dog cage, right?
[59:33] A: So then, like, the dog cage was in the office where the computer was. So he put you in the dog cage. Right. And then what happened next? And so grossly hate talking about things, but be here. Hi. I'm not gross. Neither are you. Neither is being here. This is not a gross place. Right. Even though that was. Right. So we want you here. So he had you in the dog cage, Right? And then what happened next?
[59:53] B: He put cat poop in the bowl.
[59:57] A: Right? So he put cat poop in the bowl. And that was weird.
[59:59] B: He told me to eat it.
[60:00] A: And he said, you need to eat this, right? You're like. But then you might have eaten it. Right? And then what happened next? And then my mom got back home, right?
[60:10] B: So he let me out of the dog cave.
[60:12] A: So he let you out of the ca. Into the dollhouse room, Right. And put you in the dollhouse room. Right. And then mom came in. Right. And then that moment ended. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, right? Like eat ice cream. Way better than cat. That's right. Right. What flavor did you get?
[60:28] B: I got strawberry.
[60:29] A: Oh, yummy. So you ate strawberry ice cream, right? You went on the Rainbow river and you repotted those plants, right? So we got repotting the plants and going in the Rainbow River. We got eating ice cream. Strawberry ice cream, right? And then mom had gotten you, and then you were back in the dollhouse room, and then he put you back there. And then mom was getting home, right? And then he had you in the cage. He had put the cat food there. Then he had you eat it. And then before that, he had put you in the cage. Right? And then before that, he may have had you on his lap, and he may have brought you into that Computer room. And then he may have come and got you from the where you were playing. And then before that, mom had probably dropped you off. She had to go to work. And then before that, you were back at home. And again, as we go backwards compared to forward and emotionally, how was it? It was his hair, right? You can remember him doing that, right? You can remember getting the spider, right? We'll stop getting the spider tattoo.
[61:24] B: I'm not getting the spider tattoo.
[61:25] A: Well, then stop him from doing that. He's doing that. Well, then you stop eating that poop. Say, I'm not eating the poop. Well, stop him from putting it there. Say he's not putting it there. We'll stop him from putting me in the cage. Say he's not putting me in the cage. We'll stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that.
[61:38] B: He's not doing that.
[61:38] A: Right. So then where does it say it no longer exists? Right. Him doing that, did that have anything to do with you? No. Right. Had everything to do with what was off with him, which is a lot. Right. Because does that even show up as a thing to do to a kid for you? No, no, no. Like, hey, you know, by the way, there's a small little cage, like, I get it if, like, a little kid likes the dog, and we kind of go in the cage. It's just kind of. But, like, putting somebody in there and like. Right, got it. Notice how that doesn't show up as a thing for you to do? Right, Right. So as we're getting it again, close your eyes. Picture that earlier. You let her know that that moment's over, that it no longer exists, that it had nothing to do with yam. Everything to do with what was off with him. So that she gets it. Let her know that he's not well. Right. And that she didn't need him to be well in order for you to turn out. Okay. They'll get ice cream and then eat and go up to the Rainbow River. Right. And again, as this is getting in, what do you notice happening to that earlier? Younger.
[63:02] B: You feel empathic.
[63:04] A: Yeah, Right. What do you notice happening to the gross feeling now? It's subsiding. Right. Because was there anything that you did that was gross? No, it was all stuff that was forced upon you. Makes sense, right? One time, my daughter, like, the oldest daughter, when she was like a baby, like, she woke up in the morning and she had pooped her pants. And then she had started playing with it. So she smeared it on herself. Smeared it on the Crib. That was gross. Yeah. Kids are just. But, you know, it's like, okay, let's get you quickly in the tubby. Yeah. And then I got the joy of cleaning all that stuff up, because my wife's like, I got you in there with that. Awesome. Yeah. So I'll go ahead and take that on for us. Thank you very much. Right. What are you noticing now?
[64:13] B: I feel better.
[64:14] A: Yeah. Like, that.
[64:17] B: Definitely still, like, some, like, anxiety for some reason.
[64:22] A: Yeah.
[64:22] B: It's not like.
[64:23] A: So notice that you're feeling it. And what happens if you were to take the feeling tone and have the feeling tone guide you back? What's another moment that comes to mind which may have to do with him or not?
[64:41] B: I remember packing up.
[64:44] A: It's hard.
[64:45] B: Cause I can't define moments about it. It's so hard. Cause all of it's so blurry.
[64:49] A: Yeah. So cool that it's blurry. Cause we don't need to see it clearly to know that it's over. Got it. Yes. Right. And you can make up with liberal interpretation what could have or might have happened. Because all we want to get to is this structure. See, the error is that the coding of that information, whether it's blurry or not, has been coded as happening. We want it coded as something that happened. Got it. So what? Something that could have might have happened. I have. That's been blurry.
[65:36] B: I have one from when I'm a little older. I was. I was 12, and my friend in eating disorder rehab had a seizure.
[65:48] A: Yeah.
[65:49] B: She died.
[65:50] A: Yeah.
[65:51] B: At the eating disorder rehab.
[65:52] A: Yeah. Good job. Good detail. So she had gone. You had known her. You knew that she had the eating thing. She'd gone to this place to get help.
[66:00] B: Oh, I also had eating, so I was there with her.
[66:03] A: You were at the actual place. Oh, got it. So you saw her seize and die. Oh, right in front of you. Yes. Okay. Yeah.
[66:12] B: And so she. We're walking down the hallway.
[66:16] A: Yes.
[66:18] B: And she felt like she just fell and started seizing.
[66:22] A: Right. Good job. And you're like, what is this? Laughing a little. Right.
[66:25] B: Oh. And I was like, oh, no. So then I got the hallway to get a nurse.
[66:29] A: Right. Good job. Good detail.
[66:30] B: And the nurses came.
[66:31] A: Yes.
[66:32] B: To get her. And the girl told me to go down the hall into the other room.
[66:36] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right.
[66:37] B: And then basically that ended. And I saw her getting taken away.
[66:41] A: Yes.
[66:42] B: On a stretcher.
[66:43] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[66:45] B: And then that whole situation was over. A week later, they told me she was dead.
[66:49] A: Right. So when they told you you were where?
[66:52] B: I was in the eating disorder rehab in, like, the back room.
[66:56] A: Back room. So they kind of brought you in and they wanted to. Hey, by the way, so. And so died. Yes. Right. And then what happened?
[67:02] B: And then. And then it was over.
[67:07] A: That moment was over. Right, right. And then later on, you did something more enjoyable. Right, right. Like eat ice cream. Right. So do you have any thoughts about what happens when people die that give you any kind of, like, you know, relief?
[67:20] B: Yeah, I think she just went back into the kind of the universal energy. Her spirit kind of got breathed.
[67:27] A: Yeah. I have a really interesting similar way to describe, Right. So if we took a glass of ice and put it outside, right?
[67:38] B: Oh, the matter has changed its forms.
[67:40] A: Yeah. And we're doing a science experiment with this kid. So we put the glass of ice outside. An hour goes by, kid comes back and goes, somebody stole the ice, replace it with water. We go, no, it transformed from solid to liquid. The molecule H2O, totally the same how we pick it up, totally changed. Kid goes, okay, yeah, I can see it. Get it. We leave the glass of water out. Week goes by, kid comes back, somebody drank it. Somebody stole the water. What happened? Where'd the water go? We're like, well, right? The water didn't disappear. It didn't get stolen. It evaporated. What does evaporation mean? It went from liquid state to gas state. But the molecule of H2O, totally identically the same. How we pick it up, completely different. And the kid's looking really confused and says to us, but I don't see it. How can I feel? Oh, right. Well, you're in Florida. It's all around you. And we put them in the desert in Arizona. You don't feel any of it here, do you? And we bring him back to Florida and we say, huh? It's all around. We show them the rain clouds, we capture the water, we put it in the freezer. It's all the same thing. So what if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop because they weren't their body. They. The first place, their body just stopped working. And when their body stopped working, they exited it. We don't pick them up in the same way we used to, but it doesn't mean that they're not here. Right. Einstein, who was really smart, we know that he's really smart because everybody after him who's really smart is called an Einstein. So the dude had to be brilliant, right? And he said two very important things who we are as energies, Energy plus matter equals the tangible three dimensional physical existence. And then what became the second law of thermal dynamics? Energy cannot be destroyed. Energy transforms. So when the body stops working, it's not that they stop working, it's the body stops. We don't pick them up in the same way, but it doesn't mean that they're not here. Right. Which is what we want to get in. Because back then that earlier you didn't have all the information you do now was not so clear on the kind of goes back into the collective unconscious. Right. Like you have that belief now. Right. She didn't know that. Plus there's that moment. And every time we have a moment, those moments tend to freeze. And when a moment's frozen in its grief, that moment actually blocks access to other moments of being with the person that I had other than that moment. Right. It becomes. And then if I think about the person, I have to go through that moment in order to get to any of the other memories. That's why grief tends to. To be frozen. Like I worked with a guy, she'd been married for 42 years. His wife died, alas, progressive decline. But every time he thought about her, the moment that was there was him kissing her cold forehead as the body was being milled to the hearse. Right. With that moment, what was it blocking all of the access to all of the moments. 42 years worth of moments. It's a lot and a lot more than that one moment. Right, got it. So we want to get that all integrated. So again, you can remember that happening, her falling down the ground, thinking it was a joke and then realizing it wasn't going and getting support and then being told later that she had done. You can remember all that happening. You can remember putting on your shirt. Yeah, Graciela, stop putting on your shirt. Stop me from putting on my shirt. We'll stop her from seizing.
[71:29] B: She's not seasoned.
[71:29] A: We'll stop them from telling you she died.
[71:31] B: She didn't. She's.
[71:32] A: They're not telling me.
[71:33] B: Not telling me.
[71:34] A: Right. So then where is that moment? Say it doesn't exist. Right. Now close your eyes and let that earlier, you know what you know now that when her body stopped working, it doesn't mean that she stopped working. Her body stopped. Let her know that that gal's been doing much better with all of this than you have for a while. Right. But that earlier you know that you're okay. Right. So that she gets it. And as she's getting it, what do you notice? Happening to the earlier you.
[72:07] B: She feels better.
[72:09] A: She's right, Right. Yeah. Which is a really good news thing. Yeah. And you can open your eyes. Right. And again, as you're checking in your body, what are you noticing now?
[72:22] B: More comfortable, more able to be here.
[72:27] A: Right. Yeah. Which is really what we're interested in. See, you're noticing what's happening is it's becoming easier to be here. Which another way to say it is to be present. When we got a lot of gunk. We're either back there or future casting out there. Not having a lot of time just being here. Make sense. So as we begin to clear up a lot of the past there, it stops being thrown out in the future. And it makes it easier for me to be now here. Right. Which is totally wrong. Wanting. That's right. Yeah. Right. And your body, what do you notice now?
[73:23] B: I feel less tense, I bet.
[73:25] A: Right. What do you notice happening? That stuff on the chest.
[73:27] B: Lighter.
[73:28] A: Not. Yeah, yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. Any other stuff transpiring that went down with what happened with Guy who is trafficker? Any other kind of. Because I know one of the things that you mentioned the last time that we were here and even when you did, there was a little bit of emotion there is that sometimes. And I don't know why I'm finding myself getting with people that hurt me. Right. So I want to kind of get a little bit of more of an understanding. Understanding of what you mean and what's been going on with that.
[74:10] B: I think it's more like emotional abuse.
[74:12] A: Yeah.
[74:12] B: Or I'll find myself with people who are not, like, mentally healthy. So they'll take out their mental dysregulation on me.
[74:21] A: Yeah.
[74:23] B: Which I think that's the big thing.
[74:25] A: Yeah. So how do you know when to pick somebody to be with that's gonna do that?
[74:34] B: Looking for red flags definitely is my big thing now.
[74:40] A: Looking for as many red flags as you can have in one relationship. Well, not like it's a good thing.
[74:45] B: But, like, you know, just thinking about, you know, how that person acts and what could be, like, warning signs that they're not gonna act well in the.
[74:56] A: Future, you know, Curious question. Have you ever had the thought? Because my take on it, for all gals, the question is never do I get to be with the other person? Like, it's never, do I get to be with a guy? Do I get to be with the gal? It's never that question. Like, the question is more, am I gonna allow them to hang out with me? So I wonder what would start to happen if your filter was determining whether this is somebody that makes sense for me to allow to hang out with me. Because in the world of worlds, women don't need men, women don't need another woman. Right. I tell people all the time, and it's heterosexual world. I go, a woman needs a man about as much as a fish needs a bicycle. Yeah. Which is not at all. Heck, the penis wasn't even designed for her pleasure. It was designed to make a baby. She's got a body part that sole purpose is sexual pleasure. Right? Right. So. So a woman doesn't need a man. A woman doesn't need a man to earn a living. Woman doesn't need a man to get a house or have a job or drive a car. Or a woman doesn't need a man. On the flip side, a woman doesn't need another woman. Same kind of thing, Right. So the question always starts to be, well, I'm not a damsel in distress. I don't need somebody to rescue me. But it does feel good when somebody does caretaking. Right. Not that I need them to take care of me. I can take care of myself. But it feels good when somebody's doing caretakers. Does that make sense? So we want to begin to adjust the lens, I call it the picker, so that I'm finding myself both attracted to and attracting people who are more. Well, that we're more of a good match. Make sense? So when you think about, you know, somebody, whether it be that gal that you dated when you were 18 who was screaming, yelling, you were getting the hell out of there, or something else where somebody's been more, not necessarily as much physically or sexually, but has been more verbally. What are some of the things that might happen, have been said or could happen or could be said that normally caused that thing in you?
[77:39] B: I don't know.
[77:40] A: There's so many things. There's so many things. So all we just need to do is think of one thing. If there's so many, we got a lot to pick from.
[77:55] B: But I'm just like, I'm so tired today that it's so hard for me to, like, see.
[78:01] A: I don't know whether that's true. I got that you're tired today, but I don't know whether it's hard. See, you don't do this process every day. Yeah, right. So how the hell are you supposed to know how it's going? Right. When you really think about aggressive, this is not what you do. If I was Doing whatever it is that you do. I wouldn't know how we're doing it either. Right. So you can't possibly know. You can know where we are, you can know what we've done, you can have an idea of where we're headed, but you can't know, am I in the right spot? Is this actually natural and normal based on how this process goes versus, Gosh, I'm really having a hard time thinking of oh, as if that's somehow abnormal. No. People tend to want to bring up the worst moments of their life to talk about them. Because that's fucking fun, you know? I mean, at least I'm trying to make it a little more fun.
[79:00] B: Yes, that's true.
[79:02] A: Because I always look at it that when you go through troubling moments, it's heavy, it's drudgery, it's difficult, it's weighted. Then the opposite is to begin to bring lightness and levity and humor. And that way it's not weighing on me so much. That's the kind of thing we want to do. We want to get this shifted so that you're becoming more okay in you. Right. And more okay with that. The good, the bad, the ugly. Right? Because there are times that you've probably reacted in ways that later on you wish you hadn't. And there are other times that you didn't react in ways that later on you wish you had. So we all have shit, and we all act in ways that aren't always optimal. Ideal. It's part of the human condition. Got it. And the experiences that we go through on purpose or not literally cause change in the physical structures of how our brain is organized. And the neat part about that is the brain is plastic. That's what neuroplasticity means. The brain has the ability to rewire. Yeah. And this is what's going on. Brain is beginning to rewire. So now we're rewiring by. We've already unplugged different moments, Right? And we've got a scatter view of different moments, which is great, because what the brain starts to do is it takes what it's learned and starts to generalize out two things that are similar. Having more than one enables it to generalize better. Right. If I said to you apple, or better yet, orange, because that's an easier one to do. You don't know really whether I was the thinking about orange the fruit or orange the color. And still until I start saying apple, banana, grapes, then, you know, I was talking about the fruit versus orange. Red, blue, green. Then you'd know I'm thinking about the color. Do I have to name every fruit? Do I have to name every color? Before you go and get it, Follow me with that. So same kind of thing. So again, you can go ahead and close your eyes slightly, lower your jaw and rest your tongue. Maybe relax the back of your tongue as you breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper. Drifting down and inside towards delight at your center. What you become aware of as you see the sun rise against that plane. When you were in Gainesville. That's right. That what begins to happen is awareness is drifting down and in towards delight at your center. That calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy. Right. The light at the center is you. That light can't be touched, hurt or harmed. Is already a whole complete and totally indestructible. And I say that because people screw up identity all the time. They say things like, I'm depressed, I'm anxious, I'm shy. Thinking the way they feel is who they are. You're becoming more connected to who you really are. Beginning to lighten up. Right. And what's happening now? How's your body feeling?
[83:26] B: Cold.
[83:28] A: It's cold. Uh huh. Do you want a blanket?
[83:31] B: Oh yeah, that would be so cool.
[83:33] A: I have a blanket. I know I have a blanket. Oh my God. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Absolutely. It's always better to be comfortable than not. Yes. Yeah.
[83:54] B: Definitely. More soothed and feel more clear.
[83:59] A: Yeah. Right, Right. So as you're thinking about some of the things that transpired or the relationships that you've gotten in, where the people have been more emotionally, verbally. Right. As you think about that, is there some form forms of like my fault, self blame? Definitely. Okay, so as you think about those moments, what's a time where you had like, you know, I should have known better, shouldn't have put myself in that situation that.
[84:36] B: Well, there's one time I was going to actually mention that I can think about, but it was Ms.
[84:40] A: Fault. Is that okay? No, that. That's not okay. Can't process so good. I love it. How fun is that? No, no, we're not doing any of that.
[84:53] B: No processing today.
[84:57] A: So you were about how old when this?
[84:59] B: I was? I was 20.
[85:01] A: 20. Right.
[85:02] B: And I met this guy at a park one day.
[85:04] A: Yeah. So parks are really good for you. You should definitely go to parks.
[85:07] B: I love parks, but not for meeting random people. Definitely not.
[85:10] A: Not to go with people when I'm 12 either. Like Parker Gray, just not with people.
[85:15] B: I know. And he. I'm trying to think about how to.
[85:23] A: Like, what the course of events was.
[85:24] B: So I got his phone number.
[85:26] A: Right.
[85:26] B: And we went to, like, we talked for a couple days.
[85:30] A: Yeah, Right.
[85:30] B: Went to like a hotel and he got alcohol first, and then we went to the hotel. Turns out he had blow too.
[85:39] A: Right.
[85:39] B: So I did a line of the blow and I thought we were just gonna, like, party and hang out.
[85:43] A: Yeah. Good job. Good detail. Right.
[85:45] B: And he. I drank like two shots and he was suspicious that I felt as drunk as I did.
[85:52] A: Right. Yeah.
[85:53] B: So he had refeed me and he.
[85:57] A: So you're kind of like, out of it.
[85:59] B: I'm out of it.
[85:59] A: Right.
[86:00] B: And he pushed me down in the bed.
[86:02] A: Right.
[86:02] B: And he started assaulting me.
[86:04] A: Right, so. Hitting you?
[86:05] B: No, he started having sex with me.
[86:07] A: So he put his penis in your vagina? That's not really having sex with you?
[86:10] B: Yeah. Oh, he. Whatever. He did that.
[86:13] A: Right. So I just put it. He put his penis in your vagina or put his penis in different body parts. Right, right. Because that's not having sex. Because sex is something that you're deciding to do with. That's true. There wasn't a decision on that one. That was something that was being forced into me. Right, right. Got it. Right.
[86:33] B: And then after that, I kind of. I just left my body and I.
[86:38] A: Woke up in the morning.
[86:41] B: And it was all over and.
[86:45] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[86:45] B: Then I went back to my. The woman's shelter.
[86:47] A: Right. So you woke up in the morning. Was he still there?
[86:51] B: He was still there.
[86:52] A: Yeah. Was still there.
[86:53] B: He drove me back to the woman's.
[86:54] A: Right. Then you got up and went to the woman's shelter. Right. And then that was over. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun like repot those plants. Yes. Right. Or go on the Rainbow river, which isn't really rainbow color. I really thought it was going to. I took my kids. They were so excited to go to the Rainbow River. And we got there and they're like, dad, this isn't rainbow ish at all. My God. Yeah, right. Sorry. Yeah, the Peace river isn't very peaceful. I mean, like, it's not rainbowish here. No. Right. They really thought that they were going and it was going to be like the rainbow color. Oh, that's so cute. Right? Yeah. Like horrible. Dad. I probably should have educated them that it's not going to look like a rainbow. Because then they're like, this isn't what we want. I can see that. Listen, there's a long drive that we had to go to get here. Okay. So you do better enjoy it while you're here. So as you were going through that, what did you notice?
[87:56] B: My heart started beating a little faster.
[87:57] A: It did. It started beating a little bit faster. But it wasn't even that you were fully there. Right? Right. Because you were here. So even though your heart beat it a little bit faster, it wasn't all of the this stuff. Right. So now we want to get it fully unplugged. So that's why we know that we went to the Rainbow river and had ice cream. Strawberry, Right. And we repotted those plants. Right. But then before that I'd gotten dropped off and then he had dropped me off. And then he was driving me there. And then we had left the hotel room and then I'd woken up and then I was gone. And then he did all that different stuff to my body. And then he pushed me on the bed. And then I had had those couple shots and then I did the line of blow and then we gone to that room. And then before that we had chatted a few different times. And before that I met him at a park. Right. Then before that I was off doing whatever I was doing. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward emotionally. Right. And again that you back then, if she had known that it was going to lead to what he did, which she have gone there. No. Right, got it. But you didn't know that then. Last little piece that happening. There's not a single aspect of your body today now that's the same as it was when that happened. All aspects have been replaced. Right. So as we get in, we want to be realized that he messed with my body, but he never got me. Right. So close your eyes. Picture that earlier you let her know, of course that that's over. Finish that it no longer exists. Let her know that you know, she just didn't know. So that she gets it. You're more okay. Right. Let her know that that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was was off with him. So that she gets it. Let her know that he messed with her stuff. But he never touched who you really are. Right. Because who you are can only be touched with respect or love. Right. So that she gets it. And again, as this is getting in, what do you notice happening to the earlier you?
[90:23] B: She feels more at peace.
[90:26] A: Right. And how's your body feeling now?
[90:29] B: More relaxed.
[90:30] A: That's right. And you can open your eyes. So I went to a training one time and it was a Training on what happens with violence. And somebody said if somebody's raped, this is what happens to their soul. It's damaged. And they go, no matter how much you try to heal wrinkles, right. They don't ever do the same. And I started thinking, well, that's a shitty way to view it, right? What if we view it more from the lens that that person maybe messed with their stuff, but didn't actually touch who they really are because they weren't their body in the first place. It didn't get their soul essence, light. Who they are messed with their stuff because even if it's an orb of light, I can move my hand right through it. Do I touch it? No. Right. The light that is. You can't be touched in that way. Right. And see, earlier you, in any of those moments, whether it be with that step grandfather, whether it be with what happened in the park, whether it be what happened with the trafficker, whether it be what happened, didn't know because thought that when stuff was happening to body, that it was happening and impacting. And it did happen. Impact. But it never got who you really are. Right? And as you're starting to realize this now, take a nice deep breath in and a long exhale and close your eyes. And as your eyes close, think of drifting down like a leaf in the fall drifts down from a tall tree down towards the ground. As you also drift down and down deeper inside, cascading down towards the light at your center. That calm, peaceful, easy, light, flowing energy. Like what you became aware of as you see the sunrise against the kind contrast to that plane. That's right. All of this is happening so that your self soothing, healing all the way through. All aspects of mind and body. Every cell getting this same healing. You're becoming more okay in you. That's right. Take a deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Right? And what's happening now? Chill. Super chill. You're super chill. That's right. What's it like to feel super chill? Yeah. And not in a cold way. So spankets, right? Super chill. But not in a cold way, right? Yeah. Yeah. So think of another thing like, you know, because you might want a date. What do you do now? Like, are you. Where are you staying? Where are you working? Are you up in Penelope?
[94:07] B: I'm in Pinellas County.
[94:08] A: Okay.
[94:09] B: I'm staying with my friend who just like rented me a room at her house and I'm not working currently, so.
[94:15] A: Okay. Okay. Is there plans to do stuff like that? Or hopefully in the future, I just.
[94:20] B: Really have to, like, settle down for a second.
[94:24] A: Cause you've been trained yet? Yeah, yeah, yeah. How did you get to Misty?
[94:33] B: I was in a woman's shelter in Miami and my caseworker for the police sent me, like her information kind of stuff.
[94:42] A: Yeah.
[94:42] B: And actually went to the house that Cello Freedom, like, has.
[94:46] A: You went to the assessment? I went to the assessment house, yeah. Like in Valrico, Brandon, Fish area. Okay. It's a big house, isn't it?
[94:52] B: Yeah, it is. But I couldn't deal with it. It was too religious for me, the whole program.
[94:56] A: Thank you very much.
[94:57] B: Yeah, thank you.
[95:04] A: I get that.
[95:05] B: Thank you.
[95:09] A: They're well intentioned, but sometimes a little heavy with that hand.
[95:13] B: I agree.
[95:15] A: Yeah. I kind of am more open. Nice.
[95:19] B: Awesome.
[95:19] A: Said that. Yeah.
[95:23] B: That was pretty much. Yeah.
[95:24] A: Okay. So you did assessment and realized that actually going to a residential thing wouldn't work, but you found somebody up in Pinellas that you could stay with and that's been good. And that's kind of having you help settle down, Right? Of course, yeah. Cool. Okay. Is there anything that you're going to need to do with this case or testifying or probably.
[95:49] B: I don't know yet.
[95:50] A: Okay. Okay. When you think about that kind of stuff, is that the trafficker that you met up with? Yes. Okay. That guy that you had taken the Uber. Right. But then there was lots of other stuff that transpired and not just in that spot, in other spots. Did you get. Have to go to other states or just in this state?
[96:11] B: I was just in this state for now.
[96:13] A: Okay. But different cities, actually.
[96:15] B: Not later in the city. I mean, not later, other cities.
[96:18] A: Sorry. Yeah.
[96:19] B: But later I was in the year I was supposed to go to New York.
[96:22] A: Okay. But that never happened because obviously. Well, good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So with any of that stuff, if that starts to come up, we'll certainly be able to do process stuff.
[96:38] B: Right. Like connect for next time, see each other. Probably gonna write a list. Like whenever events come up that I think about, I'm probably just gonna write it down.
[96:45] A: Yeah.
[96:46] B: Because I noticed this time, you know, just kind of like when I'm on the spot, I go like, you know.
[96:50] A: No, I think that that's actually. Again, that is part of the process. Right. So here's the cool part. You may be consciously going, oh, I need to think of the time. But your unconscious knows more than you do. Right. So your unconscious is a warehouse of everything you've ever gone through. The good, the bad, the ugly. It also Knows which moments that you've gone through that left imprints, big imprints, little imprints, right? So we have, when it comes to the world of traumas, we have little T, medium sized teeth, big T, right? We all know big T traumas. I was raped, my best friend got shot in front of me. I killed these people at war. You know, I had this horrific accident in a car, right? Those are big T, right? Middle sized T would be over time, I got 10, picked on, bullied, made fun of throughout my formative middle school years. That would be more of a medium sized tea because you clump all that together, right? Little T, you know, that could be a medium tea. A divorce where a parent who was around isn't around anymore. And that kind of made me feel like I'm not lovable. Because if I was more lovable, that parent will be around. But of course, at that young age, I don't realize how fucked up that parent is. That's why they're not around. Has nothing to do with my loveability. But that's what starts to get right. So a lot of these kinds of things get unraveled. And so what you might notice because this is really, really common, that even if other moments show up, like what you're saying, I'm gonna write stuff down that as other moments show up that we haven't touched, they're not going to have the same sting. The intensity is already going to be turned down, right? Because what's happening is your brain is going to scan for what's structurally similar to what we have cleared, right? So for example, if I had somebody that was abused by their uncle, both physically and sexually from let's say age 8 to age, you know, 11, and it happened a lot of times, do I need to go through every single time that it happened to clear them all? No, thank God, no. Right. Isn't that cool? Right? Now what I may need to do, because if that happened from 8 to 11, but at 17 they got date raped, that may not transfer because they're structurally different. Make sense? So part of what you're gonna start noticing for yourself are things that used to be troubling me. They're not troubling me. That the intensity of my reactivity way less than it was the frequency of when it used to spike for me, way less. And then even if I do get triggered the length of time that it used to stay shrinks. So it doesn't mean you're not going to have any stressors or other kinds of things that go on or any of that stuff. What it means is that if it does, it's not going to happen as often, spike as high, or last as long. So that'll make it a lot easier. And again, where we're headed and part of what we're doing and part of why we do it in this way is we, we do a process that's about clearing up stuff. When you get a lot of stuff gone, other stuff that may have not been as pertinent may fill the area. Right? Or I might not have any of it. But what starts to happen in me is as we get things cleared, now I'm reacting better. Then we start thinking about, okay, now that I'm not so triggered in experiences, well, like, how do I actually want to be moving forward in life? What do I want for me in my life? None of us start off going, oh, you know what? I'm going to create my life and here's what I'm creating. Yeah, well, not fucking shit, right? But as we get to a certain phase of life, we go, maybe I can be a little more of a creator, co creator in how I want things to go. Right? So that's where we want to begin to adjust the picker so that what I'm finding myself drawn to or finding myself appealing are people who are more well, right, because we know based on what got broken. My picker has been bringing people into my life that treat me shitty. And then I somehow feel like I must deserve it because I don't deserve any better. So I keep finding myself getting hooked and into relationships with people that treat me shitty. Awesome, right? We want to get that adjusted. So what I'm finding myself being more attracted to and attracting are people who are treating me well because I'm starting to treat me well. One of the things that's happening with what we're doing is you're starting to be more okay in you, which means you're starting to treat you more well. That's part of why, as we thought about younger moments, it was you letting the younger you know that you know she didn't know any better and that you're okay so that she gets to be okay. And having not known any better because more often than not, we look back at the earlier me and kick the earlier me going, you stupid fucking moron, you should have known better. Follow me. That's one of the things that that goes on. So that's starting to get adjusted inside as well. Does that make sense?
[103:50] B: Yes.
[103:53] A: So what are you noticing for you right now?
[103:58] B: I'm sleepy. I'm a little antsy, but I'm good.
[104:03] A: Huh. Where do you feel the antsiness?
[104:05] B: Like my legs when I move.
[104:07] A: Uh huh.
[104:08] B: Or like, I think it's just my ADHD brain that just sometimes will be.
[104:13] A: Like, you know, do you know how we settle in ADHD brain?
[104:18] B: I want to know.
[104:20] A: Little bit of caffeine.
[104:24] B: That's why you like sweet tea.
[104:25] A: That's because like, like a little bit of caffeine. Not an over amount of caffeine, but if you do a little bit of caffeine, it actually can settle so that it's easier to focus and see. Attention deficit and I don't know if you know this or not, is not really a deficit in attention. It's really a, what would we call it? A hyper. Into what I'm into. So somebody who is, who has attention deficit, whether it be the hyperactivity or just regular. Right. What they have the ability to do when it's something that they're interested in, they can be completely consumed. Meaning they can eat it, drink it, sleep it, should it, consume it, be consumed by it. It's all, everything. Follow me with that. That's a superpower. Because most people in life can't be all consumed with something. The deal with attention deficit is when it's something I'm disinterested in, then I have a harder time than most continuing to pay attention to it. Got it. Yeah, right. That's where the.
[105:46] B: God, I can't say words. Sorry.
[105:47] A: Go ahead. You know, you got it. That's where it is. So we as people want to learn how to target it in the arena that I enjoy because that's how I'll do great. Right. Like if I look at my education, I did not do well in high school. I didn't think I was smart because in high school there were certain classes that I enjoyed that I did well in other classes that I would rather gnaw off my arm.
[106:25] B: Right?
[106:27] A: Right. When I went away to college, I had to take like the general courses. And again, same thing with that. There were ones that I liked that I did well in and some that I didn't like that I'd rather gnaw off my arm. So I didn't have a good gpa. When I finally got targeted into my major and it was something that I liked and wanted to do, my grades went way up. I'm smart and that arena. Right. So in schooling, in order to be the smart kid, you have to be good at everything. But in life, in order to be successful, you need to be good at one thing. I don't have to be a good accountant. I don't have to be good at math to do what I do. Right. The accountant that I have needs to be good at math, accounting. I don't. Right. So we again want to be targeting more of what's going to work for you in an ongoing way so that you find yourself entertaining more of the things that are appealing that I enjoy doing because then it'll be easier for me to do. Got it. Yeah. Right. So what did you notice happened to the antsiness now?
[107:58] B: Still antsy.
[107:59] A: Uh huh. And still in the legs.
[108:04] B: You're just gonna like body tension, I don't know.
[108:08] A: Uh huh. So just notice the body tension for a moment without having to do anything with it or about it. Right. And then slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, breathe in this way, that's a little slower and simply expand your awareness. Notice that you can pay more attention to seeing me and my fingers wiggling, that you're able to notice more space. And as you notice more space without having to do anything with or about the sensations, what do you start noticing happening? You are so this, Graciela, is a really powerful tool that you have access to that we have done in multiple iterations. We've done it more than one time, which when you do something more than one time, your brain becomes more familiar with it and it becomes easier to do. So in between now and the next time we get together, one, I want you to pay attention, attention to what you notice for yourself that's new and different in terms of how you're feeling, how you're reacting, how certain things in your environment are. Right. I want you to pay attention to what you notice that's new and different for you. Two, you already said I'm gonna write down different things as they pop come to mind so that I have access to that. Right. But three, you want to utilize this process that we just went through a couple times throughout your day. So one time would be when you wake up in the morning again, because you're already going to be in that state. So you can lower your jaw, rest your tongue and just breathe for a few moments. As you breathe for a few moments, you want to do an inventory. So it's kind of like I have my eyes closed and I'm breathing and I'm going to do an inventory. And the first part that I'm going to do an inventory is my energy body just kind of notice how does my energy body feel Then I'm going to bring my awareness into my thoughts and feelings, and then I'm going to just notice my body and then be asking myself, what do I need? Right. That's what we do first thing in the morning when you lay down at night, same kind of process. Phone goes away, electronics are off. I take a few moments to whether I'm seated or laying down, lower my jaw, rest my tongue, breathe a little bit slower and deeper and expand awareness, open the field, notice more space, because again, as you do this process that will start settling body down. Notice how some of the jittery tension starts to subside, and it'll make it easier for you to at night rest. Right. You'll notice that one, either A, certain memories that used to pop, that would cause discomfort aren't showing up anymore, or B, even if they do, you don't have the same kind of discomfort. Even if the discomfort showed up for a moment, it's gone really fast. It didn't get as high. It doesn't last as long. That's what I want you to pay attention in between now and when we get back together. Makes sense. Yes. Cool. So where in Pinellas are you staying?
[112:09] B: I am in Pinellas Park.
[112:10] A: Pinellas Park. Okay. So I lived in Pinellas park for a period of time. Where did I live? I lived in an apartment complex. Gosh, what the heck was the name of it? They were new at the time. They're clearly not new now because I been away from there for a while, but I'm trying. So let's see. Where were they? So we lived for, like, four years out in a plantain. Seminole. Right. When we were in the apartment in Pinellas Park. Yeah. Where the. I can't even think of what the name of the road is that was. But it was close, so I was not. When I was in Pinellas Park, I was fairly close to the P check. So the Pinellas juvenile assessment center, which is near where the court and all of that was. I could go up 49th to get there. So it must have been 49th and in from 49th, but it wasn't 54th. It was up from maybe 62nd. Could have been. It's up in that area.
[113:29] B: I'm just in a little house, like, deep in the suburb kind of area. Yeah, I'm trying to think of, like, closer to 87th.
[113:38] A: But it was nice.
[113:39] B: It's really nice. I like it. It's a lot more calm than Miami, for sure.
[113:43] A: So I needed that. Yeah, that's much Better. Where did you grow up?
[113:49] B: Miami.
[113:50] A: Oh, you did? Like, in Miami? Like, yeah. Okay. That area is crazy right now.
[113:57] B: It's insane. Price wise and. Price wise.
[114:00] A: And the traffic. We stayed one time in Miami, like, North Miami. So, like, Ball harbor, like, the traffic on I95A 1A. Like, during the day, you can't fucking move.
[114:15] B: Mind blowing.
[114:15] A: Yeah, mind blowing. Like, literally takes you, like, hours to get to. Like, we went to the mall to watch a movie, and it's five miles away. It took us 50 minutes to get there. Like, I could have walked there faster.
[114:31] B: Yeah.
[114:31] A: Like, what the fuck? It's ridiculous. But at night, wide open road, nobody's moving during the day. Nuts. We did go to a really, really good vegan restaurant. Oh, which one? Oh, geez. What is it? It was down in Miami. It was off of.
[114:51] B: Was it Holly Vegan Kitchen? I'm trying to think. There's so many.
[114:57] A: That was really good. I got a chickpea steak, and my wife got a pasta dish with the spaghetti sauce that had, like, walnuts and, like, the pesto.
[115:14] B: Right?
[115:14] A: Kind of. Yeah.
[115:15] B: Nice.
[115:15] A: It was really good. God, I thought I started with it. I can't remember what it's called.
[115:24] B: I bet I've been in, though.
[115:25] A: I really do. It was, like, a really small place. There was, like, a hotel in front of it. Like, part of it, like, so. But on the listing of, like, the vegan restaurants in Miami, it was, like, listed as one of the top places. But, like, literally there was a hotel, and the restaurant was right on the side of the hotel, and it was awesome. They also had another one called Sobe Vegan, which was like a vegan fast food joint. Yes. I've been to that one, and that was really cool that you could go. And it was like, they had smoothies. They had, like, you could get, like, a vegan burger that had. With, you know, non real cheese and cashew made cheese. And I love cashew cheese so much. Right. There's a really good one that we get. Vivo Life and C H A O Chow cheese. That one's phenomenal. The chow.
[116:27] B: We have the vivo one, though.
[116:29] A: But Vivo one's really good to make a grilled cheese because the. How it melts. Melts, like, cheesy. Yeah. Some of the other don't melt as cheesy as. Yeah, but I really like that. That chow cheese a little lot. We've had their Mac and cheese and all of that kind of stuff. We. We started doing vegan, like, what'll be two years in January. Wow.
[116:55] B: That's amazing for you guys. I wish I could keep it up right now. Just my budget. Can't. But, you know, I have always had mad respect for everyone doing the healthy living thing, so.
[117:04] A: Yeah, well, I get it. The budget is a. Is a big deal thing. We. We. It's. If we go out, we will be flexible and do vegetarian because a lot of places don't have any. And at least I'm not eating pork.
[117:26] B: Yeah, you're plant based. You know, that's. And that's. I think what counts is really just trying to nurse your body in the best way you can.
[117:31] A: Yeah. Yeah. Cool. So again, what do you notice?
[117:40] B: Yeah, I do just feel a significant amount better. Like, I feel less, like, weight on me.
[117:47] A: Yeah.
[117:48] B: Explain it. But it's like a chest thing. Feels like I'm carrying, like a weighted vest sometimes.
[117:51] A: Yeah, I bet.
[117:52] B: Just because I get so, like. Feels like my lungs are cramping sometimes.
[117:55] A: Right.
[117:56] B: In my thoughts.
[117:58] A: Yeah.
[117:59] B: I feel a lot more like.
[118:02] A: Right. Notice how it's easier to be here. Yeah, right. That I'm not. So in my mind, that's not racing as fast as it normally does.
[118:11] B: And I always get wrapped up in, like, how people perceive me and all this other shit and stuff. I feel less like in my own.
[118:18] A: That's part of what we want to do. By getting that version of it's not about me, that enables me to. To see other people's stuff as being about them. And therefore I'm not so concerned about me and how I'm coming across or what they're thinking about me. So the self consciousness turns way down. I like that. Yeah. So that's what you're going to notice. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Well, I think we're in a good place to stop for today.
[118:49] B: Okay.
[118:50] A: And then we can get back together again.
[118:53] B: All right. I will see you soon.
[118:56] A: Yeah, that'll be great. Really good connecting with you.
[118:59] B: Likewise.
[118:59] A: Thank you. And if you get a chance, definitely try out Casatina.
[119:03] B: Oh, God. I would.
[119:04] A: In Denver.
