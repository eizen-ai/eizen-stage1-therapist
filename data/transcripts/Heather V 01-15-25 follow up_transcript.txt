[00:00] A: All right, so today is January 15th, Heather. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. Given what we do is useful and valuable, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:14] B: Yes.
[00:15] A: Cool. Okay, so here's my first question. How did our last session leave you? When you think about the things that we talked about and unplugged. When you think about those things now, what do you notice?
[00:29] B: That I'm not. So I don't get so tense when I think about them.
[00:34] A: Yeah.
[00:35] B: You know, like, I remind myself that they're in the past, you know, and I'm not there and I'm not being frightened and I don't get tense up and.
[00:43] A: Yeah. So you're noticing not feeling the same way you used to feel about it. Yeah.
[00:48] B: Yeah.
[00:49] A: Right. And not because you're telling yourself that it's in the past.
[00:52] B: Yeah, because my body is realized.
[00:54] A: Yeah. Isn't that a good news?
[00:56] B: Yeah.
[00:56] A: Yeah, it's cool. It is cool. Right? Like, it's different than therapy.
[01:02] B: Yeah.
[01:02] A: It's different than just developing an understanding as to what the triggers are and why I have them and that kind of stuff.
[01:10] B: Yeah.
[01:11] A: Okay. Okay. And even when you think about the moment of finding out about the guy when you were in rehab, what do you notice when you think about that?
[01:18] B: It's not so sad anymore, you know?
[01:21] A: Yeah.
[01:23] B: A lot of relief to let go, you know?
[01:26] A: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Not hurting. Yeah, he's not hurting.
[01:30] B: Yeah.
[01:31] A: Right. And the love hasn't disappeared.
[01:32] B: No.
[01:34] A: Right. We want to connect to more of it.
[01:35] B: Yeah.
[01:36] A: Because it's in the ongoing way of the experiences that I can't lose.
[01:41] B: Yeah.
[01:42] A: Yeah. Cool. All right. What else have you been noticing for yourself? Like, how have things been being, you know, and programming and clearly working at Duncan?
[01:50] B: Yeah. I just been trying not to stress as much, you know, I used to stress about tomorrow and a month from now and nothing I can do about it, you know, why worry about it and keep myself up at nighttime and get sick over it?
[02:06] A: Yeah.
[02:07] B: I can't change it, you know?
[02:08] A: Yeah. So has that been happening as much where you've been keeping yourself up and getting sick about it and not as much. No. Okay.
[02:17] B: Yeah.
[02:18] A: So you've had the ability to be more emotionally present.
[02:23] B: Yeah.
[02:23] A: Like here.
[02:24] B: Yeah.
[02:24] A: Not so concerned about what could or what might.
[02:27] B: Yeah.
[02:28] A: Because it might not even. And even if it. There's nothing for me to do.
[02:33] B: Yeah.
[02:33] A: Right now.
[02:34] B: Yeah.
[02:35] A: Right. I can't pre plan three years from.
[02:37] B: Now they always just.
[02:39] A: Heck, I can't even tell you what club I'm going to use on the third shot at the second hole of a golf course. I can't tell you that right now.
[02:48] B: No.
[02:48] A: Right.
[02:49] B: Yeah.
[02:50] A: Makes sense.
[02:50] B: Yeah.
[02:51] A: Yeah. Okay, so that's cool. So it's been easier for you to be more emotionally present and less lost in the worries about the what could or what might.
[02:59] B: Yeah.
[03:00] A: Okay. So that's cool.
[03:01] B: Yeah.
[03:01] A: Yeah.
[03:02] B: Yeah.
[03:02] A: Yeah. What else have you been noticing?
[03:07] B: I just. I'm happier, you know, I'm happier because I know everything's gonna work out like it should, you know, and the past is.
[03:15] A: Well, everything's gonna work out.
[03:16] B: Yeah.
[03:16] A: We have no idea whether it should.
[03:18] B: Yeah, that's true.
[03:20] A: Right. It's all gonna work out some way. Shape or form.
[03:22] B: Yeah.
[03:23] A: I don't know whether it's gonna be.
[03:24] B: Yeah. Yeah. So. But I haven't been that in the past. Defy me, you know, before I did. And I don't care what anybody thinks about me. It's what I think about myself, you know? And I have to tell myself that.
[03:36] A: But I want to understand, say more about that. You used to be really concerned about what others thought about you.
[03:43] B: Yeah. Especially my son's father.
[03:45] A: More about, like, what you did.
[03:46] B: Yeah.
[03:47] A: Like, what might your son's father have been thinking about you? What are some things that. Or he might have said that. What. What. What he thinks.
[03:56] B: Always going to be a drug addict, like my mom. Never going to be my son's life. I don't want to be in his life. So. And yesterday we made plans and he canceled them last minute because he said he's just not comfortable with it. He needs more consistent phone calls. So I'm like, you know what? I understand you're just trying to protect my kid instead of getting defensive, like, this is all I've done this year, blah, blah, blah, you know?
[04:18] A: No, Isn't that good?
[04:19] B: Yeah. So I'm like, okay.
[04:21] A: You're like, okay, I get it. Like, you want to make sure our boy's okay. I want that, too.
[04:26] B: And doesn't want to get. Get him hurt.
[04:28] A: Isn't that cool?
[04:28] B: Yeah.
[04:29] A: Yeah. I'm really glad that you're caring for our son.
[04:32] B: Yeah, Right.
[04:33] A: He's not going to expect a reaction like that from you. No, he's not gonna get a. Oh, okay. No, I get it. Like, you haven't had a long enough time. You don't know whether I'm gonna be okay. I haven't demonstrated it. Totally, totally get it. Right. Like and you're being a really good dad, so thank you.
[04:49] B: Yeah.
[04:51] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[04:52] B: Yeah.
[04:53] A: It's not about me.
[04:54] B: No.
[04:55] A: His shit's not about me.
[04:56] B: No.
[04:57] A: Right. Yay. Well, that's all good. New stuff that makes me super happy.
[05:05] B: Yeah.
[05:05] A: Yeah. That's really great. Good job.
[05:07] B: Yeah.
[05:08] A: Yeah.
[05:08] B: I was proud of myself after I said I understand, you know, instead of wanting to snap, you know, or feeling bad about myself or how I was, you know.
[05:16] A: Right.
[05:16] B: You know, now I just have to prove it to him. And I understand he's trying to protect our kid. Yeah.
[05:22] A: And it used to be. Well, I worked hard, so I deserve.
[05:25] B: Yeah.
[05:25] A: It's not that anymore. People in life, it's crazy. Don't get what they deserve.
[05:30] B: Yeah. Yeah. Very true.
[05:31] A: You don't get it because you deserve it. You get it because you get it.
[05:34] B: Yeah.
[05:35] A: Good or bad.
[05:36] B: Yeah.
[05:36] A: The kid who's born to a family that when he's born, he already has a trust worth $100 million. What the did that kid do.
[05:43] B: Yeah.
[05:43] A: To deserve that? Not a damn thing. He rolled the dice and got lucky.
[05:47] B: Yeah.
[05:49] A: Right. In the same way, the kid who's born with a cleft palate.
[05:52] B: Yeah.
[05:55] A: I mean.
[05:55] B: Yeah.
[05:56] A: What could that kid do to deserve that? Nothing.
[05:59] B: No.
[06:00] A: Isn't that crazy?
[06:01] B: Yeah.
[06:02] A: Yeah. But so we. We have this language, though. Oh, well, you know, I work hard, so, you know, I should get. You had a bigger picture, which is long term. I want to have a better connection with my son, which means I have to have a better connection with his dad.
[06:18] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[06:21] A: That's part of it. You can't have a shitty connection with him and have a good connection with my kid. You have to figure out a way. So if he's protective. Great. Yeah. I get it. Totally understand. You want more of it. Being demonstrated that I'm different.
[06:35] B: Yeah.
[06:35] A: Yeah. Okay. I got it.
[06:37] B: Yeah.
[06:38] A: Yeah. And it's okay.
[06:39] B: Yeah, it's okay.
[06:40] A: Right. Because the people who know us the most are the ones oftentimes last to see that we've changed. Because they've got their own filter.
[06:49] B: Yeah.
[06:49] A: Right. If I got my own filter, that this is who you are. You know, it's really hard to see that you've changed. You kind of. And it's moving on me really hard to see that you've changed.
[06:58] B: Yeah.
[07:00] A: Right. Okay, Cool. Good job.
[07:03] B: Yeah.
[07:04] A: Yeah. Any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know? Any other stuff that you've noticed? Different, Better in terms of responding, reacting, doing. Cool. So what surfaces today? What do you want our time to do for you today? What do we want?
[07:23] B: That's what I was trying to figure out. I was like, what are we going to talk about for two hours?
[07:27] A: Who knows? We don't have to know.
[07:30] B: Yeah. No, I'm cool with it though.
[07:32] A: Because the idea is thinking about how do you want to be.
[07:35] B: Yeah.
[07:36] A: Remember, the only purpose of healing emotional wounds is so that my brain functions in the present moment in a way that's better for me.
[07:49] B: Yeah.
[07:50] A: If my brain was working the way that I wanted to in all moments, I wouldn't care about any of that.
[07:56] B: Yeah.
[07:57] A: Right. So we still want to be thinking because you're still in process of programming. Right. And you have a little ways to go.
[08:06] B: Yeah.
[08:07] A: Right. Because you're doing what phase are you? Action. Action. We want action. Or are you beyond that? Are you out of something? You don't have to do any of that at all. Okay. So you're not at. You're at a. You're at home.
[08:21] B: Halfway.
[08:21] A: Halfway house. Okay. Same kind of thing.
[08:23] B: Yeah.
[08:23] A: You're not in the program. Residential. Okay. Okay. So are there specific things about being there that challenge you? Roommates, people, things that go on? Stuff that irks you?
[08:39] B: Yeah. They don't want to do simple stuff like their chores or like when I get up at 4, 4 in the morning.
[08:46] A: Yes.
[08:47] B: Why are you screaming at 10 o'clock at night time? Laughing like that's quiet time. And I don't want to say anything anymore because I'm like, you know what? They're just going to keep doing it. They know, you know, why am I stressing about it? They don't care. Why should I care? Yeah. I don't know if that's a good attitude.
[09:03] A: Well, does it, does it bother you?
[09:04] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[09:05] A: Well that's why you care.
[09:06] B: Yeah.
[09:07] A: Cuz it bothers you.
[09:08] B: Yeah.
[09:08] A: You have a different solution?
[09:09] B: Yeah.
[09:10] A: You could get those noise canceling.
[09:12] B: Yeah.
[09:13] A: Earplugs.
[09:13] B: Thinking about it. Yeah.
[09:15] A: Which you know, a couple bucks get you the foam ones.
[09:19] B: Yeah. And that would give me some peace.
[09:23] A: Yeah. Cuz that's you taking care of you. When I travel I have like a silicone and I. It's a earplug, molds to my ear and I just put it in because in hotels there's lots of loud noises or one was next to an interstate or.
[09:39] B: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And you can't help that. Yeah.
[09:43] A: Right. There's other ones on Amazon for like 25 that they are ones that you wear at concerts. You know, sometimes concerts are really loud yeah. And you don't need it that loud.
[09:53] B: Yeah.
[09:54] A: But you can still hear it.
[09:55] B: Oh, okay.
[09:56] A: It allows you to have a conversation. But those are. Those are a different kind of ear.
[10:01] B: Okay, I'll have to check that out.
[10:03] A: Yeah, Yeah. I think I could show you. I think I have it here. I take it with me because it's a super. There it is. It is a really small. Oh, it is that inside. I got no nails. It always happens. I go to open something, I clip my nails. So these are little teeny.
[10:55] B: Oh, yeah.
[10:56] A: So you just put them in your ear. Cool.
[11:03] B: They fit perfect.
[11:04] A: Yeah. Yeah. So that's another thing to have for. Yeah, makes sense.
[11:09] B: Yeah.
[11:11] A: That's managing you because you're not going to change them.
[11:15] B: Yeah.
[11:16] A: For that behavior in them, even if it's rude or disrespectful or not following the rules or.
[11:22] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:25] A: Okay. All right. So how long do you stay in a halfway house for? Is there a requirement you get to stay as indefinite?
[11:34] B: Well, one of the girls has been there two years.
[11:36] A: Okay.
[11:37] B: So think they kick you out as long as you're following the roads, you know?
[11:44] A: Yeah.
[11:45] B: It's supposed to be like a year program, but they don't kick you out.
[11:49] A: Okay, Are there requirements? Do you have to go to a certain number of meetings in a week?
[11:53] B: In your first 30 or first 90 days? You have to go to 90 meetings in 90 days. After that, you have to go to four meetings a week.
[12:00] A: Okay.
[12:01] B: Yeah. And then. Yeah.
[12:03] A: And get a sponsor and be on a curfew.
[12:07] B: And that's. Do your chore. It changes every Sunday. Like, you know, I'm like, well, what if you had your own house? You would have to clean the whole house. You complain about cleaning one bathroom.
[12:17] A: Well, of course they're going to complain about cleaning the bathroom. Who wants to clean the bathroom?
[12:21] B: I don't mind.
[12:23] A: Right. People who don't mind. But it's not like you want to. But you don't mind. I don't mind doing the laundry. My wife hates it.
[12:30] B: Yeah.
[12:31] A: I do the laundry.
[12:32] B: Yeah.
[12:32] A: I don't mind.
[12:33] B: Yeah.
[12:36] A: But people like to.
[12:37] B: Yeah, yeah.
[12:39] A: And you might be in a household of women.
[12:42] B: Yeah.
[12:42] A: Yeah.
[12:43] B: There's eight of us.
[12:44] A: Eight of us. Right. And there's always something to. About.
[12:47] B: Oh, yeah.
[12:48] A: Or gossip about.
[12:49] B: Yeah.
[12:49] A: Those are the two things that we'll do.
[12:51] B: Yeah.
[12:51] A: We'll. Or gossip.
[12:52] B: Yep. Exactly.
[12:54] A: Okay. Okay. Do you get your own room?
[12:57] B: No, I share one room with one other person.
[12:59] A: Okay. Is that person decent?
[13:01] B: Yeah.
[13:02] A: And respectful when you go to bed and have to be up.
[13:04] B: Yeah, she has to be up just as early and she's 64 years old, so.
[13:08] A: Oh, all right, well, that's cool. So. So that's a. That's a different thing.
[13:11] B: Yeah, yeah.
[13:14] A: Cool.
[13:14] B: Yeah.
[13:15] A: Okay. So thinking about your current day to day stuff, work, what have you dealing with, sun, being in halfway house, having been in rehab, and there's still a ton of stuff that you've gone through that although the experiences are over, underneath the surface, there's an effect. Right. One of the things that you said that I think is really useful is I used to get really troubled by what my son's father would say to me about I don't want to be with my kid or I'm always going to be a drug or. Or. Or. Yeah, right. And that no longer causes the same disruption in you that it used to. Am I following that correctly? Like, it doesn't make you feel like it did.
[14:05] B: Yeah, definitely.
[14:06] A: Yeah. So we want more of that to settle in you, in more arenas of your life. Do you follow me with that? Like, that would be one of the things. What, what else might we want our time to do?
[14:24] B: I don't know.
[14:25] A: You know, and like changing ways that you've been thinking, feeling, acting, reacting.
[14:32] B: I'm just. I have a hard time trusting people, trying to learn to let people in, but I really have a hard time with it. Like, I'm trying to be open, but I'm so used to everybody leaving me and hurting me, you know, that I don't even give them a chance to get that close.
[14:49] A: Okay.
[14:50] B: So I'm trying to break that cycle, but it's so hard because it scares me when I, you know, get close to people.
[14:58] A: Okay, so say more. What scares you about getting close to people?
[15:04] B: They're gonna leave me or see me. Not like me, you know.
[15:09] A: Okay, so that happens now. And you're thinking that that's a program in you based on having had experiences where it felt like people left me.
[15:24] B: Yeah. Even, like people that try to care about me, I push them away, you.
[15:27] A: Know, what does that mean?
[15:31] B: Like, to a couple of the girls invite me to go out or want to give me a hug, and I, like, back up at first, like, and it's just a reaction I do, you know, and I tell them I'm busy, I can't go to these things. You know, I was going through stuff for Christmas, you know, the holidays are hard with having no family and all that. And I see my kid and so I was like recruiting to My room and sleeping a lot and they tried to come talk to me about it and I really wouldn't talk. Yeah, I know that's only hurting me, you know, but.
[16:02] A: Okay.
[16:03] B: Scary.
[16:04] A: Scary to share.
[16:05] B: Yeah.
[16:05] A: Oh, because if you shared, then what. What's the scary thing that would happen after sharing?
[16:12] B: They wouldn't understand.
[16:14] A: Okay. And then what would happen if they didn't understand?
[16:18] B: They'd probably talk about me behind my back and then eventually leave.
[16:25] A: Okay. So we got it all planned out. So good, Heather. Right? We got it all planned out now. Z9 Zack's on it would go. Right. We have no idea whether that's true.
[16:35] B: No.
[16:36] A: Right. We don't have any idea whether that's true. Yeah, that's what we want to get. We don't have any idea whether that's true.
[16:42] B: Yeah.
[16:45] A: So I'm curious what you sharing has anything to do with trust? What does that have to do with trust? Trusting.
[16:58] B: I don't want people to judge me.
[16:59] A: You know, that's okay. But they're going to.
[17:03] B: I know. Why is that?
[17:05] A: Because that's what people do. But just like it's different already and we want it even more solidified in you that you're not so concerned with how he's seeing you. Right. Because, you know, you're not learning about you, you're learning about him.
[17:20] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[17:21] A: Right. I wonder what it would be like if you didn't experience other people's thinking about you having anything to do with you.
[17:29] B: Yeah.
[17:30] A: And probably that they're not thinking about you nearly as much as you think that they're thinking about you.
[17:35] B: Yeah, I've been told that before.
[17:39] A: Yeah, Right.
[17:40] B: People have their own lives, are not worried.
[17:42] A: They're thinking about themselves a lot more than they're thinking about you. Yeah, Right.
[17:47] B: Not that important to these people, you know?
[17:50] A: Well, they're important to themselves.
[17:52] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:54] A: Right.
[17:55] B: Yeah.
[17:55] A: Right. So. So what if, however, there no longer causes discomfort in you, so that you experience their stuff as being about them and I'm learning maybe about how they might be thinking or feeling about something I said or did.
[18:20] B: Yeah.
[18:21] A: But I'm not learning about me worthful or worthlessness or love or lovability or unlovability or I'm not learning about me, I'm learning about them and some of their thoughts maybe about something I said or did or didn't say or didn't do. Yeah, got it.
[18:42] B: Yeah.
[18:43] A: So let's think of. In those situations, the lens is adjusted so that you're experiencing their stuff as being about them. Not about me. So that you're lighter and more at peace in you, knowing that who you are and who you're becoming has. Is not what you've gone through and is not what you've done. Make sense?
[19:15] B: Yeah.
[19:17] A: So that's where we're headed. Is the you where that's like crystal clear, right? Yeah. Cool.
[19:27] B: Yeah.
[19:27] A: Okay. So that in those situations, it's not even showing up as a thing so that you can share if it would make sense to share.
[19:38] B: Yeah.
[19:41] A: Right. The idea of trust is to be thinking that they're always going to have my best interest in mind, but they're not. They're going to have theirs.
[19:50] B: Yeah.
[19:52] A: Even my kids. I'm not thinking that. They're always having my best interest in mind. They got their best interest in mind. No, Dad, I was not on the iPad for the past two hours.
[20:05] B: Yeah, right.
[20:06] A: They're not out for my best interest. For their best interest. So we want to be experiencing emotionally that stuff is. And we want the effect of any of the troubling stuff that you've done or that happened to you to also be unplugged. So it's no longer running in you. Right. So that you are more connected to who you really are and therefore much more content and at peace and. Okay. With. Right. Where you're at on your way to creating and becoming more like a better version of you ongoingly being created.
[20:58] B: Yeah.
[20:58] A: Right. That's why the phones keep having different iterations. It's the same freaking thing. It's better iteration.
[21:06] B: Yeah.
[21:07] A: That's how we want you to be becoming.
[21:11] B: Yeah.
[21:11] A: Cool.
[21:12] B: Yeah.
[21:12] A: Okay. Any other stuff that comes up in terms of what we want to do? Okay, cool. Yeah, no worries. So then the only thing that there is for you to do. Right. Is slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, and begin to breathe a little bit slower and deeper in and a little bit longer on the way out. And notice as you're breathing in this slightly slower and deeper way in and a little longer on the way out, that your Heather now consciously controlling how you're breathing, which is therefore different than what happens when you're unconsciously breathing. And there's lots of things in your life that you can choose to do consciously, like close your eyes. That also happens unconsciously, like when you're blinking. And so what we know about the conscious part of our brain is it's like a flashlight in a dark room showing me what my attention is on. And of course, I can shift what my attention is on. To something else. And that's what it's going to show me, but both ways. Everything else that it's not showing me is now unconscious. And so there's your conscious brain and. And there's your unconscious brain. And your unconscious brain does healing inside automatically and accelerates the rate of healing when you're in states of rest. Because the resources get devoted more and more to the healing. That's right. And your unconscious knows Heather way more than you do on how to heal itself, on how to make the changes from the inside out. You know you've had to do nothing when you've had a cut on your arm or on your leg instead. Your body did it all for you. So you can consciously be listening to what I'm saying while your unconscious is also listening, but in a different way, absorbing and integrating things that you're not consciously fully aware of yet, but soon will begin to realize how much you've already changed on the way to changing more. That's right. That's right. Yeah. And what are you noticing now? How's your body feeling?
[24:18] B: Good. Calmer.
[24:20] A: Your body's feeling calmer.
[24:22] B: Yeah.
[24:22] A: Right. And as your body's feeling calmer, other things are happening. Right. Because your unconscious is a warehouse of everything you've ever gone through. The good, the bad, the ugly. It knows which things left imprints. It knows which experiences created faulty programming in you. It knows what to bring to your awareness so that we can unplug and heal. Right. And so because of that, as you and I are organizing towards this future, you whose present and clear and much more centered and grounded in herself. Right. Experiencing other people and their opinion as being about them. Even if she's learning about how they might be feeling about something she's done or hasn't done, she's still learning about them. And with her learning about them, she's got flexibility in how she responds. Which might be the same way you did with your son's dad. Yeah, no, I get it. Totally. That might be the way. Or it might be more firm and direct, or it might be more playful, or it might be not anything at all. But there's flexibility because it's being experiences info about them. Right. The other part is going on that I'm ongoingly becoming more and more of who I am, which at the center is light. And you're beginning to lighten up on you. Right. So the next thing you're going to do is put both hands on your leg like that. Right. And then bring your awareness towards your left hand. Right. Or your right hand. That's right. And you can notice the left one. You can notice the right one. Right? And so get a little bit curious about which one of your hands is going to lift up in a voluntary way. Because the hand that might lift up for you might be the right one, or the hand that might lift up for you might be the left one. See, it could be that the left one is the one that's right or the right one is the one that's left. Either way, you don't have to know. Your job is to just get curious, right. About how you'll begin to notice that hand beginning to lift up. But how it lifts up, Heather, is in a different way than how you would on purpose decide to lift your hand up. And see, as you on purpose decide to lift your hand up in a super slow way. So almost like I might not even notice that it's lifting up. Right. See, in a voluntary way, when you slowly lift that hand up. That's right. That what you'll notice is that some of the movement within the hand will be movement that's on purpose. But then you'll begin to think to yourself that, wait a minute, some of the way that it's moving isn't on purpose, which means it must be moving not consciously, unconsciously. Right. So then all you want to do is just focus your awareness towards your right hand in those fingers. And ever so slowly, as slow as you possibly can, like nobody would even notice that it's lifting up involuntary ways, begin to slowly lift that hand up even slower than that, like super slow. And now it lifts up from the arm. That's right. Super, super slow. Because as you're noticing that you're voluntarily lifting that hand up super slow, get curious about when that's right, you'll notice some of the. That's right. Movement that's not on purpose. Movement. That's right. When you notice movement that's not on purpose, as that hand voluntarily lifts up, right? Then you're aware of movement that's not conscious movement, and you're consciously aware of what's not conscious, which alters your state, state of consciousness and fuels more of a trance formation that's underway as you're healing from the inside out. All of this is happening as you rest. Because in a moment, what's going to happen is I'm going to snap my fingers and when I do, that hand is just going to drop down. And when that hand drops down, down, you're going to close your eyes and just drop down deeper Inside towards a more calm and peaceful flowing energy. Now. That's right. Eyes closed, hand drops, you drop down and in more and more towards that calm and peaceful light and easy flowing energy. The light that is you are healing from the inside out. Your unconscious responding as you rest. And so as you rest, you can pay attention to what your unconscious knows more than you. That's right. And I'm not sure if you're following anything that I'm saying, but if you are, it means you're deeper than you thought. That's right. And your unconscious has already begun to highlight the experiences that it knows would be useful to bring into the light. So we heal. Rewiring your brain. So that now works even better. It'll catalog those moments and bring them to your awareness when we need them so that we can heal those wounds. All of this goes on without you having to do anything. The right buttons being pressed, the knobs being turned at the exact spot, the levers being shifted, the switches being flipped to organize inside as you rest. Which means really cool that the next time that you rest with your eyes closed, it'll be even easier. Easier to sink in even more. And so now, in a moment, I'm going to count up from one to five. When I get to five, I'm going to snap my fingers. You'll Open your eyes. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Eyes are open. There we go. Good job. And so as you're here now, your unconscious went back already. It's already highlighted. It's going to bring one of those moments for us to unplug. What experience comes to mind? You don't know. That's right. We're not asking you, Heather. We're asking your unconscious, which does know. It knows for sure which experiences would be useful to unplug. Meaning there any of the moments that you've gone through that although they're over and you've got a different understanding about them all, they still have a tinge of ick.
[33:26] B: Yeah. I'll be losing my apartment.
[33:29] A: What's that?
[33:30] B: Losing my apartment.
[33:31] A: Losing your apartment. Right. That happened when?
[33:35] B: Four years ago.
[33:35] A: Four years ago. Right. And how did you find out? It happened. You're aware and what happened?
[33:40] B: Yeah.
[33:40] A: Remember?
[33:41] B: I moved out. On me.
[33:43] A: So your roommate moved out. Right. And then you were staying there. Right. And then what happened?
[33:48] B: I couldn't afford the ranch, so they got evicted me.
[33:50] A: So you weren't paying and they finally said, you can't stay here. Yeah. And then you gathered up your stuff and did what?
[33:59] B: My boss put me up in A hotel for a week.
[34:02] A: Right. So he put you up in a hotel. So you moved into the hotel. Right. And then what?
[34:06] B: Then I went to Harvest House.
[34:07] A: Then you went to Harvest House.
[34:08] B: Yeah.
[34:09] A: Right. And then that was over.
[34:10] B: Yeah.
[34:11] A: Right. And then later on you've done stuff more fun.
[34:15] B: Yeah. Like going to the seafood festival this weekend.
[34:19] A: Well, you're going to the seafood, that's why you want.
[34:20] B: I already went. Yeah.
[34:21] A: Oh, you already went.
[34:22] B: Yeah, it was this weekend. Lose fast.
[34:23] A: Nice. So going to seafood festival. Way better than that.
[34:25] B: Yeah.
[34:26] A: Good. Something else.
[34:28] B: Seeing my kid.
[34:29] A: Yeah, seeing your kid. Right. One other thing.
[34:31] B: Going to the beach.
[34:32] A: Right, we got it. So going to the beach, seeing your kid. We got going to the seafood.
[34:36] B: Yeah.
[34:37] A: Right. And then before that you're at Harvest House.
[34:39] B: Yeah.
[34:40] A: And then you're with work in the hotel.
[34:42] B: Yeah.
[34:43] A: And then he had put you up and then you had to leave. And then you weren't paying. And then roommate moved out. And then you too were paying.
[34:48] B: Yeah.
[34:49] A: And then before that you moved in there.
[34:51] B: Yeah.
[34:52] A: Right. As we go backwards compared to forward, what do you notice?
[34:56] B: Doesn't hurt.
[34:57] A: It doesn't hurt. Right, Right. You can remember all that happening? You can remember putting on your shoes.
[35:03] B: Yeah.
[35:03] A: We'll stop putting on your shoes. Say I'm not putting on my shoes.
[35:06] B: Yeah.
[35:07] A: I'm not putting my. We'll stop losing that apartment. Say I'm not losing that apartment. We'll stop it from happening. Say it's not happening.
[35:12] B: It's not happening.
[35:12] A: Right. Where is it? Say doesn't exist.
[35:14] B: Doesn't exist.
[35:15] A: Bingo. And again, as it gets in, what do you notice?
[35:18] B: It's relief.
[35:19] A: It's a relief. Right? Right.
[35:22] B: Yeah.
[35:28] A: Right. Right. How old is your son?
[35:31] B: 10.
[35:32] A: 10?
[35:32] B: Yeah.
[35:33] A: Cool.
[35:33] B: Yeah.
[35:34] A: That's awesome.
[35:35] B: Yeah.
[35:36] A: I have a 12 year old.
[35:37] B: Oh, yeah.
[35:38] A: And a 16 year old. They both just turned 12. And 16.
[35:41] B: Oh, I don't know about 16, but 12 is great. For sure.
[35:46] A: 16 may be better than 12.
[35:48] B: Really? Maybe you don't know yet.
[35:50] A: Yeah, the 16 year old might be.
[35:52] B: Yeah.
[35:53] A: At times easier. They're easier in different ways. They're better in different ways. They're harder in different ways.
[35:58] B: Yeah, yeah.
[35:59] A: Because they're different.
[36:00] B: Yeah.
[36:01] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's just check because like if we think about different things. Right. There's your upbringing.
[36:11] B: Yeah.
[36:12] A: Right. And you grew up with whom?
[36:15] B: My mom.
[36:16] A: Mom. And that's who you live with?
[36:18] B: Yeah.
[36:19] A: And mom wasn't well. Mom had drug issues. Right. Mom did other kinds of stuff.
[36:27] B: Yeah.
[36:28] A: Mom have trafficking stuff or any of that?
[36:31] B: No.
[36:31] A: Well. Or what we call prostitution or. Or she had those things.
[36:35] B: Yeah.
[36:36] A: And you were around.
[36:37] B: Yeah.
[36:39] A: Right, got it. So there have been lots of things that have happened.
[36:44] B: Yeah.
[36:45] A: That underneath the surface, affect stuff. Right. Because what you want to do is you want to have the freedom to be able to share what's going on with you.
[36:54] B: Yeah.
[36:55] A: Right. Versus bottle it up or.
[36:58] B: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[36:59] A: Right, Right. It would be nice to have the freedom to give or get a hug if that's what you had wanted, where right now there's no freedom to. Even if you wanted one. Yeah, Can't. Yeah, got it.
[37:18] B: Yeah.
[37:19] A: So we know then that based on a lot of what you had gone through, there wasn't really great people to attach to.
[37:27] B: Yeah.
[37:29] A: Makes sense. So that would create attachment challenges. Yeah, got it.
[37:34] B: Yeah.
[37:36] A: Second thing, when we're little children. Right. We're all trained to believe good is good, bad is because I've done something wrong.
[37:45] B: Yeah.
[37:46] A: And we're also all trained to believe that I need the people around me in my life in order for me to turn out, let alone turn out okay.
[37:55] B: Yeah.
[37:56] A: Right. Because as a baby, I am useless.
[37:59] B: Yeah.
[38:00] A: I don't do anything for myself. I am 100 dependent on somebody else doing everything for me.
[38:06] B: Yeah.
[38:07] A: Right. Maybe I've got the technique that can get the boot, but they still got to bring me over. Like, there's nothing that a baby does. So we have the longest incubation period as human beings. Right. And so because of that, we are most dependent on our caregivers during that time to nurture, bathe, feed, change, do take care of all that kind of stuff.
[38:30] B: Yes.
[38:31] A: Make sense. So it gives us a false belief when we're a child that we need our parents and we need our parents to be okay in order for us to be okay. And I say it's a false belief because it's what I thought I needed from them back then. Right. Like, so I've worked with somebody who, you know, their dad wasn't very loving, wasn't present, wasn't there, wasn't connected, wasn't yet. They're a, you know, really loving dad.
[39:08] B: Yeah.
[39:09] A: And the idea might be. Well, based on what you didn't get, you. You are more of it. Right. I don't know if you've been able to do if. If they've done this with you. A genogram.
[39:19] B: Yeah.
[39:20] A: Right.
[39:20] B: That. Before I came here.
[39:22] A: Yeah. So when you think about the genogram, doesn't it all explain to you where you came from?
[39:28] B: Yeah, yeah.
[39:29] A: The different family Members that also have similar afflictions to what you had. Oh, yeah, mom, grandmom, whatever. All the other stuff and how you. You got born into the system that gave you the roles that led you to have the kinds of choices you had that led you to do what you did.
[39:50] B: Yeah.
[39:51] A: Make sense.
[39:52] B: Yeah.
[39:54] A: That we can all get up here and understand and totally get it. Where it sometimes doesn't register, though, is I know better, but I don't feel better because, again, when those moments were happening and I was younger, my brain didn't know that it wasn't about me. My brain doesn't know that it's over. Makes sense.
[40:18] B: Yeah.
[40:19] A: So again, as we're organizing towards the you present and clear and free and connected and grounded and at peace and seeing clearly. Right. As we organize towards this you again, the other part of your brain is going to travel back down the timeline of moments in your history, growing you younger and earlier, and bring you to another moment that would be useful to unplug. Yeah. What's coming to mind now?
[40:54] B: My mom going to prison.
[40:56] A: What's that?
[40:56] B: My mom going to prison.
[40:58] A: Yeah. So you might have been how old?
[41:00] B: I was in high school from ninth grade.
[41:03] A: Yeah. So you're like, in ninth grade. And like, how did you find out? Where are you as this happens?
[41:08] B: I'm at the neighbor's house.
[41:09] A: You're at the neighbor's house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[41:12] B: Nighttime.
[41:12] A: Night time. And you're, like, spending the night there?
[41:14] B: No, I went over there because they were fighting.
[41:16] A: Oh, so mom and dad were fighting? Mom and whoever person was. Yeah, they were fighting. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[41:24] B: Police showed up.
[41:25] A: She went over there because they were fighting. Police showed up. Right. Good job, Good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[41:30] B: She got taken away.
[41:32] A: So you were looking out the window or you were outside?
[41:34] B: Yeah.
[41:35] A: So you look out the window, you saw the police have her, put her in cuffs, put in the car and drive away?
[41:41] B: Yeah.
[41:41] A: Right, Right. And then what happened next?
[41:44] B: CPS worker showed up at the neighbor's.
[41:46] A: House the next day or that night?
[41:48] B: The next day.
[41:48] A: Yeah. Right. So. So then you'd gone to bed, and then CVS work was there. Right. Then what happened next?
[41:53] B: I went to foster care.
[41:55] A: You went to foster care. Right. And then what happened next?
[41:57] B: And see my mom. And she went to prison.
[42:00] A: She went to prison. Right. Then what happened next?
[42:03] B: She came home.
[42:04] A: Right. Eventually she came home.
[42:06] B: Yeah.
[42:07] A: Right. But later on, you did something more fun, like see your son.
[42:09] B: Yeah.
[42:10] A: Right. Or go to the seafood festival.
[42:11] B: Yeah.
[42:12] A: Right.
[42:12] B: Yeah.
[42:13] A: Got it.
[42:13] B: Yeah.
[42:14] A: Her go to the beach. Yeah, we going to the beach. We got the seafood festival. We got seeing your son.
[42:18] B: Yeah.
[42:18] A: Right. Then mom was back.
[42:20] B: Yeah.
[42:20] A: Right. And then you were staying in foster.
[42:22] B: Yeah.
[42:22] A: And then you got put in foster. And then they had come to the neighbor's house, and then you'd gone to bed, and then you'd see mom taken away, and then the police took her out. And then they were fighting.
[42:30] B: Yeah.
[42:30] A: And then you'd gone over to the neighbor's house. And then before that, they were fighting.
[42:33] B: Yeah.
[42:34] A: Then before that, you'd gotten home.
[42:36] B: Yeah.
[42:36] A: Right. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, what are you noticing?
[42:42] B: It doesn't feel like so much like attached. Like it's there.
[42:46] A: Right. You can remember that happening? You can remember putting on your shoes. Yeah, well, stop putting on your shoes. Well, then stop that from happening. So then where is it? Say it doesn't exist. Right. Right. And close your eyes and let that earlier, you know what you know now? One, that it's over, that no longer exists. And of course, mom doing that and being that way, nothing to do with you. You or even her love for you had to do with that. Mom's not well. That's right. You didn't need mom to be well in order for you to be okay.
[43:16] B: I need mom to be well for me.
[43:18] A: Right. Let her know that, you know, you're in foster, but you have to see mom later. Let her know about seeing your son.
[43:23] B: I had to see my son.
[43:24] A: Right. And the seafood festival. It was so I'd go to the beach. Right.
[43:28] B: Beautiful.
[43:30] A: And again, as it gets in, what do you notice?
[43:32] B: So happier.
[43:33] A: So. Yeah. And you can open your eyes. Right. Because those are the things, Heather, that we want to unplug. Right. Because that's been dimming your light. Makes sense.
[43:50] B: Yeah.
[43:50] A: Yeah. And even though you know better now, as an adult, it wasn't coded that way in your brain.
[43:57] B: Yeah.
[43:58] A: So that's why we're interested in changing and healing. Right. Lower your jaw slightly. You know, relax the back of your tongue and breathe a little slower and deeper, exhaling a little bit longer. Noticing that with your eyes closed, they rest. As your eyes rest, you rest. That's right. And see, as you're resting, everything that needs to happen is an action happening within you automatically. Right. Becoming more free and light. And as you're becoming more free and light, your unconscious will travel back again down that timeline and bring another moment for us to clear, heal. What comes to mind now?
[45:03] B: My dog dying.
[45:05] A: Huh?
[45:06] B: My dog dying. Yeah, I love that dog.
[45:09] A: Right, right. So as you're thinking about it now, what are you noticing? What is the part that's troubling?
[45:18] B: She was like family, then she was gone.
[45:22] A: This happened when?
[45:25] B: 10 years ago?
[45:26] A: Yeah. Right. And. And this was a dog that you had on your own?
[45:32] B: Yeah, I got her for mine my seventh birthday. Let me pick her up from the pound.
[45:37] A: Yeah, got it.
[45:40] B: Yeah.
[45:40] A: Okay, so this was a dog that you had through a lot of stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the part that's going on now, as you're thinking about it, just check. I know it's a weird question, but as you're thinking about it now, what about it's troubling.
[45:59] B: I miss her. It was hard to see her, like.
[46:04] A: Oh, it's the moment again.
[46:05] B: Yeah, yeah.
[46:06] A: Right, right. And see what happens when we go through those troubling moments is. Is it short circuits and part doesn't know it ended. Right. So the memory of that and the experience of it are glued. So when that happened and you, you know, dog passed away, where were you when that happened?
[46:29] B: At the bed.
[46:31] A: So you're. So the dog wasn't doing well and you were noticing that the dog wasn't doing well. Right. And so then you took the dog to the vet. Right. And then you're at the vet and the vet's saying what? Have to put her down because she's not doing well. Yeah. So we have to put her down. Right, good. And then what happened next?
[46:51] B: I cried.
[46:52] A: Right, good. And then what happened?
[46:53] B: And we went home.
[46:55] A: Well, you cried?
[46:56] B: Yeah.
[46:57] A: You when the dog went home?
[46:59] B: No, me and my mom.
[47:01] A: So you were there.
[47:02] B: Yeah.
[47:02] A: Right. Did you hold the dog?
[47:03] B: Yeah.
[47:04] A: Right. And then she put the.
[47:06] B: Yeah.
[47:06] A: And then the dog's body was there, but the dog wasn't anymore.
[47:11] B: Yeah.
[47:13] A: Makes sense. Yeah, the dog's body was there. That's why it felt different.
[47:16] B: Yeah.
[47:17] A: Like as soon as. Not there, which wasn't as soon as the injection went in. You follow me with that?
[47:24] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[47:25] A: But there was a moment that who your dog is for you is in her body and then was no longer in her body. Make sense? Yeah, I know it's a weird way to think of it.
[47:37] B: Yeah.
[47:38] A: Right, right. And then you went home.
[47:40] B: Yeah.
[47:41] A: And then later on you did something more fun.
[47:43] B: Yeah.
[47:43] A: Right. Like go to the seafood festival.
[47:44] B: Yeah.
[47:45] A: Right, right. And see, we haven't been connecting to more of who she is for you. Your dog is a boy or girl? Girl.
[47:52] B: Girl.
[47:52] A: Right. So who she is for you? Right. So again, we got going to the Seafood festival, Seeing your son.
[47:58] B: Yeah. So fun.
[47:59] A: Right? So fun. Right. And then before that you're back home and then you and your mom had driven home and then you were crying and then the doc or then body stopped and the doc had done the injection. Then the doc said you got to. Or the vet.
[48:14] B: Yeah.
[48:15] A: Right. And then you brought it there.
[48:17] B: Yeah.
[48:17] A: And then you noticed things were off.
[48:19] B: Yeah.
[48:20] A: And then before that you were doing whatever you're doing.
[48:22] B: Yeah.
[48:22] A: Right. And again, as it goes backwards all the way, check inside of you now. And what do you notice?
[48:30] B: I know. It's not happening.
[48:32] A: Right, Right. And you can remember it. And you can remember putting on your sweatshirt.
[48:38] B: Yeah.
[48:38] A: Well stop putting on your sweatshirt.
[48:40] B: I'm not putting on my sweat.
[48:41] A: Cuz it was cold this morning at 4.
[48:42] B: Oh yeah.
[48:43] A: Yeah. Freezing.
[48:44] B: Oh boy.
[48:44] A: Wasn't it?
[48:45] B: Yeah, yeah. So cold.
[48:47] A: Like 40 something.
[48:48] B: I know. What's going on with that?
[48:50] A: We live in Florida. We only have a few days of it.
[48:55] B: Thank goodness.
[48:56] A: That's right. Right, right, right. So as you think of that now, what do you notice? What a great, you know, a great dog. Yeah. Over through those years.
[49:07] B: Yeah. How much fun. I used to put makeup on her. And jewelry.
[49:11] A: Right, right. She was good with it all.
[49:15] B: Yeah, Right. She had a good life.
[49:18] A: Yeah. I'll let my human do whatever the hell they wanted me.
[49:20] B: Yeah.
[49:21] A: They're gonna feed me, take care of me. I'm good.
[49:24] B: Yeah.
[49:25] A: Right, right. And now as you're thinking of her, there's more joy in the memories.
[49:30] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[49:31] A: Right. Because you're accessing more of who she is. Right. No longer hurting.
[49:36] B: Yeah.
[49:38] A: Right. So close your eyes and let that earlier, you know, back then. That she's no longer hurting.
[49:46] B: She's no longer.
[49:47] A: That's right. She's okay. That you're okay.
[49:53] B: She's okay. I'm okay.
[49:54] A: Right. And that's opening up access to more of who she is. Right, Right. We can't be missing what I'm connected to. Right, Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[50:16] B: Yeah.
[50:16] A: Huh? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So again, as you're checking inside of you, what are you noticing?
[50:24] B: It's okay. You know, it's okay. She's gone.
[50:27] A: It is okay.
[50:28] B: Yeah.
[50:29] A: Yeah. You're okay.
[50:30] B: Yeah.
[50:30] A: Right. Because she's not really gone.
[50:32] B: No.
[50:32] A: Right. Because you can remember putting makeup on her.
[50:34] B: Yeah.
[50:35] A: Right, Right. Having fun.
[50:38] B: Yeah. Cool.
[50:40] A: Right? It's cool. Yeah. Because you get access to her now.
[50:44] B: Yeah.
[50:45] A: Right. You hadn't. Because that was in the way.
[50:47] B: Yeah.
[50:48] A: And that's what we're doing. Is we're rewiring, we're opening up more ways of being. Right. So I've got more freedom when the situation, circumstances and things ar. Yeah. Because the person who's got the most amount of flexibility, the most options, they have the most power always.
[51:13] B: I like that.
[51:14] A: Yeah. Yeah. So again, slightly lower your jaw, relax your tongue and breathe. Ride a little slower and deeper. That's right. Drift down inside towards delight. Delight at your center. As you are becoming more okay in you. As you lighten up, things are changing. And sometimes changing is in the way you think they'll be changing yet other times changing in ways that you're not thinking they're changing yet. And see, I don't know where you'll be when you realize how much you've changed. And I'm not sure how you'll know how much you've changed. But what I do know is, is that your unconscious knows that's right. As it's rewiring on the inside. Your healing energy all throughout mind and body healing. That's right. And once again, because your unconscious knows it's going to pinpoint the next moment for us to unplug and heal. Take a deep breath in. And one more deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Yeah. How's your body feeling now?
[53:31] B: Relaxed.
[53:31] A: It is relaxed, isn't it? Yeah. Isn't that a nice feeling?
[53:35] B: Yeah.
[53:35] A: Yeah. And as your body's feeling relaxed and your unconscious goes back, what's the moment that comes to mind?
[53:41] B: Now your first time going to jail?
[53:44] A: Yeah. Right, right. That happened how long ago?
[53:49] B: 2009.
[53:50] A: 2009?
[53:51] B: Yeah.
[53:52] A: Great year. Oh, yeah. So how did that happen? You're aware in what happened?
[53:59] B: Yeah, my house got raided for selling drugs.
[54:04] A: So you were in a house that was selling drugs?
[54:06] B: Yeah.
[54:06] A: Right. And you were selling them?
[54:08] B: Yeah.
[54:08] A: Okay.
[54:09] B: And then they busted in.
[54:11] A: So they came in.
[54:12] B: Yeah.
[54:13] A: Right. And it's you and other people. Me and my boyfriend were there. Yeah, Right. They came in, they seized the drugs.
[54:19] B: And put us on the ground with guns for you.
[54:22] A: That's right. Good. And then what happened next?
[54:24] B: Put us a handcuffs in the back of the car.
[54:26] A: Right, Good. Then what happened next?
[54:27] B: Went to jail.
[54:28] A: Right. Then what happened? Got processed?
[54:32] B: Yeah, yeah.
[54:32] A: Right. Got the little jumper. Yeah, right.
[54:36] B: Awful.
[54:36] A: Behind the bars?
[54:38] B: Yeah.
[54:38] A: Right. Then what happened?
[54:40] B: I got out.
[54:41] A: You got out?
[54:42] B: Yeah.
[54:42] A: And then that was over?
[54:44] B: Yeah.
[54:44] A: And then later on you got to see your son.
[54:46] B: Yeah.
[54:46] A: And go to the seafood faster.
[54:48] B: Yeah.
[54:48] A: Right. So we had to go into the seafood. We got seeing your son yeah. Right. Then you got getting out.
[54:53] B: Yeah.
[54:53] A: And then you got being there.
[54:54] B: Yeah.
[54:54] A: Then you got getting processed.
[54:56] B: Yeah.
[54:57] A: And then you have being driven there and put in the back of the cop car and then cuffed.
[55:01] B: Yeah.
[55:01] A: And then picked up and then down on the ground with guns pointed and then they busted in.
[55:06] B: Yeah.
[55:06] A: Then before that you guys were like.
[55:08] B: Yeah, yeah. Not worried about anything.
[55:11] A: Right. And again, as it goes backwards, what do you notice?
[55:16] B: It's not happening.
[55:18] A: Right. Close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You and let her know that's over. That experience no longer exists and you're no longer in jail.
[55:27] B: My experience no longer exist.
[55:29] A: I'm no longer let her know about going to the seafood festival and seeing her son. Right.
[55:33] B: See my son.
[55:34] A: Yeah. And as it gets in, what do you notice?
[55:36] B: I feel better.
[55:38] A: Yeah. You can open your eyes. Right, Right. Because it's not running you. Right, Right.
[55:45] B: It's a good thing.
[55:47] A: It is a good thing. Yeah, yeah. So as you think about that stuff, how many times in jail Was it all drug related?
[55:54] B: Yeah.
[55:56] A: Seven times in jail. Any prison?
[55:58] B: No.
[55:59] A: No. Okay, but seven times in jail.
[56:01] B: Yeah.
[56:01] A: All for different stints of time.
[56:03] B: Yeah.
[56:04] A: And all for drug related shit.
[56:06] B: Yeah.
[56:07] A: Cool. We probably want to stay away from that stuff.
[56:09] B: Yeah, I'm working on it.
[56:13] A: You and that stuff don't seem to mix very well. So I do the best I can to stay far, far away from that stuff.
[56:20] B: Yeah. I never want to go to that place again.
[56:22] A: No. It doesn't work for you?
[56:23] B: No, no.
[56:24] A: Not the right place for you.
[56:25] B: No.
[56:27] A: Yeah. Well, sometimes, you know, the seventh time is a charm.
[56:30] B: Right. Fact the judge is like, next time's prison is the lucky charm.
[56:37] A: Oh. Oh, okay, good. So now we make it so you have to be there for more than a year.
[56:41] B: Yeah.
[56:41] A: Yeah. You don't want to do that.
[56:44] B: No.
[56:44] A: Right. You want to be a better version of you.
[56:46] B: Yeah, yeah.
[56:47] A: So whatever motivation I needed to start me in the right direction to become a better version of me, I'll take.
[56:51] B: Yeah, yeah.
[56:53] A: Right.
[56:54] B: Yeah.
[56:54] A: Yeah. And then I want different motivation.
[56:57] B: Yeah. Getting better, healthier.
[57:01] A: Getting healthier. Having a better relationship with my kid.
[57:05] B: Yeah.
[57:06] A: Right.
[57:08] B: Being productive in our society.
[57:10] A: Yeah. Like all sorts of things get to happen.
[57:13] B: Yeah.
[57:15] A: Cool.
[57:16] B: Right, Right.
[57:17] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in your life, had there been any kind of sex stuff that happened as a kid?
[57:28] B: As a kid, when I was like a teenager.
[57:31] A: Like a teenager, yeah. Something that was unwanted.
[57:34] B: Yeah.
[57:34] A: Yeah. Well, let's get that cleared too. That one. You might have been how old?
[57:43] B: 15.
[57:43] A: 15. And you might have been Where?
[57:45] B: I was at a party.
[57:47] A: So you're at a party. Right. So you'd gone over to somebody's house.
[57:50] B: Yeah.
[57:50] A: Right.
[57:51] B: Started drinking.
[57:52] A: Of course. Because that's what you do at a party.
[57:54] B: And then a guy, 22.
[57:55] A: Right.
[57:56] B: You know, next thing I know, I'm waking up and he's on top of me.
[57:59] A: Right. So you're with the guy. He, like, kind of flirt a little bit, maybe?
[58:02] B: Yeah.
[58:02] A: Right. And then all of a sudden, like, because you're wasted.
[58:04] B: Yeah.
[58:04] A: You wake up and he's like, on a bed.
[58:06] B: Yeah.
[58:07] A: You're on a bed. He's on top of you.
[58:09] B: Yeah.
[58:09] A: And are your pants down?
[58:10] B: Yeah.
[58:11] A: And he's got his penis in your vagina.
[58:12] B: Yeah.
[58:12] A: And that's how you wake up. Good morning. What the. Yeah, Sorry. Then what happened next?
[58:19] B: I started crying and he covered my mouth and continued.
[58:21] A: Right, good. And then what happened next?
[58:23] B: I was done.
[58:24] A: He was done.
[58:25] B: Oh, yeah. He was.
[58:25] A: Right. He was done.
[58:26] B: Yeah.
[58:26] A: Right. He stopped.
[58:28] B: Yeah.
[58:28] A: Right. Then he took his penis out.
[58:30] B: Yeah.
[58:30] A: Right. And then he left.
[58:31] B: Yeah.
[58:31] A: And all of that was better than when he was doing it.
[58:33] B: Yeah.
[58:34] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[58:36] B: Yeah.
[58:37] A: Right. Like go to the seafood festival.
[58:39] B: Yeah.
[58:39] A: Right. Or see your son.
[58:40] B: Yeah.
[58:40] A: Right. Or go to the beach.
[58:41] B: Yeah.
[58:42] A: Right. So we gotta go into the beach. Going to the seafood festival. Seeing your son way better. Right, Right. And then you probably got, you know, clothes on.
[58:49] B: Yeah.
[58:49] A: Right. And then he had left and then he had stopped. And then he took his penis out.
[58:52] B: Yeah.
[58:53] A: Right. And then he had his penis in.
[58:54] B: Yeah.
[58:55] A: And then you had woken up and then he put his penis in.
[58:57] B: Yeah.
[58:58] A: And then before that, you had been drinking.
[59:00] B: Yeah.
[59:00] A: Then you gone to the party.
[59:01] B: Yeah.
[59:02] A: Right. Then before that, you're home.
[59:04] B: Yeah.
[59:04] A: Right. And again, as it goes backwards, what do you notice?
[59:07] B: It doesn't bother me.
[59:08] A: Right, Right. Because he didn't touch who you really are. Right. Because check it out. There's no part of your body now that's the same as it was then.
[59:21] B: No.
[59:22] A: Like, everything's changed millions of times.
[59:25] B: Oh, yeah.
[59:25] A: So he never touched you. You. He messed with your stuff.
[59:28] B: Yeah.
[59:29] A: He didn't actually get you.
[59:30] B: Yeah.
[59:31] A: Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing?
[59:33] B: Yeah.
[59:34] A: Yeah, yeah. Right. Cool. Right. And that's what's starting to get in. So again, close your eyes. Picture that earlier, you. And let her know it's over. No longer exists.
[59:44] B: No longer. It's over.
[59:46] A: That's right. Let her know that that happening wasn't about you, it was about him.
[59:50] B: The happy wasn't about me. It was about.
[59:52] A: That's right. In that he never touched me.
[59:55] B: He never touched me.
[59:56] A: Right. Let her know that he never touched me.
[59:58] B: He never touched me.
[59:59] A: He messed with my stuff. Sure. Screwed up my thinking and feelings.
[60:03] B: Yeah.
[60:04] A: But he never touched me.
[60:06] B: But he never touched me.
[60:07] A: Right. So that she gets it.
[60:09] B: Yeah.
[60:10] A: Right. As the earlier. He gets it. What do you notice?
[60:16] B: Part of me.
[60:17] A: That's right. It's not a part of you. It never was. Right. And that's clear now.
[60:23] B: Yeah.
[60:24] A: Isn't that a good news thing?
[60:25] B: Yes.
[60:26] A: Yeah.
[60:27] B: Yeah. Cool.
[60:29] A: Cool.
[60:30] B: Yeah.
[60:31] A: Right, Right. So as you're checking in, what are you noticing now?
[60:35] B: I feel better.
[60:36] A: You do also. What feels better?
[60:39] B: Just like being here right now, you know, not having the past lay heavy on me.
[60:46] A: Right.
[60:47] B: And it's not happening. I'm just here right now in the room with you.
[60:50] A: Right. Notice how the past stuff's not laying heavy on you.
[60:53] B: Yeah.
[60:55] A: Right. So how concerned are we about what others think?
[60:59] B: Shouldn't be at all. No.
[61:01] A: If the past stuff isn't laying so heavy on you, I'm not worried about it. How concerned are you about what they think? Right. Because you're not learning about you, you're learning about them.
[61:14] B: Yeah.
[61:15] A: So if your son's father is nervous about having you get close to your son and then relapsing and doesn't want him to get hurt in that way, you're going, I get it. That's okay.
[61:33] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[61:34] A: Yeah. I also don't want to hurt him.
[61:37] B: Yeah.
[61:38] A: And I also have the commitment that, you know, I'm staying clean and clear.
[61:43] B: Yeah.
[61:44] A: Yeah. Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[61:48] B: Yeah, definitely is.
[61:50] A: Yeah. And that's how we're thinking of it.
[61:53] B: Yeah.
[61:54] A: We're learning about him. We would want him to that have that same thing, whether it was you or somebody else that was the kid's mom.
[62:03] B: Yeah.
[62:06] A: Right. It wouldn't matter whether it was you in the situation or somebody else that had.
[62:10] B: Yeah.
[62:10] A: We'd want them to do this. Want them to be the same way.
[62:13] B: Yeah.
[62:14] A: Right, Right.
[62:17] B: Yeah.
[62:17] A: Yeah. And you're getting it. Right.
[62:19] B: Yeah.
[62:20] A: Right. And even when you think about that thing that happened at 15 now, what do you notice?
[62:24] B: Does it bother me?
[62:26] A: It doesn't. No. Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Are there other things that you've found yourself having done to you or that you had to do that you think about that? Yeah. Still has a little bit of.
[62:44] B: I thought a lot of it go.
[62:46] A: You know, what does that mean?
[62:48] B: I'm like, when I prostituted Myself, I used to feel like no man would ever want me, but I know that's not who I am today.
[62:56] A: Yeah, yeah.
[62:58] B: I had to work through that a lot though.
[63:00] A: Oh, okay. Would you want that completely gone?
[63:02] B: Yeah.
[63:04] A: Right. Because you've been feeling bad over having done that. Yeah, yeah. Well, that happened during what period of time?
[63:12] B: 19 to 26.
[63:14] A: 19 to 26. Right. And did anybody have get money from you?
[63:18] B: At first? Yeah.
[63:19] A: So you had a trafficker. Yeah, at first. Or pimp or whatever we want to call him.
[63:23] B: Yeah.
[63:24] A: And then what happened?
[63:25] B: He went to prison.
[63:26] A: Oh. So then I didn't have to pay him anymore.
[63:28] B: Yeah.
[63:29] A: But I was still doing the same thing.
[63:31] B: Yeah.
[63:32] A: Got it. Okay. And when you think about having done that then in the life. Right. And there was money and other stuff that came when you think. And probably drug stuff too.
[63:43] B: Yeah.
[63:43] A: I mean, I'm not thinking that all the time. You were, you know, completely sober as you were doing it.
[63:47] B: Yeah, Definitely not.
[63:50] A: Right. Like got it. Right. There may be some moments where yuckiness about it is there.
[64:00] B: Yeah.
[64:00] A: Right. Because the experience that I have in working with lots of survivors is that there, it's yucky overall. But there are people that it's easier. Maybe it's a, you know, person who's kind or a long term customer or, or, or where with those people it's a little bit easier to do. And then there's some people that I'm completely grotesque and disgusted by and I can't not do it. Yeah, yeah, got it. So that's where it kind of gets stuck sometimes. So one we want to get in certainly that where people get screwed up is they go, because it's something that I did. That means that's part of who I am. Right. And so we can go to the esoteric world of things. We can go, you know, the first question is, who are you? Right. And people answer with their name.
[64:50] B: Yeah.
[64:51] A: They're going to know that's your name. Who are you? And then the person tells them what they do for a profession, they go, no, no, that's what you do. Right. Who are you? Right. And they're trying to think like, well, and the idea of the question who are you? Is to begin to realize that who you are is different based on whom you are with and where you're at and what part of life.
[65:19] B: Yeah.
[65:20] A: Who are you though? And that's not even me. I'm not any of the things I do. And the idea is, no matter what I think I am at any one time, I'm Always more than just that.
[65:35] B: I like that.
[65:36] A: Yeah. So what we want fully installed is that those actions were just things that you did then that you couldn't have not done then, based on the life in situations you had that led you to do the things that you do.
[65:54] B: Yeah.
[65:55] A: Right. So we really want to be at peace. That although I don't like any of the stuff that I did then or any of the stuff that happened to me that couldn't have not happened. In the same way, if there's a branch broken and on the ground. Right. And the lightning bolt hit it, we know given that it's broken and on the ground, there's no way the lightning bolt could have not hit the tree there.
[66:19] B: Yeah.
[66:19] A: We also know, given that it hit the tree there, there's no way the branch could have not been broken and on the ground.
[66:25] B: Yeah.
[66:26] A: Makes sense. So we want it kind of in that way that it's fully integrated.
[66:34] B: Thank you.
[66:35] A: Right. That although I don't like any of that based on, it couldn't have not happened exactly the way it happened. Second thing is, although those are things that I've done, none of it makes up who I am, because who I am is not determined by my past. Who I am is an unfolding of who I'm becoming, which is an ongoing process. And the who I'm becoming is someone who's much more okay and comfortable and lighter and more at peace and even more open. Right, right. And again, as we're thinking of this, you take that deep breath in, exhale, and eyes rest closed. As eyes rest closed, you rest just simply resting deeper and deeper on the inside. Because the coolest part is that you know that your fingers are interlocked and your feet are crossed. But what's really cool is that you didn't consciously decide to interlock your fingers that way, cross your feet that way. Who did it for you? Oh, that's right. It's your unconscious responding and organizing, healing and changing and getting information in at the deepest level. Right. And because it's a big generalization and because we're getting clear that none of that stuff couldn't have not happened, and you're not any of those things you've done. That's never been you. That's right. Your unconscious is going to bring a particular time that as that one is unplugged, it sends a ripple effect to the rest, so that you get to be fully free, present, at peace, and clear, distanced and done. That's right. With this stuff, that's not about me. I'm definitely not what I've done. And so once again, when you're ready, big deep breath in, eyes are open. Good job. Yeah. And see a particular moment, if one of those moments is going to come to mind for us to unplug. Right. One of those ones that when you think about it, it's got yuckiness attached.
[69:41] B: To my dad drive it away on Father's Day.
[69:46] A: Yeah. So what's. You're aware how old. What happened?
[69:50] B: I was five.
[69:51] A: You're five. Right. And you'd gotten up and My parents.
[69:55] B: Separated two days before. So my mom took me to get a big card and we tried to meet him at the gas station and he just drove away.
[70:03] A: Right. So you went with mom to get a card. Right. Mom trying to do the thing. Right. You try to meet him at a gas station.
[70:11] B: Yeah.
[70:12] A: Which is where he was getting gas.
[70:15] B: Yeah.
[70:16] A: So you tried to catch up to him getting gas. He may or may not even have seen you.
[70:21] B: Yeah.
[70:21] A: We don't know.
[70:22] B: Yeah.
[70:22] A: And then he drove away. Right. Then what happened? Right Then what happened? Right. That you back then in that moment. Because as you think about it now, we know that it happened, but it's not happening.
[70:35] B: Yeah.
[70:36] A: Just like, you know, you're not putting on your shoes.
[70:38] B: Yeah.
[70:38] A: Right. She's getting that. That's not happening now.
[70:40] B: Yeah.
[70:41] A: Right. And that that happening had nothing to do with you or his love for you. Right. Had everything to do with whatever was going on with him. You know that now.
[70:51] B: Yeah.
[70:51] A: Let her know. Close your eyes. Picture younger. You let her know. That's right. It's not about me. It had everything to do with him.
[70:59] B: And do everything with him.
[71:00] A: Right. And things were off with daddy wasn't well.
[71:02] B: Daddy wasn't well.
[71:04] A: But I didn't need a well dad in order for me to love my son. That's right. That's right.
[71:12] B: Yeah.
[71:13] A: Notice how that's true. Yeah, it is, isn't it? Yeah, that's right. Same thing with you didn't need a well mom in order for you to love your son. Yeah, that's right. Right. And do stuff to heal and choose to change your life for the better. Right. That's what you're doing.
[71:34] B: Yeah.
[71:34] A: Right. On your own.
[71:37] B: Yeah.
[71:38] A: Right. Which means you don't need others. Right. But it's nice sometimes to share with others. Yeah, that's right. Sometimes it's nice to break bread with others.
[71:50] B: Yeah.
[71:51] A: Right, Right. Right. And that doesn't mean I lay down all my cards.
[71:57] B: Yeah.
[72:00] A: Right. It's not like open or closed. It's like I'm getting to know.
[72:05] B: Yeah.
[72:07] A: Right. I get to be curious.
[72:09] B: Yeah.
[72:10] A: And curious about them.
[72:11] B: Yeah. That's cool.
[72:14] A: And that's what you want to be, is curious.
[72:16] B: Yeah, I'm curious.
[72:18] A: I get to learn.
[72:19] B: Yeah.
[72:20] A: Right.
[72:20] B: That's cool.
[72:21] A: Right. Right. So go back to thinking about any of the times where you'd been doing that, where you had the guy that, before he was arrested, was the pimp. But then having done it and knowing that there were certain guys that it was easier with than other guys that, like, you were, like, really, like, grossed out. Because I. Right. And you can remember that there was a time that you were grossed out when you had to do it with that guy.
[72:46] B: Yeah.
[72:47] A: Right. And you can remember doing it with that guy when you're grossed out. But you can also remember putting on your Duncan jacket.
[72:53] B: Yeah.
[72:54] A: Well, stop putting on your Duncan jacket. Right. Well, then stop doing that with that guy. Well, then stop it from happening. Right. And what do you notice?
[73:04] B: Feels better.
[73:05] A: It does feel better, doesn't it? Right. Right. Because I'm not that.
[73:09] B: Yeah.
[73:09] A: That isn't me.
[73:10] B: Yeah.
[73:11] A: Right. Cool. Cool.
[73:14] B: Yeah.
[73:14] A: So even think about, you know, your son's dad going. Well. Yeah. I mean, you gotta prove a lot longer than, you know, just a few short weeks and a couple phone calls that you're not gonna go back to being an addict because you're always an addict and you've never not been an addict. And you're gonna be.
[73:28] B: Yeah.
[73:30] A: And what do you notice?
[73:32] B: Doesn't bother me.
[73:33] A: I know. Because we're not learning about you. We're learning about his concern.
[73:40] B: Yeah.
[73:43] A: Right. For your son, it's well being. Yeah.
[73:47] B: That's so cool.
[73:48] A: I know. Isn't it?
[73:49] B: Yeah.
[73:49] A: Notice how you're feeling it differently now.
[73:51] B: Yeah.
[73:53] A: Yeah. And that's what's changing.
[73:57] B: It's cool.
[73:57] A: It is cool. Right? I mean, there's lots of stuff that's different.
[74:02] B: Yeah.
[74:02] A: Right. Different than it was. Right. Which makes it easier to move through now. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So you have the opportunity to be in the halfway house for an extended period of time. When you're in the halfway house, do they have, like a lower rent?
[74:29] B: I pay 185 a week.
[74:31] A: Okay.
[74:32] B: Yeah. Nipified washer and dryer, all the hygiene stuff. Soap, cleaning supplies.
[74:39] A: Beautiful.
[74:40] B: Yeah.
[74:41] A: Okay. That's cool.
[74:42] B: Yeah.
[74:43] A: What do you do? Are you good with money? Starting to be like, are you? Well, there we go. We got the answer to that. What is starting to be mean.
[74:55] B: I did that. Downloaded or deleted TEMU machine Walmart and Amazon off my phone.
[75:03] A: Okay, good. Because those are things that would draw you in to buy.
[75:06] B: Yeah. Oh, they send me deals and then I'm bored and I start shopping. I have outfits in my closet. I haven't even wore it, like more than one.
[75:13] A: Yeah, right, right, right. Well, we have to be thinking of it. Right? So I'll give it to you in this way. I don't think we teach people how to do money very well. No, not in this country we don't. And there's like a secret thing that people who have money know to do and then they don't share it. But there's a major difference. And the major difference is somebody who's not good with money is living in a paycheck by paycheck way and is thinking about their bills on a day to day, week by week basis. Like, okay, so I know that this bill, my phone bills coming up here and I got to make sure they got enough money to pay the phone bill. And then I'm working to the next thing. So I make sure they got an underpay this. And, and of course, because I'm working hard, then I feel like I deserve.
[76:05] B: Yeah.
[76:05] A: You know, nice things because I worked really hard. I worked like 60 hours this week. So like I should deserve to reward myself for working so hard, you know, to buy shit. Right. Like, but they're thinking of it on a, on a day by day, week by week basis.
[76:19] B: Yeah.
[76:20] A: And there's not a lot of forethought to future plans. Yeah, makes sense.
[76:26] B: Yeah.
[76:27] A: So a person who is good with money doesn't think about money on a day to day or week by week basis. They know that monthly certain bills get paid and they have money in their accounts to pay it.
[76:41] B: Yeah.
[76:42] A: And they plan.
[76:44] B: Yeah.
[76:45] A: So they have money that they've been putting in an emergency fund. They have money that they've been putting in a long term savings plan, but for spending like they're going on a summer vacation there.
[76:55] B: Yeah.
[76:55] A: Like, so out of what they make their thinking further ahead, they're learning how to live on less than what they make so that they're always building more. Do you follow me with that? Where somebody who's not good with money is literally going paycheck to paycheck and sometimes one bad thing happening away from the whole thing going to do you follow me with that?
[77:30] B: Yeah.
[77:31] A: So like in the world of worlds, they talk about that you want to have your fixed expenses to be like 55% of how much money you make. Right. And Fixed expenses would be things like gas, clothing, rent, cell phone. Cell phone medicine. Right. Those are fixed costs. Right. And those fixed costs are supposed to be about 55 to 60% of what you make. Right. And then other monies go to a investment, an emergency and a. What we like to call guilt free spending. Right. So one of the things that I don't think we do well and I don't think Salah's done well, is how do we teach the women about how to set themselves up with money so that we get them out of the day by day, week by week. Making sure I've got enough just to pay this.
[78:40] B: Yeah.
[78:42] A: But not really going, okay. I get online and I order this thing, which doesn't really make sense. I'm not even wearing it. Right. That could cost me the ability to pay for this thing. That. Because I didn't put anything in. In a emergency fund.
[78:58] B: Very true.
[78:59] A: Right.
[79:00] B: Yeah.
[79:00] A: And in. That's part of what we want to learn. There's, there's lots of stuff you can do on your own. There's a great podcast, there's books on tape that you can get the guy. Raymit Sadie, he does a podcast with couples and talks about their money psychology. He's really good at understanding that kind of stuff. But that's one of those things where, oh, I'm trying to get better at it. Yeah. So you don't have an understanding. Even if somebody came up with a budget, you don't really have an understanding of, well, what is my fixed costs?
[79:33] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[79:35] A: And how would I make that if it were 55%? How do I get it to be 55 to 60%?
[79:40] B: Yeah.
[79:41] A: What else am I spending money on?
[79:43] B: Yeah.
[79:44] A: Right. You know, there's a long time ago, a thing called the latte factor. Did you ever hear that like, you know, Starbucks was a five dollar drink. So if you went to Starbucks every day, you know, Monday through Friday, that's, you know, 25 a week times, you know, four weeks, it's a hundred dollars a month times, you know, 12. You're spending, you know, $1200 on coffee.
[80:11] B: People do it. Yeah. It's crazy.
[80:13] A: Right? But other people do it. Where. Oh, I'm quick. I gotta grab this out of the convenience store because I was getting gas and I grabbed that.
[80:21] B: Yeah.
[80:22] A: Or, you know, I had to go out to eat because I didn't prepare. Have food for me.
[80:28] B: Yeah.
[80:29] A: You follow me?
[80:30] B: Yeah.
[80:31] A: Right. Like so. Those are ways that people can shrink. I never ever. Never is a fake word. But very rarely do I ever Go out for lunch, I make food and bring it with me, and I eat it here.
[80:45] B: Okay.
[80:46] A: And it's way less costly because if I went out to eat, I'm going to be spending probably $15 now a day. Right? 15, 20 on a meal. Yeah, I did that every day. That's, you know, 100ameal just for lunches. Yeah, right. 400amonth on lunches. Like that doesn't seem like a. Where I can buy chicken at Costco, grill it out, chop it up, and have five days of it.
[81:14] B: There you go.
[81:15] A: And that might have cost me 30 bucks for all the chicken.
[81:18] B: Yeah. We're still saving gas for having to drive.
[81:23] A: I'm saving all of it. Yeah, right. And maybe even more than that. That. Yeah, right. Maybe it's not even 30 bucks. It's like 20, 25 bucks.
[81:30] B: Yeah.
[81:31] A: But then I'm going from 15 to $20 a day to $5 a day.
[81:35] B: Yeah. That's cool.
[81:39] A: Right. So kind of beginning to get the thought process of not, oh, I get to reward myself now, but how do I delay? Just like you are with your son, the bigger picture makes us less likely to go buy things that we don't really need or use or want, but we're bored, and so we get them. Right. And it's fine to have some of that stuff when you're in a position that you have more than enough so that. That doesn't affect it. Yeah. Follow me with that. Yeah, that's kind of what we want to be thinking about for you. Right. Is how do we begin to get. And so there is. Do you have access to computers and stuff?
[82:27] B: Yeah.
[82:28] A: So there's a. I'll write it down so you can go. You can type in a search engine. You can. His name is Ramit Sadie, and it's called the Conscious Spending Plan. So csp.
[83:06] B: Okay, cool.
[83:07] A: And it's a free. Downloadable. Free downloadable page and web thing. And what's really good about it is it's simple. So you can just input your stuff, and then you can kind of get an idea. You might be in a position where you're like, you know, at 80% fixed cost, and then it's like, oh, no wonder why I feel really stressed every day, you know, week or month or waiting for the next paycheck kind of thing. Yeah, right. Because I might have too many things, and there are all sorts of things. Like I have a Netflix account, or I have a, you know, whatever it is that I don't necessarily realize is what's making me so stressed. And so for a period of time. Yeah, I might need to shrink what I'm doing because I'm delaying not. Not getting it. I'm delaying it. Like, there's a. There's a researcher that used to do a thing with kids called the marshmallow effect. And basically you'd have a kid like under the age of five, and they'd be in a room with a. The researcher, and the researcher would put a marshmallow on a plate and say, okay, I'm going to leave here. You can have the marshmallow. But if you haven't had the marshmallow, when I return, I'll give you a second marshmallow. Right. And so there are kids that the guy leaves gone. And then there are kids that are using all sorts of distraction things to distract them so that when the guy comes back, they get the second one. Isn't that interesting?
[84:47] B: Yeah.
[84:48] A: So what we want to set up in you, Heather, is we want to have you have a bigger picture in mind, so it makes it easier for you to do the right stuff around your finances.
[85:01] B: Yeah, definitely.
[85:03] A: Right. That I'm only spending the money on the things that I absolutely need, have to have and not other stuff for a period of time so that I can start building up somewhat of an emergency fund.
[85:18] B: Yeah.
[85:19] A: Right. So that in working with Duncan, they may have a 401k.
[85:23] B: Yeah.
[85:24] A: That I can put whatever they match.
[85:27] B: Yeah.
[85:28] A: Into that. So. Because if they match, like, let's say they match 3%, you want to put in at least 3% because that'll give you 6%.
[85:38] B: Yeah.
[85:39] A: Does that make sense?
[85:40] B: Yeah.
[85:41] A: Right. So a company like that would have a 401k or some sort of retirement thing.
[85:47] B: Yeah.
[85:47] A: That you could put part of and they take it pre tax. So $50 that goes in feels like in your paycheck. $35. Oh, do you follow me with that? And see, even me having this conversation. This is new information. Yeah. Right. So without being armed with the right kind of information, it's very hard for me to do the right. Do the right steps. Right. Like, you know, there are people that have. And you may have had this in time or have had it. Balances on their credit card. Yeah, Right. If you got a balance on your credit card, you're throwing money away.
[86:24] B: Yeah.
[86:24] A: Every month.
[86:25] B: Yeah.
[86:27] A: So we need to figure out a way to stop putting money on it and then secondly, aggressively start paying it off because those interest rates are ridiculous.
[86:35] B: Yeah, yeah.
[86:38] A: Yeah. You know, I put a hundred dollars on it. It's a 30% interest rate. Now I owe them $130. That's crazy.
[86:50] B: Yeah.
[86:51] A: Insane, right? Put $500 on it. Now I owe them 650.
[86:58] B: It's even crazier.
[87:00] A: Right. Because that's what it does.
[87:02] B: Yeah. People get like five of them.
[87:06] A: So. So we've got to have a way to kind of think about our finances and where we are and what we need to be doing and how to start to scrimp and save.
[87:17] B: Yeah.
[87:19] A: Because the app world is easy to just buy shit.
[87:22] B: Yeah.
[87:22] A: And we have no consequence of buying shit anymore because I put. I either put the number in or I put a little piece of plastic up to something.
[87:29] B: Yeah.
[87:30] A: I got no experience of. Oh, that's $27.45. Okay. Let me get out. Okay. So there's 20. There's a five, seven. Okay. Change. We don't do that anymore. Nobody does that. No, we go.
[87:44] B: Yeah.
[87:44] A: And no connection to it.
[87:45] B: Yep.
[87:47] A: So, yeah. When we have the bigger picture of why I'm doing what I'm doing, it makes it easier to do it.
[87:53] B: Yeah. Very true.
[87:56] A: Yeah. When I turned 50, I had seven other guys go to pebble beach with me. And over an 18 month period of time, we put money away for the trip. So that when we went on the trip, the only thing that we had to pay for was food and souvenirs.
[88:15] B: Cool.
[88:16] A: Right? Yeah, that kind of thing. So that was a. I would consider a long term savings, but for spending. I was putting money away to pay for the trip.
[88:29] B: That's cool.
[88:30] A: Yeah. Yeah. Right?
[88:34] B: Yeah.
[88:34] A: Yeah. So let's just check in with you. Right. Think about the things that we've talked about. Think about stuff with dad.
[88:41] B: Yep.
[88:42] A: Think about stuff with mom.
[88:43] B: Yep.
[88:44] A: Right. Got all those things.
[88:46] B: Yeah.
[88:47] A: Right. Think about stuff when you were in the life.
[88:49] B: Yeah.
[88:50] A: Right. What are you noticing?
[88:54] B: It's not bothering me.
[88:55] A: Right, Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[88:58] B: Yeah.
[88:59] A: Think about your dog.
[89:00] B: Yeah.
[89:01] A: Right. Noticing how you're having more access.
[89:05] B: Yeah. To the good memories.
[89:07] A: That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Right. With you through a lot of difficult shit. Yeah. I think about going to jail.
[89:17] B: Yeah.
[89:18] A: Right. There, now I know. Isn't that cool?
[89:22] B: Yeah.
[89:23] A: Yeah. Right. So what you'll be noticing again as you move forward is experiencing other people's stuff is truly being about them. That it's not about me. That is their stuff about them. Yeah, that's right. It's not about me. You'll also notice feeling more ease in situations and an openness to share bits of information, not everything all at once.
[89:55] B: Yeah.
[89:55] A: But it's kind of like I get to know somebody. Yeah, right, Right. It's like vetting them. Right. Like, if I had a woman who's got a child and she's a single mom and she's wanting to date, I'm never having her bring the guy over to the house. Yeah. Never. Not any first date. Second, third. I'm waiting until she. She vets him.
[90:23] B: Yeah.
[90:23] A: That he's a kind and decent man that she would be willing to allow her son to maybe get attached to.
[90:30] B: Yeah.
[90:32] A: Like, that's a big, huge decision.
[90:34] B: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[90:35] A: So there's a lot of vetting that goes in before you ever get to meet my man.
[90:40] B: Yeah.
[90:43] A: Right, right. That kind of thing.
[90:46] B: Yeah.
[90:46] A: It has to be. Yeah, yeah. And again, that's what he's doing. He's wanting to make sure you're okay.
[90:53] B: Yeah.
[90:54] A: And that this time it's different.
[90:56] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[90:57] A: Right.
[90:59] B: I'm okay with that.
[91:00] A: I know. And while. Because you're being different.
[91:02] B: Yeah.
[91:04] A: Right. Cool.
[91:06] B: Right, Cool.
[91:07] A: It is cool. Yeah. Yeah. You're doing great. I'm super proud of you.
[91:10] B: Thank you. Yay.
[91:12] A: Yeah. Yeah. So one last time. Right. Any other stuff, by the way, that come to mind for you that we want to do that we didn't get done yet today?
[91:23] B: I'm okay right now.
[91:24] A: You are, aren't you? Yeah. So one last time. Big deep breath in. Exhale. Eyes are closed. Eyes rest. Closed. You rest. Awareness drops down deeper and deeper inside towards delight at the center. That calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy. Delight that is you are connecting to more and more of who you really are. Beginning to lighten up on you and become more and more okay. And free. Right. To share just what's needed to be shared as you're learning. Curious. That's right. You get to be curious. Right. All of this is happening in multiple ways. Different changes. The ones you notice, the ones you haven't noticed yet. All integrating inside so that you're lighter and more clear and more peaceful and on the way to even more and more. That's right. There you go.
[92:34] B: Cool.
[92:34] A: Yeah.
[92:35] B: Yay.
[92:36] A: You did great.
[92:37] B: Thank you so much.
[92:38] A: Hey, you're welcome. My pleasure. I will stop this.
