[00:00] A: All right. So today is the 3rd of February, Isabella. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable. The recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:14] B: Yes.
[00:15] A: Cool. So how did our last session leave you? It was like. Like before Christmas.
[00:21] B: Well, it left me speechless. Like. Like whenever I was like thinking of something, I did what you told me. Like, she's not there. It's not happening. And it worked. I'm like, oh. Because I was trying to go to sleep and then I was like. Like memory popped up. I'm like, that's not happening. So I thought. And I was able go to sleep.
[00:41] A: Isn't that cool?
[00:42] B: Yeah.
[00:43] A: Yeah, yeah. So it doesn't have the same effect on you that it did?
[00:48] B: Yeah.
[00:48] A: Yeah. And then you were able to tell it to not be there and it went away.
[00:52] B: Yeah.
[00:52] A: Right. Which you weren't able to do before?
[00:54] B: Never.
[00:55] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[00:56] B: Yeah.
[00:57] A: Yeah. That's because it doesn't actually bother you.
[01:00] B: I know more.
[01:01] A: I know it used to. Isn't that the coolest thing?
[01:05] B: Yeah.
[01:05] A: Like stuff that used to bother you you can now think about and it doesn't bother you.
[01:09] B: Yeah.
[01:09] A: I still don't like it that it happened never. But there's a lot of shit that I'm not gonna like that happen. Right. You follow me with that. But notice how it's not making you feel bad. And then the second thing is, is it's also not making you feel bad about you. Like, it's not making me feel bad about my lovability or my worthiness or whether I was good enough or. Or, Or.
[01:31] B: Yeah.
[01:31] A: Isn't that cool?
[01:32] B: Yeah.
[01:33] A: Awesome. What else have you noticed? I'm really curious.
[01:37] B: Well, I mean, those memories I haven't been thinking about, but there's this like, specific one that, like, I was trying to get to you about.
[01:44] A: Oh, okay.
[01:46] B: About the whole mom situation and me blaming myself and it's still happening.
[01:52] A: How so?
[01:54] B: Because it's like, I don't know, it happened. And of course, like, I'm not there and it's not happening no more. But it's just the fact that it keeps bothering me.
[02:04] A: What bothers you?
[02:06] B: That I keep blaming myself for what I did?
[02:09] A: Oh.
[02:10] B: I mean, like I took part of it, but my mom was took part of it too. It was 50. 50.
[02:17] A: So why would you want to blame you?
[02:19] B: I don't know. That's the reason I Don't know why I'm blaming myself. I never blame myself for that.
[02:24] A: Oh, but now you are. You weren't blaming yourself, but now you are.
[02:27] B: I mean, before it happened, after it happened. No, like, ever since I got to, like, recovery and all that, it's been blaming myself for a lot of things now.
[02:37] A: Yeah. Was that useful? I mean, when you blame yourself, does that make you do better later? No, it doesn't, does it? So it's not very useful. Right. And you're blaming yourself because now you know better or now you wish you hadn't done it.
[02:55] B: Yeah.
[02:56] A: Oh, that's where the error is.
[02:59] B: Yeah.
[02:59] A: Do you know what the error is? It's that you can conceive of having not done it. You can conceive of that experience having not happened or you having not played whatever part you played. Right. And so, because you can think it up here, your emotional brain, which works like an animal's brain, goes, if you can think it, we can do it. So do it. I mean, stop doing that thing.
[03:27] B: I'm not doing it.
[03:28] A: It doesn't know that, though. That's where the other error goes. So we want to get that better. Okay, we can do that. What else?
[03:34] B: I've also kind of been angry.
[03:37] A: Oh, how so?
[03:38] B: With my mom and my dad. So, like, I literally bawled my eyes out in a meeting because first they leave me, and I. And then they came back in my life and they left me again. And it's just like. That anger, like, just keeps building up.
[03:57] A: How about now, as I was talking about it?
[04:01] B: Yeah.
[04:01] A: You felt a little bit of it, right?
[04:02] B: Yeah.
[04:03] A: But are they in your life now?
[04:05] B: No.
[04:06] A: Oh, are they?
[04:07] B: Well, my mom's okay, but my dad.
[04:09] A: No, really.
[04:11] B: I mean, not mentally, she's not.
[04:14] A: My mom's okay. Wait a minute. Hold on. That mom. Hold on. Let's look at this thing clearly. Okay. Okay.
[04:22] B: My mom's, like, mentally okay.
[04:24] A: She's not. Is she?
[04:25] B: And my dad's not mentally, physically, emotionally, okay.
[04:29] A: Right.
[04:30] B: He's still out there using drugs.
[04:31] A: Right. They're both not well.
[04:33] B: Yeah.
[04:35] A: Right. Which would have they operated very consistently with somebody who's not well. Right. Because somebody who's not well leaves, goes and does. Comes back, leaves again. Right. Like, somebody who's well, doesn't do that. Does that make sense? Yeah. So where that was also stuck is that that also makes it feel like it was about me, even though I know it still feels that way. So we want to get that shifted, too. Okay, cool. We can do that.
[05:11] B: Okay.
[05:11] A: What else? You're doing great. I'm so glad you're here. You're way wise beyond 1920.
[05:23] B: Yeah.
[05:24] A: Yeah, you are.
[05:25] B: Well, thank you. Well, those are like, those two main things besides, like, when people in the group, in the house, bring up trauma, memory stuff, like, it gets me mad, too. And it brings me back to my. My stuff where I was at. So that's like another.
[05:53] A: Okay. Like, how might that happen? Where might you be when that goes on?
[05:57] B: So say someone's talking about their abuse, their tragic stuff, and then I just listen. And then it brings me to, like, me getting abused. It brings me to me getting hurt or being touched or this and that.
[06:10] A: Okay. Okay. So you'd like that similar thing to not bring you back to feel like it's happening to you.
[06:18] B: Yeah, Like I want to feel happy. Like, I want to feel okay that it happened and then I moved on from it.
[06:25] A: Yeah. We're not going to feel okay that it happened.
[06:27] B: Oh, never that.
[06:29] A: Because it wasn't okay that it happened. Okay. But we want you to be okay.
[06:33] B: Yes.
[06:34] A: In here. Even though what happened then wasn't.
[06:37] B: Yeah.
[06:37] A: Yeah.
[06:38] B: Like I told one of the girls, I'm like, hey, can we not talk about that?
[06:42] A: Yeah.
[06:43] B: But I want to be able to. Able to listen.
[06:46] A: Right.
[06:47] B: And not feel what I feel.
[06:48] A: Yeah. So what would that be like if you were able to listen, then you weren't feeling that way anymore? Like, how would you actually be?
[06:57] B: I have no idea.
[06:59] A: Well, I don't know whether you have no idea. I think you might know.
[07:04] B: I might know, but I don't know until I.
[07:07] A: How do you actually want to be in that situation? Because you said, well, I want to be able to hear it and listen to it. Yeah. And if you were able to hear it and listen to it, how would you actually be being?
[07:21] B: I guess okay.
[07:22] A: Yeah. Right. You want to feel okay in you, even if you're listening to historical yucky stuff that happened to somebody else. That's similar to historical yucky stuff that happened to you. Got it. Like, we want you to be what we like to call emotionally present so that your emotions are matching what's happening, not bleeding into past. Right. We want the effect that that stuff has had gone. Right. Because there might be other moments that we didn't fully get unplugged yet that would be useful to heal. Right, Right. Like that one that comes up.
[08:11] B: Yeah.
[08:11] A: Right. When you get taken back. Right. And then there was one other thing that you had said is the middle one.
[08:19] B: I remember what I said.
[08:21] A: You don't remember do you?
[08:22] B: The middle one, that before that one?
[08:23] A: Yeah. Isn't it funny that we're not able to remember?
[08:31] B: Yeah.
[08:32] A: What you just said just a few minutes ago.
[08:34] B: I know, I know.
[08:35] A: Where did it go? I don't know either. And you don't have to know because you know who does know. Your unconscious knows, right. How to heal itself. So it knows which moments and experiences would be useful to unplug. Right. So that's why we're looking towards a you who's present and clear where the guilt, grief, self blame, stuff, that's completely gone. Got it. Where you're much more emotionally present so that you're hearing that kind of stuff as historical information about stuff they went through that's similar to historical stuff that I went through. Wow. That really was hard for them. That sucked. I'm really glad that they're not going through it now. Right. I'm really glad I'm not going through it now. Right. Like that's how we want you to be. Got it. So as we think of the you, then all you want to do is slightly lower your jaw, relax your tongue so that the bottom rests against the back. Right. Your tongue rests against the bottom of your mouth. Right. You breathe a little bit slower and deeper in and a little bit longer on the way out. Right. Notice what starts to happen as you're breathing in this way. Like, check inside your body. What are you noticing? It is getting calm. Isn't that cool? How responsive your unconscious is to you in healing. Right. Notice my nose. Notice my fingers. Notice when they go out. Notice the space as you notice the space. Right. Check even in more inside. And how's your body feeling? It is calm, Right. And you know that you are not your body. There's a guy that I listen to, does a meditation. His name is Saad Guru. And Saad just means uneducated Guru. But he has this thing that he does. He goes, I'm not the body. I'm not even my mind. I'm not the body. I'm not even the mind. So what if you're not your body, which we already know that you're not. There's no cell within your body that's the same as it was and everything is replaced. But you're also not the mind. You're not the thinker of your thoughts. And see, your brain has historical information about stuff that happened. And we want all of that to be read as data, to have it fully historical information about something that's over. Got it? So even if I hear something that's similar to something that I went through. It's all not right because everything that's passed is not happening now, even if I hear about it, even if it's similar. And we want that fully integrated inside you. Does that make sense? So one more time. Your jaw is slightly lowered. You relax your tongue. You breathe a little slower and deeper. Deeper. You exhale a little longer. You notice more space. As you notice the space, you close your eyes. As your eyes are closed, they rest. When your eyes rest closed, you also rest. Right. Aware of your breath, my voice, background sounds, how it feels to be seated on the couch, or noticing all of this. At the same time. Your unconscious is doing the background work, beginning to reorganize and rewire your brain so that it becomes. Becomes optimized for you to be in this present moment, free from the effect of those past moments. That's right. And as all the rewiring is going on, the only thing there is for you to do is rest. Resting accelerates healing. That's. And then whenever you're ready, you can take your time, beginning to find your way back. Up and up. Yeah. And again. How's your body feeling now?
[12:43] B: Very calm.
[12:44] A: It is very calm. And as your body is very calm, that other part, the unconscious, will bring one of those moments that hasn't been fully unplugged to your awareness. So what's a specific thing? That particular time that happened with mom, that was partial her, partial you, that you've been feeling really blaming yourself for having done. You got it?
[13:04] B: Yeah.
[13:05] A: That one happened how long ago?
[13:07] B: Like four years ago?
[13:10] A: Yeah, four years ago. And just again, the flat, what happened? You're where at home. So you're at home. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[13:18] B: Daytime.
[13:19] A: It was daytime. And you're where in the house?
[13:21] B: I'm in the kitchen.
[13:22] A: You're in the kitchen, right? Like by the stove or the counter? By the knives. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[13:27] B: I took one.
[13:28] A: Right, you took a knife. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[13:30] B: I'm just feeling my foot color blackout.
[13:33] A: Well, you took a knife, right?
[13:34] B: Yeah.
[13:34] A: And then what happened?
[13:36] B: I went to the wall.
[13:37] A: Then you went to the wall, started stabbing holes right? In the wall with a knife?
[13:41] B: Yeah.
[13:42] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[13:43] B: And then my mom got scared, right?
[13:44] A: She's like, what the is happening? Why is my daughter stabbing the wall?
[13:49] B: And then she runs her room as I'm chasing her.
[13:52] A: And then you chased after her with my little brother. Right. She had your little brother.
[13:56] B: She. Yeah.
[13:57] A: Right. So she's Running with your little brother and you're running after them with a knife.
[13:59] B: They go in the room.
[14:00] A: Right.
[14:01] B: Lock the door.
[14:01] A: Right.
[14:02] B: As they lock the door, they're texting 911 so they don't have me hear them.
[14:06] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right.
[14:08] B: And then I'm going back to the kitchen, add more holes.
[14:10] A: Right. Good job, Good detail.
[14:11] B: Right?
[14:12] A: Yes. Right. And then what happened next?
[14:14] B: And then I guess they show up.
[14:16] A: And then they show up. And then what happened?
[14:17] B: I'm arrested.
[14:18] A: Right, and then you went to some. Some sort of bake rack place.
[14:21] B: Yeah.
[14:21] A: Right. And then that was over. And then you got out?
[14:24] B: Well, it was over.
[14:26] A: And then I got.
[14:27] B: Went to foster care.
[14:28] A: Well, then you went to foster care for. Right, but then that was over.
[14:30] B: Yeah.
[14:31] A: Well, then you got out. I went to foster. Went to live with a different person. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun. Yes. You did like, you decorated. Oh, yeah, right. I remember you telling me that was fun.
[14:44] B: Yeah.
[14:44] A: Right. But something else you've done. Reason that was fun.
[14:47] B: I just went to school today.
[14:48] A: Yeah. Going to school today was more fun than that.
[14:50] B: I just got me a job.
[14:52] A: Yeah. And got a job. Where are you working?
[14:53] B: Humane Society.
[14:54] A: Nice. Right, so we got. Getting the job. Yeah, we got. Going to school.
[14:57] B: Yeah.
[14:58] A: Right.
[14:59] B: We've got my one year on Friday.
[15:01] A: Decorating.
[15:02] B: Yeah, decorating.
[15:03] A: One year's coming up, right?
[15:04] B: Yeah.
[15:05] A: And then before that, you would live with some different people. And then you were at the bakery place, and then they take into the bakery place, and then the police had gotten there and then you were cutting and. Or then you had blood and then you had been stabbing and then you went back to the kitchen and then you had ran after them and then they had went and locked the door and then they were running. And then she's like, what the hell is going on? And then you had been stabbing the wall and you picked up the knife. Then before that, you were in the kitchen. Then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing.
[15:31] B: Yeah.
[15:32] A: Right. As we go backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it? Yeah, was it same? Was it more? Was it less?
[15:40] B: It was like less.
[15:41] A: Notice how it was less. Right. Because your brain is getting that it's data about something that happened not happening. Right. Remember, your emotional brain doesn't get logic, but it does get patterns of association. So I could just say to you, remember getting dressed, putting your watch on. Don't stop putting on your watch. You go, I'm not putting on my watch. Well, then stop stabbing the wall. Well, Then stop her from running with your brother. Well, then stop it all from happening. It's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. This. Right. As that gets in, what do you notice.
[16:14] B: Popping up?
[16:15] A: Right. Mom wasn't equipped.
[16:18] B: Yeah.
[16:18] A: To deal with daughter when daughter was troubled, was she? Mom wasn't very well equipped at all. Cuz like, you were with mom until you were how old?
[16:30] B: Just for like a couple months.
[16:32] A: No, no, not that time.
[16:33] B: But she had never had me.
[16:35] A: Ever.
[16:36] B: I was with my grandparents.
[16:37] A: So you were born.
[16:38] B: Yeah.
[16:38] A: And grandparents had you.
[16:39] B: My grandparents took custody.
[16:41] A: Right, right. When you were born.
[16:42] B: Yes.
[16:42] A: And mom was gone for a period of time.
[16:44] B: Yes.
[16:44] A: And then she came back.
[16:45] B: Yeah.
[16:46] A: Right. And you were how old?
[16:49] B: I think, like 13 when she came around.
[16:51] A: Right. And then you were with her for a few months.
[16:54] B: Yeah. When I was 15, I was with her for three months.
[16:56] A: Right. And then you went to foster.
[16:59] B: Yes.
[17:00] A: Right. Right. You did, didn't you? Mm. And then you got off to foster. Yeah. Right. Now you're here.
[17:07] B: I am.
[17:08] A: Right. Healing.
[17:09] B: Yeah.
[17:10] A: Right. And, you know, changing your life for the better. Isn't that cool that you're in the process of changing your life for the better?
[17:17] B: Oh, yeah.
[17:17] A: Isn't that cool?
[17:18] B: Oh, yeah.
[17:19] A: Like, I think that's super cool.
[17:20] B: So cool.
[17:20] A: And you chose it.
[17:21] B: Yes.
[17:22] A: Right. Mom wasn't well. You didn't know that mom wasn't well. Right. And all that stuff would have felt like, you know, maybe I wasn't wanted by her. That makes sense. But it had more to do with that mom not being well. That's why she wasn't around. Right. Grandparents don't take custody because, you know, the mom's doing good. Let's just check that out for a moment. Right. Like, if the mom's doing great, there's no purpose for the grandparents to take custody. If the mom's not doing well. Makes big sense for grandparents to take custody, doesn't it? Got it. You didn't know that then? That earlier you didn't know that mom wasn't well. And why you were so distressed at home, even though you were with mom and a younger brother, is that mom wasn't well and mom didn't have what she needed to have to repair and mend things to be better. Does that make sense? Right. Like, it was hard to connect with that woman, wasn't it? Because, like, she didn't really, like, know you. Right. And she probably knew your little brother more and she.
[18:35] B: Yeah.
[18:36] A: Because she was around him. Like, I had that with my dad. It's really funny. It's a funny story. Not really funny, but my dad had me with my mom. Divorced when I was 2. Then my dad got married again. And I have a brother that's 10 years and 12 years younger than me. Then he divorced. And I have a sister from his third marriage who's like 15 years younger than me. Right. He doesn't really know me, doesn't really know my brothers because he wasn't around us. He knows little sister. Isn't that weird? Right? But when you're in it, it's like, oh, like that feels like it's about me. Was it about me or was it about my dad? Right. And here's the weirdest part. All of us were married. Myself, my two brothers and my sister. Do you know who the only one that got divorced is? No. Well, he got divorced three times. The only one that's gotten divorced is the one that grew up with him. H. Maybe it was better that I did grow up with him. And maybe one of the benefits out of not growing up with him is a benefit that I didn't get, but my kids get from me because it sucked and it hurt. Didn't feel like I was wanted or loved or all that stuff. How my dad's not around, like how come he doesn't show up. Clearly has to do with this kid's vulnerability. Right? That's how we would all feel. Had nothing to do with me, had to do with him and his own shit. Right. And then when I was older, right when that would have been like, he would have had a. When I was 10 and 12 years old, he would have had a newborn and a two year old. That's not easy. And then that bring a 12 year old into the picture, like. But you know the value that my kids get, they get a dad who's around and present. So my dad wasn't around and present. My kids get a dad who's around and present. It's cool. Out of the shitty thing that I went through. So I wonder what it would be like that you get to have a better life and better life around even though you went through difficult stuff because back then that you didn't know that mom wasn't well and didn't fully get why she wasn't as connected as her younger brother and didn't get why it was so difficult. How come she wasn't like all of that would have felt like it was about you. But as we look at it, clearly mom wasn't well and she certainly wasn't Back then, her grandparents would have had custody. Do you follow me with that? Right. And it's not like, you know, she went to a lot of treatment, did a lot of work on herself, and she was like, you know, that's not what was going on with her either when she came back. That makes sense. You didn't know any of that then, right? So close your eyes and picture that earlier you let that earlier you know that's over, finished, no longer exists. And that mom being that way had nothing to do with you or your lovability, had everything to do with what was off with mom. Right? That it looked really different, that, oh, she must not love me like she loved my brother. But had nothing to do with that at all. It had everything to do with her not being well. Right. So that the earlier you get it. Letting that earlier, you know how lovable she is to you. Because by the way, you're the one that matters most to that younger you because you know so much more than she does, how resilient, how brave, how strong, how courageous she is. You know, how worth it she is to you. That's right. And she's getting it. And as the earlier you is getting it, what do you notice happening to her? What happens to her face? You don't know? What do you think might be happening to her face? Did you need mom in order for you to be loving? Isn't that weird? But earlier you felt like she did need mom in order for you to be okay. What happened when the earlier you canceled that she didn't. Yeah. What's happening now? What's happening inside?
[23:33] B: Just hurt.
[23:34] A: Oh, you hurt? Oh, why are you hurting?
[23:39] B: I mean, not hurt. It's just like.
[23:45] A: I'm wondering if it's the same thing. I'm wondering if the thing that's hurting is that you can conceive of mom having been a different way. You can conceive of that stuff having not happened. Right. And just check it out. That moment when you took the knife and started doing that, there had been lots of things going on prior to that that led you to be in that troubled of a state that you started doing that. Do you follow me with that? Yeah. So what if we could lighten up on that earlier you. Because she's feeling that by doing that, she lost her mom. But as we look at it, clearly that might have been the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak. But there was a lot of stuff that was going on, right, that wasn't okay in being with mom. And Living there that led you to be in such a distressed state to do that make sense? Here's the saying. Everybody's behavior makes sense to them or they wouldn't do it. So in that kind of intense distress state that you were in in that moment, that's what made sense for you to do. Got it? Now, what we do know, because you're bright, is you can conceive of alternatives to what already is over, meaning you can conceive of having never done that with a knife. Right. You can conceive of alternatives to stuff that's already over. The difference is that that other part of your brain that directs your emotions is like an animal's brain and can only conceive of doing things that it can actually do. If it can't do it, it can't think it. Does that make sense? So the animal's brain lives that. If I can think it, that means I can do it. So it's basically saying, hurry up, stop stabbing holes in the wall, quick. Right when you were what, 15? Yeah. That's what your brain is trying to motivate you to do, get you to stop doing that when you were 15. The timing is all fucked up, though. It's like the guy might have shared with you whose brother died in the automobile or motorcycle accident. He didn't go with his brother's brother died. He feels guilty thinking if he had gone, his brother might still be alive. But that's not why he's feeling guilty. He's feeling guilty because he can conceive of having gone. And if he had, his brother might still be alive, and that would be better. And so, because up here he can think it, his emotional brain goes, well, if you can think it, that means we can do it. So do it. Go on the ride a year ago. What are you waiting for? Can he actually do it? No. So when our brain gets the first thing that it's already gotten for certain experiences, it no longer exists. And then the second thing, there's nothing to be done. It stops causing the feeling. Your brain isn't making you feel bad sad, because it wants you to feel bad sad. It's just trying to motivate you to get it to stop. It's not because that was a bad thing or you shouldn't have done it, or it's because your brain is trying to get you to get it to stop. Got it. So I'm simply going to say to you, well, then, stop stabbing the wall when you're 15. Hurry you go. There's nothing to Be done. Say that no hurry. What are you waiting for? Stop doing that. Quick. No, come on, we're going to get a corner.
[27:43] B: How are we done?
[27:44] A: Why?
[27:44] B: Because no longer exist.
[27:46] A: That's right. Check in. What happens to the feelings? What happens to the sad? What do you notice? Say more or less. Yes, is less. Yeah. What about that happening then is still sad now?
[28:06] B: I think it's just a fact. I mean, with that part, it's okay. But like the fact that she had a send me somewhere else and not because if I would have done that, then I wouldn't have been in foster.
[28:21] A: Care, I would have been home.
[28:23] B: So that's also kind of like gets to me because she sent my sister foster care. She sent me to foster care.
[28:29] A: She did, Right. What does that tell you?
[28:32] B: She didn't love us.
[28:34] A: See, isn't that so good? So perfect, right? Isn't that the meaning that gets attached? If she loved me, then we would have been with her. So therefore it must have meant that she didn't love me. Could we add something else other than whether she loved you or not or whether it had to do with your lovability. Could we have it do with her capacity to handle challenging things? Mom's got a very low capacity in handling challenging things, doesn't she? I mean, she had a baby and couldn't keep her. That's a challenging thing, a baby. You know, babies, you have to feed them, change them, clean them, bathe them. I mean, they're really dependent. Yeah, got it. So mom we were learning about his mom had nothing to do with mom's love or lack of love for you and everything to do with mom's capacity or capability. Right? And we know that because it wasn't just you. Mom's capacity was limited. You didn't know that it was limited. Follow me with that. What happens when you get it that Mom's capacity was limited? So think of it in one other way, because we know that mom's not well. Mom's brain works more like a broken jukebox. Do you know what a jukebox is? A jukebox is a thing that back in the day in diners or in like arcades or in clubs, you'd be able to go to this big machine that had a bunch of records, CDs, whatever you want to call them, that had music in it. And you could pick different music from different artists and would pull out that CD and play that song from that cd. Then you could get a different one and play a different one. Right now we have like ipods and they do that, right? But back in the day we had that and you used to be able to press the buttons to get the different songs. You didn't know that moms like a broken jukebox. Because it didn't matter what button you pressed. You would think that it's a me thing. Oh, why do I keep getting this response from this jukebox even though I'm pressing different buttons? What am I doing wrong? You just didn't know that the jukebox was broken, right? Mom loves you to the ability that a broken jukebox loves. Just like my dad loves me. But he never loved me the way that I wanted him to love me. Not because I'm unlovable, but because he doesn't have the capacity or capability that's just not in his thing. Does that make sense? What you hadn't been considering because you thought it was a choice is that what if it's not a choice? And it was just mom's capacity and capability had nothing to do with your lovability or her love for you had everything to do with her not being well, right? And as you get that, let's educate the younger you. So one more time close your eyes and let that younger you know. One, that that's over. Two, that you're okay. Three, that that happening at everything to do with mom's capacity and capability. Not her love that she loves like a broken jukebox loves. Which isn't how you want to be loved. But it doesn't mean that she doesn't love, right? Just like my dad loves me. But I'm in the way that I wanted to be loved by my dad, right? So that the earlier he was getting. It's not about me. Had nothing to do with me. Nothing to do with me or me. It's not about us, not about me. So that she gets it as the earlier you is getting it. What do you notice now?
[32:48] B: Becoming more calmer.
[32:50] A: She is, isn't she? She's beginning to see it more clearly from the person who sees it with clear, right? And as this is going in checking your body because that you thought it had to do with loveability. Nothing to do with you or your lovability had to do with mom's ability capacity. Mom's not well, right? So she does it very consistent like somebody who's not well would do it. Do you get it? Right? Why is this well person doing all these unwell things? Oh, maybe she's just not well, huh? Right. And now you're the adult. And you get to be directive in how you want your life to be. You get to start creating a new life for you distinctly different than the one you got born into. That's right. And again, as all of this is getting in, take a deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. And as you're checking inside now, what are you noticing? It is, as you think about mom and some of that stuff, what do you notice happening to the anger slowly rising down? It is. Yeah. Right. Because the hope was that I had a mom who was well and just choosing to do unwell stuff. But now we're getting the realization, oh, wait a minute. I didn't have a mom who was well, that was choosing unwell. I've had a mom that's unwell. Duh. No wonder she did the fucked up shit that she did. Right, Right. And that led me to do some of the shit I've done. But the good news is you're not her. And you're changing and you're getting it early. Right. You know, there's lots of residents that are much older than you, and you're getting it now, so you have a head start in changing your life for the better. Isn't that cool? Huh? I think that's really cool. What are you taking at school?
[36:05] B: Language arts.
[36:06] A: Okay. What do you want to do with.
[36:07] B: All that after ged? I want to start med school.
[36:13] A: Okay.
[36:14] B: Be a surgeon.
[36:15] A: And be a surgeon. Well, the knife will come in handy. I already know how to cut things, so that's good. May not use such a stabbing motion when I do it, but, you know. Right, right. I know.
[36:39] B: Before all that, I'm gonna get rid of these tattoos.
[36:42] A: Okay. How many different tattoos do you want to get rid of?
[36:46] B: I know this one.
[36:47] A: That one for sure.
[36:47] B: I know. I go on Thursday to get my second treatment.
[36:51] A: Neato. That's cool.
[36:52] B: Briana's Plaza.
[36:54] A: Nice. Right in this plaza?
[36:56] B: Yeah.
[36:56] A: Really? Yeah. Like at the end over there. Like, is that where they do it? Like, I feel like.
[37:02] B: And the yellow buildings back there.
[37:05] A: Okay, that's cool. Nice.
[37:10] B: And then I want to get rid of this one.
[37:13] A: Okay.
[37:15] B: This one.
[37:16] A: Okay. Okay, cool. Because those are the ones that you didn't get to choose. Yeah, fully.
[37:34] B: I mean, I did choose this one on here.
[37:36] A: Huh.
[37:38] B: But I didn't. I choose these.
[37:40] A: Yeah. Yeah. Awesome.
[37:45] B: Yeah.
[37:45] A: That's great. Yeah. So again, let's think about, like, somebody might be sharing about an experience they had with a trafficker while they're out on the street or some Fucked up shit that happened in their family life. Right. And it sounds really similar to some fucked up shit that you've gone through, maybe with the trafficker, maybe family life, maybe. And just think about them saying something really similar, you know, my parents liking me up. I had to be in foster a couple times. Fucked up shit happened when I was in foster. And what do you notice?
[38:25] B: It doesn't bother me.
[38:27] A: Isn't that interesting? Right, right. We can have shared experiences. We've gone through similar stuff. I'm glad it's not happening for them now. I'm glad it's not happening for me now. Right, right. Because that's what we want to check in with, noticing what's new and different. What's new and different and better in terms of how you feel. Right. Because there's several things that we did the last time that you were here that when you think about those moments, they don't have the same feeling tones. Right. And part of the anger was coming from that. I can conceive of having had a well mom and a well dad. Right? But just like you didn't get to choose who you were born to, right? You didn't get to choose mom, you didn't get to choose dad, you didn't get to choose the siblings you got. Right. You didn't get to choose the hand that you were dealt, so to speak. But if you did get to choose the hand that you were dealt, would you trade places? Would you rather be your mom than you? Would you rather be your dad than you? Isn't that interesting? How about your sister than you? Your brother than you? No. So out of the hand that was dealt, we didn't always get great hands. You got the best one because you wouldn't trade. Isn't that crazy? How cool is that? Yeah, right, Right. Because what you've gone through doesn't define you and it's not part of who you are. It's just stuff that happened. Right? We used to have this saying in the world of like mental health, they used to go, oh, what's wrong with you? Right? Like, oh, there's got to be something wrong with that person. And then somebody educated mental health professionals and they said, wait a minute, it's not what's wrong with them, it's what happened to them. And it comes from everybody's behavior makes sense to them or they wouldn't do it. So what the hell has happened to that person that what they're doing makes sense for them to do? Right? Right. And what you're doing different than family members have done is your healing emotional wounds. You're changing your life for the better, which is super cool. Mm. Yeah. So again, what happens when you slightly lower your jaw and you rest your tongue and you breathe a little slower and deeper and you exhale longer and you notice more space. Right? The space that's between us, but there's space beyond me. There's space behind you that goes beyond the wall. There's space to either side, and that goes out in every direction. There's the space above that goes beyond the ceiling and the roof, and it goes all the way out. So if you've ever thought about this, space is an unending entity. It's not the thing that separates you from me, but it's the thing that connects you to me and everything else. That's right. And see, what's happening is you're connecting more to the space inside and out, which means you're becoming more okay in you. That's right. Notice what happens once again when you close your eyes. And just as your eyes close and rest, you can also rest.
[42:00] B: You can.
[42:00] A: You're aware of my voice and the background sound. You're noticing it all at the same time. Your unconscious is responding, absorbing, and integrating those things that it's gotten and learned and spreading that good news all the way through. So that each and every facet of mind and body is getting the same healing from the bottom to the top. From the top to the bottom, all the way through. And you don't even have to know all the healing going on to know that there's healing going on, because more of it is happening unconsciously underneath the surface. Just like every hut and every broken bone heals from the in, inside out, your mind and body is healing you from the inside out as you rest. So that things are lightening up. That's right. And you're becoming more okay in you. Clear peace. Fully integrating inside you now. That's right. And you can take your time enjoying this peaceful resting. And then, whenever you're ready, slowly find your way back. Big, deep breath in. And eyes are open. There you go. What are you noticing now?
[44:07] B: It's calm.
[44:08] A: It is calm. Home. That's right. So you think about that experience with the knife. What do you notice now? Right when you think about mom, when you think about dad, what do you notice about the anger?
[44:27] B: Not really there.
[44:29] A: Yeah. Is there some for dad? Is there some for mom?
[44:32] B: More dad?
[44:34] A: What's the stuff with dad? Would it be okay for you to no longer be angry or. No Longer have anger towards dad.
[44:43] B: Yeah.
[44:45] A: And when you think about dad, what's the anger about?
[44:49] B: Just all the lies not showing up.
[44:56] A: He didn't show up, did he? But he told you he would.
[44:59] B: Yeah.
[44:59] A: And then he didn't.
[45:01] B: Yeah, he told me that he'll stop.
[45:03] A: That he stopped using.
[45:04] B: Yeah, he told me he stopped and I called him.
[45:07] A: Yeah. Is this recent?
[45:09] B: This was like, before I got clean.
[45:11] A: Okay. Yeah. So you're out on the whatever and you call dad, and Dad's like, no, no, I'm not doing that anymore. I'm clean. It's over.
[45:18] B: Yeah. And then I can hear in his voice and I'm like, dad, are you. Are you high?
[45:22] A: Right?
[45:23] B: You think?
[45:24] A: No, no, no, no, not me. Right? I'm not high. I'm not crossing my fingers. No, not me. No, I didn't know. Yeah, right.
[45:33] B: I mean, I was using that time, too, when I was taking my. My things for myself, so. Yeah, but the fact that he lied and I heard that he used to mess with little girls, so that's why I'm, like, also mad about that. Like, I mean, I don't want him in my life. I just want him to get better because he's blood, no matter what he is.
[46:03] A: But we don't get to pick our relatives. No. We don't get to pick other people's noses though, either. No.
[46:15] B: I had to think for a second. I'm like, what?
[46:17] A: I know, right? You're like, what is he talking about? Yeah. So again, that earlier you didn't know how unwell dad was. That makes sense. Right? And she was so hoping that he could be a different guy because he's blood. Right. I wish my dad was a different dad. And that's the dad I got. I want him to be better, too. I also get that it's not my job to get him better. Even if I got skill sets that could probably help. He's my dad. You follow me with that? Yeah. And that's where this is going on. Where the anger comes from is learning what are some of the stuff that he might have done. And that's lucky that he would have done that. And then two, that he wasn't a man of honor. He wasn't a man you could believe he would tell you one thing and do something else. But that's what you're always going to believe isn't what people tell you. It's always what they do that makes sense. Talk is cheap. Heard that before, right? Yeah. So think back to that earlier. You with dad, who, of course Knows when she called and he's like, oh, I'm totally clean. Could hear it in his voice that he wasn't. Right. And remembering all the other times that he said that he'd show up and he didn't. Right. And you were thinking that that had something to do with your lack of lovability or his lack of love for you. But if we're looking at it, clearly it's not about you or your lovability or his lack of love, it has to do with his illness. Right. Because he's not well. He's really at the effect of the substances and you know firsthand what it's like when you're really at the effect of a substance. It becomes all consuming and everything else goes by the wayside. And then I do a lot of that I would have never done if I wasn't see, you got it.
[48:48] B: Yeah.
[48:48] A: And you didn't know all of that like you do now about dad not being well and that it's not about you or his love, it has to do with his illness. So again, close your eyes and think back to that earlier you and knowing all those other times where he said he would and he wasn't and let that earlier you know that that had nothing to do with you or his love for you or your lack of lovability, that it had everything to do with him not being well. That's right. That it had to do with him and his illness. Right. So that she gets it. Right. And just like anybody else that she cares for, she'd want them to be well. Cuz it'd be better for them. Right. Even if she doesn't want to have anything to do with them. Right. And again, as all of this starts to get in, what are you noticing now? You are, aren't you? Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah, that's right. So as you're thinking about that dad now, what you notice and you didn't need him in that way in order for you to be loving. Right. And loving that younger you and how courageous and brave, strong, resilient. Right, Right. And then when you're ready, one more time, deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Yeah. And what's happening now? It's blank, it's calm, it's blank, it's calm. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. Yeah. So I mean somebody might be telling you a story of something that they went through. You know, maybe it's some sort of thing that they had to do that they didn't want to do, they could not do it. And you remember there were times that you had to do things that you didn't want to do that you could not do. And they might be telling you about something that's really similar to the thing that you had to do that you didn't want to do, that you did not do. And what do you notice? Right. Isn't that cool? Good job. You did great today. I'm so proud of you. Yeah. You're amazing.
[52:04] B: Thank you.
[52:04] A: Yeah, for sure. So, anything else left for today? Are we good for now?
[52:11] B: I think we're good.
[52:12] A: All right, we'll stop with that. Come with me.
