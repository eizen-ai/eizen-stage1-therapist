[00:00] A: Today is the 5th of November and Jaclyn, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is transformative and life changing, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work, I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:17] B: Yes.
[00:18] A: Okay, cool. So you had said earlier, I've been doing a lot of work. What do you mean by that? What work have you been doing? Because clearly you are in programming with Salah, so what work have you been doing? I got. It's not just the save a lot because that's a different kind of work. Yeah, right. But when you think of like that you've been doing lots of work. Cuz I follow you with the toxic nature of the relationship that you've been having with mom and her guy.
[00:47] B: Yeah.
[00:48] A: And how that sometimes bleeds into you and we want to get that to stop.
[00:52] B: Right.
[00:54] A: But when you say that you've been doing lots of work, what does that actually mean? What have you been doing? Like how.
[01:01] B: So you know what I've been doing the most of is I've been trying to find out the roots of things and like my reactions to things and I've masked so many of like my coping mechanisms to where I don't even know that I'm using them just to be able to deal with life to where then I'm not actually really assessing the situation and how it needs to be assessed, accepting the situation and how it is. I'm totally blowing my mind through a whole nother era as though it doesn't exist or that that's not how it is because I can't physically or I can't mentally be there, think that, that people are like that, that that's happened to me, that I've gone through that or that I'm like that or that's been a part of who I am.
[02:08] A: Okay, so let's separate a couple different things. What you've gone through and the stuff that happened to you and the stuff that you did. What if that's not part of who you are? What if it's not part of your identity? It was just part of the journey you've gone through where you've been identifying it as if it's part of me.
[02:29] B: Yeah. I feel like I've met many.
[02:31] A: Right. So I wonder what it would be like if it wasn't a part of you. It just was stuff that you did, stuff that happened to you. You know, and honest ways that you acted, reacted, responded ways that others did. So when you go, I don't want to buy into or believe that those things were true or people are like that, or I did those things or they did those things to me. Are you referring to past stuff that happened?
[03:01] B: Yeah, Got it. That's how I managed through it, was.
[03:06] A: To pretend like it wasn't. So.
[03:08] B: Yeah.
[03:09] A: But now you're kind of having it sit on your lap and going, fuck, yeah. Okay.
[03:14] B: Because I'm dealing with the repercussions from it. I mean, I'm working at a freaking grocery store because of that man. And that I have to go through that.
[03:22] A: That guy or a different guy?
[03:25] B: The other guy.
[03:26] A: The guy that stole the money. The younger guy. Because you told me about two or three different guys. Yeah, one was Frederick.
[03:35] B: Yeah, the one that put me in prison.
[03:37] A: Okay.
[03:37] B: That one. That one's the worst one.
[03:40] A: Okay, so we know then that those experiences that you've gone through, although they're over underneath the surface, are having an effect and not just the effect of where you are right now with that I'm working at save a lot and I don't have, but the effect emotionally that it's been having on you.
[04:02] B: Yeah.
[04:03] A: We want to get the impact that that stuff has had in particular at that emotional level lifted and cleared. So you're free from it.
[04:12] B: Because I think differently about people. And then after that guy, then I went out, you know, to California and did like my Zen time and stuff. And then that's when I got involved with that other guy.
[04:25] A: Yeah, the younger stole.
[04:26] B: The younger guy stole the money.
[04:27] A: The good sex guy, but stole the money.
[04:29] B: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know, right? It's a give or take in life.
[04:35] A: Doesn't have to be.
[04:36] B: No, it really doesn't. And that's the thing. That's the point.
[04:40] A: Yeah.
[04:41] B: So it's like I've gone from, you know, it's like back to back hurts. So then I'm. I really have a hard time. But I think the best thing that I've gotten from this is my awareness and how I'm to now follow my instincts, you know, follow the red flags versus like looking, overlooking them. And now that's something that I don't do. That's what I mean. By now I'm sitting with what is the reality? What is. What is it I'm really dealing with so I can assess the situation properly.
[05:16] A: Okay, so you're now seeing flags more than you did before.
[05:22] B: I'm really seeing the world like. Like it is. And.
[05:25] A: And Are we feeling like what happened to you has had you feel a little jaded about people in general because you weren't thinking before that people would do those kinds of things or act that kind of way or have that stuff happen. So it's kind of shifted a little bit of jadedness around stuff, and that might not necessarily be how you want to be.
[05:50] B: Exactly. Overall, yeah. I don't want to think that people hurt me and, like, the, you know, people are out to get me and stuff, or people look at me as a target. I mean, look at my mother. She even did. Now, you see, it's back to. It's like I'm. And I don't know if it's because I'm a very sensitive, sweet, kind person. And so then people are like, just like, oh, that's the one. Let's go take a bit. Because, you know, the darkness is attracted to the light, and they can spot it quickly.
[06:18] A: Right. Actually different.
[06:20] B: What do you mean?
[06:20] A: I don't think darkness is attracted to the light because the light destroys the darkness.
[06:25] B: Yes, that's true.
[06:26] A: I think the darkness is attracted to the weakness, dark people. Predators are not going after strength. The lion may be king of the jungle, but the lion doesn't go after the biggest gazelle, the largest rhinoceros, the tallest giraffe, to conquer them, improve his might. The lion goes after the weakness. Sharks smell blood. Predators don't go after anything that they could possibly get hurt by. Predators only go after weaknesses. The weaknesses are there, Jacqueline, because you have open wounds. You have open wounds because of the shit that happened to you, both in growing up stuff and in stuff that happened that led you to have to go to and. Yeah, right. So what we know is that there are lots of open wounds, and that's what the predator smells. We want to heal the wounds. So you're no longer attracting or attracted to damaged individuals. Right. That's one of the things we want to get done, too.
[07:38] B: Yes.
[07:38] A: Please follow me with that immediately.
[07:42] B: I'll take it.
[07:42] A: That would be one of the things that we want to get shifted for you so that you're free from the impact that that stuff has continued to have on you, because right now you're still at the effect of it. Second part to that is we don't want to think that other people will always have our best interest in mind, because they won't.
[08:02] B: Why is that? And that's the way we live in.
[08:04] A: Because we live in a very crooked world.
[08:07] B: That's so messed up.
[08:08] A: It isn't actually that messed up.
[08:11] B: Really?
[08:12] A: You don't think I don't think right. To think that somebody else is always going to have my best interest in mind is messed up up. Because they will have my best interest in mind as long as their best interest in my best interest match, we go down the road that way. But as soon as their best interest no longer matches my best interest, they don't have mine in mind anymore, they have theirs.
[08:38] B: Well, I understand that, but.
[08:40] A: So the idea is not to be trusting over there. The trust isn't in that person will never do anything to harm me. People ask me all the time I've been married, it's coming up to 24 years. 23 years. 23 years, right. We're in 23 years, 24 years together. Right. And so people ask me all the time, you must trust your wife. And I say I don't, I don't trust my wife, but I don't not trust my wife. Trust is the invisible leg of the table. It's only there when there's a lack of it. So I don't trust my wife, but I don't not trust her. I watch and pay attention that she's walking her talk. That she's talking her walk, right? So if she tells me I'm going to the gym and I think she is and she comes home and she's dressed to the nines and she smells like cologne, I should be thinking that she went to the gym. Oh, okay. Right. The only time that I can be blindsided is if I close my eyes. Right? My daughter when she was four would do these silly things. Daddy, I have a surprise in my room. Close your eyes. And she'd want to pull me through the house. Now I know my 4 year old's intention isn't to bang me into, but I'm also thinking that as she's running through the house, she's not paying attention to my size versus her size. And I probably will.
[10:06] B: Oh.
[10:06] A: So I do this as she pulls me through the house so that I'm taking care of me.
[10:13] B: Okay.
[10:14] A: Where we want the trust and the discernment is within you. But see, what's been off is the picker's been off. That you've been finding yourself attracting and attracted to damaged individuals. Right. And those damaged individuals see those wounds and that's why you become more attractive. We want to heal the wounds. So you're no longer attracting or attracted to those damaged individuals. Right.
[10:57] B: Because I'd really rather not know any more of them.
[10:59] A: But see what we want Is we want your eyes to be open.
[11:03] B: Yes.
[11:04] A: I'm gonna have in your ears to be tuned like a fire detector. A fire detector would be useless if it kept going off all the time when there's no fire. That would be useless.
[11:20] B: The.
[11:20] A: This thing's goddamn broken. It's like the little boy that cried. Right? No. If it just kept going off and it's no fire, like, I'm not gonna listen to it anymore.
[11:29] B: Oh, right.
[11:31] A: Follow me.
[11:32] B: Yes.
[11:32] A: But the fire detector isn't there to prevent the fire. That's not why it's there. Like, I don't have a fire detector because I think one day my house is going to catch on fire. But I don't not have a fire detector because I think, you know, it never will. I have it there at the off chance that something happens. And what do I want my fire detector to do? I want it to alert me at the earliest sign of smoke. Why do I want to be alerted earliest? Because then I'm able to do more things about. Would be useless if it went off after half the house is in flames.
[12:22] B: And I'm really screwed.
[12:23] A: Right. And so, yes. What's been problematic because of all these factors and other things, and you don't know that this has been going on. Your lens has been narrowed. So have you ever seen a horse race like the Kentucky Derby? Sometimes horses have blinders on.
[12:43] B: That's right.
[12:43] A: And the only way that they're able to put the blinder on the horse is to come behind the horse's head and put it like this, because then the horse doesn't know it's on. What if, as human beings, we sometimes have blinders on and that blinder narrows our view. And so, unfortunately, we don't see the dark stuff until it's too close to me. Right. When I'm looking at this, what can I not see? I can see you. But in order to see other things, I've got to move my head around. Right. Versus when I'm like this. I can see something out here. Right. I can see something out there. But if I'm like this, I can't see that. I can't see it until it gets to be right here.
[13:32] B: Yeah.
[13:32] A: And then I don't have enough ability to do stuff with it because it came in too close and too hot.
[13:40] B: Yeah.
[13:41] A: Got it to what?
[13:43] B: I got it.
[13:44] A: Yeah, I got it. What I mean by having space in distance is that you have the space in distance inside you so that you're more settled and clear and you're able to see stuff with more space so it's not so tunneled. Makes sense.
[14:11] B: And maybe not get so emotionally attached to it because I'm getting really almost. I am. I'm getting very offended that my mother is out to get me.
[14:26] A: Well, see, and that's. I'm not so sure your mom is out to get you, but I am pretty sure she's not about it working for you.
[14:39] B: Yeah. So.
[14:39] A: Or just like she's about herself.
[14:42] B: Oh, for sure.
[14:43] A: Right.
[14:44] B: Yeah.
[14:44] A: So she's about herself. And we know that when somebody that's a family member, quote, unquote, borrows money, I need to know that it's a gift.
[14:55] B: Well, it doesn't feel like.
[14:56] A: Because I'm not getting it back.
[14:58] B: Yes.
[15:00] A: Right. That's what I need to know is that it's a gift because I'm not getting it back. Because the likelihood that a family member who needs money is going to somehow come in some windfall that they're able to pay me back is very, very low. Because they wouldn't need money if they were managing money better. Right. So we had a family member one time say, hey, could you help me, you know, with my credit cards? And we were very happy and willing to pay off their credit cards. We were, but we said, you need to cut up your cards and cancel them. Oh, no, I can't do that. Well, then we're not going to go ahead and give you the money because what we're then enabling is just you to do the same thing again. Because we're not changing the behavior. What got them into the credit card debt in the first place. If they don't get rid of the credit cards, will be the same thing that will get them into credit card debt again and then be asking for more money from me. Right. So, I mean, that's just what we want to do. But what you've recognized and what you've been beginning to understand more is that you've been at the effect of a lot of the stuff that happened, a lot of the stuff that you did, and you saw things and experienced things in people that have had. You feel more discouraged about people because you didn't know people could be like that.
[16:34] B: No, I never would have thought that.
[16:36] A: Right. So what we want is. We want that good breath to transfer to wisdom.
[16:46] B: Yeah.
[16:47] A: So that I'm more wise, so that I see things with more space and distance and I'm more directive. So I'm not getting bamboozled.
[16:59] B: Yes.
[17:00] A: Right.
[17:04] B: I don't want to be an easy target.
[17:06] A: Right. So that then you get yourself platformed and you have a good foundation as you're moving to something else. Yeah, got it.
[17:18] B: That's right. Exactly.
[17:20] A: Yeah. Cool. All right. What else? Because I follow you with the mom stuff and that. That's the stuff that's present and in your face, and it's really troubling and discouraging that it's your mom and it feels like she's fucking you over and. And that is very hurtful. And yet you're also in a position that I can't leave there yet. So we've got all of those things. Right. So we're dealing with that part. I get it. That there's been a bunch of stuff that happened and some things that happen with certain men, that the effect you've been feeling both in a financial sense of where you are, but also in an emotional distress aspect of things, and that you've been working to help identify the. What we'll call you called the roots, which I don't know whether there's really roots or not.
[18:27] B: I don't know. Or wind or waves.
[18:29] A: I don't know whether it's a root that it goes to a single source. I think it's probably more rhizomatic. And rhizomatic is simply the other plant in botany. Right. The tree grows from a singular root, and then, yes, it grows out other roots to help secure the tree to the ground. But there's one source that it grows from. Rhizomes are like mushrooms, mint leaves, turmeric, dandelions. The crab grasses we have in Florida. Right. What. What that means is they are connected through multiple interconnections. So there's no single source that it grows from. Mushrooms pop up in all different places. So do dandelions. We can't rip them out and go, oh, we've eradicated it, because it'll pop up somewhere else.
[19:35] B: It does.
[19:36] A: We can cut out the crab grass in Florida and pick it up. We can go plant it somewhere else. It may grow back to the originating source that it came from, or it might create a whole new network. That's how our brain works. Our brain is. Isn't singularly rooted. It's rhizomatic. It's connected through multiple linkages and multiplicities. So what we're really interested in doing is getting a hold of some of the linchpins that have been keeping this thing running in the way that it has been for you. Okay. So that inside you get distance and freedom and clarity and ease that you feel inside of you more space from that darkness. Yeah, right. And that we see mom clearly for what's going on over there and that it feels like what's going on over there is about mom, which, you know, up here it is, but you don't fully feel it in here because for you it's hard to conceive or fathom that somebody would be doing that to their own kid. Got it. We want that distance so that you see it clearly and it's integrated emotionally.
[21:24] B: And I mean, you know, ever since I was young, my mother and I have had a very distant relationship. You know, her being an alcoholic and you know, very, you know, verbally and sometimes even physically abusive. I had distanced myself from her a long time ago from like 12 or 13 years old. You know, we really didn't talk until my 20, 21st year. And it was me feeling like I needed a better relationship with my mother. Cuz we couldn't even talk on the phone. We couldn't, we couldn't even have a short conversation without like us blowing up or I was, I was literally yelling. I would end up being yelling because it was like ridiculous. Like I just couldn't handle it. Like some of the stuff she would say and it's just absurd. And so then I tried to come back around and I felt that I needed that relationship. But something that I've realized in this work is, you know, I love her. I do, you know, I love her. I want the best for, I hope the best for her, but I also accept her for who she is. And I realized that I don't need her. I don't need her to be beautiful, you know, and content. And maybe she wasn't. And I always like aspired to and wanted to have that mother daughter relationship, you know, the one that went to the mall together and had cute little talks and like they had their own bond and own relationship. Like it was like a girlfriend, you know, I always wanted that. I never had that. And I realized now that, you know what? I'm not gonna have that. I love her for who she is and I love the relationship that like I'm okay with the relationship that we have and it's fine because I feel like I can manage or I'm managing the best way out. It's kind of like it's a very abusive relationship. I take a lot of abuse and a lot of like her tearing me down. But I know that it's because she's not up. You know, you can't expect someone that doesn't feel and Love themselves, to love you back, you know, her trying to always pick pinpoints at me and, like, little jabs at who I am as a character. It's like. It's sad, but it's like, you don't even know me. For you to say the things you do about me. You don't even know me, and you don't appreciate me. And I get a lot of love from a lot of people, and they talk about my spirit and, like, take the time to tell me and, like, and honor me as another being. And I think it's so precious, and I'm so grateful for that because I love that people feel that and get that from me because that's what I want. I want everybody to, you know, feel love and liked and calmness and just peace and just another beautiful being, appreciating and sharing and, you know, feeling giving flow and love to another, you know, and just being beautifully, you know, you and uniquely you. And so, I don't know. It's. It's. It's devastating in a way, but I've always known this for a long time. And I do feel like. And one of my biggest problems is that I take a lot of the blame for how things have gone, you know, I chose to come over here, you know, and now I'm having to resurface and feel how our relationship really is, you know, and how she does view me and things like that. So everything in my life, just like that guy that put me in prison, like, I was going to travel Europe for the summer, why did I have to go back with him? You know, why did I get convinced to go spend, oh, my last two weeks with him when I knew that he wasn't the one and I shouldn't be involved with him and in a relationship with him? You know, like, I knew that. So I do take a lot of.
[25:30] A: That's the problem. The problem is there was a part of you that knew it and a different part of you that didn't. So you weren't fully clear. Just like there's a part of you that knows it's mom and has always known. Yes, Mom's not well, but there's another part of you that hasn't fully gotten it yet. That's the part that we want to speak to.
[26:04] B: That's what I need to have more confidence that. Because that's where my discernment comes in. And that's what I'm most scared about, my decisions and then within my future, because I don't have, like, enough confidence and Being.
[26:18] A: How do you know?
[26:19] B: Because I know because I second guess everything.
[26:21] A: Well, you're pretty confident that you're not confident.
[26:24] B: Oh, no, no, I know I'm not.
[26:26] A: So what's it like to feel really confident that you're not confident and you got a lot of confidence in being not confident. Jacqueline.
[26:35] B: I think I know, but I. I second guess everything.
[26:42] A: Like, what if you started second guessing the second guess?
[26:47] B: I felt I came about that the other day practicing that. About not. Yeah, I just got that somehow somewhere from something about doubting the doubt.
[27:01] A: Yes. Doubting the doubt.
[27:02] B: Doubting the doubt. I don't know where it came from. I don't know where I was or what that came about.
[27:06] A: Right. We talked about that. Doubting the doubt.
[27:10] B: Oh, did we?
[27:11] A: Uh huh.
[27:12] B: Oh, that was you and me. Okay, well, you know that.
[27:17] A: Right. So see if you can be confident about being not confident, which you were pretty darn confident that you're not confident. And you know that you are not confident because you've been second guessing yourself. But you could be second guessing the second guess and then you might be more confident in you. Because you know already what it's like to be confident that you're not confident.
[27:44] B: It's like, yeah, but then I get to a point where I don't even know what I'm second guessing anymore because, see, I've wavered it so many times in my head. So then I'm like, okay, so which one is the right. Which one? I'm so afraid to make a mistake anymore because of where my life has been, what I've had to deal with. I'm like, oh my gosh, I don't even want to make a decision anymore. I don't want it because I don't want the next big, big mistake. Because my blow ups are big blow ups. There's no freaking, you know, small potatoes in my bag, you know, like, I'm can't, like.
[28:22] A: I mean, if you're gonna do it, you might as well go.
[28:23] B: Yeah, if I'm on the farm, I might as well farm. But so it's wild.
[28:31] A: So we want you to be more in coherence with yourself.
[28:34] B: That's it.
[28:35] A: I wanna more in alignment. Yeah, right. So that you're more clear.
[28:41] B: Right. Because I'm totally freaked out about what.
[28:43] A: Makes sense for you to do. And then in action, doing it. Feeling good about what you're doing.
[28:50] B: Yes.
[28:51] A: And when you think back about having done it that way. Glad you did.
[28:54] B: That's right.
[28:56] A: Yeah, that's where we're headed.
[28:58] B: That's what I want.
[28:59] A: Right. Is you're becoming more okay in you, free from the effect that this stuff has had because you're seeing it clearly. You've got distance in space, so therefore it's easier to do the things that are best for you to do. It's hard to do it if I'm like this and things keep coming in and I don't see it over there until it's here.
[29:31] B: Well, then that makes the exact opposite sense of what people have been telling me to do about keeping my blinders on. Don't get distracted by the temptation. I guess that's kind of two different theories we're talking about. We're talking about a little different. Because that would be the same thing. It would be still being aware of what's going on. Like your running path on the track. But don't, you know, dip over into the sidelines.
[30:02] A: Yeah. Right. So that you can see your path.
[30:07] B: Yeah.
[30:08] A: The one that makes sense for you to do. Right. And you're in alignment with it. Right. So that it's okay to do it.
[30:19] B: I need to be in alignment with it.
[30:22] A: Yeah. So that you're connected to you. Trusting in you. That you have. That you have what you need. Need.
[30:36] B: Yes.
[30:37] A: Right. And that you now, based on what you've gone through, have more wisdom.
[30:43] B: I do believe so.
[30:44] A: You're not so naive.
[30:46] B: That's right. And I think why this happened truly is because no one later on down the road could really screw me over in a bigger way. You see? So this. These little small potatoes that they screwed or threw around or tossed out the window or, you know, or tried to hold me down into where I didn't have a future, you know, did all those things and all that stuff happened to me, and I had to go through that. So the big one didn't happen. You know, so nothing really serious down the road happened to where it actually is saving my future. I know that's why this happened. I know that's why. So I will never be. I will never have anyone be able to take anything big from me. No one's gonna screw me over. No one's gonna get over on me. Nothing like that is gonna happen.
[31:38] A: Right. I can't get blindsided again.
[31:41] B: That's it.
[31:42] A: Because I'm aware.
[31:43] B: That's right.
[31:45] A: I was talking to a guy who got in a traffic accident right off the interstate here because somebody cut through an area that they're not supposed to cut through. So up until that moment, he didn't think it was even possible for somebody to cut through as we unplug. The effect that the trauma has had on him, creating angst when he was there, he's now more aware. So he's more protective of himself. Yeah, because he knows certain things could happen that he never had conceived of, could have happened before.
[32:28] B: So you're ultimately saying that I should probably go back to my old ways of when I was, you know, a young teenager. I was very protective of myself, and I. I didn't let a lot of people in. I didn't let a lot of people. People know a lot about me either. And even the ones that were close to me, I was very guarded and I kind of let things unfold or like you were saying, people would. I let people show me who they are and kind of just let things go.
[33:00] A: But I don't know whether it's always about being guarded.
[33:06] B: I like that. Because I really don't want to go back to that.
[33:08] A: I don't think that that's what I'm saying. What I am saying is I want you to be in a place that you're both alert, aware and relaxed. That you're seeing other people clearly, you're seeing their intentions clear clearly.
[33:33] B: Yes. I'd like that very much.
[33:34] A: And you're weighing. Do they match with me?
[33:40] B: Yeah.
[33:41] A: Because if they are, it's fine to proceed forward. If it doesn't, I do something else.
[33:49] B: Yeah.
[33:50] A: But I'm more aware because I'm much more emotionally present.
[33:57] B: Yeah.
[33:59] A: Right. What we are learning is that you haven't been as emotionally present as you want to be because you're still at the effect of some of the shit that happened.
[34:14] B: Oh, yeah. There was a lot that happened.
[34:16] A: Right. But the effect is still going on, so it's no longer the shape that happened. That's not what we're troubled by. That shit happened.
[34:30] B: Not really.
[34:31] A: I mean, what we're troubled by is the effect that that shit happening has continued to have on your brain. Yes, that's what we want to get adjusted. That's why I say it's not the lion that makes the zebra scared. Instead, it's the zebra's brain. Even though the brain of the zebra does it, as soon as the zebra sees, smells, feels, thinks, senses lion approaching, it's zebra's brain that makes zebra alert, motivated, and stronger. We do call it scared. Yes, it does run away. But it's not the lion that's doing it. It's the zebra's brain. So what's continued to make you feel bad, that lingering angst or Anger or hurt or grief has been something your brain has been doing to you, even though it's been doing it to you in response to that stuff. And the cool part is we can't get the stuff to have not happened. But we don't have to. Because you're not troubled because stuff happened. I know that sounds crazy, but you're troubled because when it happened, part of your brain froze and doesn't know the troubling moment ended. There are parts of your brain that don't know certain awful things that you went through, ended, stopped. You totally do. So where you're reasonable, rational, logical, where you understand things, where you're bright, you totally know that it's that at the other level, that part doesn't know it ended.
[36:31] B: And what's that other level?
[36:33] A: So where therapy got it wrong is that therapy thought that in order to make it through the troubling things, I learned ways to repress and bury it. I learned ways to just put it in the closet, to put it behind a locked door, to shove it under the carpet. Right. And that therapy's job is to provide a safe, warm, nurturing, caring, supportive, kind environment to help me process, figure out, understand, and get the bad feelings out of me. Yeah, Just like throwing up, which after throwing up, I do feel a little bit better. The problem is I still get triggered by the same.
[37:16] B: Yeah.
[37:17] A: So what we're gonna do is the opposite. We're gonna get the good news in to the parts of the brain that don't know certain. Certain awful events ended. You survived it. You're okay.
[37:33] B: I did survive that.
[37:34] A: I know I did survive that.
[37:36] B: With flying colors. Really.
[37:37] A: I feel like I did a really.
[37:38] B: Good job through all that.
[37:39] A: But there's an aspect, different aspects that don't know. Certain awful things ended. That's why when you're in, something similar to it or something reminds you of it, or when you start thinking. Thinking about it, or when you even start talking about it, it's right there.
[38:00] B: Yeah. It's so heavy.
[38:02] A: Not because it was so awful. I know that sounds crazy.
[38:07] B: You've been seeing it in there.
[38:09] A: But not because it was so awful, but because part of your brain doesn't know the awful thing ended, that you survived it. You're here, you're okay. And okay doesn't mean great. Okay just means okay. Okay.
[38:27] B: I think you need to use the restroom.
[38:29] A: Go use the restroom. I'm gonna go use the other restroom. All right. So any questions about what I've been talking about so far? You're following me it's making sense.
[38:44] B: Oh, it's making sense.
[38:45] A: Cool, right? So we're not about getting the bad feelings out. We want the good news in. We want to unplug, plug the memory so the brain can experience it as information because it's currently coded in your brain is happening, even though the logical part knows that it's not. Got it.
[39:09] B: It's wild, isn't it?
[39:10] A: The second thing that happens that keeps these things stuck is that when we're little, we're lied to by culture and society, by parents, by authority. And the big lie is, life is good. And when you're good, good things happen. Toys, presents, cookies, candy. Once a year, some dude you don't know drops gifts off because you're good. So the messaging that gets installed when we're little is that good things happen because I am good. I am. I am is identity. My identity equals good. Which is great if for that child, their life is nothing but good. I've never met anyone where life has been nothing but good. And so the error, right. If I was trained to believe that good happens because I am good, well, then if bad happens, it's because I am bad, or I did something wrong or even worse, there's something wrong with me.
[40:19] B: That's right.
[40:20] A: Or maybe I should have known better or I shouldn't have put myself in that situation. I never should have done that thing. So all of the negative stuff that gets tied into anything that I go through that was bad feels more like it was my fault and I'm to blame. So when mom and dad get divorced and the kid is six, the little kid doesn't go, oh, that's a mom and dad issue. Little kid feels, if I was more lovable, my dad would be around more. And if dad said, At 9, I'm gonna take you to Disney and then doesn't show up, the little kid doesn't think to himself, right, My drunken alcoholic dad is on a bender. He doesn't get to go to the coolest place in the world with me. No. The little kid feels like, oh, it must have something to do with my lack of worth or lovability or if I truly mattered or if he really cared, he would be here, right? If the girl goes out with a co worker's friend and they have a great time and he drops her off at her apartment and she even gives him a kiss and is hoping that they may go out on a second date, and he says to her, oh, my goodness, I'm so sorry, but I really need to use the Restroom. Now she's not going to be a jerk, so she lets him in. Now, she had no idea that when he got out of the restroom he was going to force himself upon her and rape her, which is a horrific experience. But nobody's shocked when she blames herself for being so stupid, careless. How could she have put herself in that vulnerable situation? She should have known better. Right. You should be thinking that a co worker's friend that you just had a nice pleasant date with is going to rape you.
[42:00] B: Right, Exactly.
[42:01] A: But because it was bad, that's what gets attached. Got it?
[42:07] B: Yeah.
[42:08] A: Once those two things are attached in that way, our brain does the third thing and that is as a protectionary mechanism, it is constantly scanning, sorting, searching for anything that's similar to anything that I went through that was painful. But again, it's looking through that very narrow lens and it's got to constantly be moving in order to see stuff.
[42:33] B: But then do you. Would you. Do you also think that we possibly then bring that continuously back into our brain or bring. Sorry, bring that into our world?
[42:44] A: Well, because I'm looking through a very narrow lens, right. I'm sending out other attraction factors of.
[42:54] B: The same type of what you're looking for.
[42:56] A: And it's not what I'm looking for, but yes, it's what I try to be aware of, but I'm not really see in the animal world. It makes sense that when a rabbit hears a twig snap and takes off, that rabbit's got a better chance of living than the one who heard the twig snap. Map and thought it was Georgio. Right. Because survival is key. So our brain confuses similar but maps it is same. And I miss a lot because I'm looking through a narrowed lens, I can't see as much. It's kind of like a flashlight in a dark room. I can only see the things that the flashlight is pointing at. I miss everything else in the room. And if I move the light to a different area now I'm seeing what I can see in that area, but I'm missing the area I just was. And everything else I can't possibly see as well when I'm looking through that narrowed lens. And anything that's similar gets read as identical. So the dramatic example is the guy diving on the ground when the firework bursts. But it's not because he didn't know he was at a fourth of July celebration, he's the same guy that lit the firework. It's that the other part of his brain confused the sound with mortar grenade. Oh, that's why he had that reaction. The guy's making out with the gal that he's into that's into him, and it's feeling really good. And he wants to be with her and she wants to be with him. And playfully, she's touching his inner thigh, moving toward. And he does this, and he's like, what the is wrong with me? The girl who I'm into is touching me in a way that should feel good. Right? Yeah. But is there any similarity to what his uncle did to him when he was 11?
[45:00] B: Damn it.
[45:02] A: Right? And it doesn't even have to be a part of the problem. It could have been something that co occurred. I was working with a gal one time who had been raped by a guy in a park who was wearing a Taylor Swift shirt. She hates Taylor Swift, which nowadays is not a good thing to hate because she's everywhere and in all places. Right. Of course, the issue when that rape happened was not the name on the tape T shirt. That is not the part that bothered her. What he did is what bothered her. But because they co occurred, they got merged. Make sense. So the good news is those three pieces I just illustrated have one common denominator distortion. Because if I take my hand and I slam it in the sand and I pick it up, it does leave an impact. But is the imprint that my hand left the same thing as my hand? No. Is the meaning at all what happened? Did she put herself in danger? Was she being careless? Or did she let the guy use her bathroom? Right. How different is a firework from a grenade? So instead of that process and get it out, we get the good news into the aspects that don't know it ended. So the brain gets to be updated to the current moment, and you get to have more space and freedom and ease inside.
[46:37] B: Yeah, that would be nice.
[46:38] A: That you get to connect to more of who you are, which wasn't any of the things you did or happened to you. None of that was ever, ever a part of you.
[46:47] B: Right.
[46:48] A: It was all just shit that you went through. Got it. So where we're headed then is a you where. Notice that different times as you were describing different things, there were different emotions that you were feeling as you were talking about it. Got it. So the you that I'm seeing, that kind of weight, this you shall, she remembers having had it and felt it. But if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't know how to get it. The you that I'm seeing, that's been completely cleared and Gone. Got it. The you that I am seeing is much more emotionally present. She's a lot lighter and even easier on herself. She's got more distance and space so that she sees. Sees other people's stuff clearly emotionally. Right. That she's learning about them. And even if it's things that they've said about her, she's not learning about herself. She's learning about their thoughts or opinions on stuff she said or done. She's learning about them. And because of that, she's got space and freedom in how she's responds, which sometimes might be with care and concern. Other times might be being very firm and direct. Other times might it just goes by because there's no sticks. It's not about her. Got it. The you that I'm seeing is much more at peace. So that she's alert and aware, but also relaxed at the same time. Connected to more of who she really is and directing her life. Got it. This is the you that I'm seeing now. The cool part is you don't have to see this future you as clearly as I do. Okay. Because my question isn't how it's going to happen that we get you here. My question is, would it be okay with you?
[48:58] B: Yeah.
[48:58] A: Yeah. And see with it. Okay, we've got a green light. Right. And just notice what you're already noticing happening in your body. How's your body feeling now? Like more tense or more calm?
[49:12] B: Relaxed?
[49:12] A: It is feeling more relaxed.
[49:14] B: Yeah.
[49:14] A: Right. And we want to move into even more relaxed by using brain level that accelerate healing by putting body into a state of rest. Right. How we do it is really simple. You just slightly lower your jaw, relax the back of your tongue at the bottom of your mouth and then easily. That's right. Begin to breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale and then a little bit longer on the exhale. Right. And you'll notice that as you're breathing in this slightly slower and deeper way, notice again what's happening to the body. That's right. As you're noticing all of this, we're going to open awareness and move from that elevated narrow beta down into lower beta into alpha. Alpha is correlated with what surfers call flow. Athletes think of as being in the zone, so alert and relaxed. So how it works is you're going to continue to breathe like you are, but stay looking at my nose. As you stay looking at my nose, you see my fingers? You're looking at my nose. My fingers move out. And then with the sides of your eyes Pick up my fingers wiggling. Notice as you open or you're becoming more aware of the space in this room, how you're aware of more of the space between you and I. Right. The space towards the side windows and doors, the space that's beyond me, the space behind you, underneath where you're seated and above your head. Right. And as you're noticing more and more of the space again, check inside your body. How's your body feeling now? Isn't that interesting? Yeah, yeah. And as your body's feeling this state of rest, I don't know whether you realize it or not, but you didn't decide to put your hands in the way they are because you could have had this hand on top versus this hand on top. So I'm wondering if you know that your unconscious did that for you without you having to think about it because your conscious mind can only pay attention to seven plus or minus two things at a time where your unconscious monitors it all simultaneously. That's right. And what we're really in interested in connecting more to is that unconscious part of your mind most closely connected to body that is totally in charge. It's not you that's running the show because the emotions you feel and the reactions you have are pre conscious. It's not like you decide, oh, I'm going to think this thought now and then that thought or I'm going to feel this way and then that way or I'm going to do that thing when this happens, you. Right. Just find yourself doing it. And so what we're interested in is aligning you with your unconscious, which is totally interested in working in ways that are beneficial and best for you. Right. Its number one job is always keeping you alive. That's why it beats your heart and why it breathes for you. It's why when a bug splats the windshield, it closes your eyes. That's right. Your unconscious is wonderfully responsive to you and is interested letting you know that things are healing on the inside. That's right. And so again, there are different processes that are automatic unconscious processes. It's the program that the brain runs. Just like if you and I, a little bit closer were to meet for the first time. Like I've never met you, you've never met me, and I go to introduce myself. What would you do? That's right. And now just look at that spot. Don't do anything at all on purpose. Look right there. As you look right there, just notice what starts to happen with that hand. Becoming. That's right. More cataleptic. Isn't that interesting that you can look at that spot and get curious about how you notice. Right. Movement happening within the fingers of that hand. And see, I don't know whether you'll notice the movement happening first is a little twitch or a wiggle, or for you, it might be a jump or a jerk within the fingers within that hand. But just get curious because as you're curious about the sensations that you can notice within the fingers of that hand, your unconscious is responding. That's right. To you. Isn't that interesting that your unconscious is responding in a way to you that you're not consciously doing, but you're noticing? And see, while you're aware of that hand, you haven't been paying much attention to this one, which is also canonical. See, I don't know what's going to happen. I'm not sure if that hand is going to drop down at the same time this hand begins to lift up. And I'm not sure what you'll notice first, whether it's that hand or this hand. But what I do know is that your unconscious knows more than you do on how to heal itself. That's right. And see. That's right. Everything that's happening now is happening on the inside. So think of a time in your life when you are outside in nature and you see something, something that's just beautiful. What is it that you see?
[57:07] B: Glorious. It's just also glorious.
[57:10] A: It's also glorious. What is it that you're seeing in nature that's all so glorious?
[57:15] B: The life.
[57:17] A: The life. Yeah.
[57:18] B: And what specifically the things like how everything is like beating almost and alive as one.
[57:28] A: And see, there's that. That moment that as you're experiencing things beating and alive as one, you're feeling like a sense of all wonder, peace, excitement. And some people might say that experiencing that is giving you those feelings. But if we looked at it from a different lens, we could say that being there and experiencing it drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what if at your center you always are peaceful and excited? Kind of like, I've got a candle and the flame is burning and I take my hand from up high and I move it down towards the flame. I say, oh, my goodness, this candle's getting a lot hotter. Is the candle getting hotter or am I becoming more aware of the heat?
[58:30] B: I'd say you're becoming more aware.
[58:32] A: That's right. And so we know that in your life there have been many times where your awareness has been anywhere but at Your center. Times of angst or anger or grief or guilt or shame or pain or hurt or sadness. But. But the cool part is, no matter where your awareness has been, always at your center. You're peaceful and excited. Just like, you know, two of us are in here. How do you know it? Your senses bring in data. Your intellect organizes it. We call that light of knowledge at your center, Jacqueline. Brighter light, light of wisdom. So now we've got light of knowledge. We've got light of wisdom. And you know that I work with all sorts of people about all sorts of awful stuff happen. And I remember this one girl that I worked with, his older brother found a stick and used to take it and jam it in. So she had a lot of luck around all of that stuff, which you can imagine, but when we work together, we clear out all the pain. So she was sitting across from me, present, and I asked her the question. I go, all that. I go, where was it? And she looks at me and she's got this big smile, and she goes, it's gone. I don't feel any of it anymore. I said, I know. Isn't that cool? And she says, it is. I go, but that's not what my question was. My question was, where was it? And so we started thinking, and I asked her, was it a surface level thing? And she's like, no, it wasn't intellectual. I said, oh, maybe it was hiding in your center. And she's like, dude, really? How could that stuff survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited?
[60:25] B: Yeah.
[60:26] A: I said, huh? Well, then, where was it? And this is what she told me. She goes, I. I know now. I go, okay, well, tell me. She says, it was hiding in the light. Hiding the light. It was hiding in the shadows in between those lights. I said, well, what happened? She says, the shadows are gone, the lights are connected, the distortion is gone. I said, whoa, that's cool. And then we started talking about how people fuck up identity all the time, that people actually walk around and you might be one of them going, you know what I am. My body, my body is me. But the weird problem. What if you're not your body? What if you have a body? Your body's totally yours, but what if it's not actually you?
[61:15] B: I don't think that is who I am.
[61:17] A: Yeah, what if. What if there's no single cell within your body that's it's the same as it was, that they all get replaced millions and millions of times? Your feet alone are longer than they were when you were two. Yet despite the changes, you're definitely you. So we know that you're not your body. People go, oh, well, if I'm not my body, I must be my thoughts. But what if you're not your thoughts? What if you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? What if your brain is, and your brain is not you, it's an organ like your heart and your liver and your lungs. They're totally yours, but not you? And then people start getting confused because they go, if I'm not my body and I'm not my thoughts, I must be how I feel. Yeah, but there are different ways that you feel at different times. And even when you're feeling that way instead of this way, you don't stop being you. So you can't be a feeling. And then they go, well, then definitely what's left is I must be what I do.
[62:19] B: Oh, my gosh.
[62:20] A: I said, but there's lots of things you've done in life. And when you stop doing that thing to do this other thing, did you stop existing? And they said, no. I go, that's right. Well, then I must be my past. But you're not in the past. Those are things that have done or have happened to you, so you can't be your past. So then we start thinking. We go, well, if you're not any of those things, your thoughts, your feelings, your body, what you do, what the heck are you? So let's just say you just are that the who you just are is what you became aware of as you're feeling that pulsing sense of all one, that the who you are is the light at the center. And see, Jacqueline, the light that is you. That light can't get hurt or harmed or touched. Right? Who you are can't be touched in those ways. The who you really are can only be touched with respect and love. And it's only the love that you decide to allow in. That's right. And so I was telling that same girl, you know, I had to go to the dentist. I said, you'll never believe what the jerk did to me. And she goes, well, what did he do? I go, well, the first thing he did is he put me on this weird chair, whereas I sat down. Immediately my legs started start moving up and my head starts moving down. And she's like, okay, you're at the dentist. And then I said, well, the next thing he did is he flipped a light on and then moved this thing right over my eyes. I can't see anything. I'm Blinded by this light. And she's like, yeah, you're at the dentist. And then I say to her, well, then he took this cold instrument and shoved it inside of me. And she's like, ah. Oh, my goodness. And you're what? And I said, my mouth. I'm at the dentist. But see, that's the same thing that I said to her with her brother. I said, when you were little, your brother, he messed with your stuff. And she looked at me and she said, he did. And for a long time it screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings. But then she looked at me with this glow again and she said, but you know what I said? What? She said, he never touched me.
[65:04] B: Isn't that something?
[65:05] A: I go, that's right.
[65:06] B: That's correct.
[65:07] A: She goes, he messed with my body. It hurt my feelings, fucked up my thinking. But he never touched who I really am. He never got me.
[65:17] B: Exactly.
[65:18] A: That's right. Because they never can exactly touch who you really are.
[65:22] B: That's right.
[65:23] A: That's right.
[65:24] B: Amazing.
[65:25] A: Yes. Yeah. So one more time, slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Breathing in as you are, a little slower and deeper out a little bit longer. As you're breathing in this way, you can see me and my nose. Nose. You can see my fingers. And then with the sides of your eyes, you pick up the fingers wiggling, and you notice more space. As you're noticing more of the space that's right in between to the sides, beyond, underneath, behind and above. Notice how this space goes beyond the room, like literally all the way out in every direction. The space is unending, like towards outer space. That's how much space there is. As you noticing this space, just for a moment, close your eyes. And then with your eyes closed, imagine floating up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof, because you rise way up above it all in the sky, the think of having a bird's eye view. Not a perched bird in a tree, but a bird that's up above, soaring and freely flying through the vastness of the space in the sky in any direction, maybe big, wide, arching angles. You soar, you glide, you fly, you move. You're free. That's right. And then when you're ready, bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you. Take a nice big deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. In those short moments eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself? Yeah. How's your body feeling now?
[67:37] B: It's good.
[67:38] A: It is good. Like how so? How do you know?
[67:49] B: Cuz I've been going there lately.
[67:51] A: Oh, you have? Yeah. And where is the there that you've been going lately?
[68:02] B: Existence. A loving. Like Omer.
[68:15] A: Oh, Aura. Just.
[68:21] B: Just all divine love.
[68:24] A: Yeah.
[68:25] B: Just completeness.
[68:29] A: Yeah.
[68:29] B: And of nothingness, but of everything.
[68:35] A: That's right. So as all of that has been happening and you're here now with me, that other part of your brain, the unconscious, is going to begin to travel down the timeline of moments in your own experience, your own history that were negative things that typically, when you think about them, make you feel icky. Whether it be shit that you did or happened to you. That point part of your brain is going to begin to categorize in group moments. Then it's going to narrow and pinpoint a particular moment, one time, one thing, and bring it to your awareness. Right. For us to unplug and heal. Right. What moment came to mind?
[69:37] B: I. It was the.
[69:39] A: You got the moment. The moment happened about how long ago?
[69:46] B: Four years ago.
[69:48] A: The feelings that come up as you think about it are feelings of. What does it hurt? Anger. Sadness. Grief. Guilt. Shame. Regret. Remorse. A combination just discomfort. Discomfort and hurt. So first question. Would it be okay to get that gone? Yeah. And if that's gone, would it mean what happened was okay? You get to be okay even though what happened wasn't.
[70:12] B: That's right.
[70:13] A: That's right. Got it. So how we unplug and heal something is super simple. Doesn't require a lot. Only one thing from you. Do you want to know what it is you do?
[70:25] B: Yeah.
[70:25] A: Okay, I'll talk. You want to intend to be emotionally present with me? Just intend. My job is to keep you here. Got it. The reason that you want to intend to be with me is that this is the shit that's happening. I'm a happening guy. This is what's happening. And that isn't. Got it.
[70:45] B: Okay.
[70:45] A: Two, we're working on a mutual goal that we both want for you. Three, I'm hoping hanging out with me is at least a little more enjoyable than that sucky moment. Got it. And if that happened four years ago, there have been many things you've done after that moment that were at least a little more enjoyable than that moment. Yeah. What's one thing you've done anytime from four years ago until, heck, even yesterday, that was more fun than that?
[71:12] B: I'm being with my dog.
[71:13] A: Yeah, being with your dog. Way more fun than that. Good. Something else.
[71:16] B: Going to the beach.
[71:17] A: Going to the beach. And one other thing.
[71:18] B: Being in the woods?
[71:19] A: Yeah, being in the woods. All of those moments happen after that. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond it. So we have good news to get in. Got it. So when that moment happened, about four years ago, when it happened, you were where? Yeah. Where were you when it happened? So you're in Boca. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[71:45] B: Nighttime.
[71:46] A: Nighttime. And you're aware, like, in Boca, like you're in an apartment or a house. You're an apartment. Right.
[71:51] B: Good.
[71:51] A: And you're like, we're in the apartment, like, living room, dining room, bedroom, outside the hallway. So you're outside in the hallway. Right. Good. And then what happened next? So the police came. Right. And you're out in the hallway.
[72:05] B: That's the moment that my mom in reference back to.
[72:09] A: Right. So you're in the hallway and the police are there.
[72:14] B: Yeah.
[72:14] A: Yeah. And they say.
[72:17] B: They asked me what happened.
[72:19] A: Right. They say what happened? You're like, I'm not saying. And then they said what?
[72:24] B: Well, then you're under arrest.
[72:25] A: Right. Good. And then they did what, they put C on you?
[72:29] B: Yeah.
[72:29] A: Right.
[72:30] B: Yeah.
[72:30] A: And then they walked you out of the apartment. Right. And then they put you back in the cop car.
[72:36] B: Yeah.
[72:36] A: Right. And then they took you to processing.
[72:38] B: Yeah. I don't really remember much of that.
[72:40] A: Well, right, but that happened.
[72:42] B: Yeah.
[72:42] A: Right. And then eventually you got out of jail. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to the beach.
[72:50] B: Yeah.
[72:51] A: Or hang out with your dog.
[72:52] B: Yeah. Right.
[72:54] A: Or be in the woods.
[72:55] B: Yeah.
[72:56] A: Right. So notice, as you were describing, that there was some discomfort, not because that was such a sucky moment, but because your brain was confusing the memory, thinking, it's the experience. We never go backwards with a memory, and the memory tends to stop at the shitty spot, but we never go backwards. But when you go backwards, it literally unplugs the memory and it takes away the charge. So we're gonna go backwards. Right. So we got being in the woods. We got hanging out with your dog. We had going to the beach.
[73:32] B: Yeah.
[73:33] A: Right. And then before that, you had gotten out of jail. Right. And then before that, you were in jail. Right. And then they done the processing, and then they took you to the place to process. And then you were back of the. The squad car. And then they brought you down to the car.
[73:48] B: Yeah.
[73:49] A: And then they put the cuffs on you.
[73:50] B: Oh, yeah.
[73:51] A: And then they said, well, then you're under arrest. And then they asked you what happened. And then you were in the hallway and Then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Right. As I ran through it backwards compared to when you were thinking about it forward, emotionally, how was.
[74:08] B: Was much better.
[74:08] A: I know, because your brain is getting that. It's data about something that happened. Got it. Right. Third, the emotional brain doesn't get logic, but it does get patterns of association. And remember, the error is that the memory of what happened in the experience have been glued, so they've been living as if they're the same thing. But there are things you can remember doing today that you know you're not doing right now, like putting your necklace on. You can remember doing it, maybe even exactly where you were when you did it. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your necklace on, I'm like, jacqueline, stop putting in your necklace. You would look at me and go, I'm not putting on my necklace. Because, you know, there's a difference between the memory of doing it and you actually doing it. Got it. So you can remember them arresting you, them saying, oh, well, then you're under arrest and putting cuffs on you. Putting. You can remember that happening. You can remember going to jail. You can remember putting on your necklace today. Hey, Jacqueline, stop putting on your necklace. Say, I'm not putting on my necklace. Say that. Say, I'm not putting on my necklace.
[75:21] B: I'm not putting on my necklace.
[75:23] A: Good job. Right? Stop putting on your bracelet. Say, I'm not putting on my bracelet. So say, stop putting on your bracelet.
[75:34] B: Stop putting on your bracelet.
[75:35] A: No, you say, I'm not putting on my bracelet.
[75:37] B: I'm not putting on my bracelet.
[75:38] A: Stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt.
[75:41] B: You're not putting on your shirt.
[75:42] A: Well, stop me from putting on my watch. So you're not putting on your watch.
[75:44] B: You're not putting on your watch.
[75:45] A: Well, then stop them from arresting you. See, they're not arresting me.
[75:50] B: Well, then how do I deal with something that I'm actively going through?
[75:53] A: Oh, definitely get to something later before we do the thing that we're doing now. Because you're really smart. Right? But we want to do one at a time.
[76:04] B: Okay.
[76:04] A: We haven't gotten to that yet, have we? No, no. So we want to do this one because this is the one that we're on. Right. So you can remember it happening.
[76:12] B: Yeah.
[76:12] A: Them arresting you, you going to jail. You remember all that happening. You remember putting your skirt on. Stop putting on your skirt. Say, I'm not putting on my skirt. Say that will stop me from putting on my pants. Say you're not putting on your pants. Well, then stop them from arresting you. Say they're not arresting me. Well, then you stop going to jail. Say I'm not going to jail. Well, then stop it from happening. Say it's not happening. So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists.
[76:36] B: It no longer exists.
[76:37] A: Bingo. Which is the first part that we want to get in. Right. As that starts to get in, what do you notice happening to the feelings?
[76:49] B: I'm working down with it.
[76:51] A: You are more okay with it, aren't you? Right. And that earlier you wasn't sure how she was. How it was going to turn out. Not when that happened. She wasn't sure how it was going to turn out.
[77:04] B: Oh, no.
[77:05] A: Right. She doesn't know about going to the beach or being with her dog. She didn't know that.
[77:14] B: She knew that.
[77:15] A: Not in the moment that you were getting arrested. She had no access to any of that later.
[77:21] B: Well, my brain naturally went to there that I knew that I was going to be at a certain place, I was gonna be able to do certain things and that I was gonna.
[77:31] A: But not in that moment.
[77:33] B: Okay. In the moment.
[77:34] A: In the moment that the rabbit is running for its life trying to get away from the fox, there are no thoughts about carrots or the rendezvous, playing with a cute bunny the night morning. Not in the moment that it's running for its life. It's fox without end. And the moment that it happens, that part of the brain doesn't know anything. Later you do, but that part doesn't. So close your eyes. Picture that earlier, you letting her know, of course that moment is over, finished, completely defeated. No longer exists. Letting her know that that happening was about that happening. Then it's not about me. Identity. Right. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about going to the beach. Let her know about playing with the dog. Let her know about pain in the woods. Let her know about working at Sableup. Let her know so that she gets it. Right. And as she's getting it, what do you notice happening to that earlier? You. What happens to her face? Right. What's happening now? You are. And as you're sending her love and she's getting that it's over, finished, no longer exists and that you're okay. What do you think happens to that earlier? You.
[79:30] B: I'm loving me more.
[79:31] A: Yeah. She's not troubled, is she?
[79:36] B: No.
[79:37] A: No.
[79:37] B: But I don't know if she was then.
[79:39] A: Huh.
[79:40] B: Because I always felt and knew that she knew that it was gonna be okay. More than okay. That everything was going to be perfect and everything was going to be better than expected and I was going to get a bigger blessing of that. I knew that.
[80:01] A: See, what I'm going to tell you is there's an aspect of you that knew that in an aspect of you that didn't why you said that couldn't have.
[80:14] B: Cuz that's why I still have that thing or that thing that ran up ping to me or how I divert to having harsh feelings or maybe why I am over critical with people or I don't think it's that I think I'm more aware of the acknowledgement of people so I can pick up when someone is similar to that other person that brought me through hell. And so then I am naturally very uncomfortable and then I'm sad, sickened because I get the realization again of how people can be in this world. And I don't like to think that way. But I'm having to manicure my way through acceptance.
[81:12] A: Okay. Whatever any of that means. So what I'd like you to check in is when you think about that moment now, what do you notice that's right in terms of how it feels?
[81:23] B: That's okay. Like it's not. Oh like it's nothing. That's the way it feels. It's like meh kind of discarded. Like whatever. I had to go through it, I had to experience that.
[81:35] A: I don't know if you had to see, I don't think that the life has been preordained.
[81:41] B: You don't think so?
[81:42] A: I don't think so. I don't think that there's a map that's been laid out that it's preordained. This is what was going to happen. I would tell you that everything that has happened couldn't have not happened exactly the way it happened. But not because there was a preordained plan for it.
[81:57] B: So then don't you think that comes back to the point of where then we take on that blame? Because if I didn't make that decision to go back to that then sorry, but then that wouldn't have happened. So then I'm at fault and it's my mistake for going being with See.
[82:15] A: What I would be thinking about that is that you didn't know when you went back to him that it was going to lead to what it led to. No.
[82:21] B: And I definitely didn't know that he was gone.
[82:22] A: Because if you had known that ahead of time that it was going to lead to what it Led to. Would you have gone back with it?
[82:29] B: Oh, my goodness, never.
[82:30] A: Right. But see, back then, you didn't know that.
[82:33] B: No, I didn't. Oh, okay.
[82:37] A: So you can't have regret and remorse or guilt and shame about something you didn't know was going to happen.
[82:43] B: Yeah, okay. Right. Because it wasn't my fault. And how was I to know?
[82:54] A: Well, you didn't know. No, no, not then.
[82:57] B: No.
[82:58] A: You do now. Yeah, right, Right.
[83:04] B: And I guess some things we just.
[83:06] A: Well, and we already did something with that when you were here the last time, that moment, didn't we? Because I wrote down that we did a moment.
[83:17] B: Yeah.
[83:18] A: That had to do with the guy and the. And the breaking his watch.
[83:22] B: Yep, that's him.
[83:24] A: That's the same thing, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah.
[83:26] B: Well, I. Yeah, I don't. I guess that's been the most destructive thing in my life.
[83:30] A: But see, as you think about it now, and we did it the last time, it didn't have the same feeling tones already.
[83:36] B: Yeah.
[83:36] A: When we went through it this time. No, no, that's why it was more matter of fact.
[83:40] B: That's good. Cuz it got brought up the other day, the other week, and I usually. I haven't had any thoughts of it, but somehow it pinged into me.
[83:49] A: And when it got brought up, notice how it didn't have the same intensity as it used to?
[83:54] B: No, it didn't.
[83:54] A: Right. Which is very interesting because we had already unplugged it.
[84:01] B: So the thing with my mother and dealing with her and cutting the cord with her. But then, yet I'm living in it.
[84:13] A: Mm.
[84:14] B: How do I work that to where it's like. How do I say, you know, I'm not.
[84:22] A: I don't think it's something you do.
[84:25] B: Can't I work that scenario with her? The same as we just did with.
[84:30] A: The flip it around. Why would I say I don't think that it's something you do? Because I don't think that you decide to get triggered by Mom. I don't think you say to yourself, when mom looks this way or says that thing, it's gonna make me feel like this. Instead, I think it's unconscious automatic programming. So I'll ask a different question. How do you know when they get triggered by Mom? And let's think of a particular time and context where and when it might happen. You might be aware in what might happen that all of a sudden you're feeling that. Mm.
[85:31] B: An example.
[85:32] A: Yeah. Even like you know what you're saying to yourself. So you Might. Beware. And what might happen that normally triggers that.
[85:46] B: Okay. In the kitchen.
[85:50] A: She might be in the kitchen and she asked me for money and she might say, what?
[85:59] B: Jas, I need that money for the insurance.
[86:02] A: Yeah. So I need that money for the insurance. Right. And she says that. Right. Where do you feel it? Like, in your body, where do you feel it?
[86:16] B: My gut or heart?
[86:17] A: You kind of notice it now.
[86:18] B: Yeah.
[86:19] A: Right?
[86:20] B: Ish.
[86:20] A: Ish, yeah. Oh, you mean it's already a little less?
[86:25] B: It is.
[86:26] A: It is. Huh. So how do you actually want to be when she says that?
[86:40] B: I don't know, because I don't even.
[86:41] A: Want to be around her. But you can't not be around her right now.
[86:45] B: Yeah.
[86:47] A: So how do you actually want to be?
[86:48] B: I'd like to just, like, have it, like, roll off the shoulders. Not even address it.
[86:55] A: What's it like when things just roll off your shoulders?
[86:59] B: It's like whenever.
[87:00] A: It's like, whatever. Right. It's like whatever. Right.
[87:03] B: Discard. Don't even consider it.
[87:05] A: Yeah. So it just goes by.
[87:06] B: Yeah.
[87:07] A: Right. So think of Mom. Right. You might be in the kitchen.
[87:11] B: Oh, God.
[87:12] A: Did you hear that?
[87:13] B: That was a good one.
[87:15] A: She might be in the kitchen and mom might be like, hey, I really need the money for the car insurance. Right. Notice the discomfort in your body.
[87:26] B: Yeah.
[87:27] A: As she's saying it. Where do you feel it?
[87:29] B: In my chest.
[87:30] A: So just notice the sensations in your chest right now without having to do anything with them or about them. Just get curious about how they're changing. Because those feelings, the sensations are like a wave. They can't stay the same. So just get curious about how they're changing. Hmm. I'm wondering how the sensations in my chest are changing. And as you're curious about how those sensations are changing, what do you notice happening to them? Even if they're not changing in the way you want them to yet, what do you notice?
[88:10] B: They're getting tighter and, like, tingly. Ish.
[88:12] A: They're getting tighter.
[88:14] B: More pinpointed.
[88:16] A: They're getting more pinpointed. They're becoming more tingly. Right. So just, again, continue to notice them. Get curious that it's become a little more pinpointed and tingly and even make the sound of curiosity. They go, h, h, yeah. I'm wondering how come they're becoming a little more pinpointed and tingly? And what do you notice happening to them?
[88:45] B: I don't know. They're kind of released.
[88:47] A: Oh, they kind of released because it's kind of like. Isn't that interesting?
[88:50] B: It's funny that I'm even. That's funny. It's funny. My body, I take it like my body and I know that I shouldn't even be feeling that way or it's kind of like, you know, like that's happening.
[89:03] A: But yeah, so I'll explain it in this way. When we get triggered, it sends us down the dorsal branch of the vagus nerve. When we're in the dorsal branch of the vagus nerve, that's where all the negative self talk is. They shouldn't be that way. How come it's like that? It shouldn't be like this. Right. All of it is determined by my physiology. And when I'm triggered into a shitty state, the thing that I don't ever do is I'm never consciously aware of the feelings changing. We know that they do because you're not always in the shitty state, but you're never conscious of it changing. So we're interrupting the automatic program.
[89:51] B: Okay.
[89:52] A: So it stops running you. So again, think about mom and they might be in the kitchen and she might say, you know, it's getting to the, you know, middle of the month. I really need to pay for that. I need that money for the car insurance. Right. And feel the discomfort. Where do you feel it?
[90:16] B: I mean, if there is any answer, right here. But I'm trying to block.
[90:19] A: Well, no, no, just feel it. Don't. Don't push it off. Oh, see, that's not what we're doing. Because what most people try to do is they try to avoid it or not feel it.
[90:27] B: I was trying to cancel it out with something else.
[90:29] A: No, and they. Or they try to. Right. All you want to do is just notice it. Notice the sensations.
[90:34] B: Well, it's kind of hurting. We've been at it for a minute. It's on my freaking heart. So notice that's my heart chakra for you.
[90:41] A: Get.
[90:43] B: Right.
[90:43] A: No, get curious about how the sensations are changing because they can't stay the same. And what keeps them ongoing is that the thing gets frozen and then it just takes us and we're off to the races. If you can notice the sensations and you can notice how they're changing, you're going to notice them changing even if they're not changing in the way you want them to yet. What do you notice about the sensations and how they're changing now? Oh, you don't know whether they're changing.
[91:18] B: I mean, them are smoothed out.
[91:21] A: Oh, now they're a little more smoothed out and get curious about how they're a Little more smoothed out. And really how they're changing. Go. I'm wondering how they're changing. That's right. And what do you notice about those sensations now?
[91:50] B: That I'm more at peace with them.
[91:52] A: Yeah. And it's not the situation that we're thinking about. It's just the sensations.
[91:57] B: That's it.
[91:58] A: So we're changing the relationship to the sensations. So again, think of mom. Maybe she's with that guy. And, you know, they haven't had any money. You know, they haven't gotten their money from Social Security and disability and a lawsuit. They're like, we. We really need the money for the car. You got to give it to us. I know. We were going to pay. We don't have the money to pay. You got to pay. Give it to us to pay. Hurry now. I mean, I'm letting you stay here. Give me the money. Right. Feel the discomfort.
[92:35] B: I don't feel it anymore.
[92:36] A: You're not feeling it?
[92:37] B: I really am not. I'm not. I mean, I didn't feel it. I don't feel it.
[92:41] A: Right, right. So you're asking, you know, how do I do the thing that. Right. Because how do you actually want to be? Like, whatever.
[92:53] B: Just whatever.
[92:54] A: Right, right. And if I need to pay for my insurance. Right.
[93:04] B: Well, then where's the proof of that?
[93:08] A: Right. But it's your car that you're driving. It is my car that you're driving.
[93:14] B: Yeah.
[93:15] A: Right, right. So what you had been thinking is that, oh, well, because they took this money and she said she was going to give it back, and how she was going to give it back was in these ways.
[93:30] B: Yeah.
[93:31] A: Right. It still needs to get paid.
[93:34] B: I know. Oh, but here's the thing. They won't. I don't even know how much it is. They won't tell me. And I've asked him.
[93:44] A: Well, how would you go about finding it, finding that out? I mean, how did you go about finding out, you know, what you would owe if you were a resident?
[93:52] B: I'm gonna call them. That's what I'm gonna do. Tomorrow, the next day. I've decided, because they keep at it, and I don't think it's the amount that they say. So I'm gonna call on myself and just find out how much it is. And they won't even show me a copy. So I know they're just trying to throw more money out of me.
[94:08] A: And we don't know whether it's been paid for every six months or month.
[94:11] B: That's right. Considering it was Just done two, three or three months ago, so. Right.
[94:16] A: Cuz some insurance you pay every six months.
[94:17] B: That's it. Yeah. So I'll find out.
[94:23] A: Right?
[94:24] B: Yeah.
[94:26] A: Right. Cuz you still want to have insurance if you're driving the car.
[94:29] B: Oh, yeah.
[94:30] A: Right.
[94:31] B: And I mean, they've already lied to me about having full coverage on it, which is just liability because I double checked. And my insurance card, which I thought it was one thing this whole time, but I look on the insurance card and it's like the basic. Like the lowest liability you can have.
[94:52] A: Sure.
[94:52] B: So I'm like, all right, well, I guess I'll just find out soon.
[94:55] A: Right?
[94:56] B: Get it taken care of.
[94:58] A: So think about them.
[95:00] B: Okay.
[95:03] A: Right. And there might be that time that mom's been drinking.
[95:06] B: Oh, gosh. Okay.
[95:07] A: Right. And she might be like, you know what? I never had intentions of paying you back at all. I just figured I could get tits. I mean, they look good, don't they?
[95:22] B: That's an emergency.
[95:23] A: Right. I mean, he wanted me to get dead. Right. Feel the discomfort.
[95:35] B: Grossed out more.
[95:36] A: Right. Where do you feel it in your body?
[95:38] B: In my brain.
[95:40] A: Mm.
[95:42] B: In my brain. I can't think about this, like, really. I don't know. I'm not just comfort. I'm more pissed off.
[95:53] A: Oh, good.
[95:53] B: Like, thinking about it like that, it's just like, ew.
[95:57] A: Notice how you're pissed off.
[95:59] B: Yeah.
[95:59] A: So grab a hold of that feeling and let the feeling. Right. Let the feeling tone guide you back. Let that feeling take you earlier and younger. Let it guide you back. Follow the feeling back towards one of the first time that you had that kind of a feeling.
[96:19] B: How my mom didn't care about us or take the time for us travel.
[96:24] A: Back to a particular moment that comes to mind. Okay. You got one?
[96:31] B: Yeah.
[96:31] A: You might have been how old?
[96:36] B: I don't know.
[96:37] A: I'll make it up. Younger than 10. Older than 10.
[96:40] B: Younger than 10.
[96:42] A: So you might have been.
[96:43] B: It was 6 to 8.
[96:44] A: Yeah. And let's think of a specific time. Got it.
[96:48] B: Yeah.
[96:48] A: And you want to be here.
[96:50] B: Oh, okay.
[96:51] A: Right. You want to be here.
[96:53] B: Yeah.
[96:53] A: As you tell me about what happened then.
[96:56] B: Okay.
[96:57] A: Right. Do you know why you want to be here?
[97:01] B: Because I don't want to be there?
[97:02] A: No. Because this is what's happening and that isn't okay.
[97:06] B: Yeah.
[97:06] A: Right. You're not troubled because of how shitty that was.
[97:09] B: No.
[97:10] A: You're troubled because your brain doesn't know the shitty moment ended. It also doesn't know a big piece of information which you logically know but don't emotionally feel mom being that way wasn't about your lovability or heck, even her love for you had everything to do with mom and whatever was going on with mom and mom not being well. Well, but you know, at 6, 7, 8, you didn't know in the same way you know now, not then, you couldn't have. So let's go through the moment while you're here. Cuz I'm more fun. Notice how you're going there. Yeah, I want you to be here. Right. Cuz we have some news to educate the younger you. Cuz the younger you was thinking she needed certain things that she wasn't getting in order to be okay. We're gonna let her know that she didn't actually need the things that she thought she needed in order to be okay. Right. But we're not there yet because we got to go through the moment and unplug it. Got it. So what moment happened? You might have been where and what happened? So you would have been at the house. Good. Would it have been daytime or nighttime?
[98:20] B: Nighttime.
[98:21] A: Nighttime. And you would have been wearing the.
[98:22] B: House in the kitchen, looking towards the living room.
[98:26] A: Yes. You're in the kitchen, you're looking towards the living room. Right.
[98:28] B: Good.
[98:28] A: And then what happened next?
[98:31] B: I'm looking at my mom and how she doesn't even want to be with us.
[98:34] A: So you're looking at mom and she's doing what?
[98:36] B: She's on the couch drunk.
[98:38] A: So she's on the couch drunk. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[98:41] B: She doesn't want to spend any time?
[98:42] A: Well, no, she's on the couch drunk. And then what happened next? You like said mom, I want to do something and she just sat there.
[98:49] B: Yeah. Or something. There were so many times we got.
[98:52] A: To think of one time. I know, let's just pull out one.
[98:55] B: I want to go to the mall.
[98:56] A: I want to go to the mall. And she's like no, no. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[99:04] B: I said I don't know, I went up to my room.
[99:06] A: Right. Notice. Right. Mind stop story at shitty spot. Right. And then you might have gone to your room and then that moment ended. And then later on you did something more fun like hang out with your dog or go to the beach.
[99:17] B: Yeah, right.
[99:18] A: Or be in the woods, Get a job to save a lot. Yeah, right. So you're getting a job to save a lot. We got being in the woods. We got going to the beach. We had hanging out with your doggy. And then you were up in your room and then before that, she's like, no. And then you're like, hey, I really want to go to the mall. And then you were seeing her sitting on the couch drunk, and then you'd gone in the kitchen. Then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing as we go backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was.
[99:44] B: Was much better.
[99:44] A: You can remember her doing that?
[99:46] B: Yeah.
[99:47] A: Right? You can remember putting your skirt on. Stop putting on your skirts. Say, I'm not putting on my shirt. Stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then stop mom from sitting on the couch drunk. Say she's not sitting on the couch. Well, stop it from happening. Say it's not happening.
[100:03] B: It's not happening.
[100:04] A: Yeah. So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists.
[100:08] B: It no longer exists.
[100:09] A: Right. That earlier you felt mom being that way had something to do with her lack of love for you or your lack of loveability. Did it have anything to do with you?
[100:19] B: No.
[100:20] A: No. It had to do with what mom and mom not being well. But again, at that age, you didn't know that mom wasn't well at that age. That younger, you felt like if I was more loved or she cared more or I mattered, she would do more. Got it. That earlier you felt like mom being that way. It's something to do with me, right? But as we're looking at it clearly, did it have anything to do with you?
[100:51] B: Not at all.
[100:52] A: No. So I want you to repeat these four words. Here we go. Ready? It's. It's not. Not about. About me.
[100:58] B: Me.
[100:58] A: Right? It's not. It's not about me.
[101:00] B: About me.
[101:01] A: Right? One more time.
[101:02] B: It's not about me.
[101:03] A: Right? Now close your eyes. Picture the younger you. Let her know that it's over, finished, no longer exists. Right? Let her know that mom being that way had nothing to do with you or your lack of lovability or her lack of love. Had everything to do with mom not being well. Right? That you didn't know that let the you know that you didn't need mom to be well in order for you to turn out okay. Play with your dog. Go to the beach. Right? Heck, even get a job at Save a Lot. Let her know so that she gets it that you're okay. Right? As the earlier you triad is getting it, what do you notice happening to her face?
[101:46] B: She's just like, okay.
[101:47] A: Yeah, she is okay. And you can open your eyes, right? Right. Because as you're checking in and thinking about that now, what are you noticing?
[102:08] B: I felt Forgiveness, mainly of self. For holding on to things that.
[102:18] A: Well. See, I don't think you have been.
[102:20] B: What?
[102:21] A: Holding on to things. I think these things have been having a hold of you. Not because your brain wanted you to feel like shit about stuff, but because complicated machines are prone to error. And that you didn't know that mom being that way was about mom not being well. And you didn't need mom to be well in order for you to turn out okay.
[102:43] B: No.
[102:44] A: Right. And see, that's getting into the earlier you who really felt that she needed her mom and she needed her mom to be well in order for you to be okay. Because when we're the littlest of kids, like 023, we need our parents to feed us, bathe us, change us, take his places. But as we get older, don't we become more independent and we don't need them in the same way we used to. Actually, we don't need them at all. That's right. So where that earlier you was feeling. Feeling like it had something to do with you, as we look at it, clearly we know that it had nothing to do with you. Right. And everything to do with what was off with Mom. Right? Right. So think about Mom. And she might be drinking. It might have been one of those days. Maybe she's getting a little argument with her guy or whatever and she's like, you know, we just knew that you couldn't stop us. So we were getting all that money because we wanted to spend it. No, I just want to have a good time. I really still don't have any intentions of paying it back. I mean, I am letting you stay here though. But I'm not paying you back. I use that money for the tatas. And you little wicked slut who just opened her legs for money. So again, think of her saying that. Feel the anger.
[104:29] B: I feel more than like, what is wrong with you? How can you think like that, be like that and do that to someone and feel like that's acceptable or okay, and you're really sick and I feel sad for you. I feel. I feel so.
[104:45] A: So thank you for saying that. Thank you for having one of those moments we're having to sit down and we're talking, right? And you know, you know, that was blood money.
[104:59] B: I mean, practically, you know, it really.
[105:03] A: Was just like a prostitute fucking all these guys for money. Right? So here's what we're doing. I want you to think of mom saying that and having her look at you in that, like, disdained way, like, you little awful, gross Thing that all you did was spread your legs for money. That's why you used that money. You didn't deserve it in the first place. Fucking your way around to get money from men. That's gross. The different men, the different things. Heckin all the different playthings that those men wanted you to do. Some of those guys are really nice playing.
[105:47] B: How could you handle that all the time.
[105:52] A: Right? Strap ons and all sorts of shit, you know?
[105:57] B: Can I dress up in girls clothes?
[105:59] A: Clothes.
[105:59] B: And you take pictures of me? Yeah. All right.
[106:06] A: Right.
[106:06] B: Is that a serious thing?
[106:09] A: You know, some people have a transistic fetish.
[106:12] B: I don't know.
[106:13] A: They do.
[106:14] B: I didn't do it. Yeah, somebody asked.
[106:15] A: It's true. Some people have transvestite fetish. I worked with a guy who used to wear his wife's hose and leggings and dress up as her and pretend to be like one of her girls. Girlfriends.
[106:25] B: Oh yeah. That's what he wanted. He wanted to feel like one of the girls.
[106:30] A: Yeah.
[106:30] B: I was like, okay, you do you buddy.
[106:36] A: I don't know if I so think of mom being like looking at you with that disgust.
[106:39] B: All right.
[106:43] A: So yeah, I took that money. Wait. Feel the anger. Feel the hurt. Feel the sadness. Where do you feel it?
[106:59] B: I don't know. It's just kind of all like, is.
[107:00] A: This how you want to be feeling? No, no. How do you want to be? Like whatever.
[107:05] B: Yeah, right.
[107:06] A: So get a hold of the feeling again and let the feeling take you back. Let that feeling, Jacqueline, grow you younger and earlier. Let it take you back to another moment which may or may not have to do with mom. Follow the feeling tone. You know that person that's like your mom looking at you like that. Right. What does it take you towards? What moments coming to mind?
[107:43] B: Well, now there's two separate things.
[107:44] A: Oh, good. There are.
[107:46] B: Take me back to the moment or the same feeling of what I got from that. Because I link that.
[107:55] A: Oh, what's the moment? We'll do one at a time. What comes to mind first.
[108:04] B: Was my descendants that I got got from my mom and she's looking at me like that was the thought that came to me was how I didn't feel accepted and that like I wasn't good enough.
[108:23] A: Where does that take you to that feeling of not feeling accepted or that you were good enough?
[108:30] B: Maybe when I was a kid.
[108:32] A: What's the moment that comes to mind?
[108:34] B: Her calling us stupa.
[108:35] A: Oh, good, you're aware. And what happened? How old might you have been?
[108:39] B: I don't know.
[108:39] A: It's like, think of the time. So you might have been 10, you might have been where? I don't know that we can make it up.
[108:47] B: Okay. See, the cool part is on the patio.
[108:50] A: All we're going to do is do.
[108:51] B: Things that are more than once.
[108:53] A: All right? That's why we just need it structurally similar.
[108:56] B: Okay.
[108:57] A: Okay. So you might have been outside on the patio, like out back.
[109:01] B: Yeah.
[109:01] A: Yeah. And you might have been doing what?
[109:05] B: Getting ready to go swimming then.
[109:06] A: Getting ready to go swimming. Right. And then what might have happened next?
[109:13] B: My mom said that it was stupid. She wanted to go swimming.
[109:18] A: She's like, that's stupid that you want to go swimming. It's too early to go swimming. You only go swimming between this time and this time. Right. Then what might.
[109:27] B: It's too early in the season.
[109:28] A: Too early. Right. Because you're gonna only go.
[109:31] B: Yeah.
[109:31] A: Right. So she might have said that. Right. Then what might have happened? You guys are stupid.
[109:39] B: She just walked inside.
[109:40] A: Then she walked inside. Right.
[109:41] B: And slammed the door.
[109:42] A: And slammed the door. Right. Good. And then what might happen next?
[109:45] B: Me and my brother went swimming.
[109:46] A: Right? That's right. I. And then. Yeah. Out of the pool.
[109:51] B: Right, right.
[109:52] A: And then later on.
[109:54] B: C. A sec. Thank God for towels.
[109:56] A: Later on, you did something more fun.
[109:58] B: Yeah.
[109:58] A: Right. Like go to the beach or to play with your dog. Yeah. Or heck, he even got a job at Save a Lot.
[110:04] B: Oh, yeah, Right.
[110:05] A: So we got getting the job at Sable out. We got, you know, being in the woods. We got plenty of dog. We got going to the beach. And then you guys were out of the pool trying off. And then you were playing in the pool, and then you'd gone in the pool. And then she's like, you guys are stupid. It's too early. Shouldn't go in the pool. And then you were getting ready to go swimming. Then before that, you were inside. Then before that, you probably woke up. As it goes backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it?
[110:36] B: It's almost just like you're watching a movie.
[110:38] A: It is almost like you're just watching a movie in reverse.
[110:41] B: Yeah.
[110:41] A: You can remember her saying that, right? You can remember putting on your bracelet.
[110:46] B: Yeah.
[110:46] A: And stop putting on your bracelet. We'll stop her from saying that. She's not saying that. Say that. She's not saying that. She's not saying no, stop her from saying that. Say she's not saying that. So then where does that moment say no longer exists again? Were we learning anything about you or your brother?
[111:06] B: No.
[111:06] A: Or were we learning about her?
[111:08] B: Her Behavior.
[111:09] A: Yeah. You know, my daughter, who's 11, will go swimming in the pool even if it's cold.
[111:15] B: Yeah.
[111:16] A: I'm not, because I'm an adult. I've already got all my swim stuffing.
[111:24] B: Eager swim plunges in.
[111:26] A: Yeah. Like, I'll go in the pool, but I won't go when it's cold. Yeah, it's cold.
[111:31] B: Right.
[111:32] A: But she didn't care. She's a kid.
[111:33] B: Of course.
[111:34] A: Right. And in particular, if she got somebody else to play with, she's definitely in the pool. Oh, yeah, Right. It doesn't matter how cold it is.
[111:40] B: Yeah.
[111:41] A: Right. So again, that happened. That have anything to do with you or did it have to do with Mom? Right. You didn't know that then?
[111:48] B: No.
[111:48] A: Right. You also didn't know that mom wasn't well.
[111:51] B: Right.
[111:51] A: Right.
[111:52] B: And now I do.
[111:53] A: So again, close your eyes.
[111:54] B: So I have more data. So my system's updated.
[111:57] A: It's updating now. Once we get that in to the earlier you close your eyes, think of the earlier you and let her know that's over, finished, no longer exists. And Mom's saying, that was not about me. It was about Mom. Mom's opinion, Mom's thoughts, Mom's stuff. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Let her know that you're okay. Right. Let her know about going to the beach. We're gonna save a lot better know. Right. So that she gets it. And as she's getting it, what do you notice now what happens to the earlier you?
[112:34] B: She's excited.
[112:35] A: She is excited.
[112:37] B: She's excited. She's about to go travel the world and go have some fun and meet some cool people, do some cool stuff.
[112:42] A: Yeah.
[112:42] B: She's excited.
[112:43] A: She is.
[112:44] B: Yeah.
[112:45] A: Right. So again, think about mom, okay?
[112:49] B: Closed or open, doesn't matter. All right?
[112:53] A: And think about one of those things that mom typically might do or say, all right, you never really need that money. I am so disappointed in you. You're a. Oh, my God.
[113:08] B: She wishes.
[113:11] A: I can't believe you would spread your legs for money. I didn't raise you to be like that.
[113:19] B: I don't know if that's necessarily true. I'm sorry, but when you're with men.
[113:34] A: Actually, mom, it's been a whole family line, right? From great grandma to grandma to you to me.
[113:39] B: She did pretty good on her security, didn't she? My grandma. That was a horrible.
[113:45] A: But check it out. Think of mom saying this stuff because what you wanted to know how to do is, how do I get it so that I'm not troubled when mom does those things that mom does.
[113:53] B: Yes.
[113:54] A: Right. All right, now my boyfriend's got 50 bucks. Would you blow him?
[114:05] B: What the. Where the hell? That was so wrong. That really literally made me gross out. I was like, oh, my God.
[114:13] A: Right. But we're trying to get you to be activated by anything that mom could say.
[114:17] B: Okay.
[114:19] A: That normally would piss you off. Cuz you go. I go there. Even if I'm in.
[114:26] B: She has called me a slut, actually.
[114:27] A: Well, there you go.
[114:28] B: Let's go there.
[114:29] A: Yeah. So think about mom calling you a slutty slut. Not even just a slut. Like a slutty slut.
[114:36] B: Oh, like a dirty one?
[114:38] A: Like, yeah. Ew. I mean, how many guys did you do in one night? Slutty slut.
[114:48] B: It's sad when you kind of enjoy that for a second.
[114:54] A: It depends on the context.
[114:55] B: Yeah, true. Oh, I know.
[114:56] A: Okay. See, not enjoyable if mom saying it. No, it's enjoyable in sex play.
[115:03] B: Yeah.
[115:03] A: If that's something that's part of the play that you enjoy.
[115:09] B: All right, so let's go back to her abusive.
[115:11] A: Let's think of mom and some of the things that mom might say that normally really pisses you off.
[115:18] B: All right, you said them. I don't really want to hear them anymore. All right.
[115:26] A: When she says it, how do you actually want to be?
[115:32] B: Just like, whatever.
[115:33] A: Like, whatever. So think of her saying one of those things. Spread your legs and open your mouth. That's why I spent that money. Deserve it didn't hurt it. All right. Notice how it's making you upset. Where are you feeling it in your body? Where are you feeling it in your body?
[116:07] B: I don't know.
[116:08] A: Well, check, cuz. Is this how you want to be?
[116:14] B: I don't know.
[116:15] A: It's like here, it's there. Right? So just notice the sensations there. Again, get curious about how they're changing. Right. As you're curious about how they're changing, make your eyes really big, right? For about 10 seconds and then go, hmm, Right. And what do you notice happening? That's right. What do you notice happening to them?
[116:44] B: It's coming or it like kind of like dissipates them or like alleviates dissipating them.
[116:49] A: Right. And as you're noticing that they're dissipating. Right. Get curious about how it's happening. Get curious about how you're noticing it happening. Dissipating. Right. And what do you notice?
[117:12] B: It's just kind of alleviates.
[117:13] A: It is just kind of alleviating. It's like More.
[117:16] B: Yeah, it kind of went like a.
[117:17] A: It did. Oh, it went like a. Yeah. Right. So again, think about the same scenario.
[117:23] B: Okay.
[117:24] A: Where, you know, mom's calling you one of those names. Right. So that you can hear her saying it.
[117:32] B: Yeah.
[117:32] A: You know how she looks when she says it? No, she sounds when she says in particular, she's had a little bit of drinking right now. It's biting. It's like, yeah, fucking whore. Didn't raise my daughter to be a slut. Fucking men for money. Right. Got the feeling. You're doing great, Jacqueline. Where are you feeling it?
[118:06] B: My stomach. Yeah.
[118:07] A: Just notice. Get curious. Make your eyes real big, hold it for like 10 seconds and then go, hmm. Right. What do you notice as they. Right. Because how do you actually want to be.
[118:29] B: I just want to let it go.
[118:30] A: Yeah. Because who are we learning about her? Yeah. Are we learning anything about you?
[118:35] B: No.
[118:36] A: No, we're not learning about you. That's right. Because are you. What you did?
[118:43] B: No.
[118:43] A: No. That's right. And as you're realizing that you're not. What you did to the extent that you're getting it now. Right. You can change the feelings because it's all about changing the relationship to the feelings so that it's more like whatever.
[119:07] B: Right.
[119:07] A: Cuz who really cares?
[119:09] B: Exactly.
[119:10] A: Right. What a damaged woman thinks, and whether she actually thinks it or is saying it just because she knows it bugs you. Right. Do you know why one kid gets picked on more than another kid?
[119:30] B: Oh, because he lets it bother him.
[119:32] A: I don't think he lets it. I don't think he's choosing to let it bother me, but he definitely feels bothered by it more than the kid who's not feeling bothered by it.
[119:44] B: Yeah.
[119:44] A: He shows it and he shows it it. Right, Right. So canaries are beautiful birds that, in a sanctuary, will all get along flawlessly together, and they'll work like a family and they work like a team A. Until one gets sick or one gets injured. Then do you know what they do to it?
[120:03] B: No.
[120:04] A: Peck it to death.
[120:04] B: What? Really?
[120:07] A: It's the mob mentality. Right. The weakness gets eaten. Why the Democrats have to get rid of Joe Biden because he looked old and weak. Because he did and he is.
[120:28] B: Yeah.
[120:28] A: He didn't look old and weak. Right.
[120:32] B: Yeah. I can see how some people at TikTok.
[120:36] A: What? Yeah. We're okay with people lying. We're okay with all sorts of other shit that happens in politics, but don't be old and weak.
[120:48] B: Okay. Yeah.
[120:50] A: If you're gonna, you know, I mean, that's that's really what it is.
[120:53] B: Be the face of everything, right?
[120:58] A: So think about mom, you know, saying one of those things, you know, we need the money. Why don't you just go out and, you know, find a guy, you know, him for money.
[121:12] B: Do you know you just brought some. She actually literally said that. She's like, I don't know what you're gonna do or whatever. And I know you're trying to get out of here and you need to really try to move things along here, and we also need that money. And she's like, I don't care if you go out and. Or if you are doing whatever.
[121:29] A: Come on. It's the power of the pussy. Do it.
[121:32] B: That's literally what she said to me. Like, in a roundabout way.
[121:36] A: I mean, high class and high $1. Don't go, like, walk 41, but like.
[121:43] B: Yeah, what the hell?
[121:44] A: Go to the Ritz, be at the bar.
[121:45] B: She like, insinuated, because she was like, oh, well, you know, if, you know.
[121:49] A: Go to the Ritz, be at the bar.
[121:50] B: I don't care what you do. Whatever men you go hang out with or do.
[121:55] A: Yeah.
[121:55] B: And I was like, did she really? Did I just interpret that correctly?
[121:58] A: That's right. Like, seriously, you know, wait for whatever city has the super bowl and just go and meet strange men.
[122:04] B: Oh, my God.
[122:05] A: And that's sex for money.
[122:06] B: Okay, that sounds great.
[122:12] A: Right? So thank you for saying that. Yeah. What do you notice? That's a knee puffer.
[122:21] B: Yeah. I don't know what's up with that.
[122:22] A: Oh, it's a knee popper. That's right. What do you notice? You're gonna need to get out of here. And we need money. And, you know, that's a fast way for you to make money. 10 to be 4.
[122:35] B: The audacity. I feel so sorry for her. For the unloved, the new compassion.
[122:57] A: Well, she needs money. Like Maslow's hierarchy. I mean, there are women that have had clitorectomies. They're also sending their daughters for clitorectomy in different African nations because that's just what they do.
[123:18] B: What's a clitorectomy?
[123:20] A: They cut off the clitoris because you don't need it. You don't need it to make a baby. You only need it for pleasure.
[123:28] B: What the heck?
[123:31] A: Literally, there are African nations, but that's what they do. They cut off the clitoris because it's not about women's pleasure.
[123:38] B: Well, it kind of is.
[123:39] A: It is not there.
[123:40] B: It's a lot about that.
[123:42] A: That's the main reason, it probably should be about women's pleasure. I mean. Yes, but it's not. So that's why they cut it off.
[123:55] B: You know, it's a shame. Why wouldn't they just allow them to have that, too? Like, okay, you might be about having the babies or whatever the case may be, but at least have some. Oh, there you go.
[124:08] A: If I suppress you and I'm more powerful and it's not about. Then you are subservient to me. We go back to the Bible. Whose fault was it that Adam ate the apple?
[124:20] B: The woman.
[124:21] A: Yeah, of course. It's not Adam's fault. He's weak. You know, she brought the apple. I can't eat the apple. God said not to eat the apple. Adam, you need to eat the apple. I'm not gonna eat the apple. Then he says, adam, do you like these apples? Yo, I really like those apples. Eat this apple. That's why men get away with all sorts of things. I mean, she wore that outfit, so, you know, I felt like I could, you know, you know, reach her. Reach right up there and grab stuff. I mean, we had a president that said that. Grab her right there. I mean, come on.
[124:55] B: Like, what?
[124:56] A: We have all the messaging that's, like, all about locker room talk. Okay. Right? Yeah. You know, it's nice when the cute girl walks by me in the bar. I should just grab her ass because she won't know it's me. Cop a feel. Yeah, I got a little side boob.
[125:11] B: What the. Exactly.
[125:13] A: It's gross.
[125:14] B: It is.
[125:15] A: But that's what's out there. All right? So, I mean, you don't have to go, like, you know, walking 41, but go to, like, Ruth Chris or, you know, go to the Ritz at the bar and, you know, find some guy that, you know, is there alone. And, I mean, you don't have to tell him until you get up in the room, you know, that if he wants. I gotta. You gotta get some money for us. We need to pay that car insurance.
[125:39] B: And you gotta get out there. It's like, what are you.
[125:46] A: I'm trying to do everything I can to get you to be pissed, but.
[125:49] B: I don't to go there.
[125:51] A: I'm already pissed about to go there while we're here, okay? So that we do the things to get it so that when she does it, it doesn't bother you at all.
[126:01] B: All right. Sorry, C. Okay. All right. Okay.
[126:05] A: I mean, that's what you're accustomed to doing anyway. See, we're just trying to do everything we can to get that to activate.
[126:16] B: Okay, I'm there.
[126:17] A: Good. Where do you feel it in your body? Where do you feel it? Got the feeling tones. What does it take you towards? Like if you were to travel that feeling tone, what does it take you back towards? Does it guide you? Grew you. Younger, younger, younger, earlier. Follow the feeling tone.
[126:47] B: About how I was in my first relationship.
[126:50] A: There we go. That one was. You were about how old?
[126:56] B: 20.
[126:57] A: 20, yeah. And the guy was.
[127:05] B: Like super ultra rich. Oh, how old was he? 60.
[127:09] A: He certainly wasn't 20 if he was super ultra rich. That didn't happen very often. He was 60, right? Yeah. So, you know, only two, four decades older. That's close. Yeah. What comes to mind as you think about that because you were like 20.
[127:30] B: Yeah.
[127:30] A: You'd gotten away from mom.
[127:35] B: Yeah.
[127:36] A: And you're aware and that's why I.
[127:38] B: Went with him originally is because.
[127:42] A: Is this the Frederick guy?
[127:43] B: This is Frederick.
[127:44] A: Ah, see, we're back to Frederick. Knew we'd come back to Frederick. Yay.
[127:49] B: This is where you wanted to go?
[127:51] A: I didn't want to go anywhere, but I'm pretty sure we were going to go back to Frederick at some point.
[127:57] B: So he or I, I got divorced.
[128:06] A: Because you got married when you were how old?
[128:08] B: 19.
[128:09] A: 19 to a guy.
[128:11] B: Yeah. I was only married a year.
[128:12] A: And he was young too.
[128:14] B: Age 25.
[128:15] A: Yeah. So he didn't really have a lot of money.
[128:17] B: No, no. And we got pregnant and I had a little girl, but I didn't, I didn't want to have the child. I wanted to go to school first.
[128:25] A: Yes.
[128:26] B: He pressured me to have her, then I had her. Then I guess I ended up finding out later that I had that postpartum depression because I didn't know what the heck at the time was going on.
[128:34] A: So you end up keeping the baby.
[128:35] B: Yeah.
[128:35] A: Having a little girl.
[128:37] B: Yep. Did that for a year. And then he wanted me to be a stay at home wife.
[128:40] A: Right.
[128:41] B: And mother. And I didn't want to do that. I wanted to go to school.
[128:43] A: Right. Good job.
[128:45] B: He didn't want me to do that.
[128:47] A: Right.
[128:47] B: And so I was like, okay, well, I'm not going to be with somebody that wants to suppress me or keep me down, you know.
[128:53] A: That's right.
[128:53] B: Control me. So I left him. Divorced. And then she, you know, he fought me over her.
[128:59] A: Right. Over custody.
[129:00] B: Yeah. Because I got a d. I got two DUIs when I was younger.
[129:04] A: Yes.
[129:04] B: And so he used that against me in court and he actually got more of the custody.
[129:11] A: Okay.
[129:11] B: We've like Shared parenting. But he, like, she stays with him the majority of the time.
[129:15] A: Yeah.
[129:16] B: So then I left and I moved to my mother's.
[129:18] A: Right.
[129:19] B: And obviously with my mother's behavior, then I don't know who this random person was in my life that told me about dating older men.
[129:33] A: Yeah. And Jine, have you ever considered dating older men?
[129:39] B: Yeah. No. But it was a little more detailed on that. And he just like, kind of told me how to be and act and toward like, kind of like, I get. I don't know what he was doing, but grooming maybe.
[129:54] A: Well, you didn't know that then. No, but I mean, if he's teaching you how to be an act.
[130:00] B: I guess so.
[130:01] A: And like, that's a little bit of grooming.
[130:03] B: Just, I mean, and got me on this site.
[130:06] A: Right. Got you on a site that older men could. Yeah, like a hookup site. Ish.
[130:12] B: Yeah. And then like, he would. He told me, like, he would. He would tell me what to write them.
[130:19] A: Right. You didn't realize he was your first pimp?
[130:21] B: I don't know.
[130:22] A: No. You haven't realized it yet?
[130:24] B: I'm assuming so. No, I've kind of categorized him as that.
[130:27] A: I'm just like, well, like, how? Well, check it out. He's grooming you.
[130:31] B: But who? I. He was just in my life for a short period of time and he was like a random friend that I met.
[130:36] A: He's grooming you. He's telling you how to act. He's getting you on these sites.
[130:41] B: I thought he was just trying to help me out, cuz I was trying to get out of my mother's house.
[130:43] A: Uhhuh. Yeah, well, he was trying to help you out. You know, he's got a good finder's fee and teaches you how to do it. Get you on a site and get you hooked up with somebody.
[130:55] B: So that's how I met Frederick.
[130:59] A: Yeah. And Frederick was more like, you know, I mean, when you first met him was more like a gfe. Girlfriend experience, you know?
[131:14] B: What does that mean?
[131:15] A: Even we're like, you're like, dated.
[131:17] B: Yeah, but not really for sure.
[131:19] A: But it wasn't really dating. But it was kind of like dating. But it wasn't really dating because it's a girlfriend experience.
[131:26] B: You mean, like, there's extra pros to it, right?
[131:30] A: It's not on my terms. It's transactional.
[131:36] B: Oh, yeah. There's that component.
[131:37] A: That's what I mean by a girlfriend experience is a transactional relationship where I'll go out with him, you know, and I'll be nice and we'll flirt and we'll have a good time, and I might have a nice meal, I might have a nice glass of wine. But it's definitely. I'm getting compensated for it. And it's going to lead to other stuff.
[131:55] B: Yeah.
[131:56] A: That they want me to do. And it may not lead immediately to intercourse or may not lead to, you know, kink shit right away. Or may not lead to. But it's on its way and I'm getting compensated because it's transactional. So I'm not just getting taken out for a nice dinner.
[132:17] B: Oh, yeah. It's kind of how it goes.
[132:23] A: Well, but that's what I call a gfe.
[132:25] B: Oh, okay. But like, Frederick's was. I mean, it was different. But the way that it started was, though, it seems like, I'll take care of you.
[132:36] A: That's right.
[132:37] B: And I looked at dealing and living with my mother.
[132:41] A: Right.
[132:42] B: Or going with this guy, and that's like, super ultra rich for a little bit. And I'm gonna get a monthly allowance.
[132:50] A: Right.
[132:51] B: Which I don't know how I got into that. I don't know if, like, I worked.
[132:54] A: That deal and all I have to do is certain little things with him.
[132:59] B: Well, that kind of stuff unfolded. I didn't even know. Like, some of that work just, like, came about. Like, I don't even know how we ended up in that type of relationship. It was kind of like I felt like I was trying to rescue myself out of what I was in.
[133:14] A: Right.
[133:14] B: And, like, jump into that. And I didn't know how long. I definitely didn't think it was gonna be freaking 10 years, you know, seven solid 10 off and or on, you know.
[133:23] A: Right.
[133:23] B: Like, I didn't know that because I did like the guy. But then I was, you know, along the way, I guess, like, convincing myself.
[133:32] A: You like what he was providing.
[133:35] B: Oh. I mean, when I definitely saw what he like. Yeah.
[133:39] A: So when you say you like the guy. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't violent with you.
[133:45] B: Yeah. He was funny. And I. I could see what he looked like when he was younger. Oh, my gosh. And I need.
[133:58] A: Right. Which you had to do in order to be more okay being with somebody four decades older.
[134:09] B: Yeah.
[134:10] A: And I'll take care of you.
[134:12] B: Yeah.
[134:13] A: Right. But as I take care of you, then it's quid pro quo.
[134:21] B: Yeah.
[134:22] A: You're also going to do things to take care of me or others.
[134:25] B: Yeah.
[134:28] A: Because I might be a cuck and I might like watching.
[134:32] B: Well. And there's always a give And a take in relationships. Right. You're like, why not? But yeah. No, there's extra stuff that I definitely ended up doing that I wasn't okay with or I didn't really like.
[134:44] A: Right.
[134:45] B: But so that's how.
[134:46] A: So what's one of those things that you did that you didn't want to do?
[134:49] B: Really? Really? We're gonna go there. We're gonna go there.
[134:55] A: Because that's the part. Oh.
[134:58] B: Because that's the link. What we were talking about. Because I was with that guy. Well, Jesus. I was hoping you would make us around to that. I thought we were getting sidetracked here.
[135:09] A: Okay.
[135:10] B: So it's up the ass. I really didn't appreciate getting it up there.
[135:13] A: Right.
[135:13] B: All the time.
[135:14] A: No, but that's what he wanted to do.
[135:15] B: Oh my God. It was ridiculous.
[135:17] A: Right.
[135:18] B: I felt like a freaking animal.
[135:21] A: Right. So you can remember that happening and him doing that?
[135:28] B: I can remember talking myself and like, praying myself through this.
[135:32] A: And let's have lots of lube.
[135:36] B: Oh, Jesus Christ.
[135:38] A: Well, when you're doing lube.
[135:41] B: Yeah. And as much as you're doing it, you just kind of. I kind of got into it.
[135:46] A: Enemas and upright. Well, yeah.
[135:48] B: Because you have to.
[135:49] A: How can you not Exactly. Right.
[135:51] B: And something. It doesn't feel good. It's just not that it doesn't want to do it if I just wasn't me.
[135:57] A: No, not particularly.
[135:58] B: That was part of it.
[135:59] A: Did.
[135:59] B: But thought I guess when I was feeling bad or like I was a bad girl or something kind of thing in there.
[136:04] A: Right.
[136:05] B: Which I've used it later on in my life. Which is kind of a nice little thing to have in the real house. Yeah.
[136:14] A: I didn't know that. You didn't know that I knew.
[136:17] B: But I know. You know.
[136:20] A: Right, Right, right. But that you back then was desperate. Right.
[136:29] B: I was in survival mode.
[136:32] A: Right.
[136:32] B: I was walking myself through, trying to get through where I wanted to be. And now I feel like I've done a full circle. I'm there now. Ish. Feel more sound body. But her saying those things to me.
[136:49] A: Yeah.
[136:50] B: Is like, why would you want me to go back there and. And what?
[136:57] A: Re.
[136:57] B: Re. Go through everything that I've. She doesn't strive to get through. Not a damn bit.
[137:03] A: She just wants the money.
[137:05] B: Yeah.
[137:06] A: It's not about what you're gonna have to do. Do. She doesn't care to know.
[137:13] B: But like. Oh, my God. I can't remember actually talking about. Like, that was like, really part of my life. Like, I. I like to not think like That I know.
[137:21] A: See, this is the part that we've got to get exposed so it loses its power.
[137:27] B: I don't know if it has any power. It's very.
[137:31] A: No, the power that it had is I did when I didn't want to, and then I learned to get into doing that I didn't want to.
[137:46] B: That's it. And that's where I don't want to go back. Because you can. I'm so tempted. No, I'm totally freaked out. I know. Because that's why we're having this conversation.
[137:56] A: Okay, let's keep going.
[138:00] B: I know. Well, you're wanting that to.
[138:01] A: Because that's where. That's where this is off, right? Because you go, I'm so worried. Say more. I am so worried.
[138:10] B: I'm so worried that I'll slip back in real quick or, like, have a little boyfriend, you know? That's kind of questionable, right? And here's the thing. If I'm being honest with you, I don't want. Well, I mean, you said earlier, too, like, it's normal you're gonna be with a guy that has more money or not. But I am, like, really, Like, I don't want to be with a guy that I don't even date. I don't even know if I date a guy if he doesn't give me, like, money right away or, like, doesn't spoil me right away with, like, quite a few things, like, right off the bat. I don't know. I don't think I feel right about it. Like, I don't feel like I feel secure or like. I don't know. I just don't. I don't. But what I'm afraid of, I'm not really afraid that I'll do anything for money, because I won't. But I don't want to be in a pinch. And I really do. Like, my little market job. I really do. It's cute and everything else. It doesn't pay anything. And the pressure that my mom's putting on me and the way that she's threatening me. I mean, she threatened to. Like he said the other day, this is what freaks me out about it, is that Randy said the other day, he's like, oh, we'll get her out of here. They already threw me in jail, so why. And he just. He was like, oh, I'll get her out of here. I'll get her out of here tomorrow. Like, what did that mean? So I'm, like, living in a hyper, like, survival mode. So then when they're, like, Saying all this stuff and they're trying to get money out of me, and then they're trying to force these things. And, you know, I mean, it's not like the thought didn't come up like, oh, well, you know, it wouldn't be hard. You know, and it's not. But.
[139:44] A: Because we're easy.
[139:46] B: Yeah, men are.
[139:48] A: But it's like you're not supposed to be, though.
[139:50] B: Exactly. And that's what I don't want to do.
[139:54] A: Women. So women who have successful relationships with men are women who hold the keys.
[140:00] B: Exactly. Trust me, I am. I'm not one. I'm waiting for my other. Okay. I'm not doing anything. Not even with some guy that I'm dating. That might have to be a possibility for. Forget that. Okay? I'm going old school. As much as I've done, you know, and had and for money and things like. Or whatever. Like, I'm okay. Like, I tested the waters. And here's the thing. This is what I think is wild, too, is that I'm in the same situation. I've gone full circle back around to where I started. And look at the things I did for money. Look where it got me. And then look what this little does. Destiny takes my money. Like it's her freaking money. Like she earned or was. I don't care how I earned that money. To try to get myself out of a situation or you're, you know, pivot myself, though. I don't know how Frederick came. That was. It was kind of a blessing, but I guess a curse. Cuz like you said, like, I got used to degrading myself or dealing with more than I should have. And so I. I started taking disrespect. And then look at the guy.
[141:03] A: Guy.
[141:04] B: That young guy that freaking stole money from me. I mean, what's up with that? People taking money. Large sums of money. Not even, you know, 100 bucks or something. Maybe a thousand, you know, but, like, what's the deal? The Chanel, the freaking product. Gone. You can't even find them online. Stupid stuff. But it's serious.
[141:27] A: Yeah.
[141:31] B: Like another meant.
[141:33] A: See what's happening now?
[141:34] B: I'm so just uncomfortable.
[141:38] A: Right.
[141:38] B: I feel like an idiot.
[141:41] A: You didn't know then. You know better now. All right, so the thing that we want to get cleared up is that one. When you met with Frederick.
[141:55] B: Yeah.
[141:55] A: And you first got together with him, you didn't know what that was going to lead to. You bending your own comfort level and what you were okay doing and doing what he wanted you to Do. Because it was transactional. Yeah. What we don't want and what you're concerned about is because I know what it was like to be in a transactional relationship. I don't want to fall back into a transactional relationship because of circumstance. Right.
[142:39] B: Because I'm trying to get away from my mother.
[142:42] A: Right.
[142:53] B: I don't want to do those things again. Like, I don't. I don't want to have to, like, experience that and acknowledge that. Like, I don't want to have to.
[143:03] A: But see, go through that again in the. Acknowledging what it was versus pretending that it wasn't. That that is the thing that keeps you present to what it was, and therefore, it's undesirable.
[143:20] B: Oh, God. So you want me to fully take it on?
[143:24] A: I want you to get to be at peace with what you've done.
[143:31] B: I kind of am.
[143:33] A: No, you pretend like it wasn't what it was. That's. That's a very different thing.
[143:40] B: Well, I don't know what that relationship was with Frederick.
[143:44] A: It was a.
[143:45] B: Or the guy that put me in prison.
[143:48] A: It was a transactional relationship.
[143:50] B: But they both wanted to marry me.
[143:53] A: Yeah.
[143:54] B: Well. Yeah. So when you're married, like, the women have, you know, put the credit cards.
[144:02] A: They both wanted to marry me. Did they?
[144:05] B: Yeah.
[144:07] A: Did they marry you?
[144:08] B: No. I got. I got. No, I didn't get the second ring because I got drunk in Greece, but I got one of the rings. And then the freaking guy that Housewell that freaking put me in prison, he took all my things. He kept my things. And Frederick came all the way up because I was with the other guy, you know, at that time. Even though I was going with Frederick, like, two weeks later, traveling overseas, I asked. He comes up to get my things that are at what's his face's place after he threw me in jail. And he said that he put them outside. He can put them outside. He said they're in the trash because. And because, thank God, Frederick was in the area, and he was able to get up in there in the area in like, two hours or something. Two hours later, and the things are gone. He put them outside. He wouldn't. I just. I don't even see him doing that in two hours, getting it done. He's doing it right.
[145:19] A: God.
[145:21] B: And what's up with the stealing things? So let me ask you this. So do you believe that, like, I'm my weakness? So something part of the deal with weakness? Is that why people keep stealing from me? Why does that keep coming up in my life?
[145:36] A: Okay, so watch all of those situations and with the men that were transactional relationships and you went beyond what you were comfortable doing was out of your not valuing you.
[145:51] B: Oh my gosh, you're right. Cuz that's why that came a couple weeks ago. Is the reason all these things have happened to me with these men is because I knew that those guys weren't the right ones. And I stuck with those guys for the wrong reasons and I was in the relationships for the wrong reasons. And that's why they turned out catastrophic.
[146:06] A: Transactional. And when it's transactional, you go beyond what you're comfortable with. You're not holding the keys.
[146:17] B: Oh, right. I like that side.
[146:20] A: You're transactional so they own you. That all came out of your not feeling worth it to yourself. What I really want you to connect to is your own worth to you. Because you keep thinking, thinking that I need to be worth it to my mom in order for me to be worth it. That's why I tried to repair my relationship with mom later in life. Because I keep thinking that in order for me to be worth it, I need to be worth it to her. The more that I want to be worth it to her, the more that she shits on me. You follow me with this?
[147:09] B: Yeah.
[147:10] A: So what. What we're interested in is you being worth it to you. Right. That you're worth it to you. Right. And you're worth it to you, which is why you're taking a menial $13 an hour job right now. Because that's temporary. Yeah, right. But part of what was going on is that younger you, when she got in with Frederick and was in survival mode, couldn't have known that it was going to lead to all the other up shit it led to. Like even with the guy three in jail, right? That younger you didn't know what a transactional relationship was. Was. She just thought it was, oh, I've got this guy who's going to take care of me. And I needed taken care of. But see, a woman is not a damsel in distress. A woman needs a man about as much as a fish needs a fucking bicycle, which is not at all okay, So a woman needs a man as much as a fish needs a bicycle. A woman doesn't need a man to buy her groceries. A woman doesn't need a man to pay her rent. A woman doesn't need a man to buy her clothes. A woman doesn't need a man. Heck, the penis wasn't even designed primarily for her pleasure. It Was designed to make a baby. She's got a body part that she doesn't need a penis for that. Its sole purpose is pleasure. Got it. As a woman, it's nice and it feels good when she's got a man who does nice things for her, but not because she needs it, not because she can't make it without him, but because it's nice to feel taken care of and partnered. Yeah, right. The thing that's been missing with those men is that you never felt partnered. You felt like this shiny object of desire, but never partnered. It was always a. They had the power, they had the money, they had the means. You were the object of desire. And as long as you were the pretty object of desire and doing the things that they wanted you to do, you. You got money or product or things or cute purses that cost $5,000. Got was never a partnership. Not with Fred. Right now with the other guy. Right. So as you're hearing this now, Jacqueline, what do you notice what's happening inside? You don't know. How's your body feeling?
[150:32] B: A little blah.
[150:33] A: A little blah.
[150:36] B: Just, like, kind of heavy.
[150:40] A: Right? So what would happen if we were to lighten up? Because the earlier you didn't know that it was going to lead to her compromising her own morals and her own worth to do what somebody else wanted that it was going to lead to, then her having to use her body or provide different services to men for money. Right. When you left the guy and you met Frederick, you weren't thinking it was going to lead to what it led to. Does that make sense? So what would it be like for you to let younger you know that, you know, she didn't know. And yeah, she got wooed because she was young by all the fancy things. That's what she got wooed by. Notice, everything that you've been upset was stuff that they took. It was the fancy things in the objects, because the fancy things in the objects made me feel like I was fancy thing.
[152:01] B: There's just something to do, right.
[152:04] A: I'm a fancy thing because I got a Chanel purse. Nobody has Chanel purses, right? Or the Gucci thing or the, you know, Prada. Prada makes shoes that are $795 that look like shoes, and people buy them just because they say Prada. There are some ugly. There really are. And you're like. And they're 900. And you're like, holy. And people buy them. Why? Because it's got Prada on it.
[152:36] B: Well, and this is at the End of the day, those things don't mean anything.
[152:40] A: That's right. You didn't know that. You have the context now that you're worth more to yourself than just a shiny thing.
[152:53] B: Yeah.
[152:56] A: Right. You got a birthday coming up in a couple days. I do. I know that you're worth more than just a few shiny things.
[153:04] B: That's right.
[153:05] A: And a couple bucks.
[153:06] B: Exactly. So much more.
[153:09] A: So that younger you didn't know that it was gonna lead her to what it led to. Which led her right back to the thing that she wanted to get away from.
[153:22] B: Yeah.
[153:22] A: Which was Mom.
[153:23] B: My mom.
[153:26] A: And that we don't need to be loved by mom in order for you to be good in you. Right. Because Mom's not. Well. So mom can't be who you want her to be. Not because she doesn't care or love you, but because she's fucked up.
[153:48] B: I know.
[153:50] A: Yes. But now we want you to know. Not just know, know. So the first thing is we want to think about the younger you who got connected to Frederick, who didn't really know what that was going to lead to. Her having to compromise herself. Right.
[154:15] B: I didn't know what love was. I thought buying him, buying those things.
[154:21] A: Right.
[154:21] B: Buying me things and growing up, them buying me things. My parents, I felt, took that as a form of love because of the absence sense of so many other reasons.
[154:31] A: Right. That comes along with partnership. Right. You didn't know that. So close your eyes and think back to that younger you and let her know what you know now. That that wasn't love. That was transactional. And when it's transactional, it leads you to compromising you. Right. So that the younger you gets that you know, that she just didn't know then what you know now with certainty. So that we lighten up on that younger you for getting wrapped all into it. Because the only thing she had in mind at that time was how to get away from Mom. And that now it's not just about getting away from Mom. It's about having more of what I want for me in my life. Right. Partnership. I'm good on my own. I don't need. Right. I outside of me to be okay. Just like the sunset doesn't need anybody to see it in order to be beautiful. It's beautiful by itself. If you're seeing the sunset, you don't need somebody with you to enjoy the beauty of it. So it's not needed. Anything adds to what's already whole and complete because you're valuing you so much so that you're working a menial $13 an hour job. Right. That we know is only temporary. Right. So that she gets it. Right. That it's more than just getting away from mom. That there's more to you. You valuing you that that doesn't come from outside of you, it's inside of you. Just like the moment that you had the experience in nature of that waveical all connecting more awakening inside to more of who you are. Right. Worth it to you. That's right. What's starting to happen now? What are you noticing for yourself, Ms. Jacqueline? Who do you know to right now? You know that what are you noticing inside?
[158:33] B: It's almost like a. Like a specular enlightenment, dispersement, like just flattering.
[158:58] A: It's a flattering like a concept. It is, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah.
[159:17] B: I don't know how.
[159:18] A: So right now the longest thing that you've been trying to get is mom to be okay. If mom's okay, then I'm okay. But you're okay regardless of whether mom ever gets to be okay. This is not your job to get mom to be okay. Right. So you're connecting right now to more of who you are, the capital S self. Right, Right. That's why we lighten up on the earlier years. You cuz now you're more wise. Right.
[160:10] B: Maybe that's what it is.
[160:11] A: That it's not about transactions, quid pro quo, it's about partnership.
[160:21] B: Yes.
[160:23] A: Right, Right. That it doesn't ever go beyond where you want it to go because you have full say. Right. People have desire, discrepancies. Let's say the guy wants to and the gal really doesn't. But she can be flexible and fluid with him. And maybe they don't have intercourse, but maybe he, you know, she lies next to him and kisses him and touches him while he masturbates because she didn't want to have intercourse. She's not willing to not do anything. She just didn't want to do that. Right. We only go to what truly works for you. Again, that doesn't mean there's not wiggle room within all that. But it still has to be what works for you. Not. Well, I do this thing because that's what they wanted and I didn't want to. That's where it went off kilter. And that only happened because it was transactional. That's why you never got married.
[161:41] B: What?
[161:42] A: That's why you never got married to the them.
[161:47] B: Oh, well, I knew they weren't the.
[161:50] A: Right ones cuz it was true. They weren't not just that you knew they weren't the right ones. It's that it was a transactional relationship. It was money being exchanged for goods and services.
[162:05] B: Well, yeah. Cuz I guess the only reason they be getting married is for more money.
[162:12] A: Right. That's why you didn't do it. Because you didn't do that to myself. That didn't value you.
[162:18] B: That's right.
[162:20] A: Do you get it? And you want to start to feel really good about that.
[162:27] B: I do.
[162:28] A: Right.
[162:28] B: I feel really good.
[162:30] A: Right. So even think of mom going, well, you know, you spread your legs once to make money. Why don't you do it again?
[162:37] B: And it's like, you know, I'm not doing that.
[162:39] A: So just check.
[162:40] B: How do we want you to be assertive and direct?
[162:46] A: Yeah. Sometimes.
[162:48] B: And say, I'm not gonna do that.
[162:50] A: Right. That's not me.
[162:51] B: Yeah, I'm exactly. I'm not doing that again.
[162:54] A: Or sometimes there's nothing to be said.
[162:58] B: Yes.
[163:00] A: Or other times. Wow, mom, it seems. Seems like you're really worried about money or my money. No. You're just really worried about money.
[163:08] B: Yeah.
[163:10] A: Seems like we're having a challenge with the bills.
[163:13] B: Okay. I like that. That's a good statement.
[163:15] A: You follow me with that?
[163:16] B: Yes. Okay.
[163:18] A: Right. Not like I'm offended that she said it.
[163:24] B: Okay.
[163:24] A: Because that's not me. I remember working with another girl with Sarah, and she got on Facebook and one of the old guys that she had done stuff with reached out to her. You know, they were friends. Not really friends.
[163:39] B: No.
[163:41] A: Because when he says, hey, would you like to see, um. Over again? He's not a friend. See, um, over instead of come see. Um.
[163:55] B: Sorry, Sorry.
[163:56] A: I know it's like the gf.
[163:57] B: I don't know where I was, like, totally somewhere else.
[164:01] A: Right. Got it.
[164:03] B: Yeah.
[164:05] A: Right.
[164:05] B: Wow.
[164:06] A: Because that's not me. Even though it was stuff that I did.
[164:10] B: Right.
[164:10] A: And I don't have to have the conversation. So what she needed to do is just block the guy instead of say, no, I don't do that anymore. That guy is a block guy because he doesn't get to interact with me because he's not seeing me for who I am now and who I'm becoming. Got it.
[164:32] B: Yes. I'm deserving.
[164:35] A: Yeah. Right. So we just keep opening up space and distance from Mom. Emotionally experiencing mom's garbage is being about her and that you don't need that from her in order for you to be okay. That's where the confusion has been. You've been thinking I needed certain things from her in order for me to be okay. Right. But you never needed those things in order for you to be okay. In order for you to want to have a better relationship with your daughter.
[165:22] B: Yeah.
[165:23] A: Right. And you get it that you haven't been in a great space based on all the other stuff that's been going on with you for you to have the kind of relationship you want to have with your daughter. Right. So you're all about getting you well. Right, Right. Got it.
[165:49] B: Yeah.
[165:52] A: So we also want you to lighten up on you that you haven't been as present in her life as you've wanted to be because it was better that you haven't been as present in her life as you wanted to be. Instead of being damaged in her life.
[166:13] B: I do fully believe that. I know that's why. And I think and I am grateful the way things have like rounded.
[166:19] A: Do you follow me? Cuz it could be like how it is with you. With you I could have been so destructive.
[166:24] B: I could have really screwed her up.
[166:26] A: Right.
[166:26] B: But I don't know if this distance is better, but I'm looking at it like, you know, I can make out little bit more.
[166:32] A: The distance is better now. Exactly.
[166:35] B: Right.
[166:36] A: Because you haven't been in a place that you could really be present. Ongoing. See, the worst thing would be to come in and out. In and out, in and out, in and out.
[166:49] B: Well, that's what I've always done my whole life with her.
[166:51] A: Yeah, but not in the same way as mom.
[166:57] B: Oh.
[167:00] A: Right. We want to get you to be in a solid situation so that you can have more consistency. Ongoing.
[167:09] B: That's what I want.
[167:10] A: Right. Got it. That's where we're headed. So you and I are going to get back together again and do more because we've done a bunch of stuff. Stuff. Because I want you to check, think about the stuff that we've talked about so far and the stuff that happened.
[167:29] B: Oh, right.
[167:30] A: And when you think about those experiences now, what do you notice?
[167:37] B: Not so difficult to understand and not.
[167:39] A: Just not so difficult to understand. When you think about it, what do you notice in terms of how you feel?
[167:45] B: I don't really connect with them the same.
[167:47] A: Yeah. No, they don't have the same feeling.
[167:49] B: Yeah.
[167:51] A: Right. And that's what's changing. You did great today.
[167:57] B: Thank you.
[167:58] A: You're welcome.
[168:00] B: I saw you try to get me tangled up. There you were. You were the little. The other little lion trying to attack me on the corral. You were.
[168:11] A: All I wanted to do is activate the stuff that's been most problematic.
[168:15] B: You're like, no.
[168:17] A: So that we could unplug it.
[168:18] B: Yeah.
[168:19] A: So it stops running you. So that you get to stand in your own power and connect to more of you.
[168:27] B: That's what I want.
[168:29] A: I know. That's what I want for you too.
[168:31] B: I want that more than anything.
[168:33] A: Yeah. That's what we've been doing. That's why we're gonna get back together again so that we can fully connect all of that. Got it? Yeah. See what you've learned how to do? And it was a coping mechanism and a way of survival is to not get connected is to pretend that it isn't or pretend that it wasn't. And so we had to get to what was real.
[169:05] B: That's why you kept addressing and bringing back up, trying to keep. Kept making me go back to feel that. Because.
[169:12] A: Because you've learned throughout life how to suppress a void. Pretend that it's not. But that's why it keeps sneaking up on you. What we're doing is all about unplugging it so it stops running you. None of it has been anything that you've allowed to happen. It's all been that has been happening based on errors and glitches in the way your brain has been working based on programming.
[169:45] B: And what was the thing about the programming that you said we were going to be doing? I'm putting in the new or something else. It'll come to me later on. It'll come to me. It's a lot of information that you give me.
[169:58] A: Well, I'm not giving it just to you. It's really working with your unconscious. The part that beats your heart, the part that breathes for you, the part that runs the show, the part that you think of as I or me is like a guy sitting on top of an elephant, only feeling in control if the elephant is doing what he wants. But guess who's really in control, the guy or the elephant? It's always the elephant. Because if the elephant gets spooked, the guy's just going along for the ride. We want to work with the part that connects to the automatic unconscious responses, all the preconscious stuff, so that naturally and automatically without having to use this, those things it used to trigger aren't triggering. So it makes it easier for you to do the things naturally that makes sense for you to do, which you've already started. That's why you're valuing you more by working the menial job.
[171:16] B: I really am.
[171:17] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[171:20] B: It is.
[171:21] A: Right and see, that's not just an up here thing. That's an in here thing. So the changes that you're going to notice most with what we've done isn't just this, but how I feel in response to stuff. Because you're going to be in situations with mom where she's going to throw one of those zingers, and it's not going to do what it did to you. You're going to catch it and be like, oh, that's her shit.
[171:46] B: Yeah.
[171:46] A: And it's gonna fall to the wayside. So, therefore, the intensity in which it used to spike will be less, the duration in which it used to last will be less, and the frequency in which it used to happen will be less. That's what you're gonna notice, in particular, with stuff with Mom. Got it. Cool beans. Come with me.
