[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 5th of October, and Jennifer, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful and valuable, that recording may be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:17] B: Yes.
[00:18] A: Cool. And do you go by Jennifer or Jen or Jennifer.
[00:20] B: Jennifer or Jen.
[00:22] A: Okay, cool. So you had started by telling me that there is a most recent thing that really has had an effect on you lasted. Although things have progressively gotten better, you're not having the same seizures that you were, and that stuff's better. You still sometimes think about it or shit reminds you of it or you have flashbacks of it. And we want to get the impact that that has had cleared. You also mentioned that there was an earlier thing that happened prior to your daughter being born that still also has an effect underneath the surface.
[00:54] B: Also. Growing up, my mom was in and out of drug addiction. She did very well and out. And when she would use, she would get very fearful. So I would say a struggle with a mental. She would be like, you know, lord, rebuke saint. Very first off, my family is very religious. Okay. So. And I come from a very strong Catholic background. My grandparents did not use drugs or alcohol. Nine aunts and uncles, doctors, lawyers, all come from very prestigious. My mom, when she would use drugs, she'd go into a state of fear, but more with Satan, a religious state of fear. A state of Lord, like, Lord, rebuke Satan spirits, the devil's getting coming for her type of stuff. And, you know, would hold us and be like, you know, that's her only way that would keep her safe, that would type of stuff. But as I grew older, that type of stuff started affecting me. When she would act out like that, obviously, and do certain things, she would get clean time. But then, you know, she would go through it every time she would use. So that has always played a. An effect on me having a state of. Because also I was made to clean obsessively when I was young, if nothing could be clean enough, stuff like that. So I find myself sometimes with things making myself like almost like an OCD where I'm cleaning a lot or I'm checking things more than one time. Certain things like that, which I find to be sometimes overwhelming and stressful to myself. I didn't know if that was important. I just threw that.
[02:32] A: No, that's great. Yeah. So that's something that you recognize. Kind of came from how mom was then. But it certainly has been having an effect on you because that comes in waves with you where you might be overly cleaning or overly checking or overly doing things. And that's something that you also recognize has been problematic.
[02:53] B: Okay, it is.
[02:55] A: Okay. Okay. So we would like to get that certainly. Yes. Down what other things? So kind of framing it because I certainly get known as somebody who's really good at healing trauma.
[03:08] B: Yes.
[03:10] A: However, the purpose of healing trauma is a side benefit. Meaning what we all want is we want life now to work more in the way that we want it to. Meaning in terms of how we think or feel or act or react. That's kind of what we want. So that's more. As I'm thinking about things, my idea goes, okay, how do we want things to be for you now in terms of how you think, feel, act and react? If as we move towards this, it leads us to clearing up earlier other stuff, which frequently it does great. But the purpose is to always get now to work better. So what I'm understanding in terms of what's been problematic now is a. Sometimes you find yourself thinking, having emotional responses to stuff that you went through.
[04:04] B: Yes.
[04:06] A: And that you've recognized has been problematic.
[04:09] B: Yes.
[04:09] A: Sometimes there are thoughts, dreams, flashbacks of yucky stuff that happen.
[04:15] B: Yes.
[04:15] A: So we want to get that going. Sometimes you find yourself more overly doing stuff, whether that be cleaning or checking, and we want to get that turned down. So that's what I've understood so far. In terms of what's been problematic for you now, what else would be useful for me to know? What else are we wanting to get better for? You certainly know how to take care of those things.
[04:43] B: I would say that I can get a high level of anxiety. I will put too much on myself at once. I. I strive when I'm like this. Okay, so I'm four months clean right now.
[04:59] A: Cool. Good for you.
[05:00] B: Thank you.
[05:01] A: That's awesome.
[05:02] B: I also quit smoking cigarettes as well.
[05:04] A: All right.
[05:05] B: So all at once, so. So I decided, you know, well, first it was the drugs and then I said, you know, I was in a program and I said, you know what, I'm done with cigarettes too since then. So I'm kind of like this. And I'm an all or nothing type of person, so I will strive and I shoot for the stars. And if I mess up or I fall short, I am very hard on myself. That's one thing. I can be very self critical when I mess up to the point where before I would go back to the old way. Of drugs or alcohol. But now I'm not. I found a strength or like, no matter what, I'm not. And I've also had feelings. My daughter. I lost my two daughters. They're now adopted. My daycare teacher adopted them. So that's very difficult for me. It's been the first time. They're a 4 and 7. That I've been away from them. And it's been almost two and a half years now. I've used drugs every day since. And now this is the first time that I'm like, I'm not. God has made a plan. He has a plan for my life. And whatever that is, I'm gonna walk with. I'm gonna. I'm gonna live my best life. What God created me to do. I'm not gonna. I've made these mistakes before, and it put me where I'm at, but I can't change them. All I can do is today. So I've now surrendered that. And so that's stuff that I've dealt with that causes me a lot of pain and a lot of. I guess you would say, regret and stuff like that. But also, like, just, I'm the type of person that I need to start setting healthier boundaries with people. I tend to give with my heart. I have a big heart and do as much as I can. It tends to. Other people do not reciprocate that. Or it's always. They have an ulterior motive of what they're trying to do with it.
[06:59] A: That makes sense. Okay, I want to understand. But before you go into the big heart, I want to make sure that I followed what you've said so far. So. So in terms of other stuff that's been problematic is that sometimes you put goals way up here, and if you haven't reached them, then you get down on you and you're hard on yourself. And there had been a history of you going back to problematic using. That's something that we want to get it so that you're lighter and easier. Then there's been the adoption of kids, and that's been weighing on you because there's a whole bunch of regret and remorse and guilt tied into that kind of stuff. So we also want to lighten that up for you, so that's not weighing on you so much. Okay, so I follow you with those things. And then you were saying that sometimes you give.
[08:04] B: Yeah.
[08:04] A: Too much with your heart, and it doesn't feel like I'm getting back what I'm giving. That's problematic. But then you said something about other people may have an ulterior. So I want to understand.
[08:19] B: I would say if someone is asked me to do something, say, even financially, say it's like something, and I don't really. I don't really have the money to do it, but they're saying, and. But.
[08:31] A: Or.
[08:32] B: This is my sister, for example. She's an addiction. Right now, she's struggling with addiction. She says she's not. She's getting clean. She's doing this. She's been cleaning this song. She called me and say, hey, it's my son's birthday. I don't have the money to take him out to eat. Don't really have the money right now, but I'll give the money that I have that. And knowing that I have to. Knowing that I really can't give them money, but I do anyways, and then I have to come up with the money. Does that make sense?
[08:57] A: Okay, so. So you do things for other people sometimes to your own detriment.
[09:05] B: That's exactly what I mean.
[09:07] A: Okay, so it's overdoing for other people.
[09:11] B: Yes.
[09:12] A: And not taking good care of me.
[09:14] B: That's. That's.
[09:15] A: So there is an aspect of you get joy, I would say, out of caretaking and caregiving.
[09:23] B: Yes, exactly.
[09:24] A: The problem is that sometimes it becomes too much, and in it being too much, you're not taking good care of you.
[09:32] B: Yes.
[09:34] A: I see. Okay, so we want that to be adjusted so that you actually get the oxygen mask on you first.
[09:41] B: Yes.
[09:42] A: Before you do things to take care of others and that you've got freedom to not always feel like you have to do caretaking.
[09:51] B: Yes.
[09:51] A: Right. Because the deal with caretaking is I get joy out of it.
[09:54] B: Yeah.
[09:55] A: But sometimes I do it and I don't actually get the joy because it's gone beyond what I'm okay with.
[10:01] B: It's. Exactly.
[10:02] A: And then sometimes if I'm not doing it, I feel bad.
[10:05] B: Yes.
[10:05] A: That I'm not doing it. Yes.
[10:07] B: It's crazy.
[10:08] A: I follow you with that.
[10:09] B: Yes.
[10:10] A: Okay, so. So that's certainly something that we want to be more regulated in you. So that you're doing things that take care of you first.
[10:19] B: Yes.
[10:20] A: Okay, cool. I follow you with that.
[10:22] B: That's it.
[10:23] A: What else would be useful for me to know?
[10:25] B: That's all I got right now. That's a lie. I think. I think that's a lot.
[10:32] A: Okay. Sister. Is she, like, older, younger?
[10:39] B: This one's older. I got three sisters, two brothers and the mom. My mom.
[10:45] A: Okay. All from same mom.
[10:47] B: Yes.
[10:49] A: Okay. And. And. And then dad, is he in picture.
[10:56] B: Not in the life.
[10:58] A: Okay.
[11:00] B: Also mom, the relationship is. I was making sure it wasn't on somehow to my mom it. We've had a history, obviously the drugs and alcohol. She's clean now, but there is a codependent relationship. She is especially with me right now. Like she's living with my sister. She's about My sister's now moving saying, hey, you can't stay here. Like we're. You have to get your own place. Mommy. Her and her husband are moving now. She. My mom's lived there with my sister over a year and a half. She sometimes will put more on us than we can handle of what. Like how so okay, so for example, my sister's leaving today. Gonna leave with the next couple weeks. She. My mom had gets a certain amount of money every month. That's not going to save.
[11:51] A: She.
[11:51] B: Somebody in a different country sends her 2,000 every month. She has money to be able to physically take care of herself. She's staying at my sister's now. She'll do this. She says to my sister, well, if you. If you make me leave or don't let me move with you, I feel like. I'll feel like killing myself. Stuff like that. Just an example of not okay. That's not my sister to the point where it's been unhealthy. My mom seen that she. But she's not working. She. She. She's able to work, but she's not. She won't get the job. So she also at this point she's on a prescription medication. You know, she'll want me to. Like this between me and you. She's asked me before to get her certain medication. Well, I'm newly clean. I would have to get it from somebody that, you know, it would put me in a bad position to get it.
[12:45] A: Oh, so not really getting it as a medication.
[12:47] B: Yeah, no, no getting it, but. Oh, not through a doctor. Regular doctor. Exactly.
[12:52] A: Not getting it at the pharmacy.
[12:53] B: Exactly. Of course. Of course. Which is. It's Adderall, which is a. But it's still. Even though you're. She's prescribed it. It would be an illegal thing to do. Of course. I said no. Just an example of type of stuff. Unhealthy stuff that's going on. She's okay. So got my taxes back. By the grace of God. They took a bunch of it for child support because I still think so that's basically done. Well, I was able to get a scooter with the rest, but with the money that was left, she wanted me to give it to her to put for her to get a place lo and health. She already has her own money, but then she thinks she doesn't have enough. I had the thing the past where my money has come. I've had a caretaking thing with my mom before for years where I would come up with money in whatever way I had to to be able to support my mom, whatever. And it could be it come to find out my mom already had money and she was doing something else just insane like, like stuff you never think, you know, she's spending her money on plastic surgery or something. You know, just, you know, a Harley just you know, like it's been where she. I've been put in positions that I should not have put been put in and now it's about setting boundaries with her. So my sister is. Now she's leaving. Well now my mom, she does this thing where she'll attach onto one of us because that's her way. But if not, she's had breakdown mental breakdowns in the past. Like really not okay stuff. I mean really bad. Like got not only psych hospitals but like just crazy things have happened. I mean legitimately. Like one time running down the street naked just like. And so most of these have been drug induced of cocaine or whatever, but just still completely horrifying situations that have happened several different times. So okay, that's just a whole situation.
[14:55] A: So there's. If I'm following you, there hasn't been a good separation between you and mom?
[15:03] B: No.
[15:04] A: Sometimes that gets blurred or again that whole caretaking. Can you overextend? Always, always have to be taking care of her.
[15:14] B: Yes. And when I was in my first rehab, when I first got clean for three I had my daughter. I was clean for three years. They said, you know, you play the mother role, she plays the daughter role. This is not okay. What happens is she looks to you, you play this role. And it's been that way since you were so young that you don't see that this is unhealthy. It's when I was younger, went to the a psychiatrist. They're like, you got, you gotta either choose you're gonna have your mother or your daughter. I chose my daughter. I was not allowed to speak to her the whole time I was in the program. They said when I was graduating because I wasn't allowed to talk to her. If you reconnect with your mother and you allow this relationship again, you will go back to usa. I didn't for about six months. Then I reconnected with my mother. Within a year I was using it. I relapsed. I lost everything. Two and a half years clean. So that's.
[16:06] A: So mom has not been all too healthy for you.
[16:10] B: No.
[16:11] A: Both in what you went through growing. Growing up when she was in active addiction. In that whole fear thing that would go on with her.
[16:18] B: Yes.
[16:19] A: And then you're doing the caretaking and.
[16:24] B: So for her as well. But it's always been for. It's been a back. There's been some reasoning. So it looks like she's always been there for me. And she has per se.
[16:33] A: Like how so what does that mean?
[16:35] B: Okay. So she would bond me out of jail. She would do that. She would do certain things for me. But I will always pay her back the money. And I would always. But she would be there for me. But always knowing that I would do anything for her if she asked me. I need you to get this money. I need you to take care of this. I'll always get it. And no matter what I had to go through to get it too. Or she'll put me in certain positions.
[17:02] A: Okay.
[17:03] B: I'm sorry. It's like some reason I have paranoia. Some it going through in her hearing what I'm saying.
[17:08] A: Because that would be bad.
[17:09] B: Yeah. It would be horrible.
[17:11] A: How so?
[17:11] B: If she was hearing everything I was saying, she'd be really upset. She'd be really pissed off. She'd be so mad.
[17:18] A: And then what?
[17:19] B: I don't know. She just would be upset with you.
[17:22] A: What about mom being upset isn't okay for you?
[17:26] B: It wouldn't. Because she would be. I wouldn't. Wouldn't know what would happen. I don't know if she would. I don't know if she would drink or do something. I don't know what she would do.
[17:35] A: Isn't that interesting?
[17:37] B: What?
[17:38] A: What's happening now that I'm crying?
[17:42] B: What?
[17:43] A: The heavy weight of if mom isn't doing okay.
[17:48] B: Yeah.
[17:49] A: Then it's all on me.
[17:53] B: Yeah. So.
[17:54] A: So. So. Okay. So one of the things that we really want for you is freedom.
[18:00] B: Yeah.
[18:01] A: With Mom.
[18:02] B: Yes.
[18:03] A: Because you haven't had any freedom there. Which doesn't mean that I have to not have any interactions. But you don't have any freedom.
[18:12] B: No.
[18:13] A: To even say certain things. Worrying about how it might impact her and what she might do as a result of. Yes. Right.
[18:21] B: Yeah.
[18:21] A: To the point that we're having a conversation and you're telling me about the troubling things that go on with mom and you're fearful that mom might hear about the troubling things that have gone on for you with Mom. Right.
[18:35] B: Yeah, it's true.
[18:36] A: We checked it twice.
[18:38] B: Yeah, right.
[18:39] A: Because the first time it wasn't enough to see that the phone's not on.
[18:41] B: And she's not listening.
[18:42] A: Oh, God. Why don't we call her and just see?
[18:46] B: Yeah. Oh, geez. Yeah.
[18:49] A: So we want you to have a lot more freedom there because you haven't had a lot of freedom, and we want you to be more. Okay.
[18:57] B: Yes.
[18:58] A: Because I follow you. That somebody educated you and said you've had more of a mom and she's had more of a kid role.
[19:07] B: Yeah.
[19:08] A: That you've been the caretaker for your mom, but you're also worried about Mom's well being.
[19:15] B: Yes.
[19:16] A: Because mom may go off the handle.
[19:19] B: Yes.
[19:20] A: And then that would be really, really bad.
[19:22] B: Yeah.
[19:22] A: As if somehow that would be your fault.
[19:25] B: Yeah, I'd be really upset.
[19:28] A: Well, as if somehow it would be your fault that if mom heard that you get troubled with all the shit that happens with mom and she do something, that somehow that would be on you.
[19:39] B: Well, this is what happened too. So we were in the. This. That is what we were in. That I was in that program. As we got further into my therapy, they're like, they're. This is a major problem.
[19:55] A: This.
[19:56] B: Your mother's relationship is more than codependent. It's really unhealthy. And what she's doing to you. She was also wanting me to not say everything that happened. And by that, I wasn't able to get better. So finally I was like, they're like, if you want to get better, you got to tell everything that's going on that happened or you're not going to be able to get better. So I did. Being in that, eventually the therapist was like, you can't have contact with your mom anymore. Basically, if you want to stay sober for right now, you can't. So because of that, of course, I had to tell my mom, I can't have contact with you right now. And I couldn't have any contact because it got to. It was just really unhealthy, like, in the way that she. It was so bad, she ended up coming up to the place, banging on the door, like, I mean, screaming. You know, of course, here I am at the other side, like, crying. I want to open it, but I can't. But she's like, just hysterical screaming. It's kind of insane. At the same time, when I think about. You're like, holy, that's nuts. That's crazy. Stuff like that. Going past a couple years, I didn't have contact with her. When I got reconnected, I ended up getting. And I also got more charges for, like, basically running what would be like. It said me and my mom were running a prostitution ring in Sarasota County. That's what it said. My mom, lo. Did not have anything per se, to do, but she did own the business and not. She owned a massage therapy company. My mom also, you know, put me in positions. I would just say she. Like this. She put me in positions like, okay, you can not. Shouldn't be pressing me to prostitute. Or just, this guy has a lot of money. He's trying to hit on you. Like, mom, I have no. I'm not talking. Dude, he's a millionaire or whatever. This is just an example. Okay, well, I don't. I'm not. You can just talk to him. He's gonna give you money. Like, you're putting me in a position where. First off, I don't want to do that. I don't wanna manipulate this guy for money or pretend like I like somebody I don't like so that he can give me money. Stuff like that. Oh, well, you. What about your mom? You know what I mean? Like, I need. I need help to buy this or that. And this guy, look at me, he's just willing to help you and. Well, no, he has an ulterior motive. He doesn't just want to help me. You know what I mean? She's done that to me in the past, so that became where I was clean before. And I used to do regular massages for her in her business. Well, her massage would come, and sometimes they would pressure me, like, to try to do after stuff.
[22:34] A: Like when she give me a hand job.
[22:36] B: Yeah, stuff like that. In the massage.
[22:39] A: Like, where's the happy ending?
[22:41] B: Exactly. And I would be like, yo. Like, I would say no. And. And eventually there's times where I was just pressured and I was just like, you know what? An extra thousand dollars? I'm like, you know what? I've done it. I did it. I'm just. Just to reiterate. Well, I got clean. I'm like, I can't do massages, period. Even regular massage. No, I can't do any massages because I'm uncomfortable. They press them. A lot of them pressure me to do stuff, and I am not comfortable. Now, I'm also a people pleaser, so I find myself, like.
[23:11] A: Right.
[23:11] B: So that's what happens. So I just can't do them at all since I told her. And it's just been many times where I was clean. And she also said, well, can't you do a regular massage clean? Well, why are the fact that you're pressuring me. You don't give a crap about me. You're. Because you're putting me in position where I have to possibly do something that's. I'm gonna use afterwards after doing it. Because even I. I just. It just. That's a whole. Whole bit of, like, basically the history of me and my mom and why it triggers me sometimes to be around my mom and it's unhealthy. Some of it. Yeah.
[23:49] A: Some.
[23:49] B: Yeah, a lot. Yeah, a lot.
[23:54] A: So me saying you having freedom.
[23:58] B: Yes.
[23:58] A: From mom is really, really something that would be useful.
[24:02] B: Yes, it would.
[24:02] A: And the freedom to not have to do caretaking and the clarity to realize that mom's not well.
[24:11] B: Yeah.
[24:11] A: And that mom not being well has nothing to do with you.
[24:15] B: Yeah.
[24:17] A: Which you might know, but you don't fully feel.
[24:21] B: Yeah.
[24:21] A: Follow me with that.
[24:22] B: Yeah.
[24:23] A: That's the part that we truly want to get changed. So that. What, you know, you fully feel it inside that you're actually clear. Cool.
[24:35] B: Okay.
[24:35] A: I know how to do that.
[24:36] B: All right. Awesome.
[24:39] A: What other stuff do you think would be useful for me to know? Because I follow you with certain major. We'll call them big T traumas that happen. I get the heaviness and weight of what happened with you and your own children. I get the relapse that's happened. I get the whole problematic stuff that's been going on with mom. I get that sometimes you get really down on you, and there's a lot of times you have unwanted emotions and that even when you don't want to do something, if you're pressured enough to do it, you find yourself doing it because you have that whole pleasing thing going on. So I follow all of that.
[25:19] B: Yeah.
[25:19] A: Wow. And I'm knowing what to do with that. What else would be useful for me to know, to understand?
[25:26] B: I think that's good. What else is there? I write music, I sing as a coping mechanism. I used to.
[25:37] A: For writing the music.
[25:39] B: I used music as a coping. For everything I write, I think, like, if I'm going through anger, I used to, like, in recession, when I drink, I punch walls or I do stuff like that that just take the pain away and the anger. But now, I mean, I write. I write music. I write poetry to, like, release it.
[25:59] A: So that's better.
[26:00] B: Yes. Better than punching walls. Stuff like that or breaking stuff like stuff like that, you know, crazy stuff.
[26:08] A: That Olivia Rodriguez gal, she's got a lot of like songs where she's really angry. Traitor. The good for you. Yeah, right. She's like good songs that are like.
[26:20] B: Yeah. So at this point I do that or I'll work out. I put do push ups. I work out.
[26:25] A: Yeah.
[26:27] B: I've was going from relationship to relationship. I am now not dating anyone. I'm just working on myself for the first time. Also.
[26:36] A: Is the picker off?
[26:37] B: No, the picker's effed. Oh, my picker's gone. It's horrible.
[26:41] A: So you haven't been picking the right kind of guy.
[26:45] B: No, and I've dated girls in the past.
[26:48] A: Or gal.
[26:49] B: Yeah.
[26:50] A: And so it's either or. You're not picking the right kind.
[26:52] B: Spin it. Yeah, finish it, Joe. It's been a legitimate shit show.
[26:57] A: So we'd like to get that picker adjusted.
[26:59] B: Yeah, My picker sucks.
[27:01] A: Right. Like one that has it be that you're feeling like you're worth it to you.
[27:06] B: Yes.
[27:08] A: Yeah, that would be useful.
[27:10] B: Yes.
[27:11] A: Okay. Okay. Are you in program now or are you.
[27:16] B: Nope. I have completed the program. I am now in a halfway house.
[27:20] A: Okay.
[27:21] B: I'm still in Tyler Court. I go to court next week.
[27:24] A: Okay.
[27:24] B: So I've been in there almost. It'll be my fifth month this week, I mean. Yep. So it's pretty amazing. And probably four or five months I'll graduate.
[27:33] A: Cool.
[27:33] B: It's exciting.
[27:34] A: Yeah.
[27:34] B: And then all my. The record, the charges that I have actually come off my record. Graduating. Yeah. I'm ready.
[27:44] A: Okay. Any people life wise? Certainly. I know that you've gotten connected with Selah, so that's a useful connection. But are there other components in life? Because mom certainly isn't. Well, dad's been out of the picture. You've got a sister who's in active addiction. Saying that she's not, but we kind of think she is. There's another sister that mom's living with.
[28:08] B: Yeah, but she's. She's. She's healthy for me. My sister Jesse. Okay, she's healthy. Who else? My other sister Heather's an active addiction. She's not. Okay.
[28:18] A: Okay.
[28:18] B: She's.
[28:19] A: So we got two sisters in active addiction.
[28:21] B: My brothers are healthy for me. My brother Jacob owns a business. He's in Venice though. He just got married. He's got a new baby. My other brother is married, he's gay. He's got. He just got out of the army and he actually does all huge concerts around the Nation. Yeah. So that's what I got there for family. I work. I have a sponsor that's phenomenal. She's got almost 20 or 15 years clean and Alcoholics Anonymous, but she's a Christian. I go to aana. I go to church. I go to Bible study. Actually was running a Bible study. And daily. Yeah, I'm very blessed. I have the gifts of intercessory prayer. Also, like I said, I write music and I sing and I have a hell of a voice. So I'll do a praise and worship and open it up. And so I'm really. I'm. I'm amazing with talented as a musician and a singer. So that's what I'm gonna pursue right now. I'm just. I'm gonna have to work as a server right now just to make egg and bucks until I make the big bucks.
[29:25] A: And is that what you're doing is working as a server?
[29:28] B: I just got out three days ago this place or about last Thursday. So I'm actually just gonna. I can probably start working for Carrabba's this week. My friend works there. I might start working there or I might get a job at like a breakfast place to start off with. Just because I don't know if I want to be around all the people that work there. Some people use, some people drink. I don't know if I just want to go to a totally different scene right away, maybe a breakfast place and.
[29:52] A: Start like a first watch kind of thing.
[29:54] B: Yeah. Less of a night crowd. Less of a.
[29:58] A: And first watch has many people that have gone through stuff with Sailor, have worked really through first watch. So you may want to check with them.
[30:07] B: Okay.
[30:07] A: About connections there.
[30:09] B: Yeah.
[30:09] A: Yeah. Okay, Cool.
[30:11] B: Sounds good.
[30:12] A: Okay. Any other stuff that you think would be pertinent or useful for me to know. To understand how things have been?
[30:19] B: No.
[30:20] A: Primarily, what was the drug of choice?
[30:22] B: Primarily, the drug of choice is cocaine.
[30:24] A: Okay, go up.
[30:27] B: Yes.
[30:28] A: Warthor's attention deficit level up.
[30:30] B: Also the X.
[30:33] A: Right. Of course.
[30:34] B: I. I also.
[30:35] A: Because we need to have uppers with downers.
[30:37] B: Yes. I did a. I did to level out. A continuation of Dilaudid. I said Dilaudid, cocaine, Xanax and marijuana continually. I never stop smoking marijuana. That is something I also consider that I might need if that was my. That was like what I was like, there has got to be an answer to the anxiety that I have. That gotta be answers to the post traumatic stress disorder. And that's why I was like, marijuana kind of. I have a problem where, like, I. I Need something for anxiety. I really do. My anxiety is unless there's something you like, can do, like we were talking about, that makes it. And I'm assuming that if the trauma was go down and the anxiety will go down.
[31:22] A: Sure. So we want you to be able to be more settled. Yeah. More functional and more comfortable in your own skin.
[31:31] B: Yes.
[31:31] A: And this quiet down.
[31:33] B: Absolutely.
[31:34] A: And a little less antsy and. Right. Because sometimes it feels like you have ants in your pants.
[31:40] B: Yes.
[31:41] A: Hard to sit still. Yeah, yeah, I get that. Okay, cool. So let me kind of give you a little bit of a background because as I said, this session is so that I can get an understanding of what's been going on with you. And what do we want to get better? So a couple interesting ways to look at things. Most people, when we relate to the stuff in our life, look through the lens that it's the stuff, the circumstances and the things that cause the feelings. So my mom doing that thing made me feel this way. When that person did that, I felt like this. When I did this thing, I felt that way.
[32:23] B: Yeah.
[32:23] A: So it's typically stuff and circumstances, situations that make me feel. That lens is not wrong. But it doesn't give us a lot of power.
[32:35] B: Yeah.
[32:35] A: Because with that lens we have one of two choices. I either try to change it, I work hard to change it, but if I can't change it, I try to avoid it and get away from it.
[32:45] B: Yes.
[32:46] A: Right. In life, though, you've already discovered that there's some stuff I can't change and some stuff I can't completely avoid or get away from.
[32:55] B: Yes.
[32:56] A: And then there's a whole bunch of bad stuff that's happened that unfortunately I can't get that bad stuff to have not happened. So we got to do something else. That's where I come in. My job is all about adjusting how your mind emotionally, automatically, pre consciously reacts and responds to stuff. So think of a silly example. Lion approaching zebra. Most of us would agree that as lion approaches zebra, lion is now making zebra scared.
[33:32] B: Yeah.
[33:33] A: Makes a lot of sense. I don't disagree with that. But if we looked at it from a different lens, we could also say that it's actually when the zebra itself sees senses, feels, smells, or thinks that lion is coming.
[33:49] B: Yeah.
[33:50] A: That it's actually the zebra's brain, not the lion, that's immediately making the zebra alert, motivated and stronger. We call it scared. It runs fast away. Now. Yes. The brain of the zebra is doing it to the zebra in response to lion approaching. But it's zebra's brain got it makes sense.
[34:13] B: Yeah.
[34:14] A: So from that same lens, Jen, we're gonna say that there's been ways in which your brain has been working that's been causing you to feel bad. By bad, we're meaning the lingering effect of those troubling experiences with the flashbacks, thoughts, whatever. By bad, we're meaning the overly need to take care of. By bad, we're meaning the high level of angst. By bad, we're meaning the problematic thoughts about using. By bad, we're meaning the. Your brain might do it, being down and hard on you in response to stuff. But see, what's really cool is that you and I have been able to recognize that that way of your brain working has been problematic. That's the issue that's on the table for us to get addressed. And it's common for our brain to have errors because it's a complicated machine. And all complicated machines are prone to malfunction more so than anything else. Right. I can pick up a hammer, right. I can throw it across my yard. I can go to the other side of the yard and pick up the hammer and still pound nails.
[35:24] B: Yes.
[35:25] A: Works simple, basic. Right. I don't want to do that with my computer. Yeah. I throw my computer across the yard, I go pick it up.
[35:35] B: It's not working.
[35:36] A: Right. So our brains are complicated machines. They're prone to error even without anything going wrong.
[35:43] B: Yeah.
[35:44] A: Then add to it shit that's happened along the way. It makes it more and more malfunctioning.
[35:51] B: Got it.
[35:51] A: So we're gonna tune it up. That being said, the way that I've been listening to you is my job is to understand how has Jen's brain been working, and in that way, how has it been negatively affecting her world? As I'm understanding that, I'm also starting to think of how do we want your brain to be working and what kinds of things do I need to be doing to get your brain to work more in the way that we want it to? Third part to that is it's not actually your job to get that stuff better. Your job is to stay clean and sober. You're with you all the time. You know that if you have an unwanted thought, craving, or urge, you're supposed to run the story all the way to the end.
[36:39] B: Yeah.
[36:40] A: Because the thought right up here might be. But we want to be in it.
[36:44] B: Yeah.
[36:45] A: Right. Even with a cigarette, the thought might be, well, do you want to have a cigarette? Well, if it's a cigarette, yes. Do I want to be a smoker? Well, that's when I'm more clear. No. Right. Kind of thing. We want to play the story all the way through because you're with you when it comes to unwanted feelings, triggers that you're not choosing. It's not your job to get it better. Yeah, it's my job to get it better for you. In the same way that when you go to a dental hygienist, it's totally her job to clean your teeth. She needs you there. You're collaborating, you're cooperating. You both have the same outcome in mind, but it's her job to do the work that makes sense. Same kind of thing with these unwanted emotions. It's my job to make the adjustments to the errors and the glitches in the way that your brain has been working, working so that it stops doing that to you. Got it. Second part, with everything. We are not troubled, haunted, pained, shamed, angry, hurting because of what we went through. So what's crazy about it is we have it that because that thing happened, that's why I'm still troubled.
[37:59] B: Yeah.
[37:59] A: We don't say that for a simple physical injury. So, for example, if I told you about when I was nine years old, I climbed up this tree and I went to get out of the tree and I landed and I broke my foot. If, as I told you about that right now, I started to get all emotional as if it was happening, you would look at me like I'm crazy. Why is this guy crying when his foot is fine?
[38:27] B: Yeah.
[38:30] A: Physical injury. We have a saying, time, quote, unquote, heals all wounds. But we also have the other notion that emotional wounds don't heal. Because if I were to tell you something different, that at nine years old, what my Uncle Tony did to me behind the bar, Grandpa's. And if I were to start telling you about what Uncle Tony did and I started to get all emotional about it, you'd be like, yeah, of course. So isn't it weird the physical wound, time heals it. Emotional wound stays on forever. Weird, right?
[39:07] B: Yeah.
[39:07] A: Not because emotional wounds can't heal. They have it only, and this is really a key thing only because there's a part of your brain that doesn't know the negative experience is over.
[39:20] B: Yes.
[39:22] A: You know that it's over. There's a part of your brain that never got the good news that it's over, that you made it through it, that you're on the other side of it, that that experience no longer exists. You may have a memory of it, but where the Error is, is that the memory of what happened is. And the experience of it happening got glued together. So the memory reads emotionally as if it's the experience itself. That's why somebody's telling us about being mugged 10 years ago. And they get to the part where the guy has come up behind him, and now the knife is at their throat, and all of a sudden, their face is white, their voices choked, their arms are trembling, and they've got a tear. But we're kind, nice people. We were listening to them. What the fuck happening with them?
[40:12] B: Yeah.
[40:13] A: And what most people say is they're reliving it, but what's really going on is part of their brain is confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience. That's why they're having that emotional reaction. We can tell it's affecting them as they were talking about it, because we saw it. But it was affecting them even over the weekend when they were playing in the pool.
[40:40] B: Yeah.
[40:40] A: With their kids. It was just under the surface, logically. They know that they're safe, that they're with us, that they survive, that they're okay, that there's no knife. The problem is that we're also learning that part of their brain never got the good news. So one of the things that we want to be doing for you is we want to get in the good news to the parts of your brain that don't know that those negative experiences are over, that you made it through it, and that you're okay. Second thing that we want to do is we want to turn down the intensity of the racing thoughts, the obsessive things, the things that go on so that that's not running you. Third, we want to also turn down that feeling that I've got to overbeat, take care of others, even if it's a detriment to me that what we want is we want you to have the freedom to do caretaking when it works and the freedom to not have to when it doesn't. Knowing that you're doing things that take care of you, so that you're more solid and grounded in you, but you're also a lot lighter on you, that you have a lot more peaceful feelings and a lot more ease. Does that make sense?
[41:59] B: Yes.
[42:01] A: So that's where we're headed.
[42:02] B: Okay.
[42:03] A: So what we're interested in doing, we're gonna have a block of time together, like a few hours, and in that time, we're gonna adjust and change all sorts of stuff that's been problematic in terms of how you've been feeling. We're going to change the way that your brain reacts and responds to the stuff past, current and future.
[42:31] B: Okay.
[42:31] A: We're going to get it so that you've got a lot more space, freedom, and ease in dealing with the difficult shit that happens with Mom.
[42:39] B: Yes.
[42:39] A: We're going to do things so that we get it, so that you see what's going on with mom clearly from. For what it is.
[42:46] B: Yeah.
[42:47] A: And you have internal ease in maneuvering through what shows up. Yeah. Got it.
[42:54] B: Got it.
[42:54] A: We're gonna do things to get it so that you're a lot lighter.
[42:57] B: Yeah.
[42:58] A: That you're much more okay in you.
[43:01] B: Yeah.
[43:02] A: We want you to be free from the emotional effect that the past experiences have had, whether they be the more recent one, ones that happen long term ago, whether they be the shit that happened to you or the shit that you did that you've now felt bad that you did.
[43:19] B: Yeah.
[43:20] A: We want all that gone so that you're much more at ease in you.
[43:24] B: Yeah.
[43:24] A: Does that make sense?
[43:25] B: Yes.
[43:26] A: And that's where we're headed. Okay. You know, it's a really good news thing. Yeah. I know how to do all that.
[43:31] B: Good.
[43:33] A: Like, I know how to make all of that happen. Which is really different. Because if you've ever done therapy or other kind of work on yourself, it's always been your job to do it.
[43:44] B: Yeah.
[43:45] A: Right. This is gonna be very different than that. We're gonna collaborate together.
[43:49] B: Okay.
[43:50] A: But it's my job to get it done.
[43:52] B: Okay.
[43:53] A: Yeah. So any questions for me? Okay. So I want to show you one thing that may be really useful for you to do in between now and when we get together. It uses neuroscience brain levers that are designed to help put the body into more of a state of rest. The first lever is a silly lever. It's about slightly lowering our jaw. Now, I don't mean just like you did. Not like wide open like. Ah. But just a little bit. Because when you slightly lower your jaw, even a little less than that. A little less than that. Right. When you slightly lower your jaw, it actually stimulates the vagal nerve and our body begins to put us in the parasympathetic. When you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, it starts to cause a satiated feeling in the body and starts to turn down internal dialogue. And then as you already are, if you begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper. That's right. Than how you automatically breathe. Just begin to notice as you're breathing in this slightly slower, longer and deeper way. How's your body feeling now? It already feels less stressful. Isn't that interesting?
[45:25] B: Yeah.
[45:25] A: Just those small little things where you're breathing a little bit slower and deeper, where you've got your jaw slightly lower and you rest your tongue. And then look as you continue to do it, that you can see me. But now with your peripheral vision, notice my fingers. Stay looking at me, but with your peripheral vision, see my fingers out here and how they're wiggling. Notice how you can pick it up with the sides of your vision. Isn't that weird?
[45:55] B: Mm.
[45:55] A: That means you're becoming more aware of space in here as you do this. Jen, again, just check. How's your body feeling now?
[46:07] B: Way better.
[46:08] A: Isn't that cool?
[46:09] B: Yeah.
[46:10] A: Not difficult. Not long, not hard to do. But all it requires is you lower your jaw slightly, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You breathe in a way that's a little bit slower, a little bit deeper than normal. You expand your awareness, which is easy. So if you're looking at something, you just stay looking at it. And then we. Your side vision, you connect. Notice how as you see me, you can see with your side vision the windows and doors. Yeah, right. You can see what's beyond me. You can sense what's behind you, how much space there is under the couch and even up above your head. And then, because when people are stressed, they tend to be under a lot of stress. Stress. Just for a moment, close your eyes and imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body while beyond the ceiling and the roof so that you go way above it all. Having a bird's eye view, seeing what's underneath and below you. Soaring like a bird who's free to fly through the sky, through space. Big, wide turns, curves, arching angles. Soaring, moving, flying all around in all ways and in all directions. Bring your awareness now back down and into your body so that you re associate inside you. When you're ready, take a deep breath.
[47:45] B: In.
[47:48] A: And then exhale and open your eyes. Right. And again, check. How's your body feeling now?
[47:56] B: Much calmer.
[47:57] A: Isn't that cool?
[47:58] B: Yeah.
[47:59] A: So those small little steps are very, very simple to do. Don't take a long time. We didn't spend more than a few minutes on this, but are about retraining your body into states of rest. Useful to do it when you first wake up in the morning. Useful to do it when you are ready to go, go to bed, and then even sometime throughout the day. If you have a few moments where you can be away from things and go through the process. So I'm gonna write it down. So you have much more calm, Right?
[48:33] B: Yeah.
[48:34] A: Right. Notice how your body's not so jittery and jumpy.
[48:38] B: Yeah. I feel much better.
[48:39] A: Isn't that cool?
[48:40] B: Yeah.
[48:41] A: Right.
[48:41] B: That was really helpful. Thank you.
[48:44] A: Sure. So it's those same things that we just went through. You lower your jaw slightly. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You breathe in a way that slightly slower and deeper than normal. You expand your awareness to your peripheral vision. And then you close your eyes and be up above like a bird, soaring and flying things. Seeing things under and below. Just for a few moments.
[50:44] B: Yeah.
[50:45] A: Every time you do that, it is a process that will get your body into a state of rest, that will start the accelerated healing process that we're engaging in so that we get you to be free from the effect that that stuff has had. Got it?
[51:05] B: Yes.
[51:05] A: And then we're going to get a time schedule where we have a few hours all at once so that we can make big change. So that when you leave, things are different. And what most people tell me time and time again when we're done is that the stuff used to really bother them isn't bothering them at all.
[51:22] B: Wow.
[51:22] A: The intensity in which they get distressed is way less. The frequency in which it would spike is way less. And even if they do get triggered, the duration in which it used to last is way less.
[51:34] B: Yeah.
[51:35] A: So they're able to move through and handle stressors with more ease. And that's where we're headed.
[51:41] B: That would be amazing. Thank you so much.
[51:44] A: Awesome. Well, I'm so glad that.
[51:46] B: Helpful.
[51:46] A: Yay. This is just the start.
[51:49] B: Yeah. This is great. Thank you so much.
[51:51] A: Of course. Yeah. So you can come with me. We will head on out there.
