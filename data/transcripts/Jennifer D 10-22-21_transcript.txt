[00:02] A: 22Nd. Is it the 22nd? Yes. Yeah, 22nd. All right. So today is the 22nd of October, Jennifer. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful and valuable and transformative, that recording may be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:24] B: Yes.
[00:25] A: Cool. Okay. So when you were in here the last time, you mentioned a variety of different things. One of the things you talked about is that there's a tendency to be like highly elevated, anxious, so racy thoughts, jittery, uneasiness, discomfort in certain settings and situations. We want to do a whole bunch of stuff to get that cleared up and better so that that's no longer running you. You also mentioned to me that there's been a whole bunch of things that you've gone through, some of them more recent, some of them longer time ago, some of them even from early childhood, that although the experiences themselves are over underneath the surface, it's continued to affect. Not that you think about it every moment of every minute of every hour of every day, but if you do, there's still attached to it. We want the effect that that stuff has had to be completely cleared and gone.
[01:18] B: Yeah.
[01:19] A: You mentioned that there's a tendency for you to be what I'm going to call more of a people pleaser over doer and sometimes to the detriment of your own well being that like you'll do all sorts of caretaking, caregiving for others, and then forget to take care of you. We also want that to get adjusted so that the, so to speak, oxygen mask gets put on you first and then you're also free. You mentioned that there's been differences in terms of how you've related to different people. You know that mom, when she was in active addiction, all was psychotic. That was problematic. And even still to this day, you and mom have some stuff. There's a couple brothers that you mentioned that are also in active addiction. One sister that you're.
[02:08] B: They're clean, my brothers, but they are. Yeah, my brother. One owns a. One owns a company and. And they both own companies. One just grad, One just left the service.
[02:19] A: He right, one left military.
[02:21] B: He owns a company.
[02:22] A: One has a little baby.
[02:24] B: Yeah, one has a baby and owns a company. Like a. It's like a handyman company. He owns that in Venice. And the other one lives in Texas. He's still stationed with the army. And they have A company, too.
[02:36] A: Got it. Okay. Okay. So. So.
[02:38] B: But my sister's in bad addiction.
[02:40] A: Sister's in active addiction. That's who it is. So sister has been in active addiction. That's also somewhat challenging. So those are the things, at least that I'm remembering from what we talked about out of what I said. Is there anything that I missed?
[02:57] B: No.
[02:58] A: Okay. Any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know?
[03:05] B: No, I think that's it.
[03:06] A: Okay. Okay. And then the last little component of all that is that there have been, at times, a whole bunch of unwanted emotions, whether they be hurt, anger, sadness, grief, guilt, shame, regret, remorse, anger, pain. And we want to get that stuff adjusted so that it's not weighing on you in the way that it has been. Okay. Yeah. Cool. So this is where we're headed. So what I mentioned to you the last time, just briefly, is a way for us to think about why things continue to trouble and haunt even though they're over. Right. So the example would be if I were to tell you about falling out of a tree when I was 8, and when I fell out of the tree, I broke my leg. If I were to tell you that now, being 48, and I was to get all emotional about it, you would look at me like I'm crazy. His leg is fine.
[04:10] B: Yeah.
[04:10] A: Why is he still hurting? Right. That's a physical injury. When it comes to emotional injury, it's a little bit different.
[04:18] B: Yeah.
[04:19] A: Right. Because if I were to tell you about what my Uncle Matt did to me when I was 8 and I started to get emotional about it, you'd be like, well, yeah, of course.
[04:28] B: Yeah.
[04:28] A: So isn't it weird that we live in this world where we have it that physical wounds over time heal, but emotional wounds don't?
[04:38] B: Yeah.
[04:39] A: Right. But it's not that emotional wounds can't heal. The reason, truly, that they haven't healed yet is because part of the brain doesn't know that the negative experience is over. Logically, where you're bright, reasonable and rational, you totally do know. But there's a whole nother part of your brain that doesn't know. That's why thoughts about it, reminders of it, can trigger the discomfort of it. Makes sense.
[05:13] B: Yeah.
[05:14] A: So what we're going to be doing, that's very different than therapy, which tends to help process and get things out of you. We want to do the reverse. We want to get in the good news to the part of your brain that doesn't know certain things are over. We want that fully integrated inside you so that it's clear and that you're free from that. Right. So that being said, we tend to look at life that it is those circumstances and those things that make me feel this way.
[05:46] B: Yeah.
[05:47] A: So when that thing happened, I felt like this. When I think of that, it makes me feel this way. When I write, it's stuff that causes feelings.
[05:54] B: Yeah.
[05:55] A: We're gonna look at it from a slightly different lens because that one doesn't give us much power.
[06:00] B: Yeah.
[06:00] A: We only have two choices. I either try to change this stuff or I try to avoid this stuff. But you already know there's some stuff I can't change and some stuff I can't completely avoid and then a whole bunch of bad stuff that I can't get to have not happened.
[06:13] B: Yeah.
[06:14] A: So the other example is when a silly one, lion, approaches zebra, we go, lion makes zebra scared.
[06:20] B: Yeah.
[06:21] A: But if we look at it the other lens, we go, no, it's actually the zebra's brain that's making the zebra alert, motivated and strong. We call that scared. But it's doing it as soon as the zebra itself sees senses, feels, smells or thinks that lion is approaching. So from this same lens, we're going to say that there's been ways in which your brain has been working that's been causing you to feel bad. By bad, we're meaning the flashbacks. By bad, we're meaning the negative critical thoughts that you have about you. By bad, we're meaning the unwanted emotions. By bad, we're meaning the reactions that your brain might do it to you in response to stuff past, current, future. You've recognized that way of your brain working has been problematic. And that's the issue that we want to get better. So from this lens, your brain making you feel bad. First question is, do you really think that your brain wants you to feel bad?
[07:25] B: No.
[07:26] A: No, it doesn't want you to feel bad. Do you think it would want you to feel good?
[07:29] B: Yeah.
[07:29] A: No. That's the fucked up. See what we've discovered in working with thousands of different people. You're a bright gal, I'm a bright guy. Most of our brain, though, emotionally works like an animal.
[07:41] B: Do people usually not say, yeah, no.
[07:44] A: That's what they always say. You're right on board. Right. Because we would think that our brain would want us to feel good. But what we've learned is no, the brain actually doesn't give a rat's ass how you feel.
[07:57] B: Got it.
[07:58] A: Not because it's not concerned about your well being, but it's a different Purpose for emotion. See, what we've learned is that the purpose of emotion for animals and human beings is to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. It's that basic.
[08:18] B: Yeah.
[08:19] A: So when a rabbit sees a fox approach, the brain of the rabbit makes it experience fear to get it to run away, not because it wanted it to have a bad day. The squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire. Immediately, the brain causes pain. Not because it wants the squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid, dumb moron and worthless. Because now it's marred and it'll be embarrassed around all the other squirrels. No, simpler. Just get the tail out of the fire. So all of the negative emotions that you and I experience, hurt, anger, sadness, regret, remorse, angst, upset, worry, pain, all that stuff is actually caused by the part of our brain that's working like an animal for the same purpose. To motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. Yes, the error. Many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. It's why. Have you ever noticed that we have a tendency to feel bad about the same kinds of things over and over and over again?
[09:24] B: Yeah.
[09:25] A: Good news. Many of the things that we feel bad about are in time periods that are finished. So we don't need to solve the problem. Instead, we want to update the timing. Timing is the error that malfunctions. And the reason why is we've got another part to our brain, our intellect. And with our intellect, it gives us access to time. Meaning, you know that you're sitting here with me right now. You can remember doing something earlier this morning, and you can think about something that you might go do this weekend. No other animal can do that. None. They're always. Now, that does not create a problem for us human beings when the experiences we go through are either positive or neutral. Because in those two circumstances, our brain distinguishes the difference between the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening. Somebody's telling us about a wonderful trip that they had to Key West. They took their picture next to the sign that said 90 miles from Cuba. They went and, you know, T shirt shopped on Duval Street. They rode the little moped.
[10:46] B: Yeah.
[10:47] A: They tell us about that experience. You and I know that they know the difference between remembering being there and being there. It's crystal clear. But when an experience is negative, and it doesn't matter whether it's a big negative or a little negative, it doesn't matter whether the negative happened a long time ago when I was a young child or just the other day. And it doesn't matter whether it was a one time occurrence or multiple times through many years, any of the negative experiences, the weird, the bad, the sad, the awful, the horrific, the catastrophic, the traumatic.
[11:30] B: So sorry.
[11:30] A: No worries.
[11:31] B: I forgot the stupid thing was on. I apologize.
[11:34] A: Yeah, happens. I do, too. Mine might go off too.
[11:38] B: Sorry. I'm so sorry. I was like, actually in the zone.
[11:44] A: Right. I know, right? You're right. With. Whoa. See, all of those negative experiences get stuck. So the brain will confuse the memory of what happened. Thinking it's happening can cause an emotional reaction in the person. So think of this guy. He's telling us about how 10 years ago when he was on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, he got mugged. Yeah, right. And he gets to the part where the guy has got the gun pointed and now his face has gone completely white, his voice is choked, his arms are trembling and shaking. He's got a tear. We're nice people. We were kindly listening to him. What the fuck is happening with him? And what do people say? He's reliving it. Yeah, but what's actually happening is a different part of his brain, emotionally, is confusing the memory of what happened. Thinking it's happening. And that's why he's having that emotional reaction, which we can tell it's affecting him as he was talking to us, because we see it. Yeah, but here's the thing. It was affecting him even over the weekend when he was playing with his kids. It was under the surface.
[13:06] B: Yeah.
[13:06] A: Logically, up here, the guy knows that he's safe, that he survived, that he's okay, that there's no freaking gun. The problem is there's another part of his brain that never got the good news. Make sense.
[13:22] B: Yeah.
[13:23] A: That's the first component that's keeping all this yucky stuff stuck. Tell the brain we're gonna totally do that. Right. Second thing is, when we're little children, impressionable kids, we are actually lied to by culture and parents because little kids are trained to believe. Disney reinforces it. Books, movies, TV shows reinforce it. That good things happen when we're being good, which is great. I get hugs, I get candy, I get love, I get kisses. Once a year, some dude I don't even know drops gifts off at my house because I'm good. Right. We live in this world that good things happen when I'm good. Which is fantastic. Except if that's what we're training Kids to believe that good happens when I'm good. What also has to be true, Bad.
[14:19] B: Happens when you're bad.
[14:20] A: Right. But is that true?
[14:21] B: No.
[14:22] A: Right. Bad things can happen without you doing anything wrong. But if what I learned first is that bad only happens because I'm bad.
[14:31] B: Yeah.
[14:31] A: Now, if I go through something bad, of course it had something to do with me.
[14:35] B: Yeah.
[14:36] A: Maybe I put myself in that situation.
[14:38] B: That I should have.
[14:39] A: Maybe I should have known better.
[14:40] B: Yeah.
[14:41] A: Maybe it was somehow my fault. Or maybe it happened because I'm not lovable or I'm not good enough, or I'm not smart enough, or I'm not prepared enough. Or maybe I don't wear the right clothes or I don't have the right. So what gets stuck for human beings is that if it's bad, it's my fault. So let me give you a couple examples of what I mean by that. Let's think of this kid. He's, you know, four. When his parents get divorced, dad's no longer around. Kid doesn't recognize that it's a mom and dad issue. Didn't even know that dad might have been abusive or an alcohol. What kid thinks is if I was more lovable, if I mattered to my dad, Daddy would be here. And if I can't even matter to my dad, how can I matter? So it gets stuck somehow about me, right? At 9, dad promised to take him to Disney. And then dad doesn't show up. Now the kid might realize that, you know, on weekends when he sees dad, dad might have a lot of Budweiser both in the recycling and in the fridge. Kid doesn't know at 9 truly what an alcoholic is. He has no idea what a drunken bender is. So he's not thinking to himself, my loser dad is on an alcoholic bender. And that's why he's not going on the trip to the coolest place in the world with me. No. Kid's thinking, see, if I really mattered, if daddy truly loved me, Daddy would be here. So it keeps going back to being about my own lovability, my own worth. Right. Even not getting picked for kickball doesn't go because I'm not good at that game. It goes, oh, nobody likes me. Makes sense.
[16:29] B: Yeah.
[16:30] A: Oh, you just went to your stuff.
[16:31] B: Yeah.
[16:32] A: Yeah. I want you to stay with me.
[16:33] B: Yes.
[16:33] A: Not go there. No, it's okay. But here's the other part I'm gonna tell you when I notice that you're going somewhere other than being with me. I'm gonna do what I can to get you back with me. Yeah, right, because I'm using you.
[16:46] B: Said the kids.
[16:48] A: I know. Yeah. I'm using examples, though, on purpose that aren't about you.
[16:52] B: Yeah, of course.
[16:53] A: The reason I want to do that is because I want us to have a clear understanding before we apply it to anything that's been troubling for you.
[17:00] B: Got it.
[17:01] A: Makes sense. So it's better to learn stuff out here than it is here.
[17:06] B: Done it.
[17:07] A: Right. Different example. Think of this girl. She got a promotion at work. She's 27, so she's super excited. She goes out with co workers. Co workers are celebrating her promotion. Right. One of the co workers had a friend. He seemed to be nice. He bought her a drink. They hit it off. They played darts together, played a little bit of pool. They had a great time. And he said, instead of taking Uber, why don't I just drop you off? You're on my way home. Great.
[17:33] B: Yeah.
[17:33] A: Get in the car with him. He starts driving. Nice guy, had a good conversation. She kind of even a little bit like him, right? He knows that she doesn't live in a great neighborhood. So when he went to drop her off, he's like, let me just walk you to the door, you know? And she's thinking, mose, maybe I'll get a pack kiss. Because you're like, you know, I kind of liked him a little bit. She had no idea that when she went to open her door, he was going to force himself into. And then he raped her. Now that is a horrible fucking experience. But what's worse is what she's telling us when she sees us. Because she says things like, you know what? I am never going to forgive myself for that. We look at her for what? She goes, well, clearly being stupid and careless and putting myself in that bad situation.
[18:17] B: Oh, hell no.
[18:18] A: But notice, because it's bad, it keeps going back to being my fault. Does that make sense?
[18:24] B: Yeah, it does.
[18:25] A: So this stuff gets stuck because that gets layered on. So now we've got bad experience, plus the meaning, which makes me feel worse about me and my own lovability and identity. What is our brain left to do? It's going to be scanning, searching for anything that's similar to anything that was painful, even if it just co occurred and wasn't part of the problem. But it'll constantly be on a super hyper vigilant, sensitive mode. It's why we have flashbacks, right? The guy who's getting gas in his car gets a whiff of the diesel from a truck that just drove by and now he's flashed back to the tank where his buddy got shot.
[19:07] B: Wow.
[19:09] A: Well, the issue when his buddy got shot was not the smell of the diesel. It was his buddy getting shot. But they co Occurred. It got stuck. Right. The soldier dies on the ground when the firework bursts in the air. Not because he doesn't know it's the 4th of July. Yes. Has that firework celebration. He lit the firework. Different level part of his brain confused the sound. Or the guy is making out with the gal, and he's into it, and she's into it, and it's feeling really good. And she touches his inner thigh, and he goes like this. And now he's thinking to himself, what the f is wrong with me? This gal who I'm into, I really like, who's wanting to be intimate with me, that I want to be intimate with, is touching me in a way that should feel good. But I got. Yeah, but is there any similarity to Uncle Mark when he was eight on the thigh? Is it the same hand? No, that was dainty female hand. That was grubby man hand. But hand hand similar enough to get confused. Make sense? Yeah. So when it comes to the troubling experiences, our brain, when they're still active, scans and looks for anything that could be similar that makes sense. And I get triggered by it. And now it's no longer that I'm here with you. It's like I'm back there. Make sense. That's what just happened. As I was describing, stuff about the guy with his kid is it took you back to your own. Yeah, Right. Got it. So even though it was about somebody other than you, it went to there, and they started to have some of those bad feelings. Right. We want to get that all adjusted because the kids are actually better off without you feeling bad. Right. Like guilt as a performer. Enhancer. Doesn't work. Like, we don't want the field goal kicker of our favorite team to be feeling awfully guilty as he's lining up for the game winner. Yeah, that's not a good strategy. Probably not gonna make it then. Right. So that's the thing that we want, is we want you. So those components, by the way, Jen, those are the things that have continued to keep this stuff stuck.
[21:22] B: Yeah.
[21:24] A: They all have one thing in common. It's based in distortion. Because if I take my hand and I slam it in the sand at the. And I pick it up, it does leave an imprint. Yeah, but is the imprint the same thing as my hand?
[21:39] B: No.
[21:40] A: So is the memory the same Thing as the experience. No, no. Right. We want to illuminate that. So your brain reads what happened as data about something that happened versus where it's been stuck as reading it is happening. Right. The meaning isn't at all what happened. Did she put herself in danger? Or did she get a ride home from a friend of a friend? How different is a firework from a grenade? So instead of trying to get it all out, you want to get the good news in to the part of your brain that doesn't know that you made it through really yucky stuff.
[22:26] B: Yeah.
[22:27] A: And that you're here now. And that you're okay. On your way to becoming a better version of you.
[22:32] B: Yes.
[22:33] A: Right. That's what we want fully installed. Does that make sense?
[22:37] B: Yes.
[22:38] A: So therefore the you that I'm seeing. Because notice even when we were talking, thought about your own stuff. But I bet right now, and it won't take a lot, you could think about whatever you need to think about around any of the events stuff, and feel just a little bit of the bad feelings. Right. Notice how it doesn't take a long time. No, no. But this time you did it on purpose because I asked you to do it.
[23:01] B: Yeah.
[23:02] A: That actually wouldn't be a problem if it only happened when you chose to do it.
[23:07] B: Yeah.
[23:08] A: The problem is that your brain does that shit to you at times that you're not choosing. That's the glitch. Therefore, the you that I'm seeing when we're done, this future you, that kind of feeling, this you, she remembers having had it, but if you asked her to get it, she would not. Again, it's been completely cleared and gone. The you that I'm seeing is emotionally present. The you that I'm seeing is a lot lighter and her mind is much quieter. The you that I'm seeing is much more outwardly focused. Focused so that she's experiencing other people's stuff as being about them, not me. The you that I'm seeing is moving through the stressors in her day to day life with much more fluidity and ease. And the you that I'm seeing is free from the effect that the past has had, whether it be shit that happened to her or stuff that she did. So it's no longer Wayne. Meaning the hurt, the anger, the regret, the remorse, the resentments, the pain. Go on.
[24:18] B: Yeah.
[24:18] A: This is the you that I'm seeing. Got it. So my question for you isn't how it's gonna happen that we get you here. My question is, would it be okay with You?
[24:29] B: Yeah.
[24:29] A: Okay, good. So we got a green light. Yeah, Right with it. Okay. Things are already moving. We want to do some processes that are designed like we did the last time, to begin to settle the body. Because one of the things that we've learned is that your body is able to heal on its own. But what causes accelerated healing to happen is when your body is in a state of rest. It's why after surgery or if somebody's got a cold. Cold or even a flu, what do we want them to do?
[25:08] B: Rest.
[25:09] A: Right. So we have those neuroscientifically proven brain levers that are designed to put your body more in states of rest. That first lever is all about slightly lowering your jaw. Second lever, as you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. So just kind of like the tongue touches against the back of the bottom teeth. Yeah. And it just kind of sits there. You don't have to do anything active with it. And then what you do is you slowly breathe in and out in a way that's just a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. Right. And what are you beginning to notice now?
[26:09] B: Tired or tired.
[26:11] A: Uh huh. And see, you don't have to do much with your tongue or even with your mouth because you don't even need to have it open in order to have the jaw lowered and resting the tongue. See, I can do it to demonstrate or I can just lower my jaw and rest my tongue. And I don't even have to have. Both ways are better. Right. The next phase of this is we want to begin to move our awareness into our peripheral vision. One of the things that we've learned is that our brain has a lot of beta wave activity when we're stressed. That we want to move our brain waves into alpha waves, which are more about flow states, being in the zone, more of an alert, but also relaxed state. Makes sense.
[27:07] B: Yeah.
[27:08] A: So how we go about in doing that is again, you slightly lower your. Your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. And again, it's not like sticking it out just like naturally if it was just resting, like you hardly even see it. Right. And then you breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. So it's more of a slightly slow, slower inhale and a little bit of a longer exhale. Right. Just like this. As you're doing it, notice that you can look across and see me. But as you stay looking at me, notice what happens when your peripheral vision begins to expand and you can see my fingers moving out, all the way out and wiggling. Notice how you're aware of my fingers wiggling while you're looking at me. Isn't that interesting that with your peripheral vision, you can notice that? And as you're noticing that, you're becoming more aware of this space in the room, this space that's in between you and me, behind me and behind you underneath and up above. And notice how there's a lot more space that you're aware of now. That's right. As you're doing all of this again, check inside. How's your body feeling now? Yeah. Right. And are you on any kinds of medication?
[28:55] B: Yeah.
[28:55] A: Assist or do you take methadone?
[28:58] B: I take that as a medicine that I'm actually titrating off it right now, which means I'm going down. I'm going to be completely off of it.
[29:06] A: That's cool. Anything else that they put you on? No, just the methadone.
[29:10] B: No. Just methadone.
[29:11] A: Okay. No. Like, anti anxiety or depression or any of that.
[29:15] B: I don't have any of that.
[29:16] A: Cool.
[29:16] B: Yeah.
[29:17] A: Yeah. How often had you gone to the methadone clinic?
[29:20] B: I used to go every day.
[29:22] A: Okay. And once a day or more than once a day. Okay. And they're basically in the process of lowering.
[29:27] B: I'm gonna start going completely off, but right now I'm just titrating. The doctor started me last week.
[29:34] A: Nice.
[29:34] B: Yeah.
[29:35] A: Well, that's pretty.
[29:35] B: I actually felt the difference of going down. I felt, like, a little hot and cold, a little uncomfortable. But it's gonna pass. I want to just be off for you guys. I've done two ago, almost. I graduated a program. I did four months there in Largo, and then I came here. So I did par village, and now I'm in Mercy House, which is a halfway house.
[29:59] A: You did Park Village?
[30:00] B: Yep.
[30:01] A: Wow. Okay. I used to live in Pinellas County. Yeah. So, yeah, I'm familiar with that.
[30:08] B: Yeah. I just did par Village. Yeah. And then I. I came to Mercy House, which is a halfway house here in Brick, writing to.
[30:14] A: Okay.
[30:15] B: You know, I'm actually the only person that's on methadone that's there, and it's not allowed. Methadone is not allowed. But she made an exception with me. And I also am not allowed to tell anybody else that I'm on it. I gotta, like, basically say, like, hey, I'm gonna go grab coffee, and I go. I get my medicine. I come back.
[30:32] A: Yeah.
[30:33] B: But it's because first off, I am gonna be coming off of it completely. But they don't believe even taking any medication.
[30:41] A: Nothing at this particular half. Yeah.
[30:44] B: Well, basically all of them, pretty much.
[30:46] A: Okay.
[30:47] B: They're very pretty much. They're against suboxone and methadone, stuff like that. But methadone really helped me immensely in.
[30:53] A: The beginning of early birthday because you needed some way to transition from what you had been doing, and that's a useful transitional piece. Yeah. Cool. And are you from that area, Pinellas, or are you from Sarasota?
[31:13] B: I'm from Sarasota.
[31:15] A: Okay. You just wound up going to Largo?
[31:18] B: I wanted to go to Park Village. Yeah.
[31:20] A: Nice. Cool. All right. So we're interested in continuing to move our body and brains into the right states for healing.
[31:30] B: Yes.
[31:31] A: And I also want to give you a way of thinking about things. Again, that's going to be a bit unusual, but will be useful for what we're interested in clearing. So think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something that's beautiful, like the moment you're looking at it, you're like the moon. Yeah. And isn't there a moon?
[31:59] B: I'm just gonna come turn it completely off. There you go. We'll turn it on later.
[32:09] A: So aren't there times when you're seeing the moon that you're feeling both a sense of peace and excitement?
[32:18] B: Yes.
[32:19] A: And some people would say to you that seeing the moon. Moon is what's giving you the feelings. But if we looked at it from a different lens, we could say that seeing it and being there is drawing your awareness down and in towards your center. Because at your center, you always are peaceful and excited. In the same way, if there's a campfire and my hands are cloth, and I begin to bring them closer and closer to the flames, and I say, holy cow, Jen, this fire is getting hotter. Is it really that the fire is getting hotter, or is it more accurate to say, I'm becoming more aware of the heat?
[33:07] B: You're becoming more aware of the heat.
[33:09] A: Right. So we know that in your life, there have been many times where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Upsets, anger, stressors, guilt, shames, pains, hurts. But no matter where your awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited.
[33:30] B: Yeah.
[33:31] A: Just like you can tell that there are two of us in here. Well, how do you know? You look around. Your senses bring in the data, your intellect or organizes it. We tend to call that knowledge. Sometimes people call knowledge light. We'll just call it light of knowledge. At your center, there's a brighter light, light of wisdom. So now we've got light of knowledge and we've got light of wisdom. And I remember working, like, I've worked with lots of different people, but one girl in particular, she had a whole bunch of stuff. Stuff that had happened to her, stuff that happened to her body, all sorts of different things. Stuff that happened on the street, like. But when she was a really young child, like five or six, her older brother used to take Matchbox cars, drive them up her leg and park them in her. So she had a lot of around, all of that. And as we worked together, we completely cleared it all. The pain, the hurt, the anger, it's gone. And as she was sitting across from me, I said to her, I go, you know all of that to. I go, where was it? And she looked at me, big glowing smile. She goes, it's gone. I don't feel any of it. I go, I know. Isn't that cool? She said, yeah. I said, but my question was, where was it? And the two of us started thinking. And so I asked her, I go, was it at the surface level? And she's like, no, it wasn't an intellectual thing. I said, oh, well, then maybe it was at your center. And she's like, dude, really, how could that stuff survive? And light, where I'm peaceful and excited? And I said, oh, well, then where was it? And she said, huh? Well, it must have been hiding in the shadows in between the lights. I said, well, what happened? She goes, the lights are now touching, the shadows gone. I said, whoa, that's cool. She said, I know. And then we started talking about our bodies, that most often we walk around thinking that I am this body versus that I have a body. And we think that my body is me, not mine. But if you really thought about it, there's not a single cell within your body today that's the same as it was. All of them have been replaced millions of times. Your feet are longer than they were when you were two. Yet despite those kinds of changes, you're still you. Right? My mom, when she was 19, she lost the tip of her finger.
[35:55] B: Yeah.
[35:55] A: In a snow cone machine accident. When she goes to visit people now, they don't say to her, hey, Susie, I'm glad almost all of you could come over.
[36:03] B: Yeah.
[36:04] A: Because they realize she's all there, even if that part of her body's missing. So let's just say for our purposes today, that you have a body. Your body is totally yours, but it isn't actually you that you have thoughts, but that you're not actually the thinker of your thoughts, your brain is. And your brain is simply an organ, not you. Like your heart and liver and lungs are organs. They're yours, not you. And then we go, well, if I'm not my body and I'm not my thoughts, then maybe I'm my emotions. Except you feel different ways at different times, so you can't possibly be a feeling because there's times that you feel happy, sad, angry, glad, and you're still you. Then we go, well, if I'm not those things, then I must be what I do. But in life, there are lots of things that you've done. And when you stop doing one thing, to do something else. Did you stop existing? No. Leads us to a kind of unusual question. So if you're not what you do, and if you're not your feelings, and if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not your body, then what the heck are you?
[37:22] B: I'm my soul.
[37:24] A: Yes. People refer to it in that way as if it's a thing that I have. But instead of us thinking that it's something you have, let's think of the light at the center as you. Yeah, right. I remember when I was a kid, my mom used to say that prayer with me. It was scary. I don't know if you're. But we would go into bed and, you know, we'd say our prayers and the one that we would end with would be, now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. And she'd kiss me on the forehead, walk to the door. Eternal thought. Light, say, goodnight, sweetie, and shut the door. Of course, I'm now laying in there thinking about my death. Why are we saying this one at the end?
[38:04] B: Yeah.
[38:05] A: So when I got older, I realized that instead of thinking of it as something I have.
[38:10] B: Yeah.
[38:11] A: My fingers and toes are things that I have. Light at the center is me. And the thing about the light at the center is that light, that is you, it can't be touched, hurt or harm.
[38:23] B: Amen.
[38:24] A: Am whole and complete and totally indestructible. And I say all of that because people come in to see me all the time and they screw up. Identity, meaning they think how they feel is who they are. People tell me things like, I'm depressed, I'm anxious, I'm shy, I'm schizoaffective, I'm ocd. They think the Diagnosis or the way they feel is who they are. But if I go to the dentist, right, and I'm really upset when I come out and you go, why are you so upset? I go, you'll never believe what he did. And you go, what'd he do? I said, well, first he put me on this chair, and my head went down and my feet went up. They're like, yeah, you're at the dentist. Well, then he took this light and he shined it right in my eyes. I couldn't see anything. You're like, yeah, you're at the dentist. And I go, well, then he took this cold metal instrument, shoved it right up inside of me. And you're like, oh, my God. Goodness. You're what? I go, jen, my mouth. I'm at the dentist. But it's the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother in the Matchbox Cars. I said, when you were really little, your brother, he messed with your stuff. And she looked at me with that same glowing, peaceful smile. And she said, he did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and it fucked up my feelings. But then she started to say. She goes, but you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body. It screwed up my thinking and feeling, but he never got who I really am. I said, whoa, that is powerful to beginning to understand that the who you really are isn't the body, but is delight at the center. And delight that is, you can't be touched or harmed or hurt. And see, we want to be getting all of that information all the way through. So one more time, slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. As you're breathing in this slightly slower and deeper way, notice you can see me. My fingers move way out. You can see it with your peripheral vision, how they're wiggling. As you notice the space in the room, notice that you can sense more of it, that normally what we see in a place is just objects, but you can sense more space. Now, go ahead and close your eyes, and you'll notice that with your eyes closed, they rest. And as they rest, you can also rest. You're aware of your breath, you're hearing my voice, the background sounds, and how it feels to be seated in the way you are noticing all of that at the same time. Imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body well beyond the ceiling and the Rooftop, so that you're way up above it all in the sky, having what we'll call a bird's eye view, meaning you're able to see things underneath and below you. But just like a bird is free to soar, think of the you way up above, soaring like a bird and flying up above and over it all free to make these big wide turns and curves and arching angles. Soaring, flying, moving all around in all ways and in all directions. That's right. Bring your awareness back down and into your body so that you now reassociate inside you. That's right. And as you're checking in, how's your body feeling now? It is, right? More tense, More calm.
[42:27] B: More calm.
[42:28] A: More calm. Right. And see, as your body's more calm, we're on our way to be doing more healing. And the unconscious part of your mind, which has direct access to the control panels, meaning it knows which buttons to press and knobs to turn and levers to shift and switches to flip to rewire, this part of your mind is already responding to you. It's very interested in working in the ways that are beneficial and best for you. And it's interested in your becoming free from the emotional effect this stuff has had. That's right. So one more time, we're going to do that same process. You can slightly lower your jaw. Just rest the tongue. Yeah, just like that. It's hardly even noticeable. Doesn't take much effort at all to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and longer. Right. Notice as you're breathing in this slightly slower and deeper way, your awareness. That's right. You might find your eyes becoming heavy and want to close. So that when your eyes are close, they rest. And when your eyes rest close, you also rest, aware of your breath, my voice, how it feels to be seated in the way you are, not even paying attention to your big toe and your right foot. But now you can notice that your awareness can shift to different places. And it's absolutely okay to rest with eyes closed, enabling you to drop deeper and deeper and deeper. Down, down, down and inside, towards the light at your center. Calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy. Your unconscious now knows so much more than you on how to heal. It's been doing it your whole life from the inside, inside out. That's right. And see as you rest, eyes rest, close, you rest. Everything that needs to happen is happening now underneath the surface. That's right. That's right. And it might even feel like falling asleep. But what you might not know is that you're unconscious is responding towards the future. You present peaceful, clear, light, free. More and more is ongoingly happening without you having to do anything at all. You might find that it's hard to keep your eyes open. So instead simply allow your eyes to rest close. That's right. Because when eyes rest closed, you also rest. That's right. And as you're resting, you're probably not paying much attention to your right hand or the fingers in your right hand. But you can start to notice. And as you notice, you'll also realize that no matter what you think is happening. That's right. At any one time, there's more going on than that. That's right. And so now go ahead and take a big deep breath in and then a long exhale. One more big deep breath in and then a long exhale. And eyes are open. There we go. Good job again. As you're checking in, how's your body feeling now?
[48:57] B: Much more relaxed.
[48:59] A: It is much more relaxed. Right. And see, you might not notice this, but it's interesting to begin to wonder what happens when you take your hands just like I have mine. So go ahead and take your hands like I have mine, bring them together and focus your eyes between your hands. And then just do slight little tiny, don't let them touch, but just slight little tiny taps towards each other with the palm of the hand and the fingers. Don't let them touch. Just tiny little tabs so that you begin to notice an energy between your hands. That's right. And as you notice an energy between your hands, you can feel the energy beginning to expand. Expand, expanding energy, more and more healing. That's right. There's the movement that's conscious. That's right. And then there's the movement that's not conscious that's happening within the fingers, within those hands. Take a deep breath in. Exhale and close. Close your eyes. Now, with your eyes closed, your hands just drop down, down, down. Right. And again, checking inside. How's your body feeling now?
[50:42] B: Much better.
[50:43] A: It is, right? And as your body's feeling much better, right? And what you're trying to do, which you don't need to do, is trying to keep your eyes open when they want to close. Because when they're closed, they rest. And when your eyes rest closed now, you also rest. That's right. Resting enables your body to drift deeper down, down, down, down and inside side towards a calm and peaceful, easy, flowing energy. That's right. Your unconsciousness is responding towards the future you present clear, peaceful, free. And as your unconscious is responding towards the future you, the other than kind parts of your mind can also scan back through experiences that have happened in your own personal history that were negative ones that happened long, long, long time ago, ones that happened more recent. Your unconscious will begin to group and categorize those negative experiences. And then on its own it's going to travel back down the timeline, pinpoint and bring a particular experience, one that's got strong emotions attached into the light between us for us to unplug and clear healthy effect it's had.
[53:26] B: Yeah.
[53:27] A: So as you and I, Jen, are organizing towards this future you, the other than conscious part travels back, back, back, back and will bring an experience to mind for us to clear. What experience comes to mind now having. Yeah, you got one.
[53:58] B: My mom have a spirit of fear her. So receiving the spirit of fear, like being attacked and claiming that that's, you know, the devil is attacking her. Spiritual things are happening negative. So I want that to be completely cleared that if that's not God gives us, doesn't give a spirit of fear but a power, love and a sound mind and a positive flow to us through.
[54:28] A: So there's a particular time that that experience happened. Yeah, that experience happened. You might have been humbled young to.
[54:39] B: Anywhere from four of.
[54:41] A: Well, let's think of a particular time you might have been how old?
[54:49] B: Six.
[54:50] A: Six. So how we clear something is going to be really, really simple. One, you're going to intend to be here with me emotionally because this is and that isn't. Two, we're working on the mutual goal. Three, on more fun and sucky moments.
[55:04] B: Yeah.
[55:05] A: So second, you're going to tell me just facts, something that happened so it'll go that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened and it's done. Three, if that happened when you were six, there have been other things you've done after that that were more enjoyable than that moment. What's one thing any time from when that happened until yesterday that was more enjoyable than that moment.
[55:23] B: Kneeboarding.
[55:24] A: Kneeboarding. Way more enjoyable. Something else.
[55:27] B: Writing my music.
[55:29] A: Yeah, writing your music. Writing one other thing.
[55:32] B: Spending time with my family.
[55:33] A: Yeah. Spending time with family. So we got spending time with family. We got knee boarding, wet, writing music. All of those moments more enjoyable than the one at six.
[55:40] B: Yeah.
[55:41] A: There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond the moment at 6. So we have good news to get in.
[55:49] B: Yeah.
[55:50] A: So that moment when you were six, when it happened, you might have been where?
[55:53] B: At the house.
[55:54] A: You're at the house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[55:57] B: Daytime.
[55:58] A: Daytime. And you might have been wearing the.
[55:59] B: House up by my bedroom, so.
[56:02] A: Up by your bedroom. Right. Good. And then what might have happened next?
[56:04] B: My mom came from the bathroom.
[56:06] A: So mom came from the bathroom. Good. Right. And then what might happen?
[56:08] B: She was yelling.
[56:09] A: She was screaming and yelling. Right. Good. Then what happened next? Right. Good. Then what happened?
[56:14] B: And then she grabbed us.
[56:16] A: Right, Good. And then what happened next? Grabbed us meaning you and my sister. Right. So she held you tight. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[56:24] B: Then she let us go.
[56:26] A: Right. Good. Then what happened?
[56:29] B: Then I went to the next day. I was scared that night.
[56:32] A: Right. But then what happened? I woke up the next day and that was over. Right. But within that, mom was saying things like, oh, my goodness, demons are taking over. They're coming and attacking me. Right. Good. So then she had held on you, then she let go.
[56:50] B: Yeah.
[56:50] A: She felt better after holding you. Yeah. Right, Good. And then that moment. And then you'd gone to bed. Right. And then that moment was over. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[57:04] B: Yeah.
[57:05] A: Right. Like go kneeboarding. Oh, yeah. Right. Or write your music or hang out with family.
[57:09] B: Yeah.
[57:10] A: Right. So notice as you were remembering that moment, there was some discomfort. Yeah. Right. The discomfort wasn't happening because that was a bad moment.
[57:20] B: Yeah.
[57:20] A: The discomfort was happening because part of your brain was confusing the moment, thinking it's the experience. It was causing the discomfort, trying to motivate you to get that to stop. Good news. It has. So one of the things about memories is we only go from beginning towards end. We never go from end towards beginning.
[57:40] B: Yeah.
[57:40] A: But when you go backwards with a memory, it actually unplugs it. It flattens up the neurons. It takes away the charge.
[57:47] B: Wow.
[57:48] A: So we're gonna go backwards. So we've got, you know, hanging out with family, writing music. We've got kneeboarding. Right. And then you'd woken up. Yeah. Right. And then you'd gone to bed, and then she had let go of you, and then she had grabbed on you and your sister. And then she was saying, there's demons and they're attacking me. And then she had come out of the bathroom, and then you were by your bedroom, and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[58:09] B: Yeah.
[58:10] A: Right. Now, as I go backwards, compared to when you told it to me, forward emotionally, how was it? Right. Because your brain is getting that. It's data about something that happened versus happening.
[58:22] B: Yeah.
[58:23] A: Second, the emotional part of the brain doesn't get logic.
[58:29] B: Yeah.
[58:30] A: It gets patterns of Association. So what I mean by that is the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening are glued together. Okay. But you can remember doing things earlier today that you know you're not doing, but you can remember having done one of them. Like putting your jacket on.
[58:52] B: Yeah.
[58:52] A: Right. You can remember doing it. You can remember where you were when you did it. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your jacket on, and then I went, stop putting in your jacket, you'd look at me and go, but I'm not putting my jacket. Yeah, because you know there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you doing it.
[59:11] B: Yeah.
[59:11] A: It's not the same thing. Right. So you can remember mom doing that. Saying there's all these demons grabbing you and then feeling. You can remember all that happening. Right. You can remember putting your jacket on today.
[59:24] B: Yeah.
[59:25] A: Jen, stop putting on your jacket. Say, I'm not putting on my jacket. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. So you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then stop mom from saying all that stuff. Say mom's not saying that stuff.
[59:34] B: Mom's not saying.
[59:35] A: Well, then you stop putting on your sandals. Say, I'm not putting on my sandals. Well, stop her from grabbing you. Say she's not grabbing you.
[59:40] B: She's not grabbing me.
[59:41] A: Well, then stop it from happening. Say it's not happening.
[59:43] B: It's not happening.
[59:44] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[59:46] B: It no longer exists.
[59:47] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. And again, as you're noticing what's happening to that moment, what do you notice now? It is now there's a last little component. Because at 6, you didn't know what you know now, which that happening had nothing to do with evil spirits and mom even grabbing you and feeling better had nothing to do with it. You were the light and I had to take care of her. What you know now that you didn't know then is that mom was under the influence or at the effect of using. And that one of the side effects of her using was these kinds of psychotic, worrisome thoughts. Right. But see, you didn't know that then. You then thought it was actually devil going into her and that you and your sister are the light that protected her. Right. Notice how as an adult, you know different, don't you?
[61:00] B: Yes.
[61:01] A: Right. Know that that had nothing to do with demons entering us and that you and your sister were not the light that stopped it.
[61:11] B: Yeah.
[61:11] A: That it had everything to do with mom having more of a psychotic break than it did with demons.
[61:19] B: Yes.
[61:20] A: Right. But back then, you didn't know that. No. Right. So now we want to get that news in. Because mom being that way and you and holding you in that going away actually had nothing to do with you. You had everything to do with what was screwed up in Mom. Yeah, but you didn't know that then. So I want you to repeat these four words after me. Here we go. It's. It's not. Not about. About me. Right? It's not. It's not about me. Right. It's not about me. Right. Now, close your eyes. Think back to the younger you back then seeing mom and feeling scared. Let that younger you know that that moment, it's over, finished, complete, defeated. That it no longer exists. Let that younger you know that mom being that way and that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with her having a psychotic break from using that you and your sister weren't the light that stopped. It had everything to do again with mom and whatever was going on with her. So that the younger you get, it's not about me. And I didn't need to rescue or save my mom. And as the younger you realizes it, what do you notice now?
[62:34] B: I feel better.
[62:35] A: Right. Let the younger you know about kneeboarding and writing your music and hanging out with family. Right. And again, as the younger you is getting it, what do you notice now?
[62:46] B: I feel better.
[62:47] A: You do? Right?
[62:49] B: Feel happier.
[62:51] A: Right. Notice how that's not troubling.
[62:54] B: Yeah.
[62:54] A: Isn't that weird?
[62:55] B: Mm.
[62:58] A: But notice how it's different than it was.
[63:01] B: Yeah.
[63:02] A: Right. Your brain is beginning to read it as data about stuff that happened, Meaning it's no longer an active memory. Because as you're thinking about it now, try to get that discomfort. Yeah. Right. Notice how it's not there. Yeah. Right. And notice already that it's different than it's ever been. Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[63:34] B: Yeah.
[63:35] A: Yeah. So again, as we organize towards the future you becoming more present and at peace, the other than conscious part of your brain will travel back through negative experience, experiences in your own history. And again, it's going to narrow, pinpoint, and bring another moment to your awareness for us to clear what comes to mind. Now, getting raped, that would be useful to get better. Right. So how we're going to get that better. Right. Is you're gonna stay here. That one happened about how long ago? A year ago. Okay. And again, when that. What's something that you've done after that that was more enjoyable than that moment.
[64:28] B: Going to A family picnic.
[64:30] A: Yeah. Going to a family picnic. Right. Something else.
[64:34] B: Going to the water with my brothers.
[64:38] A: Nephews. Right. One other thing.
[64:41] B: I went to what you call it, the siest key beach on a drum circle.
[64:49] A: Yeah. Going to the drum circle. All of those moments after that one. Yeah. And way more enjoyable than that one.
[64:55] B: Yeah.
[64:55] A: So again, when that moment happened, you're where.
[64:59] B: Where.
[64:59] A: Where were you when it happened?
[65:01] B: Bradenton.
[65:02] A: So you're in Bradenton. Right. Like in a house? In an apartment?
[65:06] B: Yeah, it's like house. Like in a barn. In a house.
[65:09] A: So you're in a barn?
[65:11] B: I wasn't when I woke up. When I was. Came back, too, I was.
[65:14] A: So you were at the house or you'd gone over there?
[65:18] B: Yeah.
[65:18] A: Right. You got a. You drove over there? Got a ride?
[65:21] B: No. Yeah, he drove.
[65:23] A: Right. So he picked you up from our apartment?
[65:26] B: Me and Brenna's.
[65:28] A: So he picked you guys up from the apartment?
[65:29] B: Yeah.
[65:30] A: Right. Right. Good. And then he drove you over to the house?
[65:32] B: Yeah. We were supposed to go straight somewhere to the hospital, but he didn't. We went to his house.
[65:36] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[65:39] B: She gave me a. He had given her a drink. To give to me.
[65:43] A: Yes.
[65:43] B: To take. I took the drink.
[65:45] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[65:47] B: That's when I was. I went in and out of consciousness. I came back into consciousness.
[65:51] A: Yes.
[65:52] B: I was hurt. I was. My leg. Was they all. When I came back into consciousness, my leg was all wrapped up and I was bleeding and I was hurting and I was shaking.
[66:03] A: Right. Good job. 15 tail. Right. And then what happened next?
[66:07] B: We must have stayed there for like another hour before he took us to Brent. Back to Brenna's house.
[66:13] A: Right. Good job. Good detail.
[66:14] B: And then what happened next was really. She was so scared, and I guess because of what happened to me, that was going to do something to her. She said, no, I'm sorry, Bear. They made me do it. They made me do it. She was crying, hysterical.
[66:29] A: Right, Good. When you got back to the house?
[66:30] B: I just. I was so, like, tired and hurt physically. Because I was hurt really bad. I came off. I was in and out of consciousness.
[66:40] A: Huh? Right.
[66:41] B: I couldn't walk for almost two months.
[66:43] A: Right.
[66:44] B: That's how bad my leg was messed up.
[66:46] A: Right.
[66:46] B: And my back. I thought I went to hospital. I thought my bones were all broke, but they weren't broken.
[66:52] A: Right, Right. And then you went to the hospital?
[66:56] B: No.
[66:57] A: No, you didn't go to the hospital. How did you find out about the Bones not being broken.
[67:01] B: About a week after.
[67:02] A: Oh, you went to the hospital. Yeah. You did go to the hospital.
[67:05] B: Yeah, I did.
[67:05] A: Right.
[67:06] B: But not right away.
[67:07] A: No. And then you realized that they weren't broken.
[67:10] B: Yeah.
[67:10] A: And then about two months later, you're walking.
[67:13] B: Yeah.
[67:13] A: Right. And then you'd gone on the picnic with the family.
[67:18] B: Yeah.
[67:19] A: And down to the water.
[67:20] B: Yeah.
[67:20] A: Right, Right. So again, as you're recalling that, notice that there was discomfort. Right. Discomfort's not there because of what happened. Discomfort's there because part of the brain doesn't fully know that what happened is over and that you're okay. Right. We want to be getting that news in to the part of the brain that doesn't fully know. So again, we go backwards. So we got being at the water. Right. We got going on the family picnic.
[68:04] B: Yeah.
[68:05] A: Right. Then you found out that things weren't broken. Then you'd gone to the hospital, and then you were back at Brenna's house.
[68:14] B: Yeah.
[68:14] A: Right. And then she was all upset, saying so sorry.
[68:18] B: Yeah.
[68:19] A: Right. And then you guys got dropped off there.
[68:21] B: Yeah.
[68:21] A: And then you kind of came to with your leg bandaged up. Right. And then they had done stuff to your body.
[68:28] B: Yeah.
[68:28] A: Right. And then you had got into that house. Right. Then they'd given you the shot, the drink. Right. Then they were driving you over and then they picked you up. Yeah. And then before that, you and her were doing whatever you're doing.
[68:43] B: Yeah.
[68:43] A: Right. As I went backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[68:49] B: Nice.
[68:49] A: Bad. Right. Because your brain is beginning to get that. It's data.
[68:54] B: Yeah.
[68:55] A: You can remember that happening. You can remember your leg being hurt. You can remember putting your pants on today. Jen, stop putting in your pants. Say, I'm not putting in my pants. Well, stop your leg from getting hurt. My leg's not getting hurt. Well, you stop drinking the drink. Say, I'm not drinking the drink. Well, stop me from putting on my jeans. Say you're not putting on your jeans will stop me from putting on my shirt.
[69:22] B: You're not putting your shirt on.
[69:24] A: Well, stop them from doing that to your body. Say they're not doing that to my body.
[69:26] B: I'm not doing that to my body.
[69:27] A: Well, then stop that from happening. Say it's not happening.
[69:29] B: It's not happening.
[69:30] A: Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[69:33] B: It no longer exists.
[69:34] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to be getting in. Right. And again, as that's happening, what are you noticing now?
[69:42] B: Feeling better.
[69:43] A: You are. Right. Because there's no part of your body now, that's the same as it was then. No, no, it's all been replaced. That's right. See, I'm wondering what happens when you begin to realize that they messed with your stuff, but they didn't actually get you because who you are can't be touched in that way. Right. Isn't that interesting?
[70:12] B: Yes.
[70:14] A: So you can remember all that happening? You can remember putting your jacket on?
[70:19] B: Yes.
[70:20] A: Stop putting on your jacket. Say, I'm not putting on my jacket.
[70:23] B: I'm not putting on my jacket.
[70:24] A: Well, then stop that from happening. Say it's not happening.
[70:27] B: It's not happening.
[70:28] A: So then where is it? Say no longer exists.
[70:29] B: It no longer exists. Right.
[70:32] A: Which is what we're wanting to get in to the part of your brain that doesn't fully know tattoo. Right. And as you're checking in with your body right now, what do you notice?
[70:53] B: I'm more in line.
[70:56] A: You are. Now close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You let her know that that's over, finished, that it no longer exists. Let that you know that you're okay, clean, clear, on your way to becoming an even better version of you. Let that you know who is really scared that bones are broken. She wouldn't be able to walk. Let her know that you're walking now and that you're okay. Right. As all of this is getting in, what are you noticing now?
[71:33] B: Feeling a little bit better.
[71:35] A: Yeah. Right? Yeah. So things are getting in at different levels. Right. What's happening now?
[72:08] B: Just relaxing.
[72:10] A: You are. Which is interesting that you're relaxing even though you're thinking about really yucky stuff.
[72:20] B: Yeah.
[72:20] A: Isn't that weird?
[72:21] B: Yeah.
[72:22] A: Right. So again, remember that happening?
[72:27] B: Yeah.
[72:28] A: Try to get the bad feelings. They're not there.
[72:37] B: No.
[72:38] A: Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[72:40] B: Yeah.
[72:41] A: Yeah. So all sorts of healing is happening.
[72:45] B: Yeah.
[72:46] A: We've already done two. We want to do even more. Because where we're headed is all about rewiring the way your brain naturally and automatically responds and reacts to stuff.
[73:04] B: Yeah.
[73:05] A: That's what we want. We want you to be more free, more present, more okay. More comfortable in your own skin. Right?
[73:24] B: Yeah.
[73:25] A: Right. So again, go ahead and begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper so that your exhale becomes slightly longer, longer than the inhale. You can rest with your eyes closed so that as they're closed, your eyes also rest as your unconscious is responding towards the future Yin on becoming more and more okay from the inside out. As your eyes are closed already, put your body in States of alpha waves. Alpha waves allow body and mind to be in flow, to accelerate healing, and to move towards deeper and deeper levels of brain plasticity. Right. What are you noticing now?
[74:51] B: I'm lining myself back up.
[74:53] A: You are?
[74:54] B: Yeah.
[74:55] A: Mm. That's right.
[74:58] B: So I can release some more bad stuff.
[75:01] A: We're on our way. Right. What's another moment that comes to mind that would be useful for us to clear? Whether it be things that. That you've done or things that have happened to you?
[75:26] B: Not being able to be with my girls, my daughters, not being able to be with them.
[75:34] A: What's the experience that comes to mind? So as you're thinking, my baby saying.
[75:43] B: To me, oh, mama, I miss you. I want to come home with. And me having to say, no, I can't, baby.
[75:56] A: Yeah. So again, get here. That happened about how long ago?
[76:07] B: Two years ago.
[76:08] A: Huh. Right. And when that happened your way where?
[76:16] B: At Livingston's.
[76:18] A: So you're at Livingston's and you had been with them.
[76:23] B: I saw her there.
[76:24] A: Right. So you had gone in there. Right. And she was with Lara. Right. So you had walked in there. You had seen her. She's with Laura.
[76:39] B: She ran up to me.
[76:40] A: She ran up to you. Right.
[76:43] B: Hugging her.
[76:44] A: And you're hugging her. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[76:47] B: She goes, mommy, I knew you loved me and you wanted to see me. They told me you didn't want to see me. And I said, no, that's a lie.
[76:55] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next? And be here. Hi.
[76:59] B: Hi. I hugged her.
[77:02] A: You did?
[77:02] B: I don't. I don't even know what to talk about. This is ruining my thing. I was. Was doing good, so I want.
[77:07] A: I don't know whether it's ruining your thing.
[77:09] B: Yeah. I don't want this to ruin because I was doing.
[77:11] A: How can it ruin it?
[77:12] B: I don't know.
[77:13] A: It's not.
[77:14] B: Because I'm getting really upset, so.
[77:16] A: No, but see this. You're getting really upset. Yeah. This isn't ruining where we're headed.
[77:26] B: Okay.
[77:27] A: We want to move through this. So she said all that? Yeah. You said it's not true that you did not want to see her.
[77:34] B: You said, I want to see you. Or, you know, listen to what they say. You have to stay up.
[77:40] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[77:43] B: Then she had to leave.
[77:45] A: She said, mommy, I want to come home with you.
[77:47] B: Should. Mommy, I want to come with this.
[77:50] A: Right. And then you said, no, you can't.
[77:53] B: Yeah.
[77:54] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[77:55] B: She left with Laura.
[77:57] A: Right. And then that moment was over. Right. And then later on you did something that was more fun.
[78:05] B: No, I smoked crack that night.
[78:07] A: Well, later on you did something that was more fun. Like, you know, go on the family picnic or go down to the water. Right. Or work on your music.
[78:18] B: Yeah.
[78:18] A: Right. Now again, notice as you were recalling that there was all the discomfort.
[78:23] B: Yeah.
[78:23] A: Again, not because that was such a sucky moment, even though it was. It's because your brain is confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience.
[78:35] B: Yeah.
[78:36] A: It's causing the discomfort to try to motivate you to get that moment to stop.
[78:41] B: Yeah.
[78:42] A: Good news, it has. And again, we never go backwards, but when we do, it'll flatten it out. So we've got being by the water, we've got going on the family picnic.
[78:52] B: Yeah.
[78:53] A: Right. And then you had left Livingston's and then she had left Livingston's. And then you said, no, you couldn't come over. And then she said, well, I thought you didn't ever want to see me. And then she ran over. And then you had gone into Livingston's. And then before that you were doing whatever you were doing. And as it goes backwards again, compared to forward emotionally, how was it.
[79:18] B: Upsetting?
[79:20] A: Same. More or less.
[79:21] B: Less.
[79:22] A: It was less upsetting. You can remember that happening and her saying all that? You can remember putting your sandals on.
[79:29] B: Yeah.
[79:30] A: Ken, stop putting on your sandals.
[79:32] B: Not putting them on.
[79:33] A: Well, stop putting on your jacket.
[79:34] B: I don't have a jacket.
[79:36] A: This shirt. Stop putting on your shirt.
[79:40] B: No.
[79:40] A: Say I'm not putting on my shirt. Stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you're not putting on your shirt. Stop me from putting on my shoes.
[79:48] B: No putting on.
[79:49] A: Right, we'll stop her from saying that. Say she's not saying we'll stop that from happening. Say it's not happening.
[79:54] B: It's not happening.
[79:55] A: Right. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[79:57] B: No longer exists.
[79:58] A: Right. Which is what we want to get in, by the way. You doing that meaning telling her she couldn't come with you.
[80:04] B: Yeah.
[80:05] A: Did that have anything to do with your lack of love? No, no, it actually had everything to do with your love. Because then you knew you weren't in the right space to have her with you. Right. So in doing that, you are all about having her be in a better environment for her than the one at that time that you were able to provide. That's right. So what's happening now?
[80:49] B: I'm upset about it.
[80:51] A: Uh huh. That you had your daughter be in a better environment. I missed that. Yes. I Follow you with that?
[81:03] B: Yeah, I was just.
[81:06] A: But what's upsetting about when you're in active addiction, having your kid live with somebody who's not?
[81:12] B: No, not that. The fact that I'm clean now and I'm doing the right things, and I just wish I was able to do it. Wish I didn't mess up when I did. And I just wish.
[81:26] A: I.
[81:29] B: Just wish it was different. But it's not.
[81:32] A: Okay. So let me check. The thing that's troubling you now isn't what happened, but is thinking that it shouldn't have happened. Yeah, got it. So would it be okay for you to be okay even though that wasn't?
[81:57] B: Yes, it should be.
[81:59] A: Well, I don't know whether you should or shouldn't, but I'm just checking.
[82:03] B: Yeah.
[82:03] A: See? Would it be okay for you to feel okay even though that happening wasn't okay?
[82:10] B: Yes.
[82:11] A: Right. If you're okay now, does that in any way, shape or form mean that what happened then was okay?
[82:19] B: No.
[82:20] A: Right. So you get to be okay even though that wasn't.
[82:24] B: Yeah.
[82:25] A: Right. You're being in active addiction or quote, unquote, messing up. Does that have anything to do with your lack of love for your kids?
[82:34] B: No.
[82:35] A: Right. It had everything to do with being in active addiction.
[82:42] B: Yeah.
[82:43] A: Right. What's better for your kids?
[82:50] B: I would say.
[82:51] A: Right.
[82:51] B: I would say me and Laura, that's what was best for them, right?
[82:55] A: Yes. Because you grew up with a mom at times who was in active addiction. How good was that for you?
[83:02] B: Not good.
[83:04] A: Right. So one of the things that we want to be getting is out of your love for your kids, you put them in a better environment, not because you don't care about them, but because you do. Right. Meaning you weren't being selfish. You are being selfless. And knowing that I'm not in the right mind state to be the mom that I'd want to be for them then, and I'm okay with them being in a better environment for them. Right. We don't have to like that that happened, but what we want to be getting in at a different level is you're becoming more okay. Because, check it out. Was that a selfish or selfless act?
[84:20] B: Selfless.
[84:21] A: Right. And you wouldn't want to start to feel good about that. No. That your kids matter so much to you that you'll go missing them in order for them to be in a better environment for them. Right. Like, how cool is that? Not that it makes it easy, but that's all about your caring about them.
[84:50] B: Yeah.
[84:51] A: Right. Because at that time, you were not in the right place. Right. You didn't wake up one day and go, you know what I'd really like? I'd like to be an active addiction. You know what would be really, really cool? Like, you know, to relapse and go into active addiction. That was not game plan. Follow me with that.
[85:20] B: Yeah, right.
[85:24] A: Right. So let's just check now the thing that's troubling you about that happening, because I don't want to understand it from how I would feel if I were you. I want to. To get what's actually happening over with you. The thing that's troubling you right now about that happening then is what?
[85:54] B: I want to be their mom.
[85:56] A: I miss being with them.
[85:58] B: I love them so much. And the right thing was for me to do what I did. And they're having a better life than I am. They're having an amazing life right now. And.
[86:09] A: Right.
[86:11] B: I just. I need to be able to be the best mom that I can be now that when they do, they can come back in my life. I'll be able to be there for them. You know what I mean? I need to do be that I need to be good to myself at this point, and I need to be the best mom that I could be for them. Like, I need to. If I can't take care of myself, I'm not going to ever take care of them anyway. You know what I mean? If I can't treat myself.
[86:45] A: Yeah. So I'm wondering what it would be like for you to lighten up on the earlier you.
[86:50] B: Yeah.
[86:53] A: Because that earlier you, when she saw her there, was feeling really bad about herself. So much so that she went and used crack that night. So now remember what I said about somebody, the favorite field goal kicker, favorite team, we don't want him feeling bad because that doesn't improve performance. Performance. You're feeling guilty that you weren't a present and around mom for your daughter in that moment. Your guilt didn't improve your performance. It actually contributed and led you to do it. Got it. Yeah. Right. So I wonder what it would be like to see things in the light and lighten up on you because you did that. Not because you don't care about her, but because you do. That's the sole purpose. Right. Right. And I wonder what it would be like to become more okay in you.
[88:24] B: Yeah.
[88:25] A: More at peace with you. Right. Realizing that you're on your way. Right. It's part of the reason that you're titrating down from Methadone, which was a useful transition to get away from the heavy duty using. Yeah. That you had been doing. Right. So if we look at where you were.
[89:00] B: Yeah.
[89:01] A: To where you are right now.
[89:03] B: Yeah.
[89:03] A: Right. And yes, we know where you're headed. But we sometimes want to look back from where I was to where I am now, on my way to becoming a better version of me and see what wasn't being included in that moment because all that was going on is how shitty of a mom I am, that my daughter's hurting, that she can't be with me. But see what your daughter didn't know because how old was she then?
[89:42] B: She was only three.
[89:45] A: Right. And do three year olds know a lot about what it's like to have parents in active addiction?
[89:51] B: No.
[89:52] A: No. And what other things you might have had to do to be able to use. Right. So your selfless act is all about your love for her. Right. And what would happen right now if you started to feel good about being selfless, that you couldn't get you in a better environment in that moment, but you damn well made sure she is right with somebody that you knew was better and able to better provide than you were then. And is your daughter better off with you feeling bad that you weren't there for her then? Is she better off with you feeling bad? Is your feeling bad gonna help her at all? No. So what would it be like right now if you were to lighten up on that earlier? You having her realize she did what was right by her kid, even though that was really hard for you. Right. And it has been hard for you. But what would it be like for you to lighten up, realizing that you did what was right by your kid? That's right. That's right. And as you begin to get it that you did what was right by your kid, even though it was really hard for you, what's happening now.
[92:17] B: Calming down.
[92:18] A: You are right. Because we want to see it clearly. Because we also recognize that you're feeling bad led you to do crack that night. Right. Right. And I wonder what happened when that you back then who was feeling really bad gets to see the you now. Yeah. And how much you're positively changing your life.
[92:56] B: Yes.
[92:58] A: Right. How far you've already come?
[93:02] B: I have.
[93:03] A: That's right. So what happens as you close your eyes, thinking back to that earlier you letting her know that that moment's over, finished, completed, that it no longer exists, that you did what was right by your kin so that she. She gets it, even though it was hard for you and let that. You know who was in active addiction then, how far you've come now. Right. Let her know about her music. Let her know. Right. And as that earlier you is getting it, when it. What do you notice now?
[93:56] B: Notice that I'm letting a lot of other anxiety go.
[94:06] A: How so?
[94:07] B: Letting a lot of other worries or stressors and I'm just putting them in a pile.
[94:14] A: What are the other stressors.
[94:19] B: Of holding on to? Resentments of myself. Things that I would tell myself because I made certain mistakes that I would never be able to achieve. The dreams that I really wanted to like my music and ministering and doing certain things. And because of my record, because of my charges and some things I got that I'm not gonna be able to reach where I want to go. But that's a lie from the devil. I want to take those lies and put them in a furnace.
[94:54] A: So what's something that you've been thinking about that you did, that you've been thinking that by having done it, it's perfect. Preventing me from reaching.
[95:10] B: Just me just getting felonies in general. Just. That's just a thought.
[95:15] A: Wait, how so what felony I've had like I've.
[95:19] B: I've had like 40 or like I think 30, 25 felonies. I don't know, a lot felonies because that. Emotionally Dispossessions, drugs. Really. Possessions of cocaine possession. But those charges caused me to have like it to cause shame and guilt towards my family and stuff like that. That's what I meant.
[95:42] A: Yeah. So what about right now?
[95:45] B: What about right now?
[95:46] A: Yeah. So as you think about, you know, having gotten arrested for possession.
[95:52] B: Yeah.
[95:54] A: As you're thinking about it right now, what do you notice?
[95:58] B: It doesn't bother me that much.
[96:01] A: So it's a little.
[96:02] B: Yeah.
[96:03] A: What's the part that's bothering you?
[96:08] B: That part? Sometimes when I think about that, that's just about that I have these charges and that I've made these choice in the past that I used. Every time that I try to get clean, I get clean, but then I mess up. Just like when I thought about what happened with my daughter. Then I said smoke crack. I had that horrible feeling like if that feeling comes like that, that's when I do stuff like smoke crack or something like that. When I feel so bad like that. Like I was feeling about my daughter and I was crying like that. That's that feeling I got. That's when I use. Like that when I feel that horrible feeling like I was feeling. Now I'm Okay, I'm feeling a little better.
[96:47] A: But I'm saying try to get that horrible feeling now.
[96:57] B: Can't really get it saying no.
[96:59] A: Isn't that interesting? So where you were thinking what we were doing is ruining. It had nothing to do with ruining at all. Yeah, Everything to do with forwarding. Right. So there's a little. As it thinks about having gotten felony.
[97:26] B: It actually works. Good.
[97:31] A: So there's still a little bit of discomfort, though. So the question that I have, is that coming from that happening or is it coming from the thought that it shouldn't have happened, meaning I shouldn't have messed up or I shouldn't have gotten the felony or I shouldn't have? Right. So now we want to get that cleared.
[97:54] B: Yeah.
[97:56] A: Our brain makes us feel bad, remember?
[97:59] B: Yeah.
[98:00] A: Either A, to try to get us to do something, get something to stop, or solve a problem. That's the purpose. Right. When our brain realizes one of two things. Either A, the experience no longer exists, stops causing the feeling, or B, that there's nothing to be done, it stops causing the feeling. So I'm going to give you a different example than your situation again, so we can see it more clearly over here. Let's think of this guy. A year ago, his brother had asked him to go on a motorcycle ride, and he didn't go and his brother died.
[98:44] B: Wow.
[98:45] A: So now he's feeling horribly guilty and he's actually thinking he's feeling guilty because he should have gone on the ride. But in actuality, Jen, he's not feeling guilty because he should have gone on the ride. He's feeling guilty because intellectually up here, he can conceive of having gone on the ride. And because he can think it, his emotional brain goes, well, if you can think it, that means we could do it.
[99:19] B: Yeah.
[99:19] A: Because the emotional brain works like an animal. And an animal can only think about doing things that it can actually do. So if an animal can't do it, it can't even think it make sense. So animals like dogs can't climb trees and they're not depressed because they don't think they should be able to do it. Porcupines aren't trying to develop hang gliders to fly because if they can't do it, they can't even think it. So the error that's happening is he can conceive of having gone on the ride. And if he had, his brother would still be alive. That would be better. So his emotional brain is going, well, hurry, go on the ride with your brother. What are you waiting for? But can he do it? Can he actually go on the ride a year ago? No, because that experience is already over. So when the brain realizes that there's nothing to be done, it stops causing the feeling. So I'm simply going to say to you, well, then stop getting that possession charge. Hurry. And you're going to go, well, there's nothing to be done.
[100:35] B: I allow that possession.
[100:36] A: Well, say there's nothing to be done.
[100:38] B: Nothing to be done.
[100:39] A: Well, then stop getting that felony. Quick. Say there's nothing to be done. Well, hurry, let's go. Let's stop doing it. Quick. Hurry. Say there's nothing to be done. Come on, we'll go together. Come on, let's go.
[100:47] B: We're not going.
[100:48] A: Say there's nothing to be done.
[100:49] B: There's nothing to go.
[100:50] A: Why? Because that experience no longer exists.
[100:53] B: Yeah.
[100:54] A: Right. And again, as you're getting it, what do you notice happening?
[100:58] B: It's disappearing.
[101:00] A: It is. Right? Because we know that you're going to do much better being present and more. Okay, yeah. Your brain hasn't been making you feel bad about that happening because it was bad. It's been causing you to feel bad because you can conceive of that having not happened. So your brain then, because that would be better, is trying to motivate you to get it to not happen. Hurry. The timing is just fucked up. The timing is fucked up because we can't get you to have not done that. Then the timing is over. So if I said to you, you know, we'll stop getting the felony in 2006, you'd go, well, there's nothing to be done. Well, stop getting it in 2010. Nothing to be. Stop getting it in 2015. Nothing to be done. Why? Because it no longer exists. Right. What's not being included in those moments is what you're doing now. Right. Is the positive changes that you're making now for you. Right. Check it out, how different things are now. How did you get to the place to decide that you wanted to go to par?
[102:27] B: My mom had talked to me about it, and I decided that I wanted to do residential, too.
[102:33] A: What had happened before your mom started talking to you about it? How did you get to the position of, you know what, I need to do something about this?
[102:40] B: Well, my core, I was starting to use pretty heavy. My mom was concerned, my family was concerned. I just couldn't stop. Like, I would try, but I was not. I was still. I ended up going to par. Started going to par, and I had a warrant at the time for title of Court because I had left the program and I decided that I was going to go into Par Village not knowing what would happen to the court. So maybe I would have to go back to jail. Maybe I wouldn't. I went in and when I went in, they said because I. I turned myself into a rehab, they took my warrant away and they gave me that. Let me do the rehab.
[103:28] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[103:29] B: And then I completed it.
[103:31] A: Yeah.
[103:31] B: And then I came here to. Right, Mercia.
[103:35] A: And you're still in Thailand.
[103:37] B: Yeah.
[103:38] A: Which is all about helping to get rid of felonies.
[103:44] B: Yeah. And they also help you rebuild your life.
[103:47] A: They do.
[103:48] B: Yeah.
[103:49] A: Right.
[103:50] B: They help you even get your teeth done and everything.
[103:52] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[103:54] B: Yeah.
[103:55] A: Yeah.
[103:57] B: I just need a little bit of A little one that here that my teeth will look. They look really good now, but they'll eat. Look even better.
[104:05] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[104:07] B: Yeah.
[104:08] A: Yeah. So you're on your way?
[104:11] B: Yes, I got a job. I start tomorrow.
[104:13] A: Where?
[104:14] B: I'm working at Kiki's.
[104:16] A: Cool. Breakfast.
[104:19] B: Yeah, breakfast place. It's good, you know, it's good money. I'm a great server.
[104:24] A: Yeah.
[104:25] B: But it's humbling to go to a breakfast place. I did. I did get the job at Buffalo Wild Wings too, but my sponsor doesn't think I should go there, so. Said it's too much of a party scene. So I got the job at Kiki's too.
[104:40] A: Yeah, they start tomorrow. What's humbling about it for me.
[104:46] B: Yeah, I guess working in like a breakfast place like that. I don't know.
[104:53] A: Yeah, but what about working in a breakfast place is humbling?
[104:59] B: It's just humbling to work into it. Like, go from working like fine dining or. I was working at Michaels on East Columbia and like, I was running like Saddlemeyer is like a. Probably like a 10, 10 survey for tables and section and just. It's just different. Humbling. It's gonna be like all breakfast stuff. It's probably. I. I don't know. I haven't worked there yet. I just went in one time. It seems like it would be humbling. That's all.
[105:32] A: Humbling. Because it's not as prestigious as working at.
[105:37] B: I. I guess humbling in general compared to not having to do that type of work. You know, I've been doing crazy stuff. Stuff and, you know, my addiction and what I was doing and for, you know, just, you know, for a long time doing stuff that crazy stuff, you know.
[105:58] A: What was crazy stuff that you were doing?
[106:00] B: Oh, like, I was doing massage and even Regular, regular massage. Like not sexual massage. Making like 150 for a half hour regular massage. I mean, that's like insane. It was my mom. Mom's clientele that was from massage from home. Real massage therapy. But there were also when we're in the place that people were trying to do other stuff than that besides that. So you know what I mean? That's when I like, I won't do any type of massage now. Like I've been have people that have texted me and I don't at all do any massage. Nothing. I don't go around those type of people and I don't associate my self with that lifestyle anymore.
[106:42] A: Okay. So humbling in that you'll make less money. Yeah, I see.
[106:48] B: Yeah.
[106:49] A: Okay. Because when you were doing massage, you made more money.
[106:54] B: Yeah.
[106:55] A: The problem with having done massage is that sometimes it wasn't massage on the up and up. What? It wasn't massage on the up and up, meaning sometimes it was massage for other kinds of massage. Oh.
[107:11] B: When. When I was on drugs and that's why I got charges years ago. Yeah. So. But that's. I. I just meant it's a humbling. It's like a breakfast place. It's humbling. That's all I meant.
[107:23] A: Yeah. Well, I again, I. I go. I don't know anything about a breakfast place. That would be humbling. The humbling part goes, I'm not making the kind of money or it's not as prestigious.
[107:36] B: Yeah, basically.
[107:39] A: Except it is a different place.
[107:44] B: Yeah.
[107:45] A: Right. Like First Watch is different than Waffle House.
[107:49] B: Yeah.
[107:52] A: Right.
[107:53] B: Yeah.
[107:54] A: Right. First Watch Kiki's is different. Different than Denny's.
[107:58] B: Yeah.
[107:59] A: Oh, yeah. Right. So in terms of the world of.
[108:03] B: World of breakfast, it's a good place.
[108:06] A: Yeah, it is. And most of the time breakfast stuff tends to be less pricey.
[108:13] B: Yeah.
[108:14] A: Than dinner. Right. But also people move through breakfast stuff faster. That's true. Then dinner. And those kinds of places like Kiki's and First Watch are not like Denny's. Yeah, no, I know. Right, Right. And it's a better place for you right now than a Buffalo Wild Wings. Yeah, right. I know. Yeah. Yeah. So it's the steps that you're taking in many different ways to improve your life and put you in the right position.
[108:57] B: Yes.
[108:58] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[109:00] B: Yeah.
[109:05] A: Yeah. So I want you to check back in. I want you to think about seeing daughter at Livingston's.
[109:12] B: Okay.
[109:12] A: And what do you notice now?
[109:16] B: She looks beautiful.
[109:18] A: Yeah. What are you noticing in you right now?
[109:22] B: That I can be calm Thinking about it.
[109:25] A: Right, Right. Because you did the biggest gift for your kid, even though it was really hard for. Right. And she's gonna be better off with a mom who's fully clean and clear. Don't you think? What's happening now?
[109:58] B: Sad again.
[109:59] A: Uh huh. But the sad is about what?
[110:06] B: Oh, I just love her.
[110:09] A: So what's sad about loving her?
[110:14] B: Because she's not that she's gonna be with Laura. Laura is gonna be like her mantra and sad because I wish it could have been me. But the right thing to do for her was what I did.
[110:34] A: Right. So the sad again, I'm gonna give you this. The sad is not coming because of what happened. It's coming from the thought that it could have been different. And because you can conceive of that, your emotional brain is trying to motivate you to get that to happen. It's not actually causing you to feel sad because it wants you to be sad. That's why I say, what about loving her is sad? There's nothing about loving her that's sad. The thing that you've been feeling sad about is that I'm not doing mom with her. Follow me with that. Yeah, but your sadness is not coming because you're not doing mom with her. It's coming because you can conceive of doing mom with her.
[111:51] B: Yeah.
[111:52] A: And therefore your emotional brain is going, well, hurry, do it. When your brain gets that there's nothing to be done. Right. Your daughter doesn't not know you even if she's living with another mom. Right. And later on in life. Right. Because it was a formal adoption, so you don't have quote unquote parental rights. Right. But it's more of an open.
[112:32] B: Yeah.
[112:33] A: Right. So that you get access to knowing how she's doing.
[112:39] B: I haven't yet. Hopefully will soon.
[112:42] A: Right. Well, I mean, you've been in active addiction for a little while and now you're getting yourself clean. So we have to look at it more so that we're on our way. Yeah. Does that make sense?
[112:58] B: Yep.
[113:00] A: But the sadness is trying to motivate you to stop being an active addiction through three years ago. Hurry. The timing is screwed up. Right. Right. So if I said to you, we'll stop using two years ago quick, you'd say, well, there's nothing to be done.
[113:23] B: Yeah.
[113:24] A: Right. So say that there's nothing to be done. Jen, Hurry. Stop using two years ago. What are you waiting for?
[113:29] B: There's doesn't even.
[113:30] A: No, come on, stop doing that. Hurry.
[113:32] B: Say there's nothing to Be done.
[113:34] A: Why? Cuz that experience no longer exists. Right. And what we're interested in is you being okay in you. Right at peace with the things you did. Because based on the situation and circumstance, you did right by your kid. Yeah. Right. And again, what would it be like to start to feel good that you did right by your kid?
[114:06] B: Yeah.
[114:07] A: Right. And that's because of how much you love her. Right. And what's happening now?
[114:21] B: Now starting to try to get upset again. And I'm not letting it.
[114:25] A: I'm not doing it. What are you getting upset about now?
[114:33] B: Just miss my girls.
[114:34] A: Mm. So what's the thing that you're saying to you? Cause here's the. Here's the thing. Right. Why am I harping on this right now? Do you know?
[114:46] B: No.
[114:48] A: Well, one of the things is the mechanism of you starting to feel really shitty. Where you get that pit in your stomach is the trigger that has you use.
[114:57] B: Yeah.
[114:59] A: So what do we want to disable trigger? The thing that starts having you feel shitty inside.
[115:05] B: Yeah.
[115:06] A: Because they think you're really hard on you right from here. You're angry at the earlier you for having fucked up and used, and therefore it's preventing you from being with them. Right. You're doing lots of time traveling in your mind and you're coming up with all sorts of things and times that thinking it could have been different than it was or it should have been different. We are really more interested in you being okay. You're being okay doesn't mean that what happened was. But we're really interested in your being okay so that you get to be more at peace with what you did. See, if you're more at peace with what you did, does that in any way, shape or form mean that you don't love them?
[116:19] B: No.
[116:21] A: Right, right, right. And see, what you've learned how to do in life is try to avoid feeling bad or thinking about things that make me feel bad.
[116:48] B: Yeah.
[116:49] A: Right. So when you think about that my kids aren't with me, I feel bad because then I feel like a shitty mom. Except based on what was going on with you at that time, you were a great mom because you put them in an environment that was better for them. A shitty mom would have been the mom that would be grabbing you and your sister while in active addiction, preventing the demons from attacking her. That made you feel overly responsible for making sure that you have to take care of your mom at 6. You follow me with that?
[117:35] B: Yeah, I do.
[117:38] A: That's not what you did. You were in the midst of active addiction. And you have your kids with a person that's better, that was more emotionally stable at the time, that was able to provide a more safe, warm, nurturing, supportive environment. So even though that was hard for you, you did right by your kids. And see. What about that doesn't feel good? What about you doing right by your kids doesn't feel good.
[118:32] B: It doesn't.
[118:34] A: Well, that part feels fine. What's happening now?
[118:41] B: Oh, I'm just thinking, Damn, this is a lot of. I didn't want to deal with any of this like this. I just wanted to have a good day.
[118:50] A: How do you know that what we're doing isn't on the way to making sure you have not just a good day, but lots? Right. I know what to do to change emotions, but what I can't do is read minds.
[119:10] B: Yep.
[119:12] A: So I keep asking because I want to get it over there in you. What's troubling you.
[119:20] B: I've already told you everything.
[119:22] A: Uh huh. Well, is it still troubling?
[119:27] B: No.
[119:28] A: I'm just don't want.
[119:32] B: That.
[119:34] A: Well, the answer to the question is yes.
[119:38] B: I know. I've already answered that though. I already said that.
[119:41] A: That it's still troubling? No.
[119:43] B: That I miss my kids, period. I'm always gonna miss my kids.
[119:47] A: Yeah. So is it?
[119:56] B: Is what? What?
[119:57] A: Okay to miss your kids?
[119:59] B: Yeah.
[120:00] A: Oh. Is it okay to miss your kids and not feel sad? Or is the only way to miss your kids is by feeling sad?
[120:12] B: No, that's not. I just get sad.
[120:16] A: Yeah.
[120:16] B: Cause I. Cause I miss my kids.
[120:19] A: I know. So the example that you just used there is. It's the missing of my kids that make me feel sad.
[120:28] B: Yeah.
[120:29] A: Right. What I would be interested in us thinking about in a slightly different way is what causes you to feel sad, is something your brain is doing to you in response to not being with your kids. And what we can do is adjust how your brain responds to that stuff so that you become more okay in you. In the same way that the physical stuff that happened to you when you were taken to that house doesn't have the same emotion. And as you think about mom and the scariness of the demons that when you think about that experience, it doesn't have the same emotions. Right. The difference in this one and where you're having the most challenge with is you're okay being okay with the shit that happened to you. What you're not okay with yet is being okay with the shit you did. So when I was 12, I got my own basketball court it was great. I got big ass hands. I'd go out and shoot baskets. My dad, if you can imagine, thought my basketball court was his freaking driveway. The dude would park right in the middle of my court. Now, I knew we had an old Buick at the time that if I put the brake on, moved the steering shifter into N, the car would roll down the gradient of our driveway and be out of my court. Now, I don't know what was going on with my dad that day, but when I went to get out of the car, my dad was screaming at a decibel I couldn't understand. His eyes were dark, his face was red. There was a big vein pulsating out of his forehead. He grabbed me and he began to punch me multiple times. So much so it busted my nose. That's why I've got this lovely bump. There was literally so much blood that you could wring out my shirt. Now, some people tell me that I'm a good therapist and I do good work. So does that mean if you want your child to grow up to be a good therapist, you should beat the shit out of them when they're 12?
[123:20] B: No.
[123:21] A: No. Me being okay, no longer in pain, no longer hurting, no longer angry, no longer resentful over what my dad did to me, does that in any way, shape or form mean that what my dad did was okay?
[123:38] B: No.
[123:39] A: Right? Now, here's the flip side. My dad no longer feeling shame, guilt, regret over what he did to me. Does that in any way, shape or form mean that what he did was okay? Right. So I get to be okay, but so does my dad.
[124:06] B: Yeah.
[124:07] A: The thing that's been missing is that from here you keep kicking, beating up the earlier, younger you, thinking, she shouldn't have done that stuff because if she hadn't, she'd still have her kids from here. You keep looking back at that earlier, you being angry and hurting over what was going on. But back then, when all of that was going on, let's just check for a moment, back then, were you thinking, hey, you know, it'd be really cool. I'd like to be in a state of active addiction so that I have to have my kids be adopted by somebody. See, you just answered the question. You did a good job on that one. Right, right. You weren't thinking it would be really cool. I'd like to, like, get, you know, hooked on substances and, you know, be in states of active addiction and, you know, have my kids get adopted. That wasn't what was going on then, right? There was no conscious Choice or decision. So what we're really interested in. And I get it. You will miss being with them and seeing certain aspects of them growing up. And that part's sad. Knowing that they're in a better environment. That part's good. What we want, though, is for you to be more at peace and not so beating yourself up.
[125:53] B: Yeah.
[125:55] A: Because in the long run, you and them are better off with you being okay.
[126:02] B: Yeah.
[126:03] A: Right. So I want you to go through this process. Let's think of a you who's present and at peace and. Okay. And if we were to symbolize a you as a wild animal who's present, at peace, and okay, doing what she had to do, even though it was hard, doing what was best for them.
[126:35] B: Am I picking an animal?
[126:37] A: Yeah. We want you to think of a wild animal.
[126:39] B: A lion.
[126:40] A: A lion. Right. So now I want you to think of the lion. Take a deep breath in, and then a long exhale. And then another deep breath in. And then another long exhale. And then one more deep breath in. Exhale. Eyes remain closed. As eyes are closed, they rest. As eyes rest closed, you also rest aware of your breath. Right. What's happening now? Now? What's happening right now? How's your body feeling now?
[127:45] B: More relaxed.
[127:46] A: It is. So look up. Think lion. Deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Good. Keep your eyes closed so they rest closed. You also rest your unconscious beginning to make adjustments on the inside, causing more healing to happen for you to become more and more okay in you. What's happening now?
[128:31] B: I just got calm again.
[128:33] A: I did. Right. And as you're feeling more calm, think about kids being with Laura. And what do you notice?
[128:46] B: They're doing good.
[128:47] A: They are. Mm. What do you notice in you?
[128:57] B: I'm less. Less hysterical.
[129:00] A: Right. One more time. Think about the lion. Take a deep breath in. A long exhale. Another deep breath. Breath in. Another long exhale. That's right. Keep breathing in this slower and deeper way. That's right. One more deep breath in. This time, as you exhale, allow your eyes to open, becoming more. Okay. And what's happening now?
[130:30] B: Are we going more focus?
[130:36] A: Yeah. How's your body feeling now?
[130:41] B: A lot less stressed.
[130:43] A: It is, right? Your body's feeling a lot less stress. And we know from what you said there was more than one time because there was a time around a rape thing before daughter or right after daughter was born. And there might have been other stuff that happened when you were a child or three, your early teens. What's another experience, Jen, that comes to mind for us to unplug and clear.
[132:39] B: Looks like fell asleep.
[132:42] A: Yeah.
[132:43] B: That was crazy.
[132:44] A: Yeah.
[132:45] B: How did I do that?
[132:47] A: You closed your eyes.
[132:48] B: Yeah.
[132:50] A: Yeah.
[132:51] B: I didn't notice that. I did.
[132:53] A: Well, you've been trying to keep them open for a long time.
[132:56] B: Yeah.
[132:57] A: Even at times when I say it's okay to close them.
[132:59] B: Yeah.
[133:00] A: Right. Because you've been afraid.
[133:03] B: Yeah.
[133:03] A: To fall asleep.
[133:04] B: Yeah.
[133:05] A: Right. Worrying whether you'd wake back up.
[133:08] B: Yeah.
[133:08] A: Yeah. Except sometimes it's about resting and your unconscious is listening anyway. It is. So there are different moments that we haven't fully cleared yet, have nothing to do with the kids, but do have stuff to do with things that you've done or stuff that's happened to your body. We want to scan back through experiences and have a nice. Another moment surface for us to unplug. Right. What's coming to mind now?
[133:44] B: What's coming to mind now?
[133:46] A: Yeah. Another one of those negative experiences. Things that we don't typically like to think about because when we do, they make me feel bad.
[134:00] B: My mom and dad fighting when I was a kid. My mom fighting with my stepdad.
[134:09] A: Yeah. And you're where and what happened?
[134:13] B: I'm at the house.
[134:15] A: You're about how old?
[134:17] B: See, I'm like 15.
[134:20] A: Huh.
[134:23] B: See, they're fighting now. And she wants my dad to leave now. And my dad doesn't want to leave.
[134:30] A: Right.
[134:31] B: And he threatens he's gonna kill herself if she makes. If she wants. Doesn't want him there anymore.
[134:38] A: Right.
[134:38] B: She loves him. Or he loves her. He's. Now he doesn't have as much money or something.
[134:45] A: I don't know. Right. Good. So they're arguing and he's saying that. And what happened?
[134:51] B: He threatens that he was gonna kill himself if not.
[134:54] A: Right. None happened.
[134:56] B: He took a boat. He went on the boat. He went on the boat.
[135:00] A: Right.
[135:01] B: He was worried the whole time.
[135:03] A: So he went out on a boat.
[135:04] B: Then he ended up coming back, and.
[135:05] A: Then he came back and then he left.
[135:08] B: Yeah.
[135:08] A: And then that moment ended. Yeah. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[135:13] B: Yeah.
[135:13] A: Right. Like do your music.
[135:15] B: Yeah.
[135:15] A: Or go. Go knee party. I go to the beach and have the drum circle. So we got half in the drum circle. We got going knee boarding. Right. And then he had left, and then he had come back, and then he was out on the boat. And then he left to go on the boat. And then he had threatened that he was going to kill himself. And then mom didn't want him around anymore. And then they were arguing back and forth. And before that you were doing whatever you're doing. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[135:44] B: Better.
[135:45] A: Right. You can remember that happening. You can remember putting your sandals on. Chen, stop putting on your sandals. I'm not putting on my sandals. Stop them from arguing. Say they're not arguing.
[135:56] B: Do not argue.
[135:57] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Close your eyes. Think back to the younger you. So go ahead and close your eyes, think back to that younger you, and let the younger you know that moment is over, that it no longer exists. Let her know that he came back. Right. That he didn't actually do it, did he?
[136:28] B: No.
[136:29] A: No. But she thought he was going to.
[136:31] B: Yeah.
[136:32] A: Right. Let that, you know that it never happened.
[136:35] B: Yeah.
[136:36] A: Right. And as the younger you gets it, what do you notice now?
[136:40] B: Less sad.
[136:41] A: Yeah, Right. That's right.
[136:46] B: Yeah.
[136:46] A: Right. That he said that not because he was actually gonna do it, but because he was really troubled.
[136:54] B: Yeah.
[136:55] A: And that was being used as, like, leverage. Right. And again, as you're getting it, what do you notice now?
[137:05] B: Less stressed it is.
[137:10] A: When you think about that moment now, what do you notice?
[137:16] B: Less stress.
[137:19] A: Yeah. Is it troubling now?
[137:21] B: Eyes troubling.
[137:24] A: Is there a part of it that's troubling still?
[137:29] B: Not really. Kind of.
[137:35] A: What's kind of troubling now about that happening then?
[137:42] B: She's not. The feelings aren't as strong associated with it. That's all right.
[137:47] A: They're not. But what about it's troubling knowing that he's okay? That he didn't do it? No.
[137:57] B: That's good thing.
[137:58] A: Right?
[138:01] B: That's it.
[138:03] A: And that, you know, sometimes parents fight.
[138:06] B: Yeah.
[138:07] A: And then sometimes they get divorced.
[138:09] B: Yeah.
[138:10] A: Right. Is that what happened then?
[138:13] B: Yes.
[138:14] A: They got divorced.
[138:15] B: Yeah.
[138:15] A: Right. And as you think about it, he didn't actually do it, even though they got divorced. Oh, so he was actually really more okay without her.
[138:32] B: Yeah.
[138:33] A: Than he thought he would be.
[138:34] B: Yeah.
[138:35] A: Right. But again, he didn't know all that. You weren't even fully sure how. Not well mom was then. Right. Right. And as you get it, what do you notice now?
[139:00] B: Much stronger than I. Than I was.
[139:03] A: Yeah. That's what we want you to begin to realize how strong you really are, how resilient you are. How even if you get knocked down, you got right back up.
[139:19] B: Yes.
[139:20] A: Right. That's what we want you to be connected more to. Right. So again, think of the line. Look up. Think lion. Take deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Eyes. Rest. You rest. That's right. Your unconscious Integrating what it's getting and learning so that things are healing at all different levels. The levels that you're consciously aware of and the levels that you're not consciously aware of. Because your unconscious knows more than you do on how to heal. It's also going to scan and filter back to another moment that would be useful to unplug. Because every time we unplug one of those troubling experiences, it does two things for you. One, it changes the programming, but two, it provides additional energy for healing. Right. We want additional programming and additional energy. So what's. That's another moment that comes to mind.
[141:07] B: My sister not doing well right now, her using an me not being able to change that control that.
[141:17] A: Well, can you control it? You can't. Can you show her the way?
[141:24] B: Yes.
[141:25] A: You can. Right. Show her that life gets to be different.
[141:29] B: Yeah.
[141:30] A: Mm. By having your life be different, by your healing. Right. Right. Could she get you out of active addiction?
[141:42] B: No.
[141:43] A: No. Who can?
[141:44] B: Yourself. God.
[141:48] A: That comes from within you to do it. Right. You can have faith, but the strength is within you in making right connections.
[142:07] B: Yeah.
[142:08] A: And putting in the right supports. Right. All of that stuff is happening now. You are taking the right steps, you're taking the right actions. You're. You went through programming to get you off to now being something else to titrate down. You have a sponsor. You're getting a job. You're working the program. You're going through Tyla to get rid of felonies, to get support. Like all that stuff is happening.
[143:04] B: Yeah.
[143:06] A: Right. And what do you notice? And realizing it now?
[143:15] B: I'm doing really good.
[143:16] A: You are too. And what would it be like to start to feel really good about that? You're doing really good.
[143:25] B: Yeah.
[143:26] A: It would be nice. Right. It would be nice to realize how far you've already come on your way to more. Mm. What's happening now?
[143:44] B: I was crying.
[143:45] A: What? I see that. Oh, so that's not tears of sadness.
[143:53] B: No.
[143:54] A: Oh, you mean you're actually having, for the first time, tears of relief.
[143:59] B: Yeah.
[144:00] A: Right. And how resilient and strong you are and how brave you are. Because this hasn't been easy. Not just in here today, but the journey to get clean and clear, to change your life. That's right. This has been hard. It's taken work.
[144:24] B: Yeah.
[144:25] A: And effort. Right. And you're doing it. Right. And you're doing it and beginning to feel good.
[144:37] B: Yeah.
[144:38] A: That you're doing it.
[144:39] B: Yeah.
[144:40] A: Right. How cool is that?
[144:43] B: Yeah.
[144:45] A: Yeah. That's a big deal thing. Right. So you're on your way. Yeah. Right. So as you think about the things that have happened, stuff that we've discussed and cleared. When you think about mom and the psychotic break, when you think about what happened when you took that drink, when you think about the fight between mom and stepdad. Right. What do you notice now?
[145:49] B: I noticed. I watched. Thinking about the day and how I have to work tomorrow. I have to get a different outfit for my job. Just non slip shoes and jeans, which I have some jeans new put for your shirt.
[146:15] A: Yeah. You'll be doing that today?
[146:18] B: Yeah, yeah. Getting out of work.
[146:21] A: Yeah. To work tomorrow?
[146:24] B: Yeah. 8:30 early.
[146:26] A: Not that early for breakfast. Yeah. That's actually the late shift in breakfast, isn't it?
[146:34] B: I guess so.
[146:39] A: Don't some breakfast places open at 6?
[146:41] B: I guess so. I never worked at one.
[146:46] A: Yeah. When you think about those experiences, are they troubling though?
[146:55] B: No.
[146:56] A: No. Isn't that weird?
[146:58] B: Yeah.
[146:59] A: Notice how different that is?
[147:01] B: Yeah.
[147:03] A: And really different than it's ever been.
[147:07] B: Yeah.
[147:08] A: Right. Yeah, it is. Good. Because what it means is you're healing wounds, emotional wounds. Healing emotional wounds from the inside out so that things are getting better. Yeah. Yeah. So do you have to go today still to do the methadone or have you already done?
[147:45] B: I already did it.
[147:46] A: Okay. So that got checked off the box? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. How long does that process take?
[147:57] B: To come off?
[147:58] A: No, to go.
[147:59] B: When you go there, for me, it takes me only about four minutes inside the place. Okay, you go, drive there, you walk in, you tell them your name, they plug you in. Then you walk into a line, go up to a window and you take the medicine and you go.
[148:16] A: Oh, okay. So it's fast. Yeah. Do you notice taking it, what it does right away?
[148:27] B: Yes.
[148:28] A: Does it take like, you know, like certain things you can notice right away. Like somebody smokes pot, they know it right away. Somebody drinks, they don't notice it right away until all of a sudden then they notice.
[148:41] B: I notice it right away.
[148:42] A: You do?
[148:43] B: Yes.
[148:43] A: Yeah.
[148:43] B: But within 20 minutes I can notice it because I feel. I don't feel good until I take it. I don't. I feel sick until I take it.
[148:50] A: Like sick to your stomach, hot and cold.
[148:53] B: And I. Not hot and cold, sweating kiki legs. Like then when I take it, it goes away like that. And then I only start to feel like that in the middle of the night. And then when I take in the morning, I'm fine.
[149:14] A: Yeah. And is it typically for you a morning thing?
[149:17] B: I take it every the morning.
[149:19] A: That's what you Do. It's not like I take it midday.
[149:21] B: No, you don't only take it one time.
[149:23] A: Okay. And it's typically. Is it? Everybody does it morning.
[149:28] B: Yep.
[149:29] A: Not like they don't have a midday.
[149:31] B: Some somebody they have a double, a split dose. They can take half theirs in the morning and half at night.
[149:38] A: Got it. Okay. But you have to go to a specific place.
[149:42] B: I go to a place to get it, yeah.
[149:46] A: Okay.
[149:46] B: Every day?
[149:48] A: Yeah. How is the titration working? Does it mean that you've already begun to take less of a dose?
[149:56] B: It means that I'm starting to take less medicine. They're going to drop me down, drop me down, drop me down until I get to. When I can just go completely off.
[150:10] A: So the hot cold sweat stuff, that's the. We'll call it the physical withdrawal of the substance. Which is still a better withdrawal than on other stuff.
[150:31] B: Yeah. What do you mean? No, the withdrawal is terrible from methadone. It's worse than any drug. Methadone gets in your bones. It's more difficult to come off. It's an 11 week physical detox. 11 weeks, wow. Yeah. So it's very difficult. So that's why like first I wanted to go off quickly, like, hey, let's just do this. Well, if I do as quick as I want to do, which is against the doctor, what the doctor feels like and what they feel like, but I'm still going faster than what they want, you know, me, because they want me to go very slow. This is where I'm at. I want to be off. I almost just want to drop top and go really hard and just be done with it, you know, and then just be done. And then I have to go in and I have to. I'm not gonna feel good for a while. So that's why it's like right now I'm getting there. I got this job, so I'm start working, I'm start. I can't be sick. I can't do any of that right now. And I'm playing, I gotta pretend like I'm not on it to the people around me, which is very difficult for me because I whether like when I was at Park Village, I'm honest, I dose, but I'm recovering, you know, I'm bettering myself. I'm doing everything I can. I'm running a Bible study, I'm doing all these different things. I'm a leader for people. But I'm also building a foundation strong for myself and my relationship with God and my meetings and my sponsor my whole rapport. But then I come here and I'm not allowed to tell anybody because I'm an exception. So she doesn't want anybody to know that I. That I am on it. Because nobody's allowed to be on it there. Nobody's allowed to be on anything there. So it's between me and her, you know? And she also talks to the lady from Tyler, you know, but my end goal is to be off of it.
[152:26] A: Yeah. So are you thinking in a 12 week period of time you will? Yeah. Like in three months?
[152:32] B: Yeah.
[152:35] A: Okay.
[152:36] B: Yeah.
[152:36] A: How early does the Methadone clinic open? 5 o'clock in the morning?
[152:42] B: Yeah.
[152:43] A: Okay. So that's pretty early.
[152:44] B: Yeah.
[152:45] A: So you'll still be able to go to work?
[152:47] B: Oh, yeah.
[152:48] A: Yeah. All right. Which Kiki's are you gonna be at?
[152:56] B: The one right by my house. By.
[152:59] A: It's called.
[153:00] B: By Temple Avenue. It's Kiki's. It's right by Cortez.
[153:05] A: Okay, so it's out west Brianton, I guess. Well, because you're West Bradenton, this is like east. Anything that's on the other side of the interstate.
[153:17] B: Gotcha.
[153:18] A: Yeah. Cool. So anything else for you for now? Any questions for me?
[153:28] B: I'm good now.
[153:29] A: All right. Well, you did great.
[153:32] B: Thank you.
[153:33] A: Good job. We're on our way.
[153:35] B: Yay.
[153:36] A: Yeah. Absolutely. All right. I will stop with this and.
