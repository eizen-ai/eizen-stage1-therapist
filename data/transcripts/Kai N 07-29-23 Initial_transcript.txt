[00:00] A: So today is the 29th of July. Okay. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. This is our first meeting. Given what we do is useful and valuable, the recording may be made available in teaching and training other professionals. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:16] B: Yes.
[00:16] A: Cool. So what would be useful for me to know? Right? Like, so if we're thinking about, like, if we could change ways that you feel or act or react that you don't, like, what do we want to get better for you?
[00:30] B: Definitely my anger and depression. I struggle with both of those. Like, yes, I punch walls. Like, I'll punch walls. Or, like, do things to others. Like, I'm very explosive.
[00:42] A: Like, okay.
[00:42] B: And then I'm just like, oh, I did not want to do that. Then I apologize because, yeah, I got out of character.
[00:50] A: Okay. So normally I'm like, mild manner and like, you know, I'm kind of like, chill. And then. Which you don't know because just right underneath the surface is this, like, bubbling, boiling thing that if I get trigger, it's going way up that that's what happens. Okay. So we want to get that to stop and maybe have, like, a longer fuse with things. So it's not. So. Yes. Okay, cool. I know how to do that. What else?
[01:18] B: My depression. I feel like I struggle with the thoughts of suicide here and there. Like, the thoughts come in.
[01:25] A: Well, why wouldn't they? I mean, that's the weird part. People go, well, I shouldn't be having these kinds of thoughts. These are bad thoughts to be having. But I'm not actually having the thoughts because somehow it's what I want to do. Right. The deal is when we feel down and bad and we don't know how to not feel down and bad. Right. We're looking for solutions. What would be one of the solutions? Suicide. Be dead. If I'm dead, I don't feel down and bad anymore.
[01:55] B: Right.
[01:56] A: That doesn't mean I want to do it. You follow me with that? Like, I want to actually stop Feeling bad is really what I want. That's just an option, a way to do it. That doesn't mean that. Oh, no, that's not what I want to do. Right. Where people get screwed up with that is they go, because I'm thinking it must be at some level, something that I want to do. You follow me with that. But it's not actually what somebody wants to do. It's an option, like on a menu. Have you ever been to a Cheesecake Factory? You, like, throw A Bible, like food down on the table that you gotta look through. I mean, like an hour goes by before you can read all the. Right. Like, it's huge. Right. It's an option. There are some in the Cheesecake Factory that are more desirable than others for you. Right. Just because it's an option on the menu doesn't mean that that's what you want. Makes sense. Okay, so sometimes you have those kinds of thoughts. How else has it shown up for you? Clearly, sometimes you felt down and bad.
[02:59] B: Yeah.
[03:00] A: Yeah.
[03:01] B: I feel like I'm very. I'm a very anxious person, too. Like, I'm always worried, waiting for a shoe to drop for everything.
[03:09] A: What color? You never thought of it that way, did you?
[03:13] B: No.
[03:13] A: What kind of shoe?
[03:14] B: I don't know.
[03:16] A: See Again, you never thought of it that way. But how much better would it be if it was just a shoe dropping?
[03:20] B: Right.
[03:21] A: Right. Wouldn't be so troubling. Oh, my goodness, there's a heel. Whoa. Jeez. I don't want to get.
[03:26] B: Heel.
[03:29] A: Okay. So worrying, meaning that there's a lot of thoughts about things. Things that could or might happen, that if they were to happen, it would be bad.
[03:38] B: Yeah.
[03:38] A: And I kind of get scared of it, even in just the thought of it. Oh, that's fine. I mean, it's really a good thing that our brain doesn't actually distinguish between the thought of it and it. Right. Like, I'm literally creating, like, probably either movies or pictures, right? Color or black and white of bad things that could or might happen, that if they were to happen, it would be really, really bad. And as I paint that movie for myself, I feel the distress of, isn't that crazy that we can do that? Like, it'd be one thing to be experiencing it as I'm in it, right. I have somebody come in. This is funny. She goes, I have a big fear of flying. I go, well, when are you flying? She goes, three months from now. I'm like, well, we better start early. Right? Because she was experiencing the fear. Now she wasn't flying for three months, right. What the hell? But that's what happens with this, right? So we want to get that thing turned around so that you're not so much forecasting, right? Because the problem with forecasting, it's like the weather. How accurate are the weather in Florida? I mean, they can get it, right? If they say, somewhere there will be rain in the afternoon and it might last for 10 minutes and be on yours, they can't, like, get down to there, can they?
[05:03] B: Right.
[05:03] A: So at 2:30 on the left side of Pinellas County. Like, what? They can't do that. They're not accurate. And the farther we go out from now, the less accurate we are with our predictions. Like, for example, when you were 4 or 5 or 6, did you, like, you know, as a little girl go, you know what? I'd like to have, like, stuff happen that leads me to go to a place that helps women who have been trafficked? No. Right. Like, right. That was not like, whoa, okay. You couldn't even have conceived of that. Right. You could have predicted other stuff. But the problem with predictions, the farther we go away, the less accurate we are. Right. That what's happened wouldn't have occurred. Like, she wouldn't have even had the thought of that being something to think about to have happened. Right. Like at that age. Right. Like not even there. So we want to get things shifted so that you're more. Okay. Right. Because a lot of the, what I would call worry about future or anticipatory anxiety, like I'm. It's in the anticipation of whatever could have that I'm actually feeling the distress of that bad thing, which may or may not actually happen. So I definitely should prepare and start feeling bad about it because it might not happen at all. Isn't that a crazy thought? The thing that I'm most worried about, that I'm feeling all the distress, I go through the experience that I thought that would happen, and it doesn't happen at all. So I got to experience all of that distress leading up to it, but didn't actually get it when it was happening. Huh. It's weird that we would do that. Right. But there's errors in the way that the brain works. So we want to get that thing turned way down so that what happens with anticipatory anxiety is I grew up or moved through lots of things in life that were scary, troubling, bad, and I didn't know in some of those moments whether I was actually going to survive it, make it through it be okay. Right. So if we all go through life experiences, some people more than others, like, I kind of think we all have a little bit of post traumatic stress. It's a fucked up world we live in and fucked up things happen. Right. I think we all have at least a little bit of stuff. Some people more than others and some people in bigger ways than others, but we all have it, right? So the stuff is on not because we went through it, but when it happened. Emotionally, brain doesn't know it's over. That level, that part of the brain doesn't get, it doesn't know that the experience is over, finished, not happening. So if I go through a lot of uncertainty in life and my brain is still living as if that uncertainty stuff is still active because it doesn't know, we know something still troubles us. Not by how often I think about it, but if I do think about it, I have. That happens to me, you know, some sort of physiological yuckiness, emotional yuckiness that I'm feeling but I don't want to actually be feeling. Right. So. So those are the things that stay stuck. So with that, it's kind of throwing that past into the possible future. That's why I'm trying to prepare. Because the thinking process is if I know all the things that could go wrong and how to handle them, if they do, then I'll be okay. That's the idea. That's what they do with an or. They try to make sure they know everything that could happen and everything that could go wrong and how to handle it if it does. But even in that really small contained environment, they can handle every variable something could happen that they weren't. That's how it works. So that's like life. So instead of having that past thrown in future, we want present moment, meaning that we want the parts where yucky stuff happened that got stuck to know. One, they're over. Two, I made it through it. Three, I'm okay. We want to get that news in first. Because when we go through really troubling moments, that's what's frozen brain at that level. Not logical, but emotional. Doesn't know it's over. Makes sense. So we want to get. Where you going? Hi. Get back here. Hi. Hi. Noticed you were going somewhere. Hi.
[10:00] B: Okay.
[10:00] A: Where are you going?
[10:01] B: Thank you.
[10:02] A: Yeah, like, what were you thinking about?
[10:04] B: My mom.
[10:05] A: Your mom. Okay. And what. What about Mom?
[10:08] B: When she trafficked me.
[10:10] A: Oh, that.
[10:10] B: Yeah.
[10:11] A: So you were thinking about some yucky moment and notice how you started to go there and notice how I noticed it. Right. Because here's the cool part. I don't need you to go there to know that it's still on and that we want to get that unplugged and that that time frame has a lot of moments in it. Right. It's not like, oh, it was the one time mom was fucked up into this. No. Right. Like, there's lots of stuff that goes with that before we go to really unplug the emotion and all the hurt and the anger and resentment and pain and Sadness and all that. We want to know both you and I being on the same page with how we get it better, why it's continued to trouble. What are we going to do to get it better so that then we go do it and we get it better. That's why I want you here with me somewhere. So my commitment in all of this is if I notice and when I do, because you may start to go somewhere other than be here, I'm gonna bring you back here. Hi. Got it? Yeah. Okay. So that's the first component of what we want to be doing. Once your brain at that level, those moments are unplugged, what also starts to get installed is the strength that I gained from making it through difficult stuff. Right. Like, nobody will accept the Navy seals signs up for difficulty on purpose. Right. Here's the easy way down the path. Here's the treacherous, difficult one that you could die during. We're all going this way. Right? Right. Except in abc, as they go, no, man, I'm going that way. Right? Right. So none of us sign up for adversity to become stronger. But when you make it fully to the other side, you absolutely are. Right. And so in a lot of ways, you actually feel the stronger. The problem is that there's this open wound that kind of drains out energy. That's where the down, depressed stuff comes in. That's where like, the heaviness and the weight. Right. Because, like, a lot of stuff is felt heavy and weighed down. Right. We want to get that lifted so that you are lighter. Because we already know that, you know, you're a colorful person, big colorful person. Right, Right. And we want that to be able to be expressed more and you'd be okay in you. Yeah. So once that happens and I have the resiliency inside, well, now I know at not a logical but an emotional level that I have what I need inside of me to be okay to handle any scenario that might come my way. Right. We want, at a deep level that I'm present and as stuff shows up, I handle it to the best of my ability and the way that would be best for me. Right. Like, that's how we want to move through stuff. Right. So therefore, my brain stops feeling the need to worry or anticipate, because worry or anticipate is all about how will I handle what could or might happen if it does. Makes sense.
[13:55] B: Yeah.
[13:56] A: At a deep level, when all of that stuff has been unplugged and you're good at you, and at that level, you know, doesn't Matter what shows up, I've got what I need. I don't have to forecast so much. Make sense?
[14:14] B: Yeah.
[14:14] A: Cool. All right, so we got. Right. Anxious stuff that goes on. We got that there's stuff that's happened that although it's over, we've got that. Down. Depressed. And sometimes, of course, when I'm feeling down and don't know how to not feel down, I have thoughts about being dead and I wouldn't at least feel down. Right. So we got all that stuff. What else, Kay, would be useful for me to know? Is there things like self consciousness? Do you get discomfort in speaking in groups or with people you don't know? Do you worry about what others might think about you or what you're saying or how you're coming across? Or, like, do any of those things.
[15:14] B: Go on what others think of me?
[15:17] A: Yeah. How so? Like, where might you be when it happens?
[15:25] B: I just feel like I'm a people pleaser. I'll give people things just so that they'll like me. Like, if I have a shirt they want, I'll just give it to them.
[15:36] A: Even if it's your favorite?
[15:38] B: Yeah.
[15:38] A: Oh. Oh, interesting. So. So that happens then. Do you feel bad about it or are you glad that you did it? I'm glad until they do something mean like disrespect me. Oh, right. Because people will.
[15:56] B: Yeah.
[15:56] A: That's one thing that you can count on. There's a lot of people out there, and they'll do disrespectful shit. Some downright mean shit. Some people are just assholes out there. Right. So what I gotta know is that I'm gonna encounter shit that presses my buttons. We can't get that to stop. Right. No matter what we do to X out the things and the people, there's a whole long lineup ready to press the same button. So what we want to do for you is unplugged the button so that even if it's pressed, it doesn't cause that in you. Does that make sense?
[16:33] B: Yeah.
[16:35] A: Yeah. So you might do something. And your purpose isn't just to be nice. Your purpose is in hoping that then they'll be nice to me.
[16:48] B: Right.
[16:51] A: But you're not always included. Like, it may be something that I wanted to keep. I mean, I did get this shirt on purpose. Be one thing if it was a shirt that was gifted to me that I didn't really like. Oh, you want that one? Sure. You follow me with that. So. But that's kind of where that sometimes. So let me ask it in this way. Okay. Is it that sometimes you do it and you're okay doing it because, like, there's a joy in doing something nice for somebody. Right. Like we have that saying, it's better to give than to receive. Right. And there is a certain aspect of joy that innately comes out of doing something nice for somebody. Right. So we want to keep that part in play. We don't want to get rid of that because you actually get joy out of that part. Right. But if I'm following you, does it sometimes show up where you're doing it when you really don't want to, but you can't not. And then there's a little bit of like, resenting that I have to.
[18:02] B: Yeah.
[18:03] A: Okay. So that's one aspect of it. Right. And then on the other side of that, does it show up where maybe I'd want to do something that's really for me, but I know what they want, and so therefore I'm feeling guilty wanting to do this thing for me? Yes, that shows up too. Okay, so what we want then is we want to extend the range and to have a better gauge or filter on how much of it is on at a time. Right. Like not fire hose all at once. Right. That would be fine in some situations. Right. But we also want to be able to turn it down so it comes out as drinking water. Right. We want to turn it off so it's not on at all. Right. So in that range, we want you to have the freedom to do what I call not just people pleasing, but caretaking, caregiving behaviors, because you actually get an internal joy in doing that. So we want you to be able to do that however we want it to be on the times that it actually works for you. So we also want you to have the freedom to not have to do it and feel okay. And we also want you to have the freedom to be able to do something else and not feel bad that you are. Do you follow me with that?
[19:23] B: Yes.
[19:24] A: So it's not like we throw the whole thing out like I'm this people pleaser, blah, blah, blah, but we have it filtered better. We have it with more range of variation. Right. We can kind of turn the knob instead of it be a switch where it's on and it was just stuck on. Right. Because it was never not on for you in that regard. Right. We want to be able to not just have it be on off, but we want to have like a thermostat so that we can adjust the dial. Okay, cool. I follow you with that, what else would be useful for me to know? Yeah. Geez. There's nothing else for me. I don't know. Well, one thing you said is there was stuff that happened with Mom. Right. Any other stuff that happened. I don't need to. Need to know the details, but, like, so how did it transpire? If you gave, like, the. The, like, high. Like, what would they call that? The Cliff Notes. You know what Cliff Notes are? Ever heard of them? So good. So it's a summary of, like, a book so I don't have to read the book that they kind of tell me a little bit about the book. Right. So if we got a summary of, like, stuff, and you can talk about a girl who had X, y, whatever. So stuff happened with Mom. There's lots of different stuff through life. You grew up. Was it just Mom? Was mom using? Was, like, my mom was struggling with.
[20:51] B: Addictions, and she was 14. She had me at 18, my other sister at 16, and she was in and out in jail.
[21:00] A: Okay.
[21:01] B: She.
[21:01] A: So it wasn't that stable. And you live with different people, like a step parent or a. I live.
[21:07] B: With my mom for probably the first couple years of my life, and, like, I do remember her leaving us in a car and stuff, and I guess that's when DCF got involved, so they gave us to our grandma.
[21:18] A: Okay. So then you live with grandma for a period, and it was in and out of grandma's house because my mom.
[21:23] B: Was in and out as well.
[21:24] A: Right. Would come back, and then you'd get her, and then she'd be gone. All right. So that was a really, you know, solid stable. Okay. What's that? Okay. I don't know. Right. Like, Okay. I had a really good foundation. Okay. So then. So that is, like, you know, early years into elementary school. Ish.
[21:49] B: Yeah.
[21:49] A: Okay. Then, like, my grandma's been struggling with, like.
[21:53] B: Well, she struggled my whole childhood with depression. So she.
[21:57] A: Grandma did.
[21:58] B: Yeah. She would be like, oh, I'm gonna kill myself, or I'm gonna put y'all all in foster care and threats like that.
[22:03] A: So grandma was also really easy to get along with. No. She was so kind and loving, always empowering, really made us feel good and wanted. Okay. So we got all that going on, Grandma doing those things.
[22:19] B: And then my grandfather passed away in 2012, and then she became physically abusive.
[22:25] A: Okay. So when grandpa died, she then, like, lost it.
[22:29] B: Yeah.
[22:30] A: So not only was she saying mean and hurtful things, she was becoming physically.
[22:35] B: Right.
[22:36] A: So might hit you with a hand or with a belt. Oh, good. Well, yeah. Awesome. You get a better with the belt, Right? I mean, if you're gonna do it, like. Okay. So we've got all that. Right. Good flogging. Grandma would give.
[22:53] B: And then from 8 to probably 14, my mom was in and out, and she would pick us up for visitations, but then she would take us a man's house.
[23:01] A: Got it.
[23:02] B: So that's when all of the. She would get money off of us. Well, me and my sister. Little sister.
[23:09] A: Yeah. And so that happened where, like, different things with different guys would be going on with all that. Okay. All right. How you doing right now?
[23:18] B: Good.
[23:19] A: Yeah. I like you better when you're here. Okay. Yeah. So then we got that. Right.
[23:26] B: And then when I was, like, 12, I started experimenting with drugs.
[23:29] A: Sure. Fuck it.
[23:30] B: With kids at school. We'd skip school.
[23:33] A: Right. Smoke weed.
[23:35] B: Yeah.
[23:35] A: Right. That would be the one that you do first.
[23:38] B: Yeah.
[23:38] A: Right. It wasn't like we. No, we actually got the thing. We heated up the heroin. We put it in the needle. Right. That's not the one that somebody starts off with. No. Right.
[23:49] B: And then in 2018, my grandma put me in foster time care.
[23:52] A: Okay. You're how old then?
[23:53] B: I was about 14.
[23:55] A: 14. Okay.
[23:56] B: And she kept. All my other siblings.
[23:58] A: Got it. So that made you feel good. Yeah. Wow.
[24:01] B: Gosh.
[24:02] A: She thinks that much of me that I get to live on my own. Awesome. That's great. Cool. Cool. You guys off to stay with her. All right. So there's that.
[24:10] B: Yeah.
[24:11] A: Right. Is mom still alive?
[24:13] B: My.
[24:13] A: Yeah, mom is. Okay. Right. And she's still up and down.
[24:17] B: No, she's been clean for three years now.
[24:20] A: Yeah. But she's still up and down with her mood. Yeah. Yeah, right. That's what I mean. I mean, it doesn't. She might be clean, and that's great. And it's way better than her using, but it doesn't mean that she still doesn't have. Erratic.
[24:32] B: Right.
[24:32] A: Okay. Right. All right. So. So foster. So you're in Foster from 14 through 18. Right. And you live with different families or.
[24:44] B: The same way I lived with different families. I was constantly running away.
[24:48] A: Oh, because you like staying at places. You're like, I'm gonna find as many different places to stay as I possibly can.
[24:54] B: And I became, like. I started prostituting.
[24:58] A: Okay.
[24:58] B: For, like, drugs, food.
[25:00] A: Yeah.
[25:01] B: Places to sleep when I ran away.
[25:03] A: Yeah. Because anything was better than that.
[25:06] B: Yeah.
[25:07] A: Yeah. Right.
[25:11] B: And then I turned 18 in January.
[25:14] A: Yeah.
[25:15] B: And when I turned 18, I was still doing the same thing. Prostituting.
[25:22] A: Yeah.
[25:23] B: And I even robbed somebody okay. For drugs.
[25:26] A: Yeah.
[25:27] B: And that's when I realized I was at the point where I'd hurt somebody for whatever I wanted.
[25:35] A: Yeah.
[25:37] B: And my anger was definitely out of control.
[25:39] A: Yeah. Well, you didn't have any emotional regulation going on because you were in and out of using. That causes a lot of dysregulation in people. Right. In particular, if I don't always have the funds to have it so that whenever I want it, I can do it. That I have to actually go search for. Like, makes it a lot harder. Right. Like, if somebody's got the funds and it's right there, it's like a lot easier.
[26:06] B: Right.
[26:08] A: Have all done that goes on.
[26:12] B: Yeah.
[26:15] A: Okay. So all that happened, you realize I would hurt somebody. Anger's way out of control. Then what happened?
[26:21] B: Um, I called my adoptive family.
[26:24] A: Yeah. Told them that one of them.
[26:27] B: Yeah.
[26:27] A: The last one that you were staying with.
[26:28] B: Yeah.
[26:29] A: Yeah. Okay.
[26:29] B: And I explained to them that I was out of control.
[26:33] A: Yeah.
[26:33] B: Like, I wake up and I drink alcohol.
[26:36] A: Yeah.
[26:36] B: I wake up and I'm smoking. I just had no control over myself.
[26:41] A: Yeah.
[26:42] B: I was at the point I would hurt anybody.
[26:44] A: Yeah.
[26:45] B: And I put other people at risk. And I had no. Like, I didn't care.
[26:49] A: Right.
[26:50] B: I didn't care about myself and I definitely didn't care about nobody else.
[26:52] A: Yeah. Or at least it felt that way.
[26:54] B: Yeah.
[26:55] A: Right. But you actually did care about you because you called them. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Right. That's really good. Yeah. So you called them, told them, hey, things are fucking crazy and I need help. Then what happened?
[27:11] B: They started looking into, like, programs.
[27:14] A: Yeah.
[27:15] B: And I went to Aspire for like, just rehab at first. I had to go to detox and stuff.
[27:20] A: Right.
[27:21] B: And when I had to interview with them, I was like, I'm not gonna call them. I don't want to go no more. I was just. I wanted to keep living the way I was living.
[27:29] A: At first I was like, well, right.
[27:30] B: What's the. Why would I go change or try to change when I'm probably gonna end up in the same circumstances every time?
[27:38] A: Yeah. Cuz like, past hasn't shown me any different.
[27:42] B: Right.
[27:43] A: And that's what I meant by earlier. It keeps being Thorin in the future, so I keep, like, re experiencing it. Yeah. We want that to stop. Okay. So then you went to Aspire. Then you weren't going to call. Then what happened?
[27:59] B: I ended up calling.
[28:01] A: Right.
[28:02] B: They accepted me the same day. So the adoptive family, they had picked me up the same day and drove two hours to Orlando. From Jacksonville.
[28:12] A: Okay.
[28:12] B: Dropped me off at detox.
[28:14] A: Yeah.
[28:15] B: And then I stayed at that program for three months until probably after three episodes. I punched walls.
[28:23] A: Yeah.
[28:24] B: And my hand was swollen.
[28:27] A: The wall always wins.
[28:28] B: God.
[28:29] A: And it was a. I wish it wasn't that way, but the wall always, always wins, no matter what. Yeah.
[28:35] B: And then I had to go to emergency room because I couldn't bend it or anything. And luckily the doctor said it was just me causing trauma to my end. It wasn't like broken or anything, but he was like, if I keep punching walls, I'm gonna end up having some long term effects.
[28:52] A: Yeah.
[28:53] B: And then the last one was the last explosion I had there before I was like, this program's not for me. Was one of the girls had left. And I'm like, why are you laughing? Like, what's so funny? And then she was like, you're just gonna have a moment, so go have your moment. And then she just kept saying stuff.
[29:14] A: For like she was. She was turning it on.
[29:16] B: Yeah.
[29:16] A: Then turning it up. And she saw that it was bothering you, so she kept going at it. Yeah.
[29:22] B: So I went to go walk out the room and then she was like. She said something. I think she said, that's why your mom trafficked you or something.
[29:29] A: So.
[29:29] B: So then I turned around and then I was like trying to push through one of the staff. Yeah. I pushed through the staff. And then I was like up in her face and we were both like just going at it. And then the cops were called.
[29:46] A: Oh, good.
[29:47] B: And then there was four cops. And I don't like cops.
[29:51] A: Because they've always been nice to you.
[29:53] B: No.
[29:54] A: Because you actually had a lot of interactions with them growing up.
[29:56] B: Yes.
[29:57] A: Yeah.
[29:58] B: Big racks.
[30:00] A: Charges.
[30:00] B: When I was like 12, so it was kind of like.
[30:03] A: Yeah.
[30:03] B: Seeing them throw my mom on the floor. So I've seen a lot of things cops did that I don't agree with.
[30:09] A: Right. Yeah.
[30:11] B: And then.
[30:11] A: Cuz they did them all for. Cuz they wanted to. Just for shits and giggles.
[30:15] B: No.
[30:15] A: Oh, right. Some of it was because they were actually doing their job.
[30:18] B: Yeah.
[30:20] A: I'm glad I don't have that job. Right. Like out of all the jobs that there could be, that is not one that I want. I don't want to be that. Or I don't want to be president either. You'd be president fucking half of everybody at least is angry at you at one point. That is a lot of negative energy coming at me. I don't need any of that. You see those people, they age like 100 years and 4 years that they're in office. It's crazy. I don't want that. Okay. So then that happened. Cops were there. Then what?
[30:51] B: They asked me how much longer I had in the program, and I told them. I was like, well, I'm gonna start looking into another program. And they said if they got called again, that they were just gonna take me.
[31:02] A: Right. So there's that.
[31:05] B: And then the next day, me and the director at that program started looking into programs.
[31:10] A: Right.
[31:10] B: And she was like, well, I think Salah would be good for you.
[31:13] A: No. Okay. And that's how you got transported to assessment?
[31:17] B: Yes.
[31:18] A: Okay.
[31:19] B: And then.
[31:22] A: I skipped a few parts, of course.
[31:24] B: Yeah, I know. While in assessment. Not assessment, but in the other program, I got told my nana passed away.
[31:31] A: Oh, okay.
[31:32] B: May 2nd. So she was like my best friend. So to get told my Nana.
[31:37] A: Nana, the one that was being. That kicked her out of the house, that was this.
[31:41] B: My great grandma. My nana's my great grandma, and then my grandma is my grandma.
[31:45] A: Right, because you would be having a great grandma because mom had you really early. Right. I. I had the same thing. Like, my great grandma lived until she was, like, 84, but I was 19.
[31:56] B: Right.
[31:57] A: Right. So I had her, like, a lot of life. Right, right. You know, I mean, and. And 84 is not super old now.
[32:03] B: But, like, yeah, my nana was 75, and I'm 18, so it was kind of like, yeah, I felt like I should have got more time with her because she was my best friend, but. And it's because she was my escape. When I was younger, I used to, like, if they went on family vacation to, like, South Carolina, I would be like, I want to stay with my nana.
[32:23] A: Sure.
[32:23] B: Pretty much. And I would just stay with my nana, and I'd sleep in the bed next to her. She was kind of like the only one that gave me love.
[32:30] A: Nana actually treated you like grandmotherly?
[32:34] B: Yes. And then April 23rd of 2021, my brother overdosed.
[32:40] A: Oh, boy.
[32:40] B: With Fentanol. So he died, and I was forced to go to the funeral. Well. Well, the viewing first. And then my biological mom took me, and she took me up to the casket. I didn't want to look at him, but she was like, no, you're going to. And she was like, if you keep on living the way you're living, you're going to end up like him. So that was probably something that bothers me the most about the funeral and the viewing, because that's all I can remember is what seeing him and her Saying I'm gonna end up like him.
[33:13] A: Oh, have you?
[33:14] B: No.
[33:14] A: Oh, you're changing. Right, Right. I wonder what that would be like. Right? Because that moment as you're talking about it kind of bothers you a little.
[33:21] B: Yeah.
[33:22] A: Right. Like, what if it didn't? Like, how would you be feeling if that no longer caused any of that for you? Right. You'd be feeling nothing. You'd be like, no, that it happened. And yet it's sad that he died. I'm sad that he died. But like, right. It's not me. Right, right. That the earlier you didn't know because in that moment she was in that all screwed up stuff.
[33:46] B: Right?
[33:47] A: Right. And not really to her own. Like, it's not like you chose any of that. Like, you got born into a. Like I said, a really solid, you know, real good foundation to grow upon feeling really loved and supported and. Right. Yeah, no, Nana, she was that way. But like, where the fuck. Right? Right. So we want that you, when mom Biomom did that, to know that that's not happening.
[34:14] B: Right?
[34:14] A: Right. Because what's something you've done after that moment that was more enjoyable than that moment? You don't need time from then until yesterday.
[34:23] B: Right.
[34:30] A: You don't know nothing. There's been nothing more. So you go, that is a moment that bothered me. And since then, there's been no moments that I've had that have been at least a little bit better than that.
[34:42] B: I guess just being able to prove everybody that said I couldn't. Wrong.
[34:49] A: No. Well, that feels good. Right? But. But something that you've done, like, okay, I got clean, that would be something you've done after that. Right? Yeah, I entered a program. I stayed in the program and I stayed in the program. Right. I actually called the adopted family going, I need help. Right, Right. Like, that's a big one. Right? That earlier you didn't know any of that. Right. So do this for me. Go ahead. And just slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue and breathe a little slower. So it's like a. Right. Because when you breathe a little bit slower and a little bit longer on the exhale, notice what starts to happen in how your body feels. Right. More tense or more calm. Right. Isn't that cool?
[35:41] B: Yeah.
[35:41] A: So as your body's more calm, we can remember mom doing that. We can remember her saying that. Right. But you can remember that happening. You can also remember putting on your pants. And if I said to you, kay, stop putting on your pants, you go, I'm not. Because you know, it's a memory. So stop putting on your pants. Go, I'm not. Right. Say that I'm not putting in my pants.
[36:07] B: I'm not.
[36:08] A: Well, stop putting on your Crocs. I'm not putting on my Crocs. Right. Well, stop mom from saying that. Say she's not saying that. Say that she's not saying that. Right. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you're not putting on your shirt.
[36:21] B: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[36:22] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shoes. Say you're not putting on your shoes. Well, stop mom from saying that. Say she's not saying.
[36:29] B: She's not saying.
[36:30] A: Right. Where is it that experience go? It doesn't exist.
[36:33] B: It doesn't exist.
[36:34] A: Right. Because it isn't.
[36:35] B: Right?
[36:35] A: Right. I have a memory, but the memory isn't it. Right? Right. What about you back then, when mom was saying that? Not know how much you've changed.
[36:48] B: Right.
[36:48] A: So close your eyes. Think back to that. You let her know that moment, of course, is over. Right. That the experience no longer exists. That mom saying that had to do with what was going on with Mom. Right. Concern about you based on what happened to him. Right. But it was about Mom's concern, not about you. Right. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about going to detox. Let her know about calling that family. Right. Let her know how worth it you are to you. That you're actually getting it now. At least a little. That I'm actually worth it to you. So I'm here. Right. Good job. Right. As the earlier you starts to get it, what do you notice? What? Does she look so troubled? She looks so hurt. Angry. Scared.
[37:38] B: Definitely angry.
[37:40] A: She does look angry now when she's realizing from you that that's okay.
[37:44] B: Oh, no, no.
[37:45] A: Oh, she's not. She was then.
[37:47] B: Right?
[37:48] A: Right. Like, who are you to say this? You've been my whole life. Right.
[37:54] B: I don't know. Because.
[37:56] A: Well, as you're thinking about it now, knowing that that moment's over and that you're okay. Oh, and how much you've changed for the better. Right. And the earlier you get how much she's changed.
[38:08] B: Right?
[38:08] A: Right. How much she values herself to start to change. That's why she stayed. That's why she called. That's why she came here. Right. Got it. When the earlier you starts to know all of that, what happens to her?
[38:25] B: I guess she becomes supportive.
[38:27] A: Does the earlier, younger you look so troubled? No. So angry at Mom?
[38:33] B: No.
[38:34] A: No. Isn't that cool?
[38:35] B: Yeah.
[38:35] A: Right. Because now as you're thinking about it, you're actually not feeling the same way you were. Hey, check it out. Isn't that interesting?
[38:46] B: Yeah.
[38:46] A: Right? And you can think about it right now and try to feel it. What do you notice?
[38:54] B: Isn't that interesting? Yeah. How cool is that?
[38:56] A: Right? And that's just one little piece of getting things beginning to become unplugged. So. So that you get freedom. Right?
[39:06] B: Right.
[39:08] A: Right. Because what you start to give is, gosh, clearly, like, I'm valuing me. Right. Then I had Nana who believed in me, who gave me love, who saw me for more than the fucking shit. Right? And now, because she's held that image for me, now I'm starting to see it in me.
[39:32] B: Right?
[39:33] A: Right. Which it was always there. It was never not there. It just had a lot of shit that's been in the way of it based on the crap that's happened. But it's always been there.
[39:44] B: Right.
[39:45] A: Got it. And we want you to be more connected to who you really are and lighten up some. Cool. Okay. And that's what got you here. Yeah. Yeah.
[40:01] B: Yeah.
[40:02] A: So again, think about the stuff with mom that time. What do you notice?
[40:09] B: It doesn't bother me as much.
[40:11] A: Does it bother you?
[40:13] B: No.
[40:13] A: Oh. So not even not as much. It's just not bothering you?
[40:17] B: Yeah.
[40:18] A: Right. Isn't that weird?
[40:19] B: It's very weird.
[40:20] A: Because it's different.
[40:21] B: Yeah.
[40:21] A: Right. Different than how it was. So here's the cool part. That's what we do to unplug the emotional effect that stuff has had. Right. Notice how the intention is to be here. You had remembered it.
[40:36] B: Right?
[40:36] A: Right. We did a silly game. I'm not. You're not. It's not.
[40:42] B: Right.
[40:43] A: Right. And it unplugs it. Then we re educate the younger you. Now she gets to have the resource. Wow. That I believed in being more than the circumstances stuffing situations that I've gone through. Because if it was anybody else who got born to that mom in that family with that sister and falling down. Right. Would have manifested the same way. Right. Like it's not on you. You didn't go. You know what? My last lifetime. Because I believe in more than one lifetime, I had it made. I had everything that I wanted. Life was grand. I felt so at peace and good inside. So in this lifetime, I'm gonna be born to that mom. Right? Right. Just to experience the opposite for a little bit. To see how fucked up she could actually get. That the people that I'm thinking are supposed to be loving and supportive and Nurturing of me are doing that. Right, right. Yeah, thanks. Right, right. But you can start to think, like, wait a minute. Got born into that. Not like, I chose that. Like, again, wake up one day, go, you know, life has been too easy. I want to see what it's like to really go through it. Right, right, right. So we want to get that part in. Because a lot of what's happened because of when you were little and the engineering that happens with kids, it is about me. Right. Whether good things happen, it's because I'm good, But bad things happen because I'm bad. I got spanked. I did something wrong. Santa brought a present. I'm good. Right. Like, that's the messaging. So that's what got installed through a lot of stuff where it felt like if I was more lovable, mom wouldn't be so fucked up in that kind of way. If I was worth it, Graham wouldn't be. So verbally and then physically and. Right. That kind of stuff. Right. So it all goes back to being somehow about me. And we want that thing turned around. Right. Because none of that stuff means anything about your identity, who you are. Because, again, anybody set up in that way, that's the way it's going down. Makes sense.
[43:21] B: Yes.
[43:21] A: Because that's the circumstances that get presented in that person's life. It's not like I have, like, oh, ultimate choice. Like, I got down a path that, like, led to, okay, you have this or this. Well, that's not really a choice. It's like a magician. Go ahead, pick any card you want. Already knowing that you're gonna. I know what card you're gonna pick. Go ahead and pick any card. Right. It's like a forced hand. Makes sense.
[43:49] B: Yes.
[43:50] A: Like, I got the card in one side, I go, okay, pick a side. And whichever one you point to, I go. So if you point to this one, I go, okay, take it away. If you point to this one, I go, yeah, good. Okay, this one. Still take that one away.
[44:01] B: Right.
[44:02] A: So it's a forced hand. Makes sense. That's what got set up. But what's really, really cool, and this is part that excites me most. Okay. Is that you went, oh, okay. This is out of control. This isn't actually the trajectory I want in my life. Actually, I'd like life to be different than this. And then you started doing stuff. Right. And that's really exciting, don't you think?
[44:27] B: Yeah.
[44:27] A: Yeah. I'm, like, really excited because then what we get to do based on this is what I'm Interested in is we get to unplug a lot of the stuff that's happening so it doesn't weigh on you. So it doesn't cause the disruptions and the disregulations in you. So you get to be more okay. That you get to see it with more clarity, that you get to feel inside you're good in you. Right. That's where we're headed. Make sense?
[44:57] B: Yes.
[44:58] A: Cool. All right, so any questions for me?
[45:01] B: No.
[45:01] A: About what we talked about so far today. It makes sense.
[45:05] B: Yes.
[45:05] A: Yeah. And, and we can do it in a way that's, you know, at least a little bit fun. I'm hoping that hanging out with me at least is a little more fun than awful shit that's happened to you.
[45:15] B: Yes.
[45:17] A: Right. Like it's not a very high bar to set, but I'm hoping I can, I can manage to do that. Yeah. And that, that's, that's the whole aspect of where we're headed. Any, any questions?
[45:28] B: No.
[45:28] A: No. Good. All right, so the next visit we're going to meet for like a really long time, but it won't feel that way because we're going to be doing a whole bunch of work to get things better.
[45:39] B: Okay.
[45:40] A: Right. But in that chunk of time, it's like three hours where you get to hang out with me and we get to do stuff so that when you leave just like with that experience, stuff that was bothering you isn't bothering you at all.
[45:52] B: Okay.
[45:52] A: And then as you move through life, stuff that you don't do that thing. Stop doing that thing. I might get mildly irritated, but it's like, you know the speed bump. Right, right. That I'm much more content in me and. Okay. Being present, I'm not so future worried.
[46:11] B: Alright?
[46:12] A: Yeah. That's where we're headed. Okay, cool. Awesome. All right, well, we will stop with that for now. Oh, actually, you know what? I'm going to do one thing. If you were, if you were to kind of think of a way to symbolize like a future you. Right. The you that's present, that's lighter, that's free, that's more at peace, that's unburdened. Right. If we think of a you and symbolize it with a wild animal, what animal comes to mind? Future you. Peaceful, clear, free, light.
[47:01] B: I think a koala.
[47:02] A: A koala. Beautiful. All right, so we're gonna do a little process. The koala becomes a symbol symbolizing the future you where we're headed. Got it. We want to. That we do. Because your brain emotionally responds to symbols. That's why you see a yellow arch and you think McDonald's brain responds to symbols. So the process, the little homework assignment is I'm gonna describe it and then we'll do it together. You're gonna look up, you're gonna think koala. Picture the koala. Take a slow breath in and then exhale and close your eyes. And then inhale and then exhale and open your eyes. So go ahead and look up, think koala. Deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. Breathe in with your eyes closed. And then exhale with your eyes opening. Good. That small little thing is priming your brain towards the future. You already knowing what we've got cleared. So every time you think of the koala, it's just organizing mind even more and more layering in the foundation so that when we get together, we can in getting things better. Cool. Well, really great meeting you. I'm so excited to get together with you. And I think we're going to be able to do really useful heal of stuff. Yeah. Cool. All right, well, we will stop with that. You can come with me.
