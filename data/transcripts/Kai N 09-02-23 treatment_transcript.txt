[00:00] A: Today is the 2nd of September, and, Kay. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful and transformative, that might be made available in teaching and training other professionals on how to do this. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:15] B: Yes.
[00:16] A: Cool. So how did our last session leave you? Because we did that one little piece about that one little thing. When you think about that one little thing now, what do you notice?
[00:26] B: Um, I actually. That hasn't really crossed my mind.
[00:31] A: I know. Isn't that crazy? Right? And then even when you think about it now, because you just did, it doesn't have the same feelings. Isn't that cool?
[00:39] B: Okay.
[00:40] A: Right. That's how we want a lot of the things that happen that suck to be. Oh, okay. Right. Because this is where we're headed. So that that's happening. Cool. Any stuff that you think would be useful for me to know in between when we got together last time and now because you were thinking once you saw it on the calendar.
[01:01] B: Well, I guess for myself, I've been noticing some issues with, like, phones ringing, scared that I'm gonna get a phone call, somebody's dead.
[01:08] A: Oh, okay.
[01:09] B: Because I've lost a lot of loved ones. Like, I lost my older brother, my nana.
[01:13] A: Right.
[01:13] B: And it's been like a repeating pattern for, like, years. So now every time, the phone calls.
[01:19] A: Well, not that. Just other people.
[01:21] B: Huh?
[01:22] A: The repeating pattern wasn't them dying every.
[01:24] B: No. Yeah.
[01:25] A: They didn't know. Right.
[01:27] B: Somebody I cared about.
[01:28] A: Guys always okay, dying. So there's a little bit of a angsty thing about, like.
[01:33] B: And then I, like, sit there and I think in my head, I'm like, when is my mom gonna die? When is this person gonna die? What if this person dies and I constantly.
[01:41] A: How can you know? Are you, like, really a good fortune teller? Like, okay, Mom's gonna die April 27th of 2039?
[01:49] B: I hope not.
[01:50] A: I mean, but, like, how are you ever gonna know that?
[01:52] B: I don't think I will ever know that.
[01:55] A: Right. But is the worry really about, like, mom and what might happen? Or is it worried about if that happens to mom whenever it happens? Am I gonna be okay?
[02:06] B: I think it's more if I'm going to be okay and if I make the amends with her that I need to.
[02:12] A: Or you just get it so that you're not hurting over the stuff she did. Or is there stuff that you did that you need to, like, apologize for?
[02:20] B: There's definitely stuff that I need to apologize for.
[02:22] A: Okay, cool. Okay. But there's probably also some stuff that she did.
[02:28] B: Yeah, there's a lot of things she.
[02:29] A: Did that you just don't want to be troubled by.
[02:31] B: Yeah.
[02:32] A: Right. Whether you have to, like, forgive or not.
[02:34] B: Yeah.
[02:35] A: Yeah. Okay, we can do that. What else? Because we got that part right.
[02:44] B: Yeah.
[02:46] A: You've been thinking about loss, dying.
[02:48] B: Yeah.
[02:48] A: What could. Might happen? Am I going to be okay? Have I made the amends? So worry about some future.
[02:55] B: I got into, like, a conflict with somebody at the house that I'm staying in, and it was over something stupid. Like, it wasn't even something to be for me to engage in. Like, I should have just walked away, but in the moment, I just couldn't find myself walking away because I felt like the person just continues to target me, and it's making me, like, kind of frustrated. So I was just like, you know, you're unnecessary to me pretty much. And then she called me stupid, and then she was like, oh, I'm gonna hurt you. And I'm like, so now you're threatening me. And I was like, I wanted to be very messy. Pretty much. Like, I really wanted to spaz out at her. I was kind of wishing, like, bad things on her. And I usually don't get out of that. Get like that. I don't like getting out of character. Like, I'm the one that. That's in the house. That's the comedian. Make everybody laugh.
[03:52] A: Yeah.
[03:52] B: I try to keep the peace. I'm the youngest. All of them are, like, 35, 36. My mom's 37. So I try to have that respect towards them because I am very young, and I feel like my mind goes to. Like, if they were almost. They could have had me. I could be their kid. So the most I can give them is respect, and I try to give that respect to them. But I also feel like respect goes both ways. And if you're going to disrespect me, I'm going to disrespect you. And I feel like that's a very bad mindset, definitely for myself. Just because somebody disrespect me, I know that doesn't mean I have to disrespect them too, but I feel like I have to, and I can't get out of that mindset.
[04:33] A: Okay, so how do you want to be? Like, if you weren't feeling like you had to, how would you be?
[04:38] B: I just want to be able to be like, okay, you're childish.
[04:41] A: Brush it off.
[04:42] B: Okay, okay, this is unnecessary. Whatever.
[04:45] A: So, like, water running on the roof?
[04:46] B: Yes. Because it's not even like I want this person to like me or, like, I want to be friends with this person. You don't mean nothing to me. We're not friends.
[04:55] A: Right.
[04:55] B: You're not family. I don't have to worry about you. But for some reason, you're getting all up under my skin and you shouldn't.
[05:03] A: Okay.
[05:04] B: And that's how I feel. Like, yes, I can care about you and hope good for you, because I have that kind of heart, but I shouldn't be letting you get under my skin because you're nothing.
[05:14] A: Is that what you mean when you say, get under my skin? Right. And then that this person is, like, targeting you? So you. You've been feeling, like, on purpose, they've been doing stuff to irritate or bug you or get under your skin.
[05:29] B: Yeah. She's said a lot of comments about things like, oh, you need to use common sense, or, oh, you're trying to burn yourself. Like, when I try to take something out oven, and she makes these, like, very rude jokes, and I'm just kind of like, are you serious?
[05:45] A: Rude jokes that aren't funny? Yeah, they're not really, because they're kind of, like, offensive.
[05:48] B: They're, like, targeting, like, you know, because I used to. My impulse control used to be bad at the other house before this one. And I would, like, just go and bring something out of the oven without any mitts on.
[06:00] A: Oh, my.
[06:03] B: I thought, like, it wouldn't burn, but my thought is, oh, it's done. I need to take it out.
[06:07] A: Got it.
[06:08] B: Instead of, oh, you need to put some gloves on, then take it out.
[06:11] A: Yeah.
[06:11] B: Because I didn't expect it to be that hot.
[06:13] A: Yeah.
[06:13] B: But I guess I also think, like, I'm some kind of, like, I can't.
[06:17] A: Get hurt person Avengers.
[06:18] B: I've been hurt so much.
[06:19] A: You're like an Avenger.
[06:20] B: Yeah.
[06:21] A: Right. Like, I mean, those guys get hurt a lot.
[06:23] B: Right?
[06:24] A: Right. I mean, those Avengers get hurt a lot. Like, they get thrown, knocked on the ground, smash their head. Right. See some of the stuff that happens with Iron Man.
[06:32] B: Yeah.
[06:33] A: Right. They get hurt, but then they keep going.
[06:36] B: Yeah.
[06:36] A: You were an Avenger, except you're like, Tom.
[06:41] B: Yes.
[06:44] A: Okay. But so she sets up a mean about you having done that.
[06:47] B: Yes. And she screams at me, and there's another girl.
[06:52] A: So you want to have some more freedom from her so that her being that way doesn't. And her pressing those buttons doesn't cause that response anymore.
[07:03] B: Yeah.
[07:03] A: Okay, we can do that.
[07:04] B: I think it's kind of my fault she does that, though, because I kind of let her take me under her wing. And first, like, you know, like a mom figure, because she reminded me a lot of my mom.
[07:17] A: She's okay.
[07:19] B: 36.
[07:20] A: Yeah.
[07:20] B: Very close to my mom's age.
[07:21] A: Yeah.
[07:22] B: And she acts like her, talks like.
[07:26] A: Her, so there's a little bit of transference and counter transference with her.
[07:29] B: And then she started being very rude to me, and I was like, okay, I'm just gonna distance myself away from her.
[07:36] A: Does that happen sometimes with mom, too?
[07:40] B: My mom's just a very negative person.
[07:42] A: So a little bit similar. Right. So that's what's going on.
[07:46] B: Yeah.
[07:47] A: Right. So there's a. In therapy, we call it transference, countertransference, or projection. So the transference is like, she's like your mom and representation of your mom. So the same kind of stuff is showing up that affects you with your mom and affects you more than, like, other people affect you.
[08:08] B: Right.
[08:08] A: Because other people that don't matter, you're like, they don't matter to me.
[08:11] B: Right.
[08:11] A: They're nothing. Like, I got it. It's gone.
[08:14] B: Right.
[08:14] A: Right. But this hasn't been that way.
[08:16] B: Right.
[08:17] A: Yeah. Okay. So we want more freedom there. Cool. What else?
[08:27] B: I've been having a lot of bad dreams and weird ones. Like, I wouldn't say they're all bad, but I've been dreaming a lot of, like, my nana and my brother, which have passed.
[08:37] A: Yeah. Nana was the woman who was really good to you.
[08:40] B: Yeah.
[08:41] A: Yeah. And my brother, like, that was Marchish. That was May 2, new as an.
[08:46] B: M. And then my brother, it hit a year, April 20.
[08:51] A: That was the one that mom brought you up to. You take a gander.
[08:55] B: Yeah.
[08:56] A: Right.
[08:57] B: And I've been dreaming of them. I don't really find myself thinking of them when I'm awake.
[09:03] A: Okay.
[09:04] B: Like, as much.
[09:06] A: And when you're dreaming about them, does it feel good?
[09:08] B: No, it kind of.
[09:09] A: It. Is it sad?
[09:10] B: It's not really sad. It's just, like, me, like, I'm, like, talking to her, and I'm like, I'm coming over to your house.
[09:16] A: Yeah.
[09:16] B: But in my mind, like, I guess I know she's dead. So in my dream, I know she's dead.
[09:22] A: No. And you're saying that.
[09:24] B: Yeah, Like, I know she's dead in my dream. And I try to get to her.
[09:28] A: Before she dies, she's gone. Oh.
[09:30] B: But every time, it's like I'm FaceTiming her, but I Can't see her. She's there. I know she's there.
[09:36] A: Okay.
[09:36] B: I saw balloons.
[09:37] A: You can't have the same. Right. You're not seeing her in the same way you did?
[09:40] B: Yeah.
[09:40] A: Okay.
[09:41] B: And then she had balloons, and I sent balloons up to her at one point. So I didn't know, like, she was visiting me. Like, some people saying, I don't know. I don't believe that. I don't. It didn't feel like her. Like, she sends this good spirit to me. It felt very, like, draining.
[09:59] A: Okay.
[09:59] B: And then when I dream of my brother, it's kind of like. It kind of feels evil, and I'm just, like, scared.
[10:07] A: That right?
[10:08] B: Yeah.
[10:09] A: And with those two things there, the stuff is still, like, active, meaning we could say there's still some pain attached to the loss. We want to get that part unplugged more so that you're more at peace. Cool. Any other stuff?
[10:43] B: That's pretty much it right now.
[10:45] A: Well, there we go. Right. So we got the thing that. And that kind of ties into the same stuff where. What I've noticed is there's been forecasting about possible loss and how I'll handle it. And I know that there's been lots of loss, so I'm being affected by it. So we want that completely unplugged. We want to get it so that thin that goes on with that other person, even if they press those buttons, it's not doing that in you.
[11:10] B: You know, I just thought about something else, actually.
[11:12] A: Okay.
[11:12] B: While we were speaking, another thing that's been bought through me is a girl that I used to be friends with. We robbed somebody, and he got shot. And in the midst of him getting shot, like, he looked over and asked me if I was okay. And he was somebody I consider a friend. And I struggle with addiction, but I never would have gone to the extreme that I did that night. I would never let you.
[11:47] A: Isn't that the thing that had you change?
[11:50] B: Yeah.
[11:51] A: Isn't that cool? But there's still, like, troubling emotion about.
[11:55] B: That happening because it's just like, I can't believe I let my far. My. Myself get that far out, because I know I'm not that stupid. And I lost control over myself. And you would. I feel like I hold a lot of blame towards myself because I saw my mom go through the same thing, and I should have saw it quicker than I did.
[12:17] A: And for some reason, that's versus feeling good about seeing it at all, because you could just not see it.
[12:24] B: Yeah. It's true.
[12:26] A: Right. And maybe seeing it sooner than her mom, that is.
[12:30] B: Yeah.
[12:30] A: Oh, right. That neither of those things would be better, would they? Right. I mean, look, neither one of those things would be better right over here at me. Look, neither one of those things would be better. Right.
[12:43] B: Right.
[12:49] A: So there's still bad feelings about what happened, even though, you know, in that happening it was the dramatic thing you needed to change your life for the better.
[13:00] B: Yeah.
[13:00] A: Yeah. So we want to have a little bit of, like, good feelings attached to that. I've changed my life and changing my life for the better, even though that other thing had happened.
[13:14] B: Right.
[13:14] A: Yeah. Okay. We can get that better. Yeah. That's the stuff that we want to get taken care of. Right. So we want you to be more at peace with things. What's happening now, by the way?
[13:32] B: Um, I don't know. I'm just.
[13:34] A: Well, I know you were in, like.
[13:36] B: It's like I'm listening.
[13:37] A: Talking to yourself.
[13:38] B: To me, I guess every time I talk about it because it bothers me. It's like, almost reliving it, and it, like, makes my stomach feel.
[13:49] A: Is that what it just did?
[13:50] B: Yeah.
[13:51] A: Oh. When you talked about that moment with him, asking you whether you're okay.
[13:55] B: Yeah.
[13:55] A: Because you weren't here with me when you said it.
[14:00] B: Yeah.
[14:00] A: You were there. Right. Do you remember the reason why we have the emotions we do? It's because the brain doesn't know it's over. Moment over. So what would be better? Do you want to know what would be better? I'll tell you.
[14:15] B: Yeah.
[14:15] A: It's not a secret you coming back here with me because I'm fun. That's right. Like, I want you to be back here with me. Not there, because this is and that isn't. We'll do what we need to do to get the effect that that's continued to have on you gone. So it's not weighing on you like it has been. Right. Because we can still not like that it happened and feel really relieved that it did, because it is the thing that catapulted me to changing my life for the better. Right. Which. That's the part that we want to start to feel really good about, don't you think?
[14:47] B: Yes.
[14:47] A: Yeah, I agree with that. Sorry. Misplacing my water. Yeah. Okay, cool. So how do we get started? Well, you get here with me. That's how we get started. Then we do processes. Right. So what we want to start to connect is putting your body into the right states for healing. We know that the right states for healing are resting States and that we have a process using brain levers that put the body into a state of rest. Right. But we also want to have an idea, Kay, of how do we want you to be when we're done with what we're doing. Right. So that feeling that you got around that stuff, the you that I'm seeing, she remembers that kind of feeling, but if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't know how to get it. The you that I'm seeing, she's at peace. The you that I'm seeing is much more comfortable in her own skin. Got it. The you that I'm seeing is much more present, so that she's experiencing that other resident stuff as being about them, not me. And it kind of slides off her like rainwater. Got it. This is the you that I'm seeing. The you that I'm seeing being present. The pain around loss has been lightened so that she's got more of an ongoing connection with those that matter to her. Got it. This is the you that I'm seeing. Right. And you don't have to see this. You just like me. Because the question is not how it's going to happen, it's would it be okay? Right. So would it be okay for you to be this way? Right. Right. No downside either. Right. Isn't that cool?
[16:31] B: Yeah.
[16:32] A: Yeah. So then with it, okay, we've got a green light. If we symbolize this, you like, you know, I don't know, something out in the wild to symbolize the future. You could be an animal, something out in nature, something from the sky, formation of the earth to symbolize the you who's at peace, who's okay, who's free. What comes to mind?
[17:05] B: A dolphin.
[17:06] A: A dolphin. Beautiful. So now we've got a dolphin as a symbol to symbolize you, which means that part of your brain that does automatic work responds to symbols. Watch. You see a big yellow arch on the side of the road. What are you thinking of? That's right. Isn't that interesting? Right? Your mind responds to symbols. So now we've got the perfect symbol, the dolphin, to organize towards. We want to add responsiveness. Really simple and easy. You look up with your eyes, you think dolphin, and take a slow breath in. That's pretty simple, wasn't it? Good. Second exact. Same thing as that. This time, though, when you, after inhaling, you exhale, look up, think dolphin. Breathe in and then exhale. Good. Same thing. Look up, think dolphin, big breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Good. You can open your eyes. Look Up. Think dolphin. Deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Keep your eyes closed. Bring awareness to your breath. Notice your breathing. That's right. In a way that's a little slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. As you're aware of your breath, you can hear the background sounds, even my voice, and how it feels to be seated in the way you are. At the same time, your unconscious is organizing towards now what the dolphin is symbolizing, beginning to change wiring at deeper levels inside. Priming your brain to restructure, rewire, reorganize, to optimize how you move through your day and into your week and beyond. That's right. So that the next time k your eyes rest closed, it'll be even easier to just sink, like all the way down. Like a big rock being dropped in the center of a clear lake. Just plunges all the way down, down, down, down towards the bottom. That's right. When you're ready, take your time finding your way back up. Right. Begin by taking a big deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Right. And what are you noticing in you now?
[20:04] B: Calmness.
[20:05] A: It is a calmness. Right. And as you're noticing the calmness, I want to show you something. Take this arm, this one right here. Place it on that. But hold this. Let's put this one there. Just like that. Take that hand. Turn it like that. Like that. Look there. Got that spot right there. As you're looking at that spot right there, don't do anything at all on purpose to move that hand or move those fingers. Just focus on that spot right there. As you're focused on that spot, you might begin to notice. That's right. Vibrational movements happening within the fingers of that hand. And I don't know because I'm curious. That's right. When you'll begin to notice, instead of just the vibrational movement, little twitches, wiggles or jumps. That's right. But in the fingers of that hand. That's right. It might be a wiggle or a jump or a twitch. That's right. Within the fingers. That's right. Within that hand. And see the reeling within that. As you've been looking at that spot on your hand, you haven't been paying much attention to your right big toe. That's right. But you can notice your left big toe even while looking at that spot and having more curiosity as to what will happen. When I notice little twitches. That's really. Jumps and jerks. That's right. You can bring awareness to your breath and begin to Slow down your breathing. Thinking that the dolphin is your mind. That's right. Is rewiring. And I don't know when you'll begin to. And notice that every time your eyes blink. That's right. That your eyes close. That every time your eyes blink and close. That's right. That one. They're closed. That's right. They rest. That's right. And then when your eyes rest closed, you also rest. That's right. Resting with your eyes closed deepens mind responsiveness. And see, what you haven't noticed is that hand is now cataleptic. Notice how it's not moving at all. So catalepty means that we can take it and just kind of bend it like wax. Isn't that interesting what happens with cataleptic. Right. Isn't that interesting? And then it just falls down and you can close your eyes and drift down like a feather. Down, down and inside towards that calm play, peaceful flowing energy. The light that is you. That's right. That's right. As mind responds to the dolphin, also to changes in our. There's ones you notice, there's ones you won't. But here's a cool thing. Take one more deep breath in, exhale, and open your eyes. And think of a time when you were outdoors in nature seeing something beautiful. Like you're looking at it, it's like, wow. Yeah. What is it that you're seeing?
[24:23] B: A rainbow.
[24:24] A: Yeah. And isn't there a moment that as you see the rainbow, you feel peace?
[24:28] B: Yeah.
[24:29] A: Right. And some people would say it's the rainbow that gives you the feelings. But if we looked at it differently, we could say the rainbow drew your awareness in because at your center, you are peaceful. Kind of like if I had the campfire and my hands are cold and I bring them down towards the flames and I go, the fire is getting hotter. You go, no, it's not.
[24:50] B: You're getting closer.
[24:51] A: That's right. So we know that in life, awareness has been different times away from here. But no matter where it's been, always here. Peace and excitement. Right? Two of us are in here. You know it. You look around, right? That's knowledge. Knowledge of light, wisdom, light of wisdom, Knowledge, light, wisdom. We walk around thinking, I am my body. Did you know you're not your body, by the way? Did you know that you have a body, that your body's yours, but it isn't actually you?
[25:26] B: Yeah, we have a soul.
[25:30] A: Ah, good change. Because you just said it. We have it as if it's a thing that we have. That's why I got scared. Scared when I said that prayer. Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. I was scared because it was going to take it from me. As if it's something I have versus it is who I am. It is my light. That light is me. We call it a soul. The spirit in essence. Right. So you have a body, totally yours. It isn't you. No cell within your body is the same as it was when you were born. They've all been replaced. Right. But you're still you. Right. You have thoughts, but you're not the thinker of them. Your brain is the thinker of your thoughts, which you have one. Just like you have a heart. Right. And you also have a hip. They're yours, they're not you.
[26:22] B: Right.
[26:22] A: Make sense? So then we go, oh, you're not your body, you're not your thoughts. Well, you can't be a feeling because you feel different ways at different times. Well, I'm not that. Oh, you must be what you do. Or you must do what you do. But you're not what you do, are you? Because if you do one thing to do something else, you don't stop existing. So if you're not what you do, and if you're not your thoughts, feelings or body, what are you?
[26:51] B: You're you.
[26:52] A: Yeah. So let's say for our purposes, K, that who you are is what you became aware of as you see the reflection.
[26:59] B: Rainbow.
[27:01] A: Got it. That the who you are is the light at the center. And see, the light that is you, it can't be touched or hurt or harmed. It only experiences the love that it allows in. What's happening now.
[27:20] B: Emotions.
[27:21] A: Yeah. Well, how so? Like, is it making sense?
[27:25] B: Yeah.
[27:26] A: And is it ringing true?
[27:28] B: Yeah.
[27:29] A: Because I'll show you something that'll be really interesting to you. Take that hand now and pull it up like that. Good. I'm gonna just move this out of the way because I normally knock it over. I'm gonna slide this thing in. I want you to look at that spot right there on that end. And then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take my hand and I'm gonna move it towards your hand. So I'm not going to touch your hand, but with the peripheral vision of your eyes, you can see my hand beginning to move in towards your hand. That's right. And I'm not sure when you're going to begin to notice the Energy. Notice how you can kind of feel an energy between my hand and your hand. Let me know when you feel it.
[28:10] B: I feel air.
[28:11] A: You feel air?
[28:12] B: Yeah. Like when your hand got closer, it got colder.
[28:15] A: It got colder. Isn't that interesting? Now though, what happens? That's right. Isn't that interesting? You can feel that kind of vibration. Isn't that weird?
[28:27] B: Very weird.
[28:29] A: Right? But see, here's the cool part. What's happening is I'm actually coming closer to touching who you really are. Light at the center. What you became aware of is the brain. You see the rainbow. You're becoming aware of you. And see, I'm coming closer to touching who you are without touching your body. That's right. So I'm really coming closer to touching you than anybody that ever hurt you. Body, feelings, thoughts. Right? Because who you are can be touched with respect. Right? Mutual connection. That's right. Same interests. What you're wanting for you. What I'm wanting for you. That's right. You can feel the energy. That's right. Isn't that weird? Because notice what happens when it's not there. How different it is than when it's here.
[29:31] B: Isn't that cool?
[29:33] A: That's right. That's right. So you may have a finger and a toe, but you're not your finger or your toe. You have an elbow. You're not at your elbow either. So repeat this after me. I have a nose.
[29:50] B: I have a nose.
[29:51] A: I'm not my nose.
[29:52] B: I'm not my nose.
[29:53] A: My nose is mine.
[29:54] B: My nose is mine.
[29:54] A: But it isn't me.
[29:55] B: But it is.
[29:56] A: I have a foot.
[29:57] B: I have a foot.
[29:57] A: I'm not my foot.
[29:58] B: I'm not my foot.
[29:59] A: My foot is mine.
[30:00] B: My foot is mine.
[30:01] A: But it isn't me.
[30:01] B: But it isn't me.
[30:02] A: I have an ass. I'm not my ass.
[30:05] B: I'm not my ass.
[30:06] A: My ass is mine.
[30:07] B: My ass is mine.
[30:08] A: But it isn't me.
[30:08] B: But it isn't me.
[30:09] A: That's right. They mess with my stuff. Cause in life, somebody might have messed with your stuff, hurt your feelings, screwed up your thinking. But you know what? They never touched who you really are. And see that news. Okay, what you're learning now, we want to get into that earlier. You, who doesn't fully know it makes sense.
[30:36] B: Yeah.
[30:36] A: That's what we want to get in that they might have messed with my stuff. And for a while, it screwed up my thinking and feeling. I worked with one girl one time. Her older brother did yucky stuff when she was like five, taking matchbox cars and parking them. So there was a lot of yucky feelings. And when it was gone, we cleared. It was gone. She didn't have the bad feelings. I had to ask her, where is it? Or where was it? She goes, it's gone. I don't have it. And then we started thinking, like, oh, my goodness, when you were little, your brother, he messed with your stuff. She looked at me and goes, yeah, I did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and my feeling. And then she looked at me and she had this big glow and this power about her. She said, you know what? He never touched me. See, we want that information in make sense to that deeper part of the brain that doesn't fully know. And then the last little part is, how do you clear something? It's really simple. We've done it before. And we know how we clear it is, one, it's okay to be okay. Two, that you stay here with me because I'm more fun. And. Come on. I keep sitting on this funny pillow only because I'm working on my pelvic floor, tan tien core. And it enables me to sit in a way that keeps it uncomfortable. It's getting better. Like, so. It was really uncomfortable when I first did it, but now that I've been doing it for a while, I can really feel it and it's interesting.
[32:04] B: I gotta get my pasta right.
[32:05] A: Pasta? Yeah.
[32:08] B: I'm gonna be hunchbacked by the time I'm 30.
[32:13] A: I don't know about that. Yeah.
[32:15] B: I'm gonna look like a diet roach.
[32:17] A: No. Okay, cool. That's nice. Upside down. So how you feeling now? What do you notice? How's your body feeling?
[32:26] B: Hyper.
[32:26] A: Hyper? What does that mean?
[32:29] B: I don't know. I get these very, like, these weird bursts of just energy.
[32:32] A: Yeah.
[32:34] B: And I talked to one of the staff at the program I met, and I was like, I don't know. Sometimes I feel like the inner child of me is just wanting to play. Like, just wants to come out and.
[32:43] A: Just like, this is why it's here, because it wants to play. But see, what we're gonna play is we're gonna get the stuff that was affecting her cleared. That's how we're gonna play. But we're gonna be fine because, like, we like to be fine. And being here is better than that. That's right. Yeah. So how we clear stuff. Right. We've already got the brain prepped and primed. What's going to start happening is your brain that maybe even, you know, inner child Whatever. You're not pregnant though, are you? Because that would be a really different kind of inner child we're talking about. Okay, good. So it may trail us back to a particular negative moment. Yeah, it's got one. You might have been how old?
[33:23] B: I don't know, for like my whole childhood.
[33:24] A: Well, I know, but we want to narrow to one because Jesus, if you told me we have to have every single ant in the world come in or one at a time, I go, let's do one at a time.
[33:33] B: No, the first number I would say would be eight.
[33:36] A: Good. So and the particular experience. You got a moment. One particular time. One thing that happened at 8, my.
[33:43] B: Mom used to trap.
[33:44] A: You got one. Right. So you got a particular time. Good. Now again, we want you to be here with me. This is. That isn't right. We're working on the goal. I'm more fun. Two, when you tell me it's just facts. That, that, that, that, that, that. Then it was over. Three, There have been things after that, after eight, that were better than that. Be here. Hi. Notice how you're there again? No, I want you to be here. My job, by the way. I'm gonna do everything I can to keep you here. So if I'm noticing that you're going there. Hey, Kay, get back here. Because you were going there. I know. I want you to be with me. This is. That is it. That's right. That's right. So what's something you've done later that was more fun than that?
[34:26] B: Um, I got adopted.
[34:31] A: Uh huh. That was more fun.
[34:33] B: Yeah.
[34:34] A: All right. So getting adopted. Right. Something else. You know, anytime from eight until yesterday, I mean.
[34:44] B: I went to the beach.
[34:46] A: Went to the beach.
[34:46] B: Good.
[34:47] A: Something else. How many days are you clean on.
[34:56] B: The 10th will be 90.
[34:57] A: Almost 90 days clean. That's better, right? Good. Something else.
[35:04] B: My adoptive family was approved to come down on Sunday.
[35:08] A: Nice. So they're coming to see you. Awesome. So we got those things happen after that. Way more enjoyable than that. Now we want to think of a specific time. Mom did that while being here with me. Hi. Right. And knowing that we have really kick ass good news for the eight year old you. Because here's the thing. This is really key and I don't know whether you know this or not. Do you want to know it? Should I tell you that younger you doesn't know that awful moment is over? She doesn't know about having almost 90 days clean, about our adoptive family being able to come down about going to the Bee. She doesn't Know second she thought all that stuff happening to her meant something about her worth. Does it? No. We know that logically, but she doesn't fully know that. So don't. And don't we also want to get in that she survived it? Because there are moments of it that she wasn't sure she was going to survive it that she did. That's kick ass. Good news. Right. So we have really, really good news to get into that earlier. You. She's troubled only because she doesn't know those moments are over. What do you and I know? Well, we know, but like sometimes you don't fully feel. But we know that you're not eight. That's right. You're not eight, are you? No. How old are you?
[36:29] B: 18.
[36:29] A: Right. So that's 10 years ago. Right. You're not eight, which is really cool. You're an adult and you can actually make your own decisions now. That's right. Which you couldn't then, but you can now. Right. We want that eight year old to know that too. Right. And how she's actually valuing herself and doing stuff to make a difference. Isn't that cool?
[36:49] B: Yeah.
[36:49] A: Yeah. Let's start to feel good about that. Right. So that thing happened one of the times it happened. You were eight. You were where?
[36:58] B: I lived at my grandma's house.
[37:00] A: Well, you're at grandma's house. Then mom came over.
[37:03] B: She lived there at the time.
[37:04] A: Right. So mom lived there too. And then mom said, let's go.
[37:07] B: She said we were going to McDonald's.
[37:08] A: So she had goin to McDonald's. Who's not in for McDonald's?
[37:11] B: I'm in.
[37:12] A: Right. I'm gonna get a Big Mac. No, we only have room for cheeseburgers. Can I get an apple pie? All right, you can get an apple pie. So we're going to McDonald's. Right. And then what happened?
[37:22] B: We didn't go to McDonald's.
[37:23] A: We drove right past my mom. McDonald's mom. Right. So then you drove past McDonald's, right?
[37:31] B: Yeah.
[37:31] A: And you went where? So you went to this guy's house. Right. Good. And it was like a really nice, fancy looking house, wasn't it?
[37:40] B: No, it was like apartment.
[37:41] A: It was like an apartment, wasn't it?
[37:42] B: Yeah, that's right.
[37:43] A: Until you went into whatever apartment it was. Right. Good. Then what happened next? And then be here. Hi. Hi. Good. Yeah. Right. No, I want here. Hi. Hi. Good job. Kay.
[37:56] B: There was like a couple guys.
[37:58] A: Yeah. So there were a couple guys there. Right.
[38:00] B: And my mom just left after that.
[38:03] A: Right. So mom left you in there with a couple guys said, all right, sweetie, I'm out. Yeah, they got the other stuff out here. You good? Right? So she left. Right. And then you're like, what's up, guys? Well, then what happened?
[38:17] B: Um, and be here.
[38:21] A: You can go really fast. You want me to tell you what might have happened? I mean, we can guess. They put scuba masks on and big, huge flippers and started walking around the room going, ah, no, it doesn't want to happen. That would have been a lot funny, right? That would have been a hell of a lot better. What do they do? Do they take your clothes off? Not first. What'd they do first?
[38:46] B: They, like, made me sit next to them.
[38:48] A: So they made you sit next to them. Right. Good. And then what happened? Be here.
[38:50] B: And then they, like, would touch my.
[38:52] A: Thigh, and then they touch your thigh and talk to you. And some of that might have been nice. Some of it was weird. Oh, weird. Good job. Right, and then what happened next?
[39:01] B: And then the clothes came off.
[39:04] A: Right. Then they took their clothes off, or you. They took your clothes off. Right. Good. And that was weird and scary.
[39:09] B: Yeah.
[39:10] A: Right. And then what happened? Right, and then what happened?
[39:12] B: They touched me.
[39:13] A: Well, they touched your body.
[39:15] B: Yeah.
[39:15] A: Like, and they might have touched the outside of your body. They might have put their hands or fingers in different body parts.
[39:21] B: Yeah.
[39:23] A: And again, some of that might have felt good. Some of it would have been weird. Right. And then what happened next?
[39:32] B: Afterwards, my mom.
[39:33] A: Well, then, did they put their penises in your body? No. They just touched your body and touched different parts of your body and put their fingers in different parts of your body.
[39:41] B: Yeah.
[39:41] A: Right. And then they stopped at some point. Right. And then you got your clothes back on. Right. And then what happened next?
[39:49] B: My mom picked me up.
[39:50] A: Mom came and got you, which was better than when you were there with them. And then you went back to grandma's house. Right. And then that moment was over. And then later on, you went to the beach. Your. Your adoptive family got approved to come down.
[40:04] B: Yeah.
[40:04] A: Right, Right. You did those things, and you did one other thing that was really fun. What do you remember? Come on. There were three things. Gotta go to the beach. We got the adoptive family being approved to come down.
[40:18] B: Oh, I got adopted.
[40:19] A: Well, that one was a good one. There's one more.
[40:21] B: Wait, there's one more.
[40:23] A: More recent.
[40:26] B: I almost got 90 days, so boom.
[40:31] A: Right, Right. Good. So notice as you were going through it, some of that, but you were intending to be here, so we got you out of it. All right. Now you're here more. Now we're going to go backwards so we can completely unplug it and take away the charge. So we go backwards. Right. So we've got, well, I mean, you know, almost having 90 days clean, right. We got going to the beach. We got them coming down on Sunday.
[40:55] B: Right?
[40:56] A: Right. And then before that, you were back at Grandma's, then Mom was driving you, and then mom picked you up, right? Then you had your clothes on, and then they stop. And then they had touched different parts of your body and put their fingers in different parts of your body, and that was all weird. And then they had taken your clothes off, and then they had been talking by. And then putting their hands on your body. And then they asked you to go sit next to them or in between them. Right. And then Mom's like, peace. No. Then, you know, you guys went in there, and then she pulled up to that complex. Right. And then before that, she drove right by McDonald's. Mom. Right. And then she said, hey, you want to go to McDonald's? Well, then you guys had left, and before that she said, hey, you want to go to McDonald's? Then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[41:44] B: Nothing like talking about it was harder, but.
[41:50] A: Right. You can remember it happening, right? You can remember putting on your fool's shoes.
[41:54] B: Yeah.
[41:55] A: Well, stop putting on your cool sneaks. Say, I'm not putting on my cool sneaks.
[41:58] B: I'm not putting on my watch.
[41:59] A: Well, stop me from putting on my watch. Say, you're not putting on your watch.
[42:01] B: You're not putting on your watch.
[42:02] A: Well, then stop them from touching your body. Say, they're not touching my body.
[42:04] B: They're not touching my body.
[42:06] A: Well, stop mom from dropping you off there. Say, mom's not doing it.
[42:09] B: She's not dropping.
[42:09] A: Well, then you stop putting on your bracelet.
[42:12] B: I'm not putting on my bracelet.
[42:13] A: Well, stop it from happening. What's not happening? Where is it go? It doesn't exist.
[42:16] B: It doesn't exist.
[42:17] A: Right. And as you get it, what do you notice? It doesn't exist. That's right. Close your eyes. Let the younger you know it's over. And not only is that one over, there's lots of other ones that are over that we're going to get to. We don't have to do them all. We're going to do a few because it'll generalize to the rest so that she's starting to learn that it's not about me. It had nothing to do with me at all. Everything to do with the situation and the stuff that I was in. Right. So that she gets it and that you're okay. She kissed her. The beach. Right. And as all of this is getting in. Kay. What's happening to that younger you?
[42:52] B: Excitement.
[42:53] A: It is exciting because she likes to play.
[42:56] B: Thank you.
[42:57] A: A lot of energy. So let's think of another moment because it happened around that time when mom was doing that. Did she drop you off at the same place?
[43:05] B: No.
[43:05] A: No. Oh, good. Well, I mean, we got to diversify.
[43:07] B: Yeah. She would drop me off, get my uncle's sometimes.
[43:11] A: Oh, this is a different time. And not the same thing as those two guys.
[43:16] B: It was more extreme.
[43:18] A: Oh, fun. Cool. So let's think of a time you might have been.
[43:23] B: How old it lasted.
[43:26] A: Yeah, I think one time you might have been how old?
[43:28] B: I don't know. I mean, it was a long time.
[43:29] A: Make it up. See, here's a cool part you can.
[43:31] B: Make up what, still eight.
[43:35] A: All right. So you made a minute. And then Mom's like, hey, you want to go to McDonald's? I'm not falling for that trick again.
[43:42] B: I always fell for it.
[43:43] A: Damn it.
[43:44] B: Mainly because I wanted my mom there. She wasn't really ever there.
[43:53] A: Oh. So it was an opportunity to be with mom. Just not the best, but it was better than none. Yeah. You thought then. Now we're not so sure.
[44:03] B: Yeah.
[44:04] A: Right. Okay. So this time, Mom's like, hey, do you wanna. Because you said she dropped you off at your uncle's. So Mom's like, we're going out or we're going over to your uncle's. Then she drops you off. Did she go inside?
[44:19] B: No, because her and Uncle.
[44:22] A: No, her sister. So she's like, all right, you're out. She pulled the car out and took off.
[44:27] B: Yeah.
[44:27] A: Then you're over. Then you're over. Right. Good.
[44:30] B: With Emma, he would give me baths.
[44:34] A: So he's like, okay, my turn. We'll go ahead and take a bath. Right. So you're in the bath. Right. We want to think of one time. We know that it happened way more than one time. Kay. But as we narrow our focus that it's one and we can even add other parts to this one, but it's still being read as one. It'll start to clear the rest. Kind of like when you learn how to tie a pair of sneakers, you learn on one pair, and then you can do all the other ones. Right. So that's what's starting to happen with this Stuff. Got it. So he had. So he wanted to do the bath. Right. And then what happened?
[45:08] B: He bathed me.
[45:09] A: Right. So he bleed you. Right. Washed your hair. All right, good. No one have an accident.
[45:14] B: I got out.
[45:14] A: All right, good. Then what happened?
[45:16] B: We went and sat on the couch.
[45:18] A: All right, so you went, sat on the couch. Right. You put BJ's on probably.
[45:20] B: Yeah.
[45:20] A: Right.
[45:21] B: He wanted me to sit on his.
[45:22] A: Right. So sit on my lap. Right. Good. And then what happened?
[45:24] B: He braided my hair.
[45:27] A: Amazing. Right? Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[45:29] B: And then he would be like, okay, time for bed. And I would go to my room and I would ask him to keep the light on or not to shut the door.
[45:39] A: Right. Good job. Then what happened next?
[45:41] B: He would shut the door on.
[45:43] A: Right. And shut the door. Right. And then it's dark. And then you're crying. Right.
[45:47] B: And then he would come in after my auntie went to sleep.
[45:50] A: Right. Good job. Good detail.
[45:51] B: And then he would touch me like the other ones did.
[45:55] A: So he came into the bed. Right. And then like he pulled your pants down. Right. And then he touched the bottom area. Right. And then he put his finger in.
[46:05] B: Yes.
[46:06] A: Your vagina.
[46:06] B: Yes.
[46:07] A: Right. And then he took it out. Right. And then used his thing. And then he put his penis in your vagina. And he did that. And then he stopped.
[46:15] B: Yeah.
[46:15] A: Right. And then he took it out. Right. And then did he pull his clothes back up?
[46:19] B: Yeah.
[46:19] A: And then you pulled your clothes back up or then he left.
[46:22] B: He would take off my. Like if I was wearing shorts.
[46:26] A: Yeah.
[46:26] B: It would be fully on the ground.
[46:27] A: Right.
[46:28] B: So then he would just pull my underwear back up.
[46:30] A: Right. So you pull your underwear back up. Right. And then you go to bed with just underwear. Right. And then he got out of the room.
[46:35] B: Yeah.
[46:36] A: And then that moment ended.
[46:37] B: Yeah.
[46:37] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to the beach. Right. Or those adopted. Right. And almost like really close to 90 days clean. How cool is that? Good job. I know. Good job.
[46:50] B: I'm excited.
[46:51] A: Yes, me too. For you. Right. And again, as we're going through it, what do you notice it? A little bit, but less because you're here.
[47:00] B: Yeah.
[47:00] A: Isn't that interesting? Isn't that cool?
[47:03] B: Yes.
[47:03] A: Right now we want to get it all going. So the brain totally reads it as data. Right. Because again, we go backwards. We got going to the beach, got almost 90 days. Right. The family's coming out. Right?
[47:19] B: Yeah.
[47:19] A: And then before that he was gone. Right. And then he had left. And then he pulled your underwear Back up. Then he pulled his underwear back up. And then he took his penis out. Then he had his penis in your vagina. And then he put his penis in your vagina. And then before that, he had touched your body and put his fingers in your vagina. And then before that, he had pulled down your pants. And then before that, he had gone to the room. And then before that, Auntie had gone to bed. And before that, you were crying. And then before that, you had said, hey, please don't. No, he had shut the light off. And then before that, you said, hey, please don't turn the light off. Or at least leave the door a crack. And then he had said, go to bed. And then he had braided your hair, and he asked you to sit on the lap. And then he had helped you put on your PJs. Towel off. And then he bathed you. Right. And then you guys said it was bath time. And then before that, you're all doing whatever you're doing. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, what do you notice? Hey. Like, nothing. I know. Isn't that cool? You can remember that happening? You can remember putting on your cool sneaks?
[48:18] B: Yes.
[48:18] A: You have to stop putting on your sneaks.
[48:20] B: I'm not putting on.
[48:21] A: Well, then stop him from doing that.
[48:22] B: He's not doing it.
[48:23] A: Yeah. Where is it? See? It doesn't exist.
[48:25] B: It doesn't exist.
[48:26] A: Right. And again, that happening. Was that about you?
[48:29] B: No.
[48:29] A: No. Or what was off with him?
[48:31] B: I don't know.
[48:32] A: Don't you think something was off with him to do that?
[48:34] B: A lot was.
[48:35] A: A lot was. You didn't know that when you were eight. Not like you do now. Right. So close your eyes. Picture that. You let her know first. That it's over, finished. That it no longer exists. 2. That him doing that had nothing to do with you. Everything to do with what was off with him. It's not about me. Right? Right. What do you notice happening to that earlier? That's right. Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[49:07] B: Yeah.
[49:07] A: Yeah. Notice how it doesn't have the same feelings, but there's another one around that same time frame of something that happened. Mom's like, let's go to McDonald's. Every once in a while. She might take us there. And then I got hooked. Because it wasn't every time that she took me somewhere else, sometimes she actually did take me to McDonald's. That was the problem. What's happening now?
[49:38] B: I don't know.
[49:39] A: Oh, you don't know? Oh, well. How's your body feeling?
[49:42] B: I don't know.
[49:43] A: Well, check. Just check inside right now. More tense. More calm. More agitated. More relaxed. More. I don't know, I'm just intense more.
[49:55] B: That's not even our emotion. But like.
[50:00] A: Like, like, is that meaning, like. Well, how come this stuff isn't doing what it did? How can I feel, okay, about what happened?
[50:08] B: No.
[50:08] A: Okay.
[50:10] B: I just don't. I'm just hyper. Like, just.
[50:15] A: Oh, okay.
[50:16] B: Oh, I wanna laugh.
[50:17] A: Like, you do wanna laugh. Because this is pretty funny, isn't it? Like, really, it's hilarious, right? That it's not doing what it used to do.
[50:25] B: Yeah. And then I let it bother.
[50:27] A: No, I don't think you were that long. It wasn't you letting it, it's that it didn't. Not because you let it, but because that's what the programming that you were in was doing to you. Right. We talk about how you are the light at the center that we call soul. Well, there's a program that's called human being. That is the body. That's right. That was part of the program. Right. But we got a program that's human being that malfunctions sometimes. We're updating the program Human Being so that it works more in the way that you want it to. Yeah. Right. So what's another moment, you know, around that same time with mom dropping you off somewhere? Oh, just kind of like run through the database of them. Because we know that there's like for years. So as you run through the database. Kay. And you're kind of seeing them, the different ones, and kind of like. Like, you know, as a picture. Like, oh, this is that one and this is that one. And that. As you look through them, are you noticing any discomfort?
[51:25] B: Not really.
[51:26] A: Isn't that weird?
[51:28] B: Yeah.
[51:28] A: Oh, where'd it go? And we haven't even talked about those.
[51:32] B: Because I've been so angry at her for so long.
[51:35] A: Angry at Mom?
[51:36] B: Yeah.
[51:36] A: Yeah.
[51:37] B: Because I didn't understand what I did wrong for her to.
[51:39] A: You didn't do anything wrong, did you?
[51:41] B: No.
[51:41] A: No. Right. That was the first thing that you wanted, wasn't it?
[51:44] B: Yeah.
[51:45] A: That we talked about. Maybe the second thing is you said, you know what I've been having worries about is if mom dies, will I actually be at peace?
[51:54] B: Yeah.
[51:55] A: Right. And not have the anger might be some of the things that I might apologize for. But then I don't have that anger. Right. And you're not feeling it right now because her behavior isn't feeling like it was about you. Your lovability. Whether you Were good enough.
[52:09] B: Yeah.
[52:10] A: Or whether you mattered.
[52:11] B: I let the whole trafficking situation break my confidence down for so long.
[52:17] A: Like, again, I don't think so. I want you to get the wording. You didn't let it. It wasn't like. You know what? Hey, I'm just gonna let this happen, right? I could do something else, but no, I'm just allowing this to happen. No, there was no letting. There was no allowing.
[52:36] B: Well, it broke my confidence for so long.
[52:41] A: And what made you feel bad?
[52:47] B: Feeling like my mom didn't want me and that she didn't love me and I didn't have a dad, so it was kind of like I didn't have no parents.
[52:59] A: Yeah.
[53:01] B: All I had was my siblings. And then the only guy, like, man attention I got was weird.
[53:09] A: Yeah, right? That weird. And at least we had the one great grandma, right? Who actually saw you.
[53:16] B: Yeah.
[53:17] A: And when I laid in the bed.
[53:18] B: Next to her, I felt some kind.
[53:20] A: Of connection and connected. Right. You know, sometimes in life we just need one, right? And you know where she's never left you, Nana. You know where she's never left, you know where she always exists.
[53:37] B: Am I. Yeah.
[53:38] A: Hurt like she always is existing here. See? The body stops working. But what if they don't stop working when their body stops? There's a weird example of this chaos. You haven't heard. It's really weird. But if we took a glass of ice, we put it out on the patio, Hour goes by, little kid comes out, goes, somebody stole the ice and replaced it with water. We would laugh. We would tell the kid, nobody stole the ice. It got melted from solid to liquid. H2O is H2O. Kid goes, okay, get it? Week goes by, same glass. Now water. He comes back a week later, water's gone. He goes, somebody drank it now. Nobody drank it. Somebody stole the water. It's gone. No, it's not gone. It evaporated, Right? Changed from liquid to gas. But H2O is H2O. And he goes, yeah, this is weird, because if I don't see it, how can I feel it? We go, right? Because you live in Florida, by the way. It's all around you, right? And then we talk about him in the desert of Arizona. We go, you don't feel any of it here, do you? And we bring him back to Florida, right? And we show them the rain cloud we capture. We go, oh, my goodness. It's all the same thing. Weird, right? So what if when people's body stop, it's not that they stop. Their body does. They Exit it. We don't pick them up in the same way we did. But it doesn't mean they're not here. Right. Because I can blow a whistle. It makes no sound to either one of us. But the dog over there is going, does that mean that if something is out of my regular awareness, does that mean that it doesn't exist? Because the whistle certainly makes a sound, just not at the level that I can hear. Make sense?
[55:19] B: Yeah.
[55:21] A: Right. So the thing that we want to start to consider is that our five senses are limited in range. Right. We can go out to the van and we can turn on music. But the radio wave was connected. And all around us, it's here right now. Right. It's not like it's not here right now. We could tune a radio in, we would have sound. Right. But we don't feel it makes sense. So there are things beyond what our senses can notice. Doesn't mean that it's not here. Right. So when people's bodies stop, it's not that they stop, Their body stops. What happens is the shock of knowing them in their body kind of blocks us access to who they really are. Because Nana, for you, is the one that you feel connected to. That's right. And safe. And that she actually saw you, who you really are. Kay. Right. Right. And I wonder what it would be like to feel. What is something you and Nana like to do. Notice how you're getting sad because you're thinking about finding out about the loss of Nana. Right. Where were you when you found that out?
[56:38] B: In a program.
[56:39] A: In a program. Like, not this program, some other program. So you're aware when that happened?
[56:43] B: Orlando.
[56:44] A: So you're in Orlando. Right. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[56:48] B: It was daytime.
[56:49] A: Daytime. And like, you're, like, in your room or you're in a group room.
[56:52] B: I was watching tv.
[56:53] A: So you're watching tv. Right. With friends. Right. Good. Then what happened next? Steph said, k, can you come here?
[57:00] B: Yeah.
[57:00] A: Like, oh, that's never good. Right. And then, like, you walked over. There were like. They brought you in a room.
[57:05] B: Yeah. They said, your mom wants to talk to you.
[57:07] A: Right. So mom wants to talk to you. I don't know if I want to talk to her. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[57:10] B: So we called her.
[57:13] A: Yeah. And she was like, hey, mom, how you doing? Right.
[57:17] B: I was like, I heard you wanted to talk to.
[57:19] A: Yeah. Good job. Right, Right.
[57:21] B: She was like, yeah. She was like, I got some very sad news for you.
[57:24] A: Yeah. Right. Good job. And then she said, Nana died.
[57:27] B: She was like, your nana passed away.
[57:29] A: Right. Good job at detail. Right. In the one episode, and she was.
[57:32] B: Like, your Nana passed away, but she was very, very sick and tired.
[57:35] A: Yes.
[57:37] B: But she died peacefully.
[57:38] A: Yeah. Good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened? I cried, of course. Right. And then what happened next?
[57:47] B: And she asked me if I was.
[57:49] A: Okay, and I was like, no, not really. Yeah, of course I'm okay. You just told me the most disturbing news I've heard in a really long time. I'm doing fucking crazy great.
[57:59] B: So then I went in my room.
[58:00] A: Yes.
[58:01] B: And I cried.
[58:02] A: Right.
[58:04] B: And I punched the wall.
[58:05] A: Right. Then what happened next?
[58:09] B: I locked my bedroom door.
[58:10] A: Right. Then what happened?
[58:12] B: I got a belt.
[58:12] A: Right.
[58:13] B: And I tried to choke myself.
[58:14] A: Right. And that didn't work.
[58:15] B: And I was like, right.
[58:17] A: And then that was over. I mean, then what happened next? Somebody came in.
[58:21] B: No, I laid on the floor.
[58:22] A: You laid to the floor. Right. Sleep. Which was better. And then later on, you were going to the beach, Right? You were going to the beach. And you're almost 90 days, right?
[58:32] B: That's right.
[58:33] A: How cool is that? Right? And they're coming down to visit.
[58:37] B: Yeah.
[58:38] A: Right. So again, as we get here, we want to get that whole thing present, because it's the moment that blocks the absence. But I have to use the restroom, so give me one quick second. I'll be right back. That's always a relief. Okay.
[60:08] B: I did it again.
[60:10] A: This is twice today. I typically do it once a day. Today I did it twice a month.
[60:20] B: At least you didn't fall.
[60:22] A: At least I didn't fall. Right. That's good news.
[60:24] B: I fell in my bathroom the other night because I forgot a towel. And then I slipped, fell, and I was like. Walked out, and I was like, did any of y'all hear that? They're like, no. I was like, I think I can't walk no more. They're like, but you're walking.
[60:42] A: Yeah, but you didn't have that slipping ball. Yeah.
[60:45] B: And then I had, like, a very, like, gnarly bruise right here. I was like, well, I'm getting old.
[60:55] A: Now as you go backwards, right. With that moment. Do you think I can remember? That's a long time ago. Do you think I can do it? Okay, so we know that we got going to the beach, right? And 90 almost, right? And they're coming down. Right? And then before that, you had fallen asleep on the floor, right? And then you tried to choke, and then you got the belt, and then you had shut. Well, then you had shut the door. And then before that, you had gone into the room, and then you had left where mom was telling you. And then mom had asked whether you were okay, which you had told her. Yes. And then she told you. Well, no. Then you were crying, then she told you. And then you had called and said, what do you want? And then you were told that mom wanted to talk to you. And then you were watching tv. What were you watching on tv?
[61:50] B: A domestic violence video.
[61:52] A: Oh, even better.
[61:53] B: Like, we were watching educational material. Well, they didn't know we were watching it. We were. Well, they didn't really care. The staff there let us watch, like, the conjuring and stuff.
[62:05] A: So they had different rules.
[62:08] B: Yeah.
[62:08] A: It wasn't as true, but as you think about that moment, what do you notice? Just that moment.
[62:14] B: Which moment?
[62:15] A: The moment with mom telling you. Oh, it's doing that same thing, huh?
[62:21] B: Yeah.
[62:21] A: How weird. Cause you remember saying that. You can remember putting on that bracelet. Well, stop putting on that bracelet. Say, I'm not. Stop mom from telling you. That's not true. So where is this? Hey. Doesn't exist. So with Nana, right? Like, you know, what's the similarity? What do you like doing with Nana?
[62:45] B: I don't know. Nothing.
[62:47] A: Yeah, you just sit there, right?
[62:51] B: I would steal her wheelchair.
[62:53] A: See? I wonder what it would be like if you were to feel Nana. You're just doing nothing with you. Because that's what you two do. Nothing together. Right? Right. Because the essence of who she is hasn't left you in the same way. Like, her love for you is as strong now and yours is as strong for her. You just haven't fully felt hers. Not because it's not here.
[63:17] B: It's weird that I knew she was. There's something wrong with her.
[63:20] A: You did, didn't you?
[63:20] B: For, like, three months before I found out she passed away, I kept telling my adopted mom, I'm like, call my biological mom and make sure my Nana's okay.
[63:28] A: Right? Yeah. And she was like, maybe Nana was letting me.
[63:32] B: Have you heard anything? And my adopted mom was like, no, your mom hasn't said anything. And I'm like, well, can you try to reach back out and make sure my Nana's okay? And then I found out she passed away, and I was just like, are you serious?
[63:49] A: Right.
[63:49] B: And then I didn't get told until May 12 that she passed away May 2. And the staff would have brought me down to her funeral, but nobody told me.
[64:01] A: I see.
[64:02] B: And nobody told me she was gonna die.
[64:04] A: Right.
[64:05] B: And I really feel like I hold that resentment for my mom because she Was at the hospital the whole time my Nana was dying. And I feel like my mom doesn't like the fact that I had that bond with my Nana. And maybe she didn't want me there because my Nana would be more focused on me and then her. But my Nana knows she was my best friend, so.
[64:31] A: So I follow you. And I'm getting what you're talking about. Notice how there's that stuff there right now? So my question for you, Kay, isn't whether what your mom did was okay. Because we're both clear what she did wasn't right. Not telling you, not including you, you not being there, you're not not knowing, you're not able to attend. Right. Like we can't get that to not happen. And we also are in agreement that that's not okay. That's not the thing that I'm asking. You wanna know what I'm asking? Okay. Would it be okay for you to feel okay?
[65:07] B: Yeah.
[65:08] A: Even if that happening wasn't right? Oh, it would be okay. So can I show you something? That's weird. Not that we haven't done anything else, but this one's kind of really weird because it's a ping pong ball. But the thing about this ping pong ball is that it has metal pieces so it doesn't bounce. But if you put your finger on the metal pieces, it makes a noise. That was really scary, huh? Jump on that one. Wait until you hold it. It goes. Now it'll be really scary. Oh, see, that's the scary one. Right? So you got it right? Now what would happen if you were to take your finger and just touch that spot there?
[65:50] B: Doesn't do anything weird.
[65:52] A: Right? So now keep your finger there. Take your other finger on the other hand. Touch my finger way over here.
[66:00] B: What?
[66:01] A: Right. Is this not the coolest thing ever? Do it again.
[66:07] B: Why?
[66:08] A: Well, think of it. What this is acting as is a connector. So a light switch. When a light switch is off, there's a gap. When a light switch turns on. Now we have a free flowing circuit of energy. So when I have my fingers on it, it's a free flowing circuit of energy within me. If I've got my finger and you've got. It's not free flowing until. Oh, isn't that cool? Because we're made up of energy. And Einstein was a really smart dude. Do you know how I know that? Einstein was a really smart dude? Everybody after him that's really smart is called an Einstein. That's how I know. Right. He said two things that are real important to us. One is. Energy plus matter equals this touchable existence. Right. And what cannot be an energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. What's happening now?
[67:23] B: I don't know.
[67:24] A: Where are you? Because you're not here. You're somewhere else. That's why I asked. How's your body feeling?
[67:31] B: Like a body.
[67:33] A: Like a body.
[67:34] B: Yeah.
[67:34] A: Okay. Where'd you go? You're thinking about something.
[67:40] B: Not too far.
[67:40] A: Not too far. Kind of close still.
[67:43] B: Yeah.
[67:43] A: Okay. What's happening now?
[67:47] B: Now I'm thinking. I was trying to think about what I was just thinking about.
[67:56] A: What does that say?
[67:57] B: That says Folio.
[67:59] A: Foolio.
[68:00] B: Folio.
[68:01] A: Oh, I don't know what that means.
[68:03] B: It's a rapper.
[68:04] A: Foolio is a rapper.
[68:05] B: Folio, like Julio Fulio.
[68:07] A: Really? He's a rapper?
[68:08] B: Yeah. And this one says Duvall, baby, because I'm from Duvall.
[68:12] A: Jacksonville, huh?
[68:15] B: Yeah. Folio's Jacksonville.
[68:18] A: Is Duval the county? Yeah. Because when I'm really down with things like. I know the lingo. You're awesome. Kay. I love it. So think about stuff with Grandma now. Right. I wonder what it would be like. Because one of the things that happens when we have a loss of a loved one is we no longer. Longer see a picture of me with them. We kind of see them as separate from me. But I wonder what would happen if you see you and Nana together.
[68:49] B: Right.
[68:50] A: Right in your mind's eye.
[68:51] B: My issue is, like, right now, I can't hug her.
[68:54] A: Well, I know you can't hug her.
[68:56] B: But I want to hug her.
[68:57] A: Right. You do want to hug her, right? How do you know that you can't hug her?
[69:03] B: Because I can't feel her.
[69:05] A: Well, how do you know you can't feel. That's right. You're not sure about that one, are you?
[69:12] B: No.
[69:12] A: No. Because what's in the way is there's still all of the anger.
[69:16] B: Yeah.
[69:17] A: Right.
[69:17] B: I'm mad at God or whoever is up there.
[69:20] A: Yeah. Because the Joker.
[69:23] B: Yeah, whoever. Batman, Robin, whatever your name.
[69:27] A: I think it's Thor. He's the dude.
[69:30] B: But I'm just mad at him because I feel like he keeps taking, take, take, take. And I'm just like, bastard. Are you serious? How much more do you got to take from me? I'm gonna still do what I want to do. Yeah, but you don't have to take somebody else life because of that. And I just feel like it's just him doing that to me.
[69:56] A: Him singling you out.
[69:57] B: Yeah.
[69:59] A: Or whoever it is up there going, okay, who are we gonna fuck? With today one more time. But hasn't K been fucked with that? No. Keep screwing with her.
[70:09] B: It's probably my fault though because I used to say fuck God all the time. I'd be like, yeah, I want to talk to his enemy. I don't want to be friends with his enemy because I was very, what do you call it? Petty.
[70:23] A: Okay, what if you weren't so petty? So we got a couple different things to do, right? We got a couple different things to do. One, we want to get the anger over mom having not informed me to be lightened and cleared. Right. And again, that doesn't mean forgiving mom. But we know that mom's not well.
[70:41] B: Right?
[70:42] A: Right. And mom does fucked up stuff, right. That have nothing to do with you. Are you trying to tie your shoes together so that you trip and fall? Is this the same thing that you did when you were getting out of the bathroom? You want to trip and fall, that's why you're tying your shoes together?
[70:57] B: I don't know. I don't even really know how to tie my shoe.
[71:02] A: Oh no, nobody showed you the bunny rabbit ears.
[71:06] B: I don't tie my shoes ever. I do them like this. My strangest thing.
[71:12] A: Okay, but it's not that you couldn't.
[71:15] B: Tie them or maybe I asked my mom once and she slapped me. So I just haven't. Oh no.
[71:24] A: You think they're too tight now? You can't get them out, huh? See if you get. Oh man, you need like a nail to get in there or something.
[71:47] B: I bite my nails.
[71:50] A: So you are not the person that.
[71:51] B: Made a situation like this. That definitely was not my 18 year old self doing that.
[72:00] A: No? No.
[72:03] B: I don't know why I just did that.
[72:06] A: Oh, cause that self showed up. That part showed up, didn't it? Wanted to make itself known, I guess to us today. That part wanted to make itself known. Alright, that part. Well, the part of you that just did this, like what do you think that part's highest positive intention is for.
[72:29] B: You to fall at this point I'm.
[72:33] A: Not sure that that's if it's, you know. Cause you said like there's like the play of kid. Isn't this a thing that a kid would do?
[72:39] B: Yeah.
[72:39] A: Joke, right? That's right. It was a joke that a kid would do. But that part likes to be joking, right?
[72:50] B: I don't know. I have bad impulse control.
[72:55] A: Well, you get dysregulated sometimes. So we want the mom things but we also want to deal with the moment of the other thing. So Best to do first. You want to know what the best to do first is, right?
[73:11] B: I feel like I just went cross eyed.
[73:13] A: Look up. Think dolphin. Take a slow breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. Open your eyes. Eyes look up. Think dolphin. Breathe in. Right. Exhale. Close your eyes. Keep them closed. What are you noticing inside?
[73:38] B: I don't know. I'm full of energy.
[73:41] A: You are full of energy, right? That's right. So just check it out. I want you to think about the things that we've talked about so far.
[73:51] B: Oh.
[74:03] A: And when you think about them, is this okay. What do you notice? Like going to that two guys going to uncle. What do you notice when you think about those moments now?
[74:16] B: They don't matter.
[74:18] A: They don't matter, do they? Isn't that cool?
[74:21] B: Yeah.
[74:21] A: Notice how that's different. And notice what's also shifting is back then, that stuff happening to me felt like it had something to do with me. It didn't have anything to do with you. Yeah, it did.
[74:39] B: No.
[74:40] A: Oh, it didn't have anything to do with you, did it?
[74:46] B: No.
[74:47] A: No. Isn't that interesting?
[74:49] B: Yeah.
[74:49] A: Notice how that's different? Isn't that cool?
[74:57] B: Yeah.
[74:57] A: Yeah. What's happening now?
[75:00] B: I'm full of energy.
[75:02] A: You are full of energy.
[75:06] B: I could go like run like a.
[75:08] A: Marathon right now or, you know, at least a good sprint. Let's do it. We'll race. You and I will race down to the end of the parking lot and back. You said you wanted to run a marathon. Let's go. Kay. Come on.
[75:21] B: No, I might not make it.
[75:23] A: All right, we won't do that.
[75:24] B: Then I might fall.
[75:26] A: You might?
[75:27] B: Yeah. I have a bad knee right now.
[75:30] A: You do? Okay.
[75:31] B: Yeah. Because of cops.
[75:33] A: Not because of anything that you were doing that had cops be involved with you, but really just because of cops?
[75:38] B: Yes. It was all the cops fault.
[75:39] A: Right. Had nothing to do with any of the things that you were doing that had cops have to be involved with you because, you know, I don't really involve myself with cops. I never have issues with cops. Like they don't pop up in my life. They just every once in a while if I'm going too fast, I'm a little nervous about a cop.
[75:55] B: But no, they just popped up out of nowhere.
[75:59] A: Crazy.
[76:00] B: No, I did something.
[76:02] A: You did something. Right. And then they did something. And then you hurt your knee.
[76:06] B: Yeah. Anger.
[76:09] A: Yeah. You're not so angry right now. No, I know. Isn't that cool?
[76:14] B: Yeah.
[76:15] A: Right. And not that we're forgiving mom. We're just realizing that Mom's not well. And therefore mom operates like somebody who's not well. And what would somebody who's not well do? Well, not let their daughter know about their Nana. Right. Like, I mean, if we thought mom was well, we'd be really, like, disappointed that this well person did this really screwed up thing. But this person who's not well actually did something totally consistent with somebody who's not well. Not that we like it. Not that it makes it okay, but we want you to be okay. Because your relationship with Nana was more than just seeing her. Right. Because you had no question in your mind that you love Nana. And Nana look you. That's right. That's right. And Nana feels the love. So one last time, I want you to think about it in this way. Float up above your head, like, in that moment that Mom's telling you. If you were to be looking at the you down below when Mom's telling you from up above, like, high up above, you're seeing the you getting the phone, calling Mom. What do you want?
[77:20] B: Like, stuff you see on tv.
[77:21] A: Right. But you're kind of looking at it from you're up above looking down at the you in the room.
[77:26] B: I need to tell her.
[77:27] A: No, no. A little bit different.
[77:29] B: She needs to tell me.
[77:31] A: Just, no, a little bit different. Just think of you being up above, seeing that thing play out where mom told you. You started being upset. Right. But you're looking at it from. It's down here, and you're up there. Right. Right. Then think of Nana. Who is Nana for you?
[77:50] B: My Nana.
[77:51] A: Right. But who is she for you?
[77:52] B: My best friend.
[77:53] A: Yeah. Right. Right. And the one that saw the true you. So I wonder what it would be like every time you see the real you, for you to feel Nana in you. Because Nana is totally excited about everything that you're doing right now, what we're doing, program that you're in, what you've decided for yourself. She's way excited about it all, don't you think?
[78:17] B: Yeah.
[78:18] A: Yeah. And you wouldn't want to actually feel good about that. These damn snakes are gonna be the death of me.
[78:33] B: I just got a lot going with no pain.
[78:39] A: I can do it, too.
[78:41] B: I just. I don't know. Sometimes I just want to, like.
[78:46] A: Yeah. So just check. Is it discomfort in your body or just kind of, like, antsy? Probably antsy like you've been sitting a long time. Not nearly as long as earlier.
[78:56] B: I don't know. I think I got adhd, because I do this everywhere, but. Yeah, I don't know, I do this. This, like, even in, like, AA meetings, I'm like, oh. And then I'll, like, kick one of the other girl's feet, like, and play foot seats with her. And then I'm distracting her, but I'm not meaning to, or I sit there and I'll eat Sour Patch Kids and laugh and I don't know why I'm laughing. I'm just laughing. I'm just like.
[79:21] A: Like sugar.
[79:22] B: Sugar.
[79:22] A: Sugar.
[79:23] B: Yeah, pretty much. But I haven't really had sugar today. Well, I don't cough this.
[79:28] A: Well, we are jumping things up, right. Because things are getting cleared.
[79:34] B: Yeah.
[79:34] A: Yeah. Which is really cool, don't you think?
[79:38] B: Yeah.
[79:39] A: Right. So there was that moment, right, that kind of had you start turning things around.
[79:46] B: Yeah.
[79:47] A: Right. And you were with, like, a friend, somebody that you knew, and, like, things went south. So where were you when that happened?
[79:58] B: Her house.
[79:59] A: So you're at her house, right, Daytime or nighttime?
[80:02] B: Nighttime.
[80:02] A: Night time. And you're wearing the house in her room. In her room. Right. Good. And then what happened?
[80:08] B: They told me in a text, this guy named Josh.
[80:11] A: So she or somebody else who was in the room too, said, text Josh and her.
[80:15] B: Her boyfriend's friend.
[80:17] A: Yes.
[80:18] B: So I texted Josh.
[80:19] A: Yes.
[80:20] B: But Josh wanted to have a threesome.
[80:22] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right.
[80:23] B: And we were like, okay, bet. And we told him, okay, we'll do it.
[80:28] A: Right. Good job, good detail.
[80:29] B: And we told him to get a zip of weed.
[80:31] A: Yeah.
[80:33] B: He was like, okay. He was like, I'll be leaving shortly.
[80:37] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right.
[80:38] B: And then me and her, like, made out.
[80:41] A: Right.
[80:41] B: Just for him.
[80:42] A: Right. Just for the boyfriend.
[80:43] B: No, just for.
[80:45] A: Oh, he came over. Now he's here.
[80:46] B: No, he's not here.
[80:47] A: Josh is not here.
[80:48] B: We took a video, sent it to him.
[80:50] A: So he got it. Yes. Right.
[80:53] B: About the whole threesome.
[80:54] A: Yes. Good job. Right.
[80:55] B: Even though I don't like females and she don't like females.
[80:57] A: Yes. But it wasn't because we like them. Yeah, Right.
[81:00] B: It was mainly just we're gonna really persuade him.
[81:03] A: Right? Yeah, of course. Right. We're actors.
[81:05] B: And then we smoked.
[81:09] A: Right. A little bit of weed. Right. Because he got over. No, no, he still was.
[81:14] B: We had a little bit left.
[81:14] A: Oh, good. See, you did that.
[81:15] B: And we're waiting on him.
[81:16] A: Yes.
[81:17] B: We texted him. We're like, where are you at? Where are you at?
[81:20] A: Right. Cuz, like, we're. Jones in here. Come on, hurry.
[81:22] B: We're trying to get this done.
[81:23] A: That's right.
[81:24] B: And her boyfriend, my friend's boyfriend, Was being very like, he needs to hurry. He needs to hurry, right? He better not be faking.
[81:32] A: Right? Good.
[81:32] B: And then his friend was like, if he fake him, we going to shoot him, right? I was like, how are you going to show them if he's not here?
[81:41] A: Right?
[81:41] B: Because he stays on the north side, right? Not the south, right? And then he's like, cool, fine, old boy. And then he was like, hey, I'm like, 10 minutes away, right? So we walked the boys down to the area. We're gonna have him back in. And they hid in the bushes, right?
[82:02] A: Then what happened?
[82:05] B: We get in the car with him.
[82:06] A: Yes.
[82:07] B: And we tell him. We're like, hey, you can just pull up here and back in, right? And he backed in, right? And the guys in the wood, not woods, but the bushes.
[82:19] A: Yeah.
[82:19] B: Five minutes and we're coming, right? Like, regardless. And during that time, he's like, so what's up with y'all? And then he brought us something to drink. He had some alcohol, too. So we start drinking, right? And then doors just fly open, right? And I forgot that it was gonna happen, right? And they hit him in the head with the gun, right? And my friend's boyfriend's friend was on my side, right? And I was like, bro, I was like, don't do that. And then the gun fired off, right? And then Josh looked over, and he was like, are you okay?
[83:01] A: Yes.
[83:01] B: I'm like, yeah. And then he started running. Like, he gave him his phone, he gave him everything and ran. And right then the two boys jumped in the car and, like, took off, right? And left me and my friend just, like, standing there. Even though we could have walked straight back to her house, it wasn't like, sure right down the street.
[83:22] A: But they took off, right? And then what happened? Nice.
[83:23] B: So then I started screaming Josh's name.
[83:26] A: Yes.
[83:26] B: The one that got shot. Because I wanted to play it off to the point, like, hey, I ain't.
[83:31] A: It wasn't me, like, set you up, right.
[83:34] B: I didn't want no part in the whole. Still in the car.
[83:39] A: Right? Good. Then what happened next?
[83:41] B: Me and my friend go back to the house, and then we didn't know he got shot at this point.
[83:47] A: You didn't know Josh got shot? You knew the. The. The gun went off.
[83:50] B: I knew the gun went off.
[83:51] A: And Josh asked you, are you okay?
[83:53] B: Yeah.
[83:53] A: And then he ran out of there. It was just like, right, Good job. Right?
[83:58] B: Then we went back to my friend's house, and we were told that the car got stuck in front of one of the boys house.
[84:09] A: Right.
[84:10] B: And that they couldn't get it to move because they didn't have the keys.
[84:13] A: Got it.
[84:14] B: So we went back down to the spot to see if he dropped the keys.
[84:16] A: Right. Good job, good detail.
[84:18] B: And the cops were down there.
[84:19] A: Got it. Good job, good detail.
[84:20] B: And the cops were like, you know, just with their lights and.
[84:23] A: Right.
[84:24] B: Looking at the crime scene or whatever. And then the next day we saw on the news that there was a robbery.
[84:32] A: Yes.
[84:33] B: Like on East Street.
[84:35] A: Which detail. Yes.
[84:37] B: And that he was shot in the.
[84:40] A: Right.
[84:41] B: And then about five days later, his uncle came down to my friend's house and said, either y'all let me touch y'all, or I report y'all to the police.
[84:52] A: Y'all let me touch you all.
[84:54] B: Like me and my friend let him.
[84:56] A: Play with us, okay.
[84:57] B: Sexually.
[84:58] A: Okay.
[84:58] B: Or he was gonna turn us into the police or he was gonna human traffic us.
[85:01] A: Okay? Right. So then what happened?
[85:04] B: We let it happen because he had a gun.
[85:06] A: Right. So he did the different things to you, to her.
[85:09] B: Right.
[85:09] A: And then what happened next? Then he left.
[85:13] B: He left.
[85:14] A: And then that was over.
[85:15] B: That was over.
[85:16] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun like go to the beach.
[85:20] B: Yeah.
[85:21] A: Right. Or almost have 90 days clean. Right. Or know that they're coming to visit.
[85:27] B: Yeah.
[85:27] A: Right. So we got them coming to visit. Right. We got 90 days, we got going to the beach.
[85:31] B: It's from Friday it is.
[85:33] A: Then we got them leaving. Where'd we go?
[85:38] B: What?
[85:39] A: Not to the beach. I know. You're not sure what's happening, are you?
[85:44] B: No.
[85:44] A: No. But when you think about that moment now, what do you notice?
[85:50] B: That there's a monkey right there.
[85:51] A: There is. Do you know what the monkey significance is?
[85:54] B: No.
[85:55] A: You ever heard the term not my monkey, not my circus?
[85:58] B: Yeah.
[85:59] A: Right. That's the thing you want to be thinking about with that other woman when she says stuff isn't just that you're nothing to me. Not my monkey, not my circus. I don't need to do anything with that. It's not my monkey, not my circus. Right. So you can remember that happening going there. You can remember the guy leaving. You can remember him having you guys do stuff and then him coming with a gun and then saying, like, if I'm not, you're going to do stuff wrong to the police. And then he had gone over. Right. And then you learned stuff on the news. Right. And then you guys had driven up to the scene. Right. And then you. The car had gotten stuck. Right. And then they had taken off. Well, no, you were screaming for him. And then they had taken off, right? And then he had ran off. Well, then you guys got out of the car. Then he had ran off, right? Then he had checked if you're okay. Then there was the gunshot. And you're like, don't go through with this. And then they had knocked him on the head with the gun. And then they jumped the car. And then you guys got in the car, right? Then you told him to park there. Then he picked you up. And then you guys had gone outside. They were hiding in the bushes. And then before that you had kind of done the picture or little video. And then before that they were going, he needs to hurry them. Before that, like you had called them. And then before that you're doing a. Whatever you do, right? And it goes backwards compared to forward. What do you notice? You can remember it. You can remember putting on the. Duval. No. Isn't it Duval? No. Duval. Is it Duval?
[87:30] B: Duval.
[87:31] A: Am I not saying the word correctly?
[87:32] B: Duval.
[87:33] A: Duval. Duval. Duval. Duval, baby. Duval. Right. I don't know how you remember putting on your bracelet that said Duval. Right? Well, stop putting on your bracelet.
[87:48] B: I'm not looking over.
[87:49] A: That's right. Stop putting in your earrings.
[87:51] B: Okay.
[87:52] A: I'm not. Stop them from doing that. Say they're not doing that. You stop doing that. Say I'm not doing that. Well, stop it from happening though. It's not happening.
[88:00] B: It's not happening.
[88:00] A: Where is it go. It doesn't exist.
[88:02] B: It's in the past.
[88:04] A: Well, is there a place that we can go dig it up?
[88:06] B: No.
[88:06] A: The past?
[88:07] B: No.
[88:08] A: Right. Doesn't.
[88:09] B: It doesn't exist.
[88:10] A: That's right. We have a memory, but the memory is not it. Right. Isn't that weird? Yeah, right. And that guy that did that stuff to you and your friend and then other stuff that happened, whether it be uncle or other people that mom dropped you off with, there are other people on the way that may have done different stuff to your body. Some of it might have felt better than others, some of it might have been easier than others. But all that stuff that happened, did you know that they never actually touched you?
[88:38] B: No.
[88:38] A: Yeah, right. Isn't that cool? Yeah, right. They never got me. I wonder what it would be like to close your eyes and let the 8 year old know that that stuff happening back then, whether it be mom dropping off at different places or uncle, that they never touched me, they never touched who I really am. They never got me, they messed with my stuff. And then it grows up to the. How old are you? You know, he's gotten other information. Now, wait a minute. They never touch me. Right? What's happening now? Calm you are. Your body's calm, isn't it? Is this thing a little quieter?
[89:17] B: A little bit.
[89:18] A: Just a little bit. Yeah, right. Were you making a flower in the. And you ripped it to pieces?
[89:24] B: I don't know what I was making.
[89:26] A: It looked like you made a beautiful flower. And then you're like, I can make a flower. I'll show you. I'm really good at it. I don't normally do it with this thin of a paper, but it'll work. I used to really like magic. Magic was fun.
[89:47] B: I'm not good at magic.
[89:50] A: Do you like.
[89:50] B: I'm good at being honest.
[89:52] A: I like seeing magic tricks. I like being awed by magic. Right. Cause magic can kind of be awe.
[90:00] B: I'm more of a poetry person.
[90:02] A: More poetry. That's why you like rap. Rap is poetry. Yeah, that's just what it be. What do we got in there?
[90:15] B: Some cheez?
