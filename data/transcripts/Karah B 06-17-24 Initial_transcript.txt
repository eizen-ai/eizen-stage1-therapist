[00:01] A: All right, so today is the 17th of June, Carol. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:17] B: That's fine.
[00:18] A: Cool. All right. So what I was explaining is we. So therapy is really great for many things. Just like physical therapy is great for many things. So talk therapy is great to have somebody to listen to me who can provide feedback and guidance from an outside perspective. Maybe give me something that I wasn't considering before. Oh, wow. I never looked at it from that point of view. That's really, really helpful. It can teach me tools like how to use I statements, which if I never knew that, that's another useful tool when I'm having an argument with my spouse or partner, whomever. Right. So those things are really great. It can help me really delve into understanding more about why I feel the way I feel, where the feelings came from, what my triggers are, why I have them, and all of that is fantastic. What it doesn't do is what physical therapy, which is great for minor ailments. I've got a rehab. I've got an issue with how I'm walk, you know, tore or strained, something. But if I broke my arm, it doesn't matter how much physical therapy I go to, I still have a broken arm. It's not the right solution for the problem. So, unfortunately, therapy gets known as the thing that people go to to heal emotional wounds. Yet how we got trained doesn't teach us how to heal emotional wounds. It helps them understand it. But I can know what my triggers are, why I have them, where they came from, and still get triggered by them.
[01:56] B: Right.
[01:56] A: It's not the issue. Right. Like, oh, I get it. The reason that I have night terrors is because of this awful shit that happened to me when I was great. And I still have night terror. So now what do I do? Right? So it gets me the understanding, but not actually better. So then we have to go to the second thing. Why don't emotional wounds heal? Right? I break my foot when I'm 10. I tell you about it right now, and I'm as emotional as when it happened.
[02:22] B: Yeah.
[02:22] A: You're gonna look across me and go, what the is wrong with this guy? His foot is fine. I saw him walk around the office.
[02:28] B: Yeah.
[02:29] A: Why is he so upset?
[02:30] B: Yeah.
[02:31] A: On the flip side, if I told you about what my uncle did to me when I was 10 and I started to get emotional about it. You'd be like, well, yeah, of course, yeah. Why? We all know the time heals all wounds, but we all realized we were talking about physical wounds, not emotional wounds. So it's not that emotional wounds can't heal. They haven't. Because when it happened, emotionally, the brain short circuited. So what that means, Kara, is that there's a part of your brain that when you went through awful moments, and there's many of them, froze the alpha moment and tended to freeze the alpha moment at the worst part of the worst part of the worst part.
[03:16] B: Yeah.
[03:17] A: Got it. When it gets frozen, it gets disintegrated from the rest of the nervous system. So it's no longer connected to the rest of the nervous system. Now on an island by itself, it's on a super vigilant, always sensitive, always looking for it because it still thinks it's happening. And that's why anything in my environment that reminds me of it or is similar to it sets me off to it.
[03:48] B: Yeah.
[03:49] A: Makes sense.
[03:49] B: Does make sense.
[03:50] A: So the error isn't that what therapy learned? Right. We buried, we repressed, we locked it behind closed doors, we put it in the closet, we shoved it down in the basement. Right.
[04:00] B: Like we put in the box that they always tell you to put.
[04:03] A: Right. And that the job of therapy is to provide a warm, nice, safe, caring, supportive, nurturing environment to help you dig up into. Dig out all of the bad emotions so that you can get them out of you. Which is great because I like horror movies. I'm eating popcorn. Well, you're all upset. It's wonderful. No, but that's the method. Because they thought it was inside and it needs to come out. Yeah, right. And after throwing up, you know what? I do feel better.
[04:32] B: Yeah.
[04:33] A: But I get triggered by the same. Yeah, so what if it's the reverse? It's not about getting the bad feelings out. It's about a reconnaissance mission of getting the good news in to the parts of the brain that don't know certain awful moments ended. What if instead of trying to feel it out, it's about unplugging the memory so the brain can emotionally read it as data about something that happened that's over, that no longer exists. Because where it's stuck in you right now is the brain is reading it is happening right now. Right. That's why somebody starts telling us about getting mugged and they get to the part where the knife is at their throat and now their face is white and their Voice is choked and their arms are trembling and they've got tears. But we're kind nice people listening to them. What the F is happening? And we all say they're reliving it, but what's really happening is part of their brain is confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience. That's why they're having that reaction. Right. We can tell it was affecting them when they told us about it because we saw it all over them. Right? Yeah, but it was affecting him. Even over the weekend when they were hanging out with friends, you know, watching a movie. It was under the surface.
[05:54] B: Yeah.
[05:55] A: Up here they know safe with us. They survived. They're okay. There's no freaking knife. Problem is the other part of their brain doesn't know.
[06:03] B: Yeah.
[06:03] A: And that's the part that's beating their heart and breathing for them.
[06:06] B: Yeah.
[06:07] A: So that's all pre conscious brain. Right. We are not intellectual beings who can feel. We are feeling beings who can think. All feeling states are primary. Right. Like I don't wake up in the morning and say, well, today at 10:00 I'm gonna feel depressed, but at 11:45 I'm going to be really tense, nervous and anxious. So that at 4:15 I can be fucking pissed. And then at 7:30 I can feel a lot of gut shame it doesn't happen. Right. Stuff might be going on and boom, I might feel a certain way, but it wasn't because I chose it.
[06:48] B: Yeah.
[06:48] A: So it's different between therapy and this is. Therapy also says it's your job to do all the work, just like aa.
[06:55] B: Yeah.
[06:56] A: Right. Your job is to keep you clean and sober. Heck, you're with you all the time, so that's a good idea. Right. Therapy thinks it's your job to do all the work, to change you. Do you know who doesn't think that? The dental hygienist.
[07:08] B: Yeah.
[07:09] A: She does not think it's your job to clean your teeth.
[07:11] B: Yeah.
[07:12] A: She knows you're gonna brush in between visits. Right.
[07:15] B: Yeah.
[07:15] A: But when she gets you in her chair, she knows it's totally her job to do all the work, you know?
[07:21] B: Yeah.
[07:21] A: Right. She doesn't hold the mirror up, give you that tool that scrapes and goes, okay, get tooth 14. There's a little bit plaque on the. Don't pull your tooth out now.
[07:29] B: Right.
[07:29] A: Like it's not going to happen. Right. So same kind of thing. This is my job to get it better for you. With your collaboration and cooperation, you're not going to be able to do. But it's like my responsibility in getting this stuff better for you. And what we're able to get back better is the stuff that hasn't gotten better over time and is the stuff that doesn't tend to get better by talking. It. Got it. So any of those emotional wounds. Because we all have them. Right. We've all gone through awful up.
[08:03] B: Yeah.
[08:04] A: Right. And the problem isn't that we went through it.
[08:08] B: Yeah.
[08:08] A: The problem is that our brain emotionally doesn't know that we actually went through it.
[08:15] B: Yeah.
[08:15] A: And that it's over and that I survived it and therefore I'm okay. There's lots of moments where it's frozen that. Where it got froze. That part doesn't know how it ended and doesn't know whether you're okay. I had a person the other day telling me, you know, and then my mom as she's outside because mom was pissy, called the cops. Mom was drunk. Mom says to her, I hate you and I wish I never had you.
[08:46] B: Yeah, right.
[08:47] A: That moment I go, well, then what happened? She goes, I don't know. I don't remember.
[08:54] B: Blacked it out.
[08:55] A: Not blacked it out. Where the moment froze and the one that replays like a short gif file is the moment of mom saying that. Okay. Right. That's what's frozen. Her brain doesn't know that moment's over. Where it's stuck on her brain is feeling like that means something about her own lovability.
[09:15] B: Yeah.
[09:16] A: Does it?
[09:17] B: No.
[09:17] A: No. It means a lot of fucked up shit about mom.
[09:20] B: Yeah.
[09:20] A: Got it.
[09:21] B: Yeah.
[09:22] A: That stuck self doesn't know about later on her having her own kids and being a really good connected mom.
[09:29] B: Yeah.
[09:31] A: Makes sense. So where she thought she needed a better mom growing up in order to be okay, we get to install that despite not having it. She turned out better than okay.
[09:43] B: Yeah.
[09:44] A: Makes sense. So those are the kinds of things, Kara, that we want to get shifted so that you get to be more. Okay, so I follow you. That like if we could be changing ways that you think, feel, act and react. One of the things that you talked about is that there's a bunch of stuff that although it's over, it's still underneath the surface effects you. Not that you think about it all the time, but if you do or if something reminds you of it, it's still.
[10:09] B: Yeah, right.
[10:10] A: We want to get that going. Second, you mentioned that sometimes you find yourself maybe it's a replay of past stuff or a conglomeration of stuff in dreams in that like affect sleep. I got that. There's a heightened startled response to particular sounds and noises, which is way even more when I'm in a new place than one that I can actually settle into. Know those sounds. Right. So I follow you with that. What else would be useful for me to know? What else do we want to get better?
[10:36] B: I mean, I don't know. My father's day is hard for me because, like, my dad's a piece of. He was very, very abusive, like, in all aspects, not just to me, but to my mom, my sister.
[10:48] A: So physically, verbally, sexually.
[10:50] B: Everything.
[10:51] A: All of it.
[10:51] B: All of it, yeah. And I was, like, the protector. So, like, I had to.
[10:55] A: Of mom and sister.
[10:56] B: Yeah.
[10:56] A: Because you're the older sister.
[10:57] B: No, I'm the youngest.
[10:58] A: Oh, you're the youngest sister. Okay, got it.
[11:00] B: So I was always, like, the brawn of it because, like, I protected everybody.
[11:07] A: So if dad was angry, you would be the one that would. I would step in, do stuff to trigger him so that it would get directed towards you, not somebody else. Okay.
[11:17] B: I mean, I have my human trafficking stuff, like. Like all that.
[11:21] A: What does that mean?
[11:22] B: So, like, I was raped multiple times. One time, I was. I. I don't even know what happened. I just woke up after. I'm guessing I was drugged, and I found a razor blade.
[11:31] A: Oh, lovely.
[11:32] B: Yeah. Inside of me.
[11:34] A: Inside your vagina. Oh, God damn. All righty, then.
[11:40] B: Yeah. And after that, like, the cops came.
[11:42] A: Good thing it's not there anymore. Y. That's all we're saying.
[11:45] B: You know, they didn't care.
[11:47] A: The cops didn't care. Okay.
[11:49] B: So I was just junky.
[11:50] A: Okay.
[11:51] B: So, like, I always had, like, a hard thing for, like, police, but now I don't, because now I want to become one.
[11:55] A: Oh, interesting.
[11:56] B: The corrections officer.
[11:57] A: Yeah. Nice.
[12:00] B: There's a lot. I mean, like, a lot of it is abandonment. A lot of, you know.
[12:04] A: So does that impact you with your partner?
[12:07] B: Oh, yeah.
[12:08] A: Like, you get fearful of.
[12:10] B: Oh, yeah.
[12:10] A: Or leaving. That kind of stuff.
[12:12] B: Yeah.
[12:13] A: Okay.
[12:13] B: Yeah. I mean, we're like, I. I got two years sober.
[12:17] A: Congratulations.
[12:18] B: You know, she works in her stuff, I work on mine. Yeah, but, like, that's always been, like, a big thing or, like, not being. Because obviously I'm gay. I was like. I had to basically pretend to be straight my whole life. I knew I was gay at a young age, but I still had to dress, like.
[12:33] A: So just be a tomboy. You couldn't even do tomboy.
[12:43] B: And then I turned 18, and I moved down here from where I'm from, a very small Bible dump in town. Like 1200 people, first black family, 2012. Like. Like Footloose type community. Yeah.
[12:59] A: In Florida.
[13:00] B: No, in Pennsylvania. Yeah.
[13:04] A: You know, I grew up in upstate New York, so. Up in the Adirondack, north of Albany.
[13:10] B: Okay.
[13:10] A: Yeah, but Albany's like the bottom.
[13:12] B: Yeah.
[13:12] A: And then it goes north. So I was like an hour north of Albany. Pretty place called Lake George's. But my kindergarten through 12th grade, so all of my education, we had one black family. Yeah. And with three black kids that fit the stereotypes. Except the athletic part.
[13:33] B: Yeah.
[13:34] A: But teen, pregnant, like all, like, just. And one Asian family that also fit the stereotypes. Yeah, that was it. That was cultural diversity from kindergarten through graduation. So. I get it.
[13:46] B: Yeah, it was hard. That was very hard.
[13:51] A: But to show up and be a little different.
[13:54] B: Yeah. And then come down here. We gotta be who I was. And then told my dad. My dad flew down, beat the out of me.
[13:59] A: Oh, he did? Oh, yeah. Oh, good. Awesome.
[14:00] B: Yeah, that's great.
[14:01] A: Yeah. Dad, I'm into girls like you. Yeah, no, it doesn't work like that. Oh, come on. We can talk about what it's like to be with a chair.
[14:10] B: Know he didn't like that, so. I mean, that's always been hard, you know, so, like, abandonment is a big thing, you know? Okay, so Father's Day was definitely hard because he's.
[14:19] A: Cuz Dad's still alive.
[14:21] B: Dad's still alive.
[14:21] A: And is he still with mom?
[14:23] B: No, they're divorced. He actually married his mistress.
[14:26] A: Oh, good.
[14:26] B: Five stepsisters.
[14:29] A: All right. I like Cinderella.
[14:31] B: Yeah, a little bit. Yeah, a little bit. But like, I'm like, I love my mom, you know, I mean, I've had to work hard not to like, blame her for things, you know, but, you know, I don't. She said she didn't know. I mean, I, I.
[14:46] A: But there's still some of it there.
[14:47] B: Yeah, there's still some of it there. Yeah, always. I'm a good stepdad. He's actually an attorney, so he's one of the top defense attorneys in Clearwater. He's like my dad now. Like, he's always, like, he, like he's my dad. Like, he's always taking care of me, love me.
[15:01] A: He was in your life until for.
[15:04] B: Like the last seven, eight years.
[15:07] A: Okay.
[15:07] B: So, yeah, I was older.
[15:08] A: Yeah. You know, that's cool.
[15:10] B: But yeah.
[15:12] A: So mom got a better guy.
[15:13] B: Mom got a better guy.
[15:14] A: Yeah.
[15:14] B: I've got the guy she deserved, I think. I mean, like, I, I mean, they have owed a lot of drug addicts money, and I had to like, you know, like I said with the human trafficking, have to like, basically, you know, do what I'm told. Family's threatened, you know, either do this or want to kill your family.
[15:31] A: Pay it off by providing services.
[15:33] B: Yeah. And get drugged all the time and not really know what the hell was even going on. You know what's nice?
[15:40] A: That that's over.
[15:40] B: Yeah. Yeah. But like, yeah, it is nice to be over, you know, it took a long time to get here.
[15:47] A: Right.
[15:48] B: Man, I ended up waking up, I guess. I went to like, pay off a debt and they beat the out of me, raped me, burned me with cigarettes. Like I still got burn marks. Cut me up, had to go home. Explain that one. Yeah, you know, so, yeah, there's like a lot of like little things, you know, man, like abandonment, you know?
[16:10] A: Well, not feeling like they're there for you.
[16:12] B: Yeah. Or that I have to be like. I, like, I'm like to like the protector. I'm the one that has to take care of everybody or by people.
[16:20] A: Do you still do that with sibling?
[16:23] B: I have one blood sister, my sister Ashley. And no, she's. She's in the medical field. You know, she. It was easier for her to move on, I guess, in a way. She still talks to my dad, hangs out with him. You know, my dad will try to call me and I just, you know, all good, you know, because I know, like, nothing will ever. He'll never own up to anything. I gotta try, you know.
[16:47] A: He'll not own up to him doing.
[16:49] B: Half the stuff he did with my childhood. Because, like, on the outside, our family looked like the perfect family. He knew everybody. Everybody knew everybody in that town. Like the police or volunteers, like, you know what I mean?
[17:01] A: Like, everyone knew him.
[17:02] B: So it was like no one could ever believe that that happened. And then my parents finally did, like finally, like my mom finally had enough and did the divorce, it got really violent, a lot worse. We had to get a restraining order against him. So he would just show up. He showed up one time with a shotgun, trying to kill me and my mom. Had to jump out the freaking two story window, you know, a lot. And no one would believe us, what happened until we started videoing it, you know, and having this documentation. Yeah, there's a lot.
[17:32] A: Well, even you just telling me about it and thinking about it now, there's a whole bunch of discomfort.
[17:36] B: Mm. Always.
[17:37] A: Right.
[17:38] B: I don't like talking about it.
[17:39] A: So the reason that there's discomfort right now isn't because of what he did. Yeah, I know that that sounds Crazy.
[17:44] B: Yeah.
[17:45] A: But. But the reason that you're feeling the discomfort now is that part of your brain doesn't know those crazy moments ended.
[17:55] B: Yeah.
[17:56] A: That you actually survived it. That you're okay. Right. That. Right. We have actual good news to get in. Because there were moments that you thought that you were actually going to be dead.
[18:05] B: Oh. Yeah.
[18:06] A: Right. And we know that you did and welcomed it.
[18:08] B: Like, I was at the point where I was like, nothing could ever get worse than this. Like, at this point, I'd rather be dead than have to keep living this life.
[18:16] A: Yeah.
[18:17] B: You know what I mean? So it took a lot for me. Like, when I said Tyler Court saved my life. They did.
[18:22] A: Isn't that cool? It is Good for you.
[18:24] B: I was. I was literally at the point. I was doing 20, 40 crack rocks a day.
[18:29] A: Shooting 20 to 40 crack rocks a day, Mother.
[18:32] B: Yeah. Like, shooting two, three grams of fatty. Like, all my art records, according to them, I have over 165 overdoses. And I'm still here. Still here. Still here.
[18:42] A: All right, good.
[18:43] B: You know, so I worked hard to, like, get this far.
[18:46] A: Yeah.
[18:47] B: You know what I mean? But, like, I know I still have things I have to. Like. Like you said tonight, like, I was uncomfortable. And, like, not everyone understands that.
[18:54] A: Yes, but I only. I pointed that out to you because what I wanted you to understand is that that discomfort can go away.
[19:03] B: Yeah. I would love for it.
[19:05] A: When your brain emotionally realizes what happened is data.
[19:10] B: Yeah.
[19:11] A: When we unplug the memory, your brain will know that it's over.
[19:15] B: Yeah.
[19:16] A: Right. Right. So you thought of a couple different things.
[19:20] B: Yeah.
[19:21] A: Right. We could take care of a couple of those now.
[19:23] B: Yeah.
[19:24] A: It's pretty easy to do.
[19:25] B: Yeah.
[19:26] A: Right. Oh, it is. I mean, seriously, like, if you were to no longer be troubled by that.
[19:30] B: Yeah.
[19:30] A: Does that mean any of what you went through is okay?
[19:33] B: No.
[19:33] A: Right. You get to be okay even though that wasn't.
[19:36] B: Yeah.
[19:37] A: And if it's no longer troubling you, how would you actually be?
[19:40] B: I know.
[19:41] A: Like, how would you be as a person?
[19:43] B: I think it'd be a lot different. I wouldn't be on edge all the time.
[19:46] A: And if you weren't on edge, like, how would you be?
[19:49] B: I don't know. I have no idea.
[19:52] A: Well, what might be the opposite of being on edge?
[19:54] B: Happy.
[19:56] A: Huh.
[19:57] B: Not anxious. All time.
[19:59] A: And if you're not anxious, how are.
[20:00] B: You enjoying my moment in life?
[20:03] A: Oh, you're present. Yeah. Right. You're present and more. Okay.
[20:08] B: Yeah.
[20:10] A: Right. So where we're headed is a you who's Much more emotionally present.
[20:15] B: Yeah.
[20:15] A: Meaning she's dealing with what is without the emotional effect of what has. Got it. She's got the wisdom and knowledge from having gone through it.
[20:25] B: Yeah.
[20:25] A: Yet emotions are matching what's currently happening.
[20:28] B: Yeah. Because they don't always match.
[20:30] A: I know. That's why I'm saying.
[20:32] B: Yeah. They don't. Like I'll get mad instead of like, sad. It's like.
[20:36] A: Or you'll have a higher intensity of emotion than the situation requires. Got it. So where we're headed is a you who's more at peace and more. Okay.
[20:48] B: I can handle it.
[20:49] A: Much more comfortable in your own skin and is able to see things with a little more distance.
[20:54] B: Yeah.
[20:55] A: So that she sees them clearly for what they are. Got it.
[21:00] B: Yep.
[21:00] A: Yeah. Because you know that dad being that way wasn't really about you. It's about whatever screwed up in dad.
[21:10] B: Yeah.
[21:11] A: But you know that here. You don't feel that in here.
[21:15] B: Like, I hate him.
[21:16] A: So that's the part that we're changing.
[21:18] B: Yeah.
[21:18] A: Right. Whether you hate him or not.
[21:20] B: Yeah.
[21:21] A: Right. We want the effect of what he's done to be cleared and gone.
[21:25] B: Yeah.
[21:26] A: Cool. Okay. So then all you do is. We want to get your body into the right states to heal. So you can slightly lower your jaw. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. And then you begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper than normal. And then as you exhale, the exhale becomes a little bit longer than normal. Normal. So it's a slower than normal breath in and a longer than normal exhale. Right. And as you're breathing in this way, just check inside your body. How's your body beginning to feel now? Like more tense or more calm?
[22:06] B: I don't know yet.
[22:07] A: You don't know yet, do you? Isn't that interesting?
[22:11] B: Yeah.
[22:11] A: Right. You don't know how your body's feeling. What if you checked?
[22:16] B: I don't even know how to check. I still feel like I'm like, tensed up a little bit.
[22:19] A: Yeah. So that's the question. Is it as tense or has it.
[22:23] B: No, it's not as.
[22:24] A: Notice how it's gotten a little less.
[22:25] B: Yeah, it has got a little less, but I've never really.
[22:28] A: So the next thing that we want to do is we want to decrease. See, we're down. Regulating your nervous system so that it's easier for you to be emotionally present. Got it. So the next part is you continue to breathe in that slightly slower and deeper way on the inhale and longer on the exhale. Your jaw is slightly lowered and you're resting your tongue. You then want to look across and see me in my nose. You're going to stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers. Stay looking at my nose. My fingers move out. And with the sides of your eyes, pick up my fingers wiggling. Right. Notice how you're aware of the space, like towards the side windows and doors, the space between you and me and the space beyond me, the space under you and behind you, the space above your head. Right. Kara, as you're noticing more of the space, how's your body feeling now? Isn't that cool?
[23:28] B: Yeah.
[23:28] A: Right, and then the last little one. Have you ever said or heard somebody use the phrase, I'm under a lot of stress?
[23:34] B: Yeah.
[23:34] A: Right. And in order to be underneath the stress, where must the stress be?
[23:38] B: Under you.
[23:39] A: No, if I'm underneath the stress. Right. If I'm underneath the stress, it must be on top of me. That's why I'm telling you I'm under it. Right. So the reversal is to get out from under it and to be up above it having what we call the bird's eye view, which is a view from above, where I see things under and below. But not just a perched bird of free soaring, flying, burned. So again, jaw is slightly lowered. You're resting your tongue. You're breathing in a little bit slower and deeper. You're breathing out a little bit longer. You see me in my nose, my fingers, they go all the way out. You notice the wiggling. As you're aware of the space, notice how the space goes beyond the room, literally all the way out in every direction. That the space is truly unending, like towards outer space and beyond. Right. You're noticing the space. Briefly close your eyes and then imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof so that you rise way up above it. All in the sky. Having this bird's eye view, you're able to see everything is being underneath and below you because you're above and over it. And like the bird, you're free to just soar and glide and fly and move through the space of the sky with big, wide, arching turns and curves. Curves. You soar, you fly, you glide, you move, you're free. Bring awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you. Take a nice deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Good. Those short moments, eyes were closed, what were you noticing within yourself?
[25:21] B: Just calmness. A lot of Calmness. A lot of relaxation.
[25:23] A: Yeah.
[25:26] B: Noticing things I didn't notice before.
[25:28] A: You are, aren't you?
[25:29] B: Yeah.
[25:30] A: You're able to be aware of things that you aren't because you're present.
[25:33] B: Yeah.
[25:34] A: And your nervous system is down regulated, so it's taking you out of tunnel vision. And you're able to see more.
[25:39] B: Yeah.
[25:40] A: Right. Then all we want to do is as we're headed towards the future, you, we're going to unplug a memory. So we're going to think of a particular thing, a particular, particular time. One time that it happened. Not a particular moment. You might have been how old?
[25:54] B: How old I was?
[25:55] A: Yeah. Back then?
[25:59] B: 10.
[26:00] A: 10. Good. So. And as you think about that moment, the feelings are feelings of like hurt, anger, sadness, grief, guilt, shame, regret. Good. So would it be okay to get it gone?
[26:09] B: Yeah.
[26:10] A: And it being gone doesn't mean what happened was okay. Right. You get to be okay even though it wasn't. Got it. Second, because that happened at 10. There have been lots of things you've done later in life that were more enjoyable than that one. What's one thing you've done anytime from 10 until yesterday that was more fun than that?
[26:28] B: I moved in with my partner.
[26:30] A: Yeah. Moved in with your partner. Way more fun than that. Good. Something else?
[26:33] B: Graduated tile. Of course.
[26:34] A: Yeah. Graduated Tyler. Good. And one other thing.
[26:40] B: I went to pride.
[26:42] A: Yeah, go to pride. All of those moments happened after that. There's a part of the brain that doesn't know any moment beyond it. So we have good news to get in then. You're going to tell me what happened, but in a matter of fact way, and in a minute or less it'll go, that happened, that happened. That happened, that happened, that happened. Then it was done. You're going to intend to be with me emotionally. The reason you want to be with me is that this is the thing that's happening and that isn't.
[27:05] B: Yes.
[27:05] A: 2. We're working on the goal that we both want for you.
[27:07] B: 3.
[27:08] A: You know, I'm at least a little more fun than a sucky mom.
[27:10] B: Yes. A lot more fun. Got it.
[27:13] A: Good job. So when that one happened in your 10, when it happened, you're where?
[27:18] B: I was at my home.
[27:19] A: Pennsylvania. In the house. Right. Daytime or nighttime?
[27:22] B: Evening time.
[27:22] A: Evening. In your upstairs or downstairs, main floor. Main floor. Right. Good. Like you're by the kitchen, dining room, hallway. You're in the hallway. Right. Good. And what happened next?
[27:31] B: Dad came out drunk.
[27:32] A: Right. Dad was drunk. Right.
[27:34] B: Went after my sister.
[27:35] A: He was angry. He went towards Your sister. Right, good. Then what happened next?
[27:37] B: Started dragging her down the hall by her hair.
[27:39] A: Right.
[27:39] B: I grabbed.
[27:40] A: And she was screaming.
[27:41] B: Right. I grabbed her.
[27:42] A: You grabbed her. Right. Pushed him. Right.
[27:44] B: Whatever tumbled out of the house.
[27:47] A: Right, good.
[27:48] B: I took the.
[27:48] A: And then what happened next?
[27:49] B: I took the brother.
[27:50] A: Well, he did what?
[27:51] B: Hit me, Punched me.
[27:52] A: Hit you. Punched you?
[27:53] B: Bless me, Everything.
[27:54] A: Then did stuff to your body. Right. Then eventually stopped and then disappeared and then left, which was better than when he was doing all that. And then later on, you did something more fun like go to Prague or graduate Tyler, move in with your guy.
[28:09] B: Yeah.
[28:09] A: Right, good. So notice as you were telling me about it, there was some discomfort.
[28:13] B: Yeah.
[28:13] A: Not because that was such a yucky moment, but it was already less. Because you're intending to be here.
[28:18] B: Yeah.
[28:20] A: Your brain is beginning to read it as data.
[28:22] B: Okay.
[28:23] A: So we never go backwards with the memory, but when we do it literally unplugs it. It takes away the charge. We're going to go back.
[28:29] B: Okay.
[28:29] A: So we've got, you know, graduating from Thailand, moving in with your girlfriend. We got going to Pride. Right. And then he left. And then he had stopped, and then he had had his penis in different parts of your body, and then he had hit your body in different ways with fists and hands. And then you had gone back inside, and then you got your sister out, and then he had taken the tumble, and then you had pushed him and then grabbed her, and then he was pulling her by her hair, and then he had come home. And then before that, you all were doing whatever you're doing. Right. As I went through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[29:04] B: It wasn't that bad.
[29:05] A: I know. Isn't that crazy? Right. Because your brain is beginning to read it as data about something that happened, not happening. Third, the emotional brain does not get logic, but it does get patterns of association. And the error is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening have been glued together. So they're living as if they're the same thing. But there are things that you can remember doing today that you know you're not doing. Like, for example, putting your socks on.
[29:34] B: Yeah.
[29:35] A: Right. You can remember where you were when you did it. Right. But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your socks on, and then I went, kara, stop putting on your socks. You look at me and go, I'm not putting on my socks. Because, you know there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually do it.
[29:51] B: Yes.
[29:51] A: Got it. So you can remember him Doing that?
[29:54] B: Yeah.
[29:54] A: Grabbing your sister, you jumping in, him punching you, him doing that stuff to your body. Sexual. You can remember all that happening? You can remember putting your socks on?
[30:02] B: Yes.
[30:02] A: Kara, stop putting on your socks. Say, I'm not putting on my socks. Well, stop me from putting on my socks. Say, you're not putting on your socks. Well, then stop dad from punching you. Say, he's not punching me. Well, stop him from grabbing sister's hair. Say he's not doing that. Well, then you stop putting on your hat. See, I'm not putting on my hat. Stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt. Well, stop dad from doing that sex stuff. So he's not doing that stuff.
[30:25] B: Yes.
[30:26] A: Right. Well, stop him from doing it.
[30:27] B: Say he's not doing it. Yeah.
[30:29] A: So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. And as this starts to get in, what do you notice happening to the feelings? Isn't that interesting? Right. Him doing that. Could that have anything to do with you?
[30:44] B: No.
[30:44] A: No. Which you know now.
[30:45] B: Yeah.
[30:46] A: You didn't fully feel it then.
[30:48] B: No.
[30:49] A: Right. And what we're going to get to. Which we won't do today, but is also at a deeper level because we frequently walk around confusing who I am as I am my body. Right. Because you're in it.
[31:02] B: Yeah.
[31:02] A: So it would be easy for me to go, well, this is my hand, so this is me.
[31:05] B: Yes.
[31:06] A: But what if you have a body and it's totally yours.
[31:11] B: Yeah.
[31:11] A: But it isn't you.
[31:12] B: Yeah.
[31:13] A: Right. My mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident when she was younger. And when people see her now and she goes to visit lots of friends and whatever, they don't say to her, susie, I'm so glad almost all of you could come over.
[31:24] B: Yeah. I'm so glad you're here.
[31:26] A: Right. They don't think part of her is missing because part of her body's missing. So we could say that there's no part of your body right now that's the same as any of it when it was back then.
[31:37] B: Yeah.
[31:38] A: Like it's all been replaced.
[31:39] B: Yeah. That's all new.
[31:41] A: Right? Right. So what if in all of that stuff, we're not all the way there yet. But what if he never touched you? He messed with your stuff.
[31:51] B: Yeah.
[31:51] A: And there's not a part of your stuff that's the same.
[31:55] B: Not at all.
[31:56] A: I know. So what if. Right. What if we were able to get it at a deeper Level which we're not there yet. We're on our way and we'll get there as we get together the next time. But at the deeper level, you get it that he never touched who you really are.
[32:11] B: Yeah. Did you change?
[32:13] A: He never touched you. Because you're not your body, just like you're not your brain.
[32:17] B: Yeah.
[32:17] A: Even though you have one and it's the thinker of your thoughts, not you.
[32:21] B: Yeah.
[32:22] A: Right. You also have feelings. They're yours, not you. There's things you do, but stuff you've done, but you're not what you do or what you've done.
[32:31] B: Yeah.
[32:32] A: So you're not any of those things. So it makes the weird question, what.
[32:36] B: Are you still figuring it out?
[32:39] A: Weird. Right? But think of a time when you were outdoors in nature and you see something beautiful.
[32:45] B: Yeah.
[32:45] A: And as you see it, it's like captured your awareness. And in that moment you're like with it and you're like, wow.
[32:50] B: Yeah.
[32:51] A: What is it that you see?
[32:53] B: I have a lot. I always see a lot of Blue Jays around. My one meeting I go to and it's.
[32:58] A: Yeah.
[32:59] B: I always love Blue Jayson visiting you. Yeah. I always love looking at them.
[33:04] A: Isn't there a moment that as you're seeing the blue jay, you're feeling like that sense of awe, peace, wonder, excitement. And some people would tell you, well, of course seeing it is going to give you those feelings. But if we looked at it differently, we could say that seeing it and being there drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what if at your center you always are peaceful and excited?
[33:31] B: Yeah.
[33:31] A: Like it's a light.
[33:32] B: Yeah.
[33:33] A: And what we talk about it in religious circles, they call it your soul or your essence, your spirit. But we don't have to think of it as some sort of thing you have. What if we thought of the light, the energy is you. It's the thing that's powering the body.
[33:47] B: Yeah.
[33:48] A: Right. That. That's you. And that light, that is you can't get touched in that way. So that's where we're headed. And we're going to get that all the way in. But what you want to do first is you want to let the younger. You know. By the way, what's something enjoyable that had nothing to do with dad. That happened.
[34:04] B: Well before 10, I was an all state soccer player. So I started soccer at five years old.
[34:09] A: Playing soccer.
[34:10] B: Yeah.
[34:10] A: Way better, right? Yeah. And where'd you play? Like forward back?
[34:14] B: I was forward.
[34:15] A: You're forward, right? Yeah. So that's the Fun part, because you get to score.
[34:18] B: I was always up there.
[34:19] A: Right, Right. So, playing soccer. So as we go back on the changing of the bookends.
[34:25] B: Yeah.
[34:25] A: We've got moving in with your gal.
[34:27] B: Yeah.
[34:27] A: Right. And completing Tyla. And what's the last one? Oh, right. Butter Pride. Right. And then even well before that we got playing soccer.
[34:35] B: Yep.
[34:36] A: Right. Got it.
[34:38] B: Yeah.
[34:39] A: So now close your eyes. Picture the younger you. Let that younger you back then know that that's over, finished, completed, defeated. That experience no longer exist. Exists. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know that she didn't need dad to be well in order for you to be okay and meet your gal and move in with her. Right, Right. Or go to pride so that she gets it that you're okay. Let her know that Dad's not well and that Dad's not being well. Had nothing to do with you or your lovability, but had everything to do with what's off with dad. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Right. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about completing Tylenol. Let her know how she's positively changing her life. Let her know about wanting to go into corrections. Let her know. Right. And as that gets into the younger you, what do you notice happening to her face? Right. And you can open your eyes. Isn't that interesting?
[35:37] B: Yeah.
[35:38] A: Right. So notice there is more for us to do.
[35:41] B: Yeah.
[35:42] A: But check. Think about that time now. What do you notice in terms of how it feels? I know. Isn't that cool?
[35:51] B: Yeah.
[35:52] A: And notice that that's different than it's ever been.
[35:54] B: Yeah.
[35:55] A: Got it. So that's just a sample of what we're doing because we only got together for an hour. The next time we get together, we're gonna have like a two and a half to three hour chunk of time to change all of that. But notice how we didn't have to do it in a way that had. You have to be there, there.
[36:09] B: Yeah.
[36:11] A: Got it.
[36:11] B: Interesting. Yeah.
[36:13] A: And here's the cool part. Once your brain gets that, it's data.
[36:16] B: Yeah.
[36:17] A: It can't go back to thinking it's happening.
[36:19] B: Okay.
[36:20] A: It's like once your brain gets that Santa's Make Believe, it can't go back to believing.
[36:25] B: You can't go back to believing or anything. You already know.
[36:28] A: Got it.
[36:29] B: Yeah.
[36:29] A: Same thing. Okay, cool.
[36:32] B: That's cool.
[36:32] A: Yeah. So, any questions for me?
[36:35] B: No. That was interesting. I've never done anything like that, but I definitely, like feel a lot better.
[36:40] A: Right, right.
[36:41] B: And what we're starting it as a negative thing.
[36:43] A: What we're starting to do is change the way your brain has that information coded. Because we're seeing it with clear eyes.
[36:51] B: Yeah.
[36:52] A: Because we've got distance.
[36:54] B: Yeah.
[36:55] A: Right. So that's just one. We're gonna do more. And as we do that, it's going to take care of the night terror. Hers.
[37:02] B: Yeah.
[37:02] A: It's gonna get it. So that when you're with your gal, you're more comfortable and okay in you.
[37:09] B: Yeah.
[37:10] A: So that whole, like, jealous or. Oh, no, what is she. Or I'm not going to be okay. If we're like. We want that to all dissipate and disappear.
[37:19] B: Yes.
[37:20] A: That you're good on your own.
[37:21] B: Yeah.
[37:22] A: That it's easier for you to be emotionally present and your emotions matching. What happens.
[37:27] B: Yes.
[37:28] A: Got it.
[37:29] B: I like that.
[37:30] A: That you get to actually lighten up a little bit.
[37:32] B: Yeah.
[37:34] A: Yeah. Right. And be able to experience more of the joy in what you've already accomplished in where you're headed.
[37:42] B: Yes.
[37:43] A: Got it.
[37:44] B: Got it.
[37:44] A: That's where we're headed. You did great today.
[37:46] B: Thank you.
[37:47] A: Yeah. It was really nice meeting you.
[37:49] B: Yeah. Now, how do I schedule? Do I schedule with you or how?
[37:51] A: That's a good question. We probably can go talk to Patty about that.
