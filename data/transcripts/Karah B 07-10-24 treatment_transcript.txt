[00:00] A: All right, so Today is the 9th. 9th. No, it's the 10th.
[00:04] B: It's 10th.
[00:05] A: It's the 10th. Darn it. All right, so it's the 10th of July. July. Kara. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, it might be made available in teaching and training others. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:21] B: Yes, it is.
[00:22] A: Cool. So first, how did our last session leave you? When you think about the one thing that we talked about and unplugged, what do you notice as you think about that?
[00:32] B: It was pretty good. I actually had it because, you know, I'm in recovery. I had to tell my story.
[00:37] A: Oh.
[00:37] B: And like, for the first time, like, I wasn't, like, nervous or anxious or, like, freaked out about certain things. So it was, like, actually very helpful for me to, like, tell my story and not break down and not be in it. Yeah.
[00:49] A: Oh, you were able to actually tell it as a story.
[00:51] B: As a story and not, like, break.
[00:53] A: Instead of reliving the horror.
[00:56] B: So it was pretty cool. That's great.
[00:58] A: Oh, good for you.
[00:59] B: And I was able to, like, tell it in a way. I was very raw with it. But, like, usually I get real, like, my hands get sweaty, I get real nervous, I get anxious.
[01:07] A: Right.
[01:08] B: All those things. And, like, I did it right. I was able to just get through the story.
[01:12] A: Right.
[01:12] B: And it be and leave it at that place after I told the story. So it was cool.
[01:17] A: Right. Because the difference was you weren't re experiencing it even though you were raw with it, because you were telling about something that's really difficult and was difficult to go through. Right. Like, I mean, so it was definitely interesting. Yeah.
[01:34] B: I didn't have to, like, I just went home and I went to bed and I was knocked out. I was tired. But, like, it was. It was refreshing not to, like, be thinking about it. Usually I would think about it, like, the horse date you probably into the next day.
[01:49] A: Really. If you had shared something like that in a meeting, normally that would be just, like, replaying.
[01:53] B: It would be replaying.
[01:54] A: Interesting.
[01:55] B: And everything would be like. I'd be like, yeah.
[01:57] A: So it was cool.
[01:59] B: Yeah.
[01:59] A: Yay. Well, that's a really good question. Has your gal noticed anything?
[02:05] B: She noticed I'm more not, like, open, but, like, I'm receiving things a lot better.
[02:12] A: Okay.
[02:13] B: And I'm like, actually, like, if she would, like, raise her voice or something, I'm able to, like, tell her and not just break down and walk away.
[02:20] A: Isn't that cool.
[02:21] B: Yeah. So. So it has been interesting, I bet.
[02:24] A: Because it's not reading so much. Like what?
[02:27] B: Yeah.
[02:27] A: And remember the thing that happens in our brain?
[02:30] B: Right.
[02:30] A: We go through troubling moments. Those troubling moments, short circuit, part of the brain doesn't know they're over. They are then more vigilant and more sensitive to look for it. Anything that's similar to it gets kind of circled into it. So now it becomes more robust.
[02:47] B: Yes.
[02:47] A: Right. So now it can pull in even more things. It's like what happens when. If you've ever gone to the fair and gotten cotton candy and they. There's the stick that they. Or the cone thing, and then they put it in there and they spin it around and then I pull it out and it's like a little bit and they spin around again and all of a sudden it's just like this fake monster thing. That's what happens with troubling moments. Some of them kind of overlap because they happen around similar times and similar. So now we've got this conglomeration that's constantly vigilant, sensitive, scanning, looking for anything that could be similar to a reminder of. And it triggers off. Right. And the last part to that is because when we were little, it was shaped for us to be thinking that good things happen when I'm being good.
[03:37] B: Yeah.
[03:38] A: That it's my behavior, my actions, my purity of thought, good thoughts that enable the good things to happen to me.
[03:47] B: Yeah.
[03:47] A: Right. So because I'm a good boy and I gave my younger brother a kiss and I prayed, then, you know, good things will happen.
[03:56] B: Yeah.
[03:57] A: Right. And that's great because every mythology, story, tell tale for kids reinforce it. But we know it's not true.
[04:07] B: Yeah.
[04:07] A: We know good things happen to bad people without them doing anything. We know that bad things happen to good people without. So we know that things happen. And it doesn't have anything to do with whether you're good or bad. But again, if that's what got layered in for the first seven years of my life, and that's a regressed part. Right. Younger part of me. Well, what happens when I get thrown into a state of higher emotion? What part of my brain body takes over? Is it my intellectual brain where I'm rational, reasonable, like a scientist, or is it my emotional brain that works like a goat? Got it. So all that other messaging makes the bad things that happen around me or to me feel like it had some. Something to do with me. I mean, because it happened to me, of course it had something to do with me. It had something to do with me being stupid or me not knowing better or me wearing something that showed too much or somehow all of what happened had something to do with me. Yeah, right. Like I had a husband in crazy situations. He. He's angry at his wife, who's also angry at him, but he's angry at his wife for getting assaulted. What's that? He blames her for it because she never should have gone out with the girl that he knows is not a good girl for her to go out with. Because if she hadn't gone out with that girl, then she never would have been at the place. She never would have. That never would. Like, okay, that could happen anywhere.
[05:55] B: That could happen out in that parking lot right there.
[05:58] A: Right, right. But people go back to. They have, like, more. More saying control and. And the problem is blame.
[06:08] B: Yeah.
[06:08] A: We go. Forgiveness is great, but you can't forgive unless you're blaming. And blaming could. And that's not useful for their relationship for him to be mad at her. Right. Because I said to him, I go, well, yeah, of course. Because if she had known that by going out with that woman, it would have led her to having been assaulted. Do you think she would have got out with a woman? Of course not. That wasn't even on the radar screen of a possibility. Maybe she thought, okay, I might drink a little too much or, you know, this girl gets online, whatever. She might have.
[06:44] B: Yeah. But that wasn't in the agenda.
[06:46] A: Right. So that's the issue, is it goes into myself and it goes culture and society blames me.
[06:55] B: Yeah.
[06:55] A: That, you know, all of the bad things that have happened are my fault. So what you're starting to notice is when she's in an upset, it's not immediately feeling like it means some sort of deficiency in you. You're able to see it with a little more distance. We want even more distance as her stuff. And you're more freed up to be like, hey, babe, I don't know whether you realize, but your voice has got.
[07:24] B: Yeah, she doesn't realize it sometimes.
[07:26] A: Right.
[07:27] B: That's why I've been saying something.
[07:28] A: Right.
[07:29] B: She doesn't do it as much.
[07:30] A: Right. But you've been freed up to be able to say it. How cool is that? Yeah. Yeah, cool. Any other stuff that you've noticed? I mean, that's really cool.
[07:43] B: Well, you know about the razor blade story, the. When the guy let the razor blade.
[07:48] A: Oh.
[07:49] B: Inside of me. My grandma. I take care of my grandma. She has Alzheimer's, dementia. You know what I mean, so I'm there like every day because my mom works, but then my stepdad works, so she had one of those little razor blades for your eyebrows. I was just joking around.
[08:02] A: I was like, putting it on me grandma was.
[08:04] B: Yeah. Like, just messing around.
[08:06] A: Okay, this is yours.
[08:07] B: Like, I'm gonna shave your legs. And it did trigger me, like, oh, me? Probably custode that foul. I'm not gonna lie. But I did. I said. I was like, I don't know if you remember this. Remember I was. I was hurt with a razor blade. So can you not do that? And it was. It was. I never made up it. I probably would have yelled at her.
[08:22] A: Right.
[08:23] B: But I did it. And I was able to like.
[08:25] A: Yeah.
[08:25] B: Take the situation like, down levels instead of like escalating it to a multitude of like, I'm never coming here again, like, you know, hating you.
[08:35] A: Right.
[08:35] B: So that was interesting too.
[08:37] A: That's very cool.
[08:38] B: But yeah, I've been just kind of like 10 to take deep breaths and just like.
[08:43] A: Yeah.
[08:43] B: Because I know it only lasts like a few seconds.
[08:46] A: Isn't that cool?
[08:47] B: So like, if I can just get through this, like, first five seconds, like, I'm fine.
[08:50] A: That's right. Because biochemically, on its own, maximum 30 seconds.
[08:55] B: Yeah.
[08:56] A: Most are a few.
[08:57] B: Yeah.
[08:58] A: So can I stay with the sensation long enough to let it go by? Right. And I can take a breath. So what you're noticing, and this is what we want even more of. You're noticing that you're having more space between the thing and your reaction to the thing.
[09:14] B: Yeah.
[09:15] A: You follow me? That, like, normally the thing. My reaction. Right. So that would. That. So now you're gaining a little more space.
[09:26] B: Yeah.
[09:27] A: Between the thing and your reaction to that.
[09:29] B: Yeah.
[09:30] A: Isn't that cool? It is cool. Good job.
[09:32] B: Yeah.
[09:32] A: Awesome. Yeah.
[09:33] B: I've been trying to like, really like, work it in there.
[09:36] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[09:37] B: It's like, oh, me, I wouldn't have. I probably would have just been like, eh, whatever, this guy's just saying this. But like, I really am. I don't want to live like that, you know?
[09:45] A: Right.
[09:45] B: I really don't, so.
[09:47] A: Right. And secondarily it's much easier to do it when it. The emotional charge has already been unplugged. Right. The reason that you were able to share the story and be present as you were doing it, even though it was raw, because it was difficult content to share in a group of people, baby.
[10:11] B: To today, it was hard, you know.
[10:13] A: Right. Like so. So as we think about that, that's amazing.
[10:17] B: Yeah.
[10:18] A: Right. Because that doesn't normally happen. Right.
[10:22] B: Have been all type of emotions.
[10:24] A: Of course. But I would have not told the whole. As you were.
[10:28] B: Yeah.
[10:29] A: Telling it. Yeah.
[10:31] B: And like, see, like I did it in front of like I was at a halfway house.
[10:35] A: Yeah.
[10:35] B: And they asked me to come back and tell my story because I knew what I. Like the owners knew what I've been through, like what I was getting done with my port.
[10:42] A: Yeah.
[10:43] B: So like it's all women and like seeing other people cry and like, see their emotions can also trigger my emotions. But it really didn't. It was like I kind of just stayed on track and I just breathed through the whole thing instead of like all of them breaking down or.
[11:00] A: Right.
[11:00] B: Someone wasn't paying attention or get irritated, you know.
[11:03] A: Right.
[11:03] B: But I did it. So it was cool. It was very interesting.
[11:06] A: Yeah. All that stuff wasn't being experienced inside is feeling about you.
[11:12] B: Yeah.
[11:13] A: Normally if somebody's looking bored, you're feeling it.
[11:16] B: Yeah.
[11:17] A: Like an attack.
[11:20] B: Yeah. But I didn't. So I was just like. Okay.
[11:24] A: Isn't that cool?
[11:25] B: It is cool.
[11:26] A: Yeah. Good job. Well, I'm super excited. We're on our way.
[11:30] B: Yep.
[11:33] A: Any other stuff, like, come to mind? Any other things that you think would be useful for me to know?
[11:38] B: Like good things or.
[11:40] A: Yeah, anything.
[11:42] B: I don't know. I'm happy. I'm like, I'm doing this because, like my two years is next month.
[11:47] A: Cool.
[11:47] B: So like. And that's like a big. For me because usually I don't last as long because I let everything just take me back out and I got this time.
[11:55] A: Yeah. So like, you're worth it. Yeah.
[11:58] B: Like being able to feel it and like everything is like, it's helpful. It sucks too sometimes. But like, that's just part of life.
[12:06] A: But.
[12:06] B: Yeah. But no, nothing. Nothing really bad has been happening.
[12:09] A: Okay.
[12:10] B: If I'm being completely honest.
[12:11] A: Yeah.
[12:12] B: Everything's been kind of just going.
[12:14] A: Going to flow. Yeah.
[12:16] B: So I.
[12:17] A: Still interested in working in the jails.
[12:19] B: Yeah.
[12:20] A: Cool.
[12:20] B: I actually am waiting for my. The people at Tyler sent a referral to an attorney for free for me to. For them. They. I had to go do an interview for them to expunge my record.
[12:32] A: Okay.
[12:32] B: So I'm waiting for that.
[12:33] A: Okay.
[12:34] B: So that way it's like all done.
[12:36] A: Nice. Good for you. How exciting.
[12:40] B: Everything. Slowly but surely everything is.
[12:43] A: Yeah.
[12:44] B: Coming into place.
[12:44] A: Yeah. Well, that's the thing. We. We can't know what timetable things are going to happen.
[12:50] B: No. I know me, I would have been very impatient, like blowing everyone Up. But I'm just like, yes, it's okay, it's gonna happen.
[12:56] A: Things happen however long they take.
[12:58] B: Yeah.
[12:59] A: And I think now the new thing that I. People get stressed out because we're too focused on time. Like I don't have enough of it or it's not happening fast enough or it's a stress out on time. But time is linear.
[13:16] B: Yeah.
[13:17] A: So time is a linear thing. In our brain, time and space are experienced as the same thing because they're not represented like a chronological. They're represented in a sub modality way, which would be in a visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, gustatory. That's how our brain kind of codes information. Right. So. So what's really interesting is because our brain like codes all that information. If you can get the brain to understand. And I'll say it in a different way, space is greater than time.
[14:03] B: Yeah.
[14:03] A: So space as a context is bigger than time. So if you get somebody connected to more of the space that's in between them and whatever stressing them out, and then you can get them to notice the space in between the steps of doing the thing that's stressing them out and you can open up more space. They're going to feel like they've got more time. It's not going to feel so overwhelming. Yeah, right. There's a thing that meditators talk about. They go, okay, so here's the deal. And I learned TM a long time ago, Transcendental meditation. And they say, okay, you're supposed to do TM twice a day, 20 minutes every day.
[14:44] B: Yeah.
[14:45] A: Unless you're super stressed out. And then we want you meditating for an hour. What?
[14:52] B: Yeah.
[14:53] A: You want me to do more. But what I find always when I meditate, after meditating, when I don't even feel like I've got enough time, after I meditate, I always have more time. Yeah. Than I thought.
[15:04] B: Yeah.
[15:05] A: More relaxed because I got connected more to the space.
[15:08] B: Yeah.
[15:09] A: Right. So where we're headed is a U where the impact of the prior stuff clears. You're much more emotionally present and much more comfortable in your own skin. A lot lighter. That you experience more seeing other people's stuff clearly as being about them as it's being registered inside as info about them. Depending on who it is and what it's about, you have flexibility in how you are with it. Because sometimes it might require you being more caring, compassionate, understanding, interested. Sometimes it might require more firm and direct. Sometimes it might not require anything. So it just goes by. Right. So we want it to be based on the circumstance and the situation in the context, so that there's a lot more range in how you are in dealing with stuff. Makes sense. More lightness inside. And as we're organizing towards that. Right. You can slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, and begin to breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and then a little bit longer on the exhale. And you might notice that as you begin to breathe in this way, you're intentionally causing your breath to happen. So it'll happen in a different way than how it naturally happens. Doing that begins to alter your state of consciousness. And as you're noticing all of that, how's your body beginning to feel now? Like, more tense or more calm, more relaxed? It is. It's feeling more relaxed.
[16:53] B: Right.
[16:53] A: As your body's feeling more relaxed, think of a time when you were outdoors in nature, and you see something that's just beautiful. Like, the moment you're looking at it, it's captured your awareness. You're like, wow, what is it that you see?
[17:09] B: It was actually the clouds last night.
[17:11] A: Yeah. Wasn't there a moment that as you were seeing those clouds, you were feeling that sense of peace, wonder, excitement? And some people would tell you, of course, being there and seeing that is going to give you the feelings. But if we looked at it differently, we could say that being there and experiencing it drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what if, Kara, at your center, you always are peaceful and excited. Right. We talk about a baby, and when a baby is born, they're whole and complete. There's nothing missing. They're perfect little beings. If that's the case, why, as we get older, do we feel there's a whole bunch of shit that's not okay in me and a whole bunch of shit that's missing that. Sometimes I think I need it from over there in order for me to be okay in here. Right. If I started off right.
[18:07] B: Perfect.
[18:08] A: Yeah. And so what it is, is it's the experiences that we go through that slam imprints on this that block access to the light at the center. Right. And so you know that, like, light at the center kind of like if I'm, you know, well, at the campfire and it's cold, so I bring my hands to the flames and I go, my goodness, the fire getting hotter? Is the fire getting hotter? No, I'm becoming more aware of the heat.
[18:45] B: Yeah.
[18:46] A: So we know that in your life there have been multitudes of experiences where Your awareness was anywhere but at your center. The stress for the upsets, right? But no matter where, awareness has been always at your center. You're peaceful and excited in the same way. You know, two of us are in here. How do you know that? Well, your senses bring in data. Your intellect organizes it. We think of that as knowledge. People call knowledge light, will call it light of knowledge. At your center, it's a brighter light. It's light of wisdom. So now we've got light of knowledge, We've got light of wisdom. And as you know, I work with all sorts of people. People have had all sorts of up happen. Yeah, right. All sorts of people with all sorts of crazy stuff that's happened. I remember one girl, older brother, for whatever reason, used to take his GI Joe figures and march them up her leg and park them in her. So she had a lot of around all of that. We worked together, cleared it. Gone. All the shame, the disgust, the anger, they're gone. And I'm asking her the question. I go, you know, all that. Ugh. I go, where was it? And she looks at me, she's got this big smile, and she's like, it's gone. I don't feel any of it. I go, I know. Isn't that cool? And she goes, it is. I said, but the question was, where was it? And so the two of us started thinking. I go, was it at the surface level? And she's like, it wasn't an intellectual thing. Oh, well, then maybe it was hiding in your center. And she's like, dude, really? How could that stuff survive? And the light were un. Peaceful and excited. So I asked again. I go, well, then, where was it? And this is what she said. It was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I'm like, well, what happened? She goes, the lights are now touching. The shadows are gone. And then we started talking about how people fuck up identity all the time. People walk around thinking that they're their bodies. I mean, you might even think it yourself. I'm my body. Well, of course I'm my body. I'm in it. It's me. But what if you aren't your body? What if your body's totally yours, but it isn't you? Right. Like, my mom lost the tip of her finger in a snow cone machine accident. When she visits people now, they don't say to her, I'm glad almost all of you could come over. She's all there.
[20:51] B: Yeah.
[20:51] A: Even if the part of her fingers missing. So you have a body. Your body's totally Yours, but it isn't you. There's not a cell that's the same. They've all been replaced millions of times. Right. Your feet are alone or longer than they were when you were two.
[21:04] B: Yeah.
[21:05] A: Yet, despite the changes, you're you. So you're not your body. Then people go, well, then I must be my thoughts. But what if you're not your thoughts? What if, Carrie, you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? What if your brain is the thinker of your thoughts and your brain is not you? Your brain, just like your heart and your lungs are organs, they're yours, not you. So now you're not your thoughts, you're not your body. You must be how you feel. Except you feel different ways at different times, so you can't be a feeling. Oh, well, then maybe you're what you do. Yeah, but there's lots of things you've done. And when you stop doing that thing to do this thing, you didn't stop existing. So the weirder question becomes, if you're not your body, if you're not your thoughts, if you're not what you do, and if you're not how you feel, then what the heck are you? Weird. Right? So we're gonna say that the who you are is what you became aware of as you see the clouds. That in that moment, what was happening is your awareness was being drawn down in towards the light at the center. And that light, that is you, A, is already whole and complete. There's nothing missing. B, can't be touched, hurt or harmed. Is whole and complete. And I say, can't be touched, hurt or harmed. Because if we had an orb of light and a monster was angry at it and swore at it, would have hurt the orb of light. No. Go right through it. If the monster spit at it, would it bother the light? No, it go right through it. Take its claws and slash it. Machete, machine gun. Life can't be touched in that way.
[22:52] B: Yeah.
[22:53] A: Right.
[22:54] B: But it can't be covered.
[22:56] A: It can. And see, that's what we're interested in, taking away the experiences that have been blocking access to you, connecting to more of who you are. Right. So people tell me all the time, you know, I hear this. You know, I go to the dentist, and they. I tell them, I go. I go to the guy, and he's a jerk. Why is he a jerk? I go, well, you won't believe what he did. What did he do? Well, he put me on a chair. Yeah. And my head went down. Yeah. And my feet Went up. Yeah, you're at the dentist. Okay. But then he shined a light in my eye. Move this thing. Brighten my. I can't see like, you're at the dentist, right? Huh? Well, then he took this cold instrument and shoved it inside of me. And they're like, you're what? I go, I'm at the freaking dentist. My mouth. Right. But see, that's the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother in the GI Joe figure. I said, when you were really little, he messed with your stuff. And she looked at me and she said, he did. And for a long time, that screwed up my thinking. And for a long time, that hurt my feelings. And for a long time, it fucked up a lot of what I did. And then she looked at me with this big smile and she goes, but you know what? What? She goes, he never touched me. He messed with my stuff. He never got me. And there's not a part of me now that's the same as it was then.
[24:35] B: Yeah.
[24:35] A: He never touched me. And I went, whoa. That is freaking cool. Yeah. So one more time, slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Breathe a little bit slower. Deeper, longer. Exhale a little longer than the inhale. As you're breathing in this way, eyes are resting closed. Whenever eyes rest closed, you can also rest. You're aware of your breath, my voice, the background sounds, even how it feels to be seated in the way. You are noticing all of this as the same time your unconscious Kara is responding towards the future. You already making adjustments within the control panels of your brain. Knowing which buttons to press, knobs to turn, levers to shift, switches to flip, and in which order to rewire and optimize demise your brain to work even more in the way you want. All of this happens as you rest. Which means the next time that your eyes rest closed, you'll drop even deeper down inside. Towards delight at this center. That calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy. That's right. And then whenever you're ready and you can take your time, slowly begin to find your way back up and up and up. Eyes can almost open. That's right. And then when you're ready, eyes are open. There we go. And as you're checking inside, what are you noticing now? How's your body feeling?
[26:57] B: Just calm.
[26:57] A: Relaxed, calm, calm and relaxed. Isn't that cool, right? Yeah. So like, you know, as you're calm and relaxed, that other than conscious part is going to travel back down the timeline of the experiences that have happened. And again, as your brain has already begun to sort and categorize, it's going to select a moment to bring to your awareness for us to clear.
[27:23] B: There's a couple. Yeah.
[27:24] A: So good. Your brain's like, okay, here we go. I'm right. I'm waiting on this. I got more than one. So one that came to mind happened. Like you might have been how old?
[27:36] B: I was like 22.
[27:38] A: 22, yeah. And remember, as we do something, your intention is to be with me. My job is to keep you with me. And you're going to tell me just the facts about what happened in a matter of fact way. You go, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened. Then it's over. And we know that there are things that you've done later.
[27:54] B: Yeah.
[27:55] A: Like go to the pride parade. Right. Or meet your gal. Right. Or finish title. Right. And there's probably even more. Yeah, that's right.
[28:04] B: A lot more.
[28:05] A: There is, isn't there? Right. So we want to keep that in mind because we're going to extend the timeline. And I bet with this one, the thing that happened at 22, what's something well before that? That has nothing to do with that. That was something that was like a good experience in your life, like, way early on. Like, well, before the thing at 22, something you've done that you had fun doing.
[28:26] B: I won the soccer tournament.
[28:27] A: You won a soccer tournament? Right. And did you, like, score a goal?
[28:31] B: Yeah, like 12.
[28:33] A: Not just one. I scored several.
[28:36] B: I got taken off because I was scoring too much, Got benched for being too good. That's awesome.
[28:47] A: How cool is that? Right, so now we're going to extend the timeline. Right. So the thing happened at 22, when it happened, you're where?
[28:54] B: At the drug dealer's house.
[28:55] A: Drug dealer's house was always a good place to be. Right. And it's daytime or nighttime?
[28:59] B: Nighttime.
[28:59] A: Nighttime. Right. Better place to be there. Right. And you're like in the living room or kitchen or dining room.
[29:05] B: Yeah, it was like a motel, I guess.
[29:06] A: Like a motel?
[29:07] B: Yeah.
[29:08] A: Right. And so, like, are you standing or seated?
[29:09] B: I was standing.
[29:10] A: Standing. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[29:13] B: I owed him money, so he started, like, attacking me.
[29:15] A: So he's like, you wanted to get drugs. Did he give them to you?
[29:18] B: Oh, after he, like, made me do much.
[29:20] A: Oh, no, but he didn't. But you were going there to get him.
[29:22] B: Yeah.
[29:23] A: And he was asking for money.
[29:24] B: Yeah.
[29:24] A: And then you didn't have any money.
[29:25] B: Yeah.
[29:26] A: But you still wanted them. So then he came at you.
[29:29] B: Yeah.
[29:30] A: Right. And then did he hit you?
[29:32] B: It was like one of the human trafficking events. He burned me. Cigarettes.
[29:35] A: So he burned, like. So he came at you with a cigarette or cigar?
[29:38] B: Cigarette.
[29:39] A: Cigarette. Right. And he burned you, like, all over the place. Right. And that hurt?
[29:42] B: Yeah.
[29:42] A: Right, Good.
[29:43] B: Yeah.
[29:43] A: Right. Right. Then what happened next?
[29:45] B: Cut me up. Cut you with a razor, Like a knife.
[29:49] A: With a knife. Cut you with a knife. Right, Good. Right, Right. How you doing right now?
[29:52] B: I mean.
[29:53] A: Well, check. Is there a knife?
[29:55] B: No, no look.
[29:56] A: Right, yeah, yeah. Right. Got it. Right. Just check where you are. Hi.
[29:59] B: Right, Right.
[30:00] A: Because you want to be back here.
[30:01] B: Yeah.
[30:02] A: Not there. Yeah, Right. When your brain starts to confuse it, it takes you back there. We want you to be here. Cause isn't this a much more comfortable place than that was?
[30:11] B: A little bit.
[30:15] A: That's right. So then he'd cut you in different places, and that was hurting. Right. Then what happened next?
[30:21] B: Maybe do sexual things.
[30:22] A: Right. So he had you, like, give him a blow job or.
[30:25] B: Pretty much.
[30:25] A: Right, okay. Right. So that. Right. And then what happened next?
[30:29] B: Got high.
[30:30] A: Well, then he gave you the drugs.
[30:31] B: Yeah.
[30:32] A: Okay. Right, Good. Then what happened next?
[30:34] B: He just kept doing random things.
[30:35] A: Right. So then he would cut you or punch you or hit you or do sex stuff or. Right. And that happened for a period of time?
[30:41] B: Yeah, it was like an hour.
[30:42] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[30:43] B: I left, then you left.
[30:44] A: Right. And then that moment was over. Yeah. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun like meet your gal or go to the pride parade.
[30:50] B: Yeah.
[30:50] A: Right. Or finish Tyler.
[30:52] B: Yeah, Right. Yeah.
[30:53] A: See? So good. Right. And again, notice a little discomfort, but less is you're intending to be here. When we go backwards, we begin to unplug the whole thing. Right. So we got, you know, meeting your gal and Tyler, we got.
[31:08] B: Got a lot of stuff.
[31:09] A: Right. We got lots of different cool stuff. Right, Right. And then before that, you left.
[31:14] B: Yeah.
[31:15] A: And then he finished doing that stuff, and then you got high. Right. And then you'd give him a blowjob, and then he had you give him a little job, and he was cutting you, and then he was doing. And then he'd come at you, and then you'd gone there for drugs.
[31:26] B: Yeah.
[31:26] A: And then before that, you were wanting drugs.
[31:29] B: Yeah.
[31:29] A: Right. And as we go backwards, what do you notice?
[31:33] B: I don't really feel anything about it.
[31:35] A: You don't?
[31:36] B: I really don't care about it.
[31:37] A: Isn't that crazy?
[31:38] B: Rihanna's right.
[31:39] A: You can remember him doing that.
[31:41] B: Yeah.
[31:41] A: You can also remember putting your shirt on today. Yeah. Kara, stop putting on your shirt.
[31:46] B: I might get arrested.
[31:47] A: Say, I'm not putting on my shirt. Say it. Say it. I'm not putting on.
[31:49] B: I'm like, I put my shirt on.
[31:50] A: No, you're not putting on your shirt.
[31:52] B: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[31:53] A: That's right. You can remember doing it today. Are you doing it now?
[31:56] B: No.
[31:57] A: No. Stop putting on your slides. I'm not putting on my slides. Right. Well, stop him from cutting you. Say, he's not cutting me.
[32:03] B: He's not cutting me Right.
[32:04] A: Well, then you stop blowing. Say, I'm not doing that. I'm not doing it Right. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you're not doing it.
[32:10] B: You're not doing it.
[32:10] A: Well, stop him from doing that. Say it's not happening.
[32:12] B: It's not happening.
[32:13] A: Where is it? Say it doesn't exist. That's not here. That's right. It doesn't exist. Right. As that starts to get in, what do you notice?
[32:23] B: I don't really think about it anymore, if I'm being honest.
[32:26] A: Well, right now?
[32:27] B: Yeah.
[32:28] A: Yeah. It's not troubling.
[32:30] B: No.
[32:30] A: Not right. And that happening, would it have mattered whether it was you or some other gal in the same situation?
[32:38] B: No.
[32:38] A: Is that what he would have done?
[32:41] B: I mean, like, it probably had, but at this point.
[32:45] A: Well, no, see, it wouldn't have mattered whether it was you or somebody else in the situation.
[32:50] B: No matter what, he was going to do it.
[32:51] A: That's what he would do if some other girl had come to his place wanting drugs. Not have. He would have done the same thing.
[32:57] B: Yeah.
[32:58] A: Follow me with that. Yeah, right. Like I. I had. Somebody said to me, they go, well, I got. I got hooked on crack. And, you know, there are these guys out there that, like, you know, have crack because, you know, they want to, and. And they, you know, as a girl, they make you blow them. And I'm like, well, that would be a good reason to be a crack dealer, if you like to get blowjobs. Yeah. Strange woman, I guess. I mean, you know.
[33:19] B: Yeah, right. Very true.
[33:27] A: It's a great perfection. Right. But you can remember all that happened. Right?
[33:37] B: But it doesn't frighten me anymore.
[33:39] A: Yeah. No, it's not. And that happening wasn't about you, because it wouldn't matter if there's you that went there, some other person with that guy. That's what he would have done.
[33:47] B: Yeah.
[33:48] A: So close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You let her know it's over, finished, completed, defeated. It no longer exists. Let her Know that you're okay. Right. Let her know about meeting your cow. Let her know about finishing Tyler. Let her know. Right.
[34:11] B: Right.
[34:13] A: What are you noticing now?
[34:17] B: Like, happiness.
[34:18] A: Yeah. And we can even look back, you know, coming out of the game because I scored too many goals.
[34:24] B: Yeah.
[34:27] A: Right. Yeah. Then you can open your eyes. Just check. How's your body feeling now?
[34:37] B: Good.
[34:37] A: Yeah. Isn't that a good use thing?
[34:39] B: That's good.
[34:41] A: Yeah. Any anger, any shame? Any about that now?
[34:46] B: No.
[34:47] A: Yeah.
[34:49] B: I think, if anything, it makes me feel a little more stronger. I'm being honest.
[34:55] A: Yeah. How so?
[34:59] B: Just, like, in a way of knowing, like, yeah, that happened, but that didn't define me. And I'm. I'm doing what I want to do in life now.
[35:06] A: That's right.
[35:07] B: You know, so it makes me feel just more at peace, loving myself and not realizing that doesn't define who I was.
[35:13] A: Isn't that cool?
[35:14] B: Or who I will be.
[35:15] A: Yeah. And who you're becoming.
[35:16] B: Yes.
[35:17] A: Yeah. Good job. So happy. Such a good news thing. Yeah. Yeah.
[35:25] B: It is nice.
[35:26] A: Yeah. Right. And we're getting free from the effect.
[35:30] B: Yeah.
[35:30] A: And all the effect is mostly that's problematic, is unconscious. Yeah. Right.
[35:39] B: Because, like, before, like, I still have, like, some scars. Sure. You know what I mean? I would always think people would know. Like, you know, I mean, like, in my mind, I'm always like, these people know I was doing crazy stuff. I was doing crazy. Like, I was going crazy.
[35:52] A: Yeah.
[35:52] B: You know, and really, like, they don't know. They don't really care. They're just like. Like, whatever, bro. Like, you're just another chick. Like, you know, just like. Yeah.
[36:00] A: Wait a minute. I'm not.
[36:02] B: I'm not.
[36:02] A: I'm not the center of everybody else's universe.
[36:05] B: Yes.
[36:06] A: Huh. God, that's a great, weird thought. It's nice. But really, are you sure? Because it still feels like I kind.
[36:14] B: Of am a little bit. I know it sounds like it's probably.
[36:18] A: Crazy, but, like, so perfect.
[36:19] B: It. Like, it was.
[36:21] A: But again, that's because when we're little children, it's my world that everybody else lives in. Yeah. Because as a child, I'm a dependent and I force people to take care of me by crying. So I grow up in the first parts of my incubation that it's my world that these people cater to me in. My world.
[36:46] B: Yeah.
[36:49] A: So then everything starts going. When my daughter was 4, I'd say, whose house is that? And she'd say, it's Daphne's house. I'd go, oh, it's Daphne's house.
[36:56] B: Right.
[36:56] A: It's not Dad's house, It's Daphne's house. Okay. Dad just, you know, pays for the mortgage.
[37:00] B: Dad just does everything about it. Yeah.
[37:10] A: Yeah. So with that stuff getting slammed into me. Right. I do feel what starts to happen is as things get turned around and the experience is unplug and my emotional brain reads it as data about what happened. I stopped having everything start meaning stuff about me. I get to see it more clearly. I have more distance from it. Make sense?
[37:42] B: Yeah.
[37:42] A: Because notice even when you think about it now, that just experience. Notice that when you think about it, it's not in the same location it used to be. In your brain.
[37:53] B: Yeah.
[37:55] A: Right. Isn't that interesting?
[37:57] B: Yeah. Because if I'm being honest, it wasn't even really in my brain. It was like in here.
[38:01] A: Right.
[38:01] B: It was in like my heart.
[38:02] A: Of course not my brain. Yeah, well, heart is a brain.
[38:06] B: Well, you know what I'm trying to say. I wasn't like sitting there thinking about, like, it was like I had it making it define me.
[38:11] A: Right.
[38:12] B: So it was. Now it's not. It's just kind of like it's there.
[38:15] A: Yeah. It's something. I went through that in going through it. Not that I want to sign up to go through it again, but I became stronger.
[38:24] B: Yeah.
[38:24] A: See, that's the. The thing about adversity. Nobody. Nobody signs up for adversity ever. Except the crazy Navy seals, but they're a different breed. Yep. Right. The rest of us go through adversity, but not because we, you know, wanted to. Yeah. Right. But when you make it through the adversity, you're stronger. Right. You've got more mental fortitude, more resilient. You become more resilient.
[38:56] B: Yeah.
[38:57] A: You know, more is possible. Right. For a long time, there was no person that could run under a four minute mile.
[39:07] B: Yeah.
[39:08] A: It was like impossible. And then one year one guy did it, and then the next year, nine.
[39:15] B: Yeah.
[39:16] A: And then the next year like 37. Right. So if it goes, you get knowing that stuff is possible versus impossible. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you're directing things now.
[39:32] B: Yeah.
[39:32] A: That's the other part that I want you to begin to pay more attention to, is that you're directing life now before I. And by no fault of your own. I'm a victim of the circumstances, both the ones that I got born into that led to the choices that were available for me to make that led to the things that happened that led to the. Right. Like I was in a situation that I didn't Know anything other than. And that's what led me down. Now you've gone through Tyla. You're doing rehabilitation, you're changing your life, you're gaining agency. When you gain agency, you have more say. You're not just tossed down the river of life. You go, I'm gonna go over that way and I'm gonna paddle towards it.
[40:24] B: Now.
[40:24] A: Yes. You have more say. Right. You have more agency and that's huge because now you have direction and you can monitor how I'm moving towards it. Right, right. And that's all it ever is, is we want to have trajectory, we want to know where we're headed. But very rarely is it going to be exact. Yeah, right. Like even an airplane that flies from Arizona to Atlanta is not exact on the court. Right. And even though it says it's going to be at this point around this time, it's not ever. Yeah, exactly.
[41:01] B: You don't know what's come your way.
[41:02] A: Around it and you don't know weather patterns. Like, can I just guesstimate it? And so it's within acceptable range, but it's not exact. So same thing. When we get a trajectory, it's where we're headed. We can't ever know. Oh, it's going to be this step and that step and then I'm going to. Good luck.
[41:23] B: Nothing is that perfect.
[41:24] A: No, no, it doesn't work that way because it's a non linear system and every step you take impacts the rest of the system. Yeah, yeah. Cool. So again, as you're checking in, what are you noticing?
[41:41] B: If I'm being honest, it's kind of just like, I'm just like here.
[41:44] A: So what's another moment as we travel back down that timeline of things that.
[41:48] B: Have happened, good or bad?
[41:50] A: I don't know, either one. I mean, you had a few.
[41:58] B: Yeah, I've had a lot. I don't know. A good one would be I graduated.
[42:06] A: Yeah. Right. From high school. Yeah.
[42:11] B: With a traumatic brain injury after being taken out of school and have to be like taught at home and taught everything again. I graduated with honors, so it's a good thing.
[42:22] A: That's pretty amazing.
[42:23] B: Yeah.
[42:24] A: What was the traumatic brain injury from?
[42:27] B: Soccer.
[42:28] A: Soccer.
[42:29] B: I dove in front of somebody. Yeah. Right in the right temple. Oh, yeah.
[42:36] A: Oh, that hurt.
[42:37] B: Yeah. I don't know. I was gone. I was gone, so. But yeah, but yeah, that was a good thing.
[42:44] A: Yeah.
[42:45] B: I didn't think I was gonna graduate, but I did.
[42:47] A: Right, Right. So there we go. What do we know about you? I'm a Hard worker you are. And when you work hard, you achieve.
[42:56] B: Yeah.
[42:58] A: Right. When you take the right steps and the right actions, the results happen. Isn't that cool? Yeah, that's pretty amazing.
[43:11] B: Yeah.
[43:13] A: Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. So let's just check. Think about like a. The experience we talked about, the earlier one that we talked to last time. What do you notice about those? They don't have the charge. Right. As we travel back down the timeline for one that's got strong emotions attached, whether it be hurt, anger, sadness, grief, guilt, shame, regret, remorse, disgust, hurt.
[43:46] B: Can we tell you?
[43:46] A: Yeah. What kind? Oh, you got one.
[43:48] B: Oh, yeah.
[43:50] A: Again, you just want to be here.
[43:51] B: Yeah. Happened when I was like 18. 19.
[43:55] A: 18, 19.
[43:55] B: I came out.
[43:56] A: Right. And you were where when you came out? I was in Florida. Wasn't that. You did not have a theme song?
[44:05] B: No.
[44:05] A: Oh, see, that was the whole problem. You need. If you're coming out, you gotta have the theme song going. So you're at home when this happened?
[44:13] B: No, I was in my apartment.
[44:15] A: Oh, so you're at your apartment in Florida. Right. And so you were on the phone?
[44:18] B: I told my mom.
[44:19] A: So you called your mom? Yeah, like, hey, Mom, I just wanted to let you know I'm gay. She's like, oh, my goodness. I've known that forever, pretty much. And then, good thing you got it now.
[44:28] B: Then my dad just kind of lost.
[44:30] A: So dad was there too?
[44:31] B: No, he was in Pennsylvania.
[44:32] A: So dad was in Pennsylvania.
[44:33] B: But I called.
[44:34] A: So you called him after Mom?
[44:36] B: Yeah.
[44:36] A: And she said, hey, Dad, I just wanted to let you know. Yeah.
[44:39] B: And he's like calling me every name in a book. Gonna burn in hell.
[44:43] A: Oh my.
[44:44] B: Ended up flying.
[44:45] A: So he said all of that?
[44:46] B: Yeah. You're like, yeah.
[44:48] A: And then you got off the phone with him. That was weird, upsetting.
[44:51] B: He flew down to Florida.
[44:51] A: Then he flew to Florida. And like, how did he get to you? So he flew to Florida, then he drove to your apartment, knocked on the door, beat out of me and so he knocks on the door.
[45:01] B: Yeah.
[45:02] A: You're like, hey, dad.
[45:03] B: Yeah. Like, what are you going on?
[45:04] A: Whoa. Why are you here? And then he came in and then he like punched you multiple times. I punched you, kicked you. That knocked you on the ground?
[45:14] B: Yeah.
[45:14] A: Right.
[45:15] B: Basically that if I. If I was gay, he was not going to be a part of my life.
[45:19] A: Right.
[45:19] B: And that God hates me.
[45:21] A: Yes.
[45:22] B: And I'm a waste.
[45:23] A: Right.
[45:24] B: I should never born, you know?
[45:26] A: So it says all that stuff as he's hitting you. Right. Then what happens next?
[45:29] B: He just leaves.
[45:30] A: And then he gets up and then he leaves. And then you finally get up and I never.
[45:35] B: I don't talk to him for, like, three years.
[45:36] A: And then that was over.
[45:37] B: Yeah.
[45:37] A: And then later on, you did something more fun, like meet your gal.
[45:40] B: Yeah.
[45:41] A: Or, you know, graduate or Tyler or. Right. Yeah.
[45:44] B: That's crazy. Yep.
[45:46] A: Right. So even as you were telling me about it, what'd you notice?
[45:52] B: There wasn't that much anxiety. Telling me at that time.
[45:55] A: Isn't that interesting?
[45:55] B: Yeah, it was kind of.
[45:56] A: Just notice how it's, like, forwarding itself already. Right.
[46:00] B: To be honest.
[46:01] A: Right.
[46:01] B: Like, what?
[46:02] A: Like, so my mom's like, yeah, of course I call my dad. You're a sinning awful person. I'm gonna punish you.
[46:08] B: Yeah.
[46:10] A: Literally flies to Florida.
[46:11] B: Yeah.
[46:12] A: Comes to my house, hits me multiple times, calls me more names that he was calling me on the phone, and then leaves and heads back home.
[46:18] B: And then I'll talk to him. It's just like, now I think about it, it's like. It's insane, but.
[46:24] A: Right. And again, in that moment, as it was happening, that earlier, you felt like some of it had to do with you. Yeah.
[46:30] B: I thought I. I was just.
[46:32] A: It had to do with you coming out.
[46:33] B: Yeah.
[46:34] A: As we're looking at it, clearly. Did it have to do with you at all? No.
[46:37] B: It had to do with him.
[46:38] A: Yes. And you didn't know then how fucked up he was about stuff. Right. Because, you know, that's what God really doesn't like. Yeah, right.
[46:48] B: Exactly.
[46:48] A: Yeah. Well, I mean, pretty soon it's going to go back to, you know, women just not having any rights.
[46:55] B: Yeah. You know, he'd be all right with that, I think, but it's just. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. It was just. Yeah. Maybe, like, sit there and laugh, like, about that whole scenario by thinking back at him, just like, you're insane, bro.
[47:12] A: That's what I want to say. You're insane.
[47:13] B: Like, you just wasted all this money to come beat my ass because.
[47:16] A: Right.
[47:17] B: And I'm not doing something that you want.
[47:19] A: Well, no, here's the other part. It's not as if you woke up one day and went, you know what? I used to like Penis. Now I like vagina.
[47:27] B: Never. Never liked it.
[47:28] A: Like, that's the thing. Like, here's the thing that's crazy for people to get. It's not like I didn't choose to go, you know what I really like? Boobs. Like, I didn't go, you know what I really like? Penis. It just was. What's There.
[47:42] B: Yeah.
[47:43] A: Right. And it's not that I couldn't view other things and go, okay, yeah. That's not what does it.
[47:48] B: Yeah.
[47:50] A: And I don't get to choose that. That's not like a decision like, I want a chicken tonight.
[47:57] B: You know, that's like your life. It's something that.
[48:01] A: Yeah, it's.
[48:03] B: You became.
[48:04] A: You are what you were born with. The stuff that led to. And people may be on a continuum and there may be more leanings based on experiences, but, I mean, you kind of are. Are into what you're into.
[48:21] B: Yeah.
[48:22] A: You know, and I get that there can be fluidity with certain things, but, you know, you're.
[48:27] B: You're who you are. Who you are, that's like. You are who you are. So.
[48:31] A: Yeah. But what you find appealing, erotic, desirable and arousing. Yeah. Right, Right. So knowing that about death. Close your eyes. Think about the earlier you after he left, knowing how crazy that was, knowing that you're okay, knowing now how screwed up he was then, that him acting like that and doing that had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was fucked up with him. Right, right. Because of course that intervention worked really well. I mean, he straightened you right out.
[49:08] B: Y. Like many of.
[49:13] A: I mean, come on.
[49:17] B: Yeah. It just makes me feel sorry, like, in a way. Like, I do. Like, I kind of feel sorry.
[49:23] A: Right.
[49:24] B: Like.
[49:25] A: Right. Like, what would it be like that when your child says that. That you're so upset up that what comes to mind is, oh, my goodness.
[49:35] B: I'm gonna be that. Right.
[49:37] A: Right.
[49:38] B: Yeah. It's insane. Like, I don't think that way.
[49:44] A: No.
[49:44] B: I can't even imagine.
[49:45] A: Right. So if you had to treat.
[49:47] B: I'm gonna be daddy because you don't like mustard, like, you know what I mean?
[49:50] A: Right. Right. If you could, like, so out of the person who the roles that got glad that you got yours and not his.
[50:02] B: Yeah.
[50:03] A: Right. But the thing that comes to mind to do is like.
[50:08] B: Like, okay, cool for you, bro.
[50:19] A: Yeah. Right.
[50:21] B: He's still like that, though. So.
[50:23] A: He is. Well, he's not had a change.
[50:24] B: No.
[50:25] A: That's the part that screwed up with him.
[50:27] B: Yeah.
[50:28] A: Right.
[50:28] B: He thinks I'll change, but maybe I want the one that needs to change you that needs to change and come back to reality a little bit.
[50:36] A: Right.
[50:36] B: Realize we're not in the 1800s anymore.
[50:41] A: Right. And the flip side is it's all about women's rights. Why people are so troubled by that stuff too, is about women's rights.
[50:50] B: Yeah.
[50:52] A: Because women don't need Men.
[50:54] B: No, we don't.
[50:55] A: At one time you did.
[50:56] B: We needed them.
[50:57] A: Right. But a woman doesn't need a man. A woman doesn't need a man for an orgasm. A penis wasn't even designed to do it, you know? I mean, it was designed to make the baby. She got a different part. That's all about sexual pleasure. Exactly.
[51:12] B: And this is true. Very true.
[51:15] A: Right.
[51:16] B: Cuz, like, I called him the other. Like, it was like two weeks.
[51:18] A: A woman needs a man as much as a fish needs a bicycle.
[51:21] B: Exactly. I don't need you to do anything for me.
[51:26] A: Right.
[51:27] B: But I don't know.
[51:30] A: Right.
[51:31] B: He's happy that way because, like, his wife is the mistress that he had with my mom. And she's the perfect person because she lets him make all the decisions. Like, you know, I mean, she's perfect.
[51:41] A: Yeah.
[51:41] B: My mom and me aren't like that. We do not require anybody, like, at all. At all.
[51:49] A: Right.
[51:49] B: So, yeah, whatever. Like, oh, he called me the day, he's like, you sure you don't need anything? I was like, no, I definitely don't need nothing for you. Just for you to hold it up from my head. No. Good.
[52:01] A: Oh. Oh, right. Because what you have with him is transactional relationship.
[52:08] B: Yeah.
[52:10] A: Not real. And that's all you can get from. From that kind of dad.
[52:14] B: Yeah.
[52:15] A: It's really useful to know that.
[52:17] B: Oh, yeah. That's why I love my stepdad, because he's per. He's like the perfect dad.
[52:21] A: Yeah. But it's useful to know that because then you don't have faulty expectations.
[52:26] B: Yeah. And it took me a long time to realize because, like, then I would find relationships like that that were transactional that I had to either take care of or they take care of me.
[52:39] A: Like, it was not an equal partnership.
[52:41] B: And now I have that.
[52:42] A: Yeah.
[52:43] B: Because it's how long it took me to realize, like, that's not a relationship. That's just.
[52:48] A: Right.
[52:49] B: Whatever.
[52:49] A: Right. Right. One could be a partnership.
[52:52] B: Yeah.
[52:52] A: Right. Good job, Cara. Yeah. Yeah. So even thinking about that with dad now, what do you notice?
[53:03] B: Nothing.
[53:03] A: Right. Notice how.
[53:07] B: I talked to him like, like a week after our last session, and, like, he was on Heal Noises, and I'm just like, yeah, I'm good. You know, I mean, like, I didn't really want to care.
[53:14] A: Right.
[53:15] B: Like, you can do what you want.
[53:17] A: Right.
[53:17] B: You know?
[53:19] A: Yeah. Like, sad for him.
[53:20] B: Yeah. In a way.
[53:22] A: Right.
[53:22] B: And it pissed. I wasn't pissed off. I wasn't angry. I wasn't sad. I was just kind of like, yeah.
[53:28] A: I had A parent one time say to me, and they were really interested because their son came out getting. And they're Puerto Rican. They had a whole thing about that.
[53:35] B: Yeah.
[53:37] A: They wanted to. They go, I just want to accept it. I go, no, you don't want to accept it. That's not enough. You want to embrace it and love it that he gets to be more of who he is and gets to be more of who he is around you.
[53:55] B: Yeah.
[53:56] A: Right. It's not, oh, I accept you. Like, I don't need you. Right. That's exactly what. So I go, it's not about acceptance. It's about the embracing. Like, good for me.
[54:06] B: I'm still me.
[54:08] A: Right. Good for you that you were freed up enough to say that to me.
[54:12] B: Yeah.
[54:12] A: And how cool.
[54:13] B: Yeah.
[54:15] A: Right. Lift and support.
[54:18] B: Yeah. Like we just want. I just want you to know, like, I'm still me of course. No matter what I do or who I do.
[54:27] A: Right.
[54:28] B: Like, I don't need you to accept that. I want you just to love me for me.
[54:32] A: Right. Yeah. That's why I said it's not an acceptance. That's a dumb way to even look.
[54:36] B: It is, it is. They still use it. That's all right.
[54:43] A: Yeah. But notice how that's not trouble. Yeah, right. Notice that you're thinking about the things they're not having the same emotional charge, you know? Yeah. Isn't that cool? So what's something that you normally encounter that normally triggers you, you know, in your day to day world? What's something that you know, normally happens that.
[55:02] B: Yelling.
[55:03] A: Yeah.
[55:03] B: Like high pitched voices. Like, that's like my biggest thing is like as soon as I hear like yell or high pitched voice, I instantly like, almost like a scared puppy dog, like, coward. Because like, I don't know, I don't understand. I don't know why that's like, that's like, that's why I've been working on that one a lot. Because that is like my.
[55:23] A: Where might you be when that happens? Anywhere. Well, think of a situation. Let's put it in a context.
[55:31] B: I don't know, Me and my girl, like, she talks loud.
[55:36] A: Yeah.
[55:36] B: So she's a loud talker. And sometimes she's very sarcastic and she'll be like, talk loud, say, sometimes sarcastic. And in my mind I feel like I did something wrong, but in her mind she's just being funny and joking.
[55:47] A: Got it.
[55:48] B: You know what I mean? But like in my soul I'm like, oh God, what did I do? What can I do to make it better in reality?
[55:54] A: Like, well, think of her. Right? Her saying that. Yeah, right. That sarcastic thing. And where do you feel the discomfort?
[56:02] B: In my heart.
[56:02] A: You feel it here?
[56:03] B: Like, right in my chest. Like, my chest gets heavy. I get hot. Like, I'm just like.
[56:07] A: Right. So notice. Think about her doing that. Feel a little bit of the feeling. Notice that your chest didn't get heavy.
[56:13] B: Yeah, it did. It.
[56:14] A: It did. Oh, isn't that weird?
[56:16] B: Yeah.
[56:18] A: Well, think about another thing. Well, like, maybe she talks really loud.
[56:22] B: She has a big mouth. She does. Yeah. Actually, I get. Now I think about it, it happened yesterday. She came home from work and I was building. I was building up an end table.
[56:35] A: Yeah.
[56:36] B: She's like, why is she just, like, not, like, being mean, but she's like, why do you always have to be doing something? And it instantly made me feel bad, like, oh, I'm not giving you enough attention? I might not. When in reality I'm building this big car home.
[56:47] A: Yeah, right.
[56:48] B: You know.
[56:49] A: Right.
[56:50] B: But she's just being a little sarcastic, right? Yes. And it's all right.
[56:55] A: So thinking of her saying that she noticed the feeling.
[56:58] B: Yeah.
[56:58] A: Yeah. So you got a little bit of the feeling. Notice the feeling without doing anything with it. Get your eyes big, become curious and go. Yeah, just notice the sensations. And go, hmm, yeah. One more time. Go. And what do you notice happening to those sensations?
[57:18] B: They're going away and I'm giggling.
[57:20] A: Yeah, they're going away. Isn't that interesting?
[57:22] B: Yeah.
[57:23] A: Right. So again, think about her coming home. What do you always have to be doing? Like, can't you just relax? Right. And so she says that. Feel that discomfort. Notice how you get a little of the discomfort. Is this how you want to be feeling?
[57:39] B: No.
[57:39] A: Oh. How do you want to be?
[57:41] B: I just want to, like, laugh it off because, like, I know she's kidding.
[57:44] A: Yeah. And what's it like when you know somebody's kidding and you're just laughing it off?
[57:52] B: It's not me.
[57:54] A: What's it like for you when you're, like, laughing it off because you know it's not real?
[57:59] B: Sometimes it's not. I feel like I'm trying to fake it.
[58:02] A: Oh, well, do we want you to fake it?
[58:04] B: No.
[58:04] A: No. So that's not what I'm saying. See, one of the things that you said that you wanted was to laugh it off.
[58:11] B: Yeah, but I want to mean it when I laugh it off.
[58:14] A: Right. So what's it like when you actually mean it and you're laughing something off?
[58:19] B: Oh, I just. My heart just feels, like, fine. Like, I'M just, like, laughing, like. Like enjoying it, I guess, in a way.
[58:27] A: Right. Because what if your brain started to realize that people who give you a hard time. Right. Do that because they like you.
[58:37] B: Yeah.
[58:37] A: Because you can't give people. Do you follow me? Like, in the world of bullying, picked on all that stuff. You can't. As in, like, kids can bully and say many things.
[58:48] B: Yeah.
[58:49] A: As an adult, you never joke with somebody you don't like.
[58:52] B: Yeah.
[58:52] A: Ever.
[58:53] B: Because I'm a teaser too. Like, I tease.
[58:55] A: Right. So you never tease somebody that you don't like.
[58:58] B: Yeah.
[58:58] A: Because then you could fight because they're not gonna take it. Like you're teasing and it's funny.
[59:04] B: Yeah.
[59:04] A: Right. But if I've got that activated in me, sometimes a tease feels like I'm being picked on.
[59:11] B: Yeah.
[59:12] A: Got it.
[59:13] B: Yes.
[59:13] A: So think about the tease. Notice how sometimes when she's saying it, it's feeling like I'm being picked on. Yeah, got it. Get that discomfort a little bit. Close your eyes and let that feeling tone Kara. Take you back. Let that feeling guide you back so that it grows you earlier and younger. Younger and earlier. Let it take you all the way back. Back towards one of the first times you had that kind of a feeling. What is it that's coming to mind now?
[60:00] B: My dad calling me stupid.
[60:02] A: So you're how old and where?
[60:04] B: Like, five? Four.
[60:05] A: Yeah. So you're like five or four. And you can open your eyes. You're like four or five. And you're way, like, in the house.
[60:11] B: In the car, though.
[60:12] A: So you're in the car with him, like, in the backseat or front seat. In the back seat. Right. And you're like a kid bouncing around. Right. And then what happens? He says he asked me to go.
[60:21] B: In and get a pizza and take his debit card, but I'm scared to.
[60:24] A: Right.
[60:25] B: I didn't know how to do it.
[60:26] A: Right. Because you've never done it before. Right?
[60:30] B: Yeah.
[60:30] A: Right. And you're like, no, I do it.
[60:33] B: And he called me stupid and yell at me.
[60:35] A: Then he's like, you stupid. You're stupid. Right, Good. And then he got out of the car, went and got the pizza.
[60:41] B: Yep.
[60:42] A: Right. And you can remember all that happened? Yeah. Right.
[60:44] B: And you cry my eyes out.
[60:45] A: You can remember putting your shorts on?
[60:47] B: Yes.
[60:48] A: Karen, stop putting on your shorts. We'll stop him from making you do that. Say he's not making me do that.
[60:53] B: He's not making me do that.
[60:54] A: Well, then stop him from saying that. Say he's not saying that. Will you stop Putting on your socks.
[60:59] B: I'm not going to put my socks.
[61:00] A: No, I'm not putting on my socks.
[61:01] B: I'm not.
[61:02] A: No, I'm not.
[61:03] B: I'm not not putting my socks on.
[61:04] A: That's right. We're not talking future, we're talking about now.
[61:09] B: I'm not putting socks on.
[61:10] A: That's right. You can remember doing it, but you know you're not doing it. That's right. So think of dad saying that now. What do you notice?
[61:20] B: I think he's kind of an idiot.
[61:21] A: Did that have anything to do with you being stupid?
[61:24] B: No, it was just cuz he missed.
[61:26] A: Out on a really cool teachable moment.
[61:27] B: Yeah.
[61:28] A: Here, let's go in together and I'll show you how to do it.
[61:32] B: Yeah.
[61:33] A: Not like dummy 5 year old you don't know how to use a credit card yet.
[61:36] B: Yeah. Do you have a richer mic? Where am I going, left or right?
[61:51] A: First door. Right and then first door on your left. Good stuff. Yeah. So think about that with dad about being five. What do you notice?
[62:13] B: I mean, I don't have that like feeling anymore.
[62:15] A: You don't?
[62:16] B: I wish it would have played out different, I guess in a way. Like how you used saying having like a teach, have teaching me.
[62:23] A: Yeah. Well, we all wish.
[62:25] B: Yeah.
[62:26] A: Right.
[62:26] B: But I don't feel that like you.
[62:28] A: Unfortunately didn't get that kind of a dad.
[62:31] B: No, I didn't.
[62:32] A: That's why I tell people the biggest gift my dad gave my children was not being there for me.
[62:40] B: Yeah.
[62:41] A: Because that was for me a huge missing in my life.
[62:46] B: Yeah.
[62:48] A: And the reason that I even got into what I'm doing. Sure. Because I can adjust my day any way that I need to adjust it for my. Anyway, you choose kids. Yeah. Yeah. So now think about your gal. Do you always have to be doing something? Can't you just sit? You make me feel bad about me not doing as much as you.
[63:25] B: No, I'm good.
[63:27] A: Someone started saying right because notice what it didn't. It do.
[63:33] B: It didn't make me feel all weird.
[63:35] A: That's right. That's right. Because it's being read is about them and it's coming from somebody who is. Who likes me. So therefore it's okay. Like it's. If you're going to be sarcastic at the end of sarcasm for people to know that you are. We need an upward turning of the lips.
[64:02] B: Yeah.
[64:04] A: We need to have a smart smile.
[64:05] B: Yeah. I like smiling. It doesn't give me frown lines. Did I tell myself.
[64:17] A: There is crazy research though. If you have somebody hold A pencil in between their teeth.
[64:23] B: Like. Like biting?
[64:24] A: No, just hold it like that. Yeah. It makes you smile.
[64:28] B: Yeah.
[64:29] A: And if you hold it with your lips.
[64:31] B: Makes you frown.
[64:32] A: Makes you frown. So they did a study having people.
[64:36] B: Hold a pencil in their mouth.
[64:38] A: Right. And view comic strips and whether it was fun or not fun to do it. And of course, the people who had it with the smile rated them as more fun and funny than the people who had the frown on their face.
[64:53] B: Okay.
[64:53] A: Isn't that crazy that that connected the body and the mind?
[64:58] B: Yeah.
[64:59] A: Right?
[64:59] B: A little bit. Yeah.
[65:00] A: You got those people with resting face.
[65:03] B: Rbf.
[65:05] A: Yeah.
[65:05] B: Or like the fomo fear of missing out.
[65:07] A: Yeah.
[65:11] B: Very true.
[65:16] A: Yeah. So going back to grandma and the razor blade.
[65:20] B: Okay.
[65:21] A: What do you notice with that now? I mean, cuz you told me that whole thing with grandma.
[65:25] B: Yeah.
[65:26] A: And you told me even how you were with grandma.
[65:28] B: Yeah.
[65:29] A: But when you remember what that person did and where they put the razor blade.
[65:35] B: Yeah.
[65:35] A: Knowing that the razor blade's not there.
[65:37] B: Yeah.
[65:38] A: Right.
[65:39] B: It's not there.
[65:40] A: No, it's not there. It was really bad when it was there.
[65:43] B: It was really bad when it was there.
[65:44] A: Yeah. But it's not there now. Right. And that's way better.
[65:46] B: It is way better.
[65:47] A: Right. And that's what we want to get into the part of the brain that doesn't flow. Know that it's not there. To know that it's not there. Cuz you know that it's not there. You can tell. Right. Definitely not there.
[66:00] B: That would hurt really bad.
[66:01] A: Going all sorts of different things, a lot going on. I'm not sure that's moving around, sitting work either.
[66:07] B: No. Yeah.
[66:10] A: Right, Right. And you can remember them doing that and maybe even some of the other stuff that they. They did. Yeah. Before or after doing that. Yeah. Right. So you know that it happened.
[66:22] B: Yeah.
[66:23] A: But you also know that you shave the sides of your.
[66:26] B: Right.
[66:26] A: Well then stop shaving the sides of your head. Say I'm not shaving.
[66:29] B: I'm not shaving.
[66:30] A: That's right. Well, stop them from putting the raise. Say they're not doing it. We'll stop them from doing the other stuff. They're not doing it. Right. Where is it? Say it doesn't exist. Right. And again, as that all gets in, what do you notice?
[66:45] B: Just peace.
[66:46] A: Yeah. Isn't that crazy?
[66:48] B: Yeah.
[66:49] A: Isn't it crazy that it goes from something that was emotionally charged, that made me feel bad.
[66:54] B: Yeah.
[66:54] A: To now I think about it a.
[66:56] B: Matter of like seconds.
[66:57] A: Right?
[66:58] B: Like seconds.
[66:59] A: Yeah. It's like the light switch yeah. Done.
[67:01] B: Yeah.
[67:02] A: Because it's as dramatic when the brain gets it. Because this is really the key thing. When the brain gets that it's over. That it no longer exists. That there's nothing to be done. Feelings are gone.
[67:13] B: True.
[67:14] A: The emotional brain doesn't linger feelings because it wants us to stay upset. Right. If the man had gotten away from Mama bear when he was poking a stick at her bear cub and she chased after him. But he got away. Mama Bear isn't like stewing on it. Weeks later she's fretting and running around. If I find that mother. If I were to go tracking him. As soon as the situation is over for the animal, the emotion's gone.
[67:43] B: Yeah.
[67:44] A: So that's where when our brain gets that it's data. It stops causing the feelings.
[67:51] B: Someone told me the other day that I need to start being like a bird.
[67:55] A: Like a bird? Yeah.
[67:57] B: Bird wakes up. It's not like freaking out or wondering where it's gonna go, what's gonna eat, where it's gonna to land. It just flies. And whatever happens, happens. And I really like that. Cuz I like, like, like, like, like that. I like doing that kind of stuff.
[68:12] A: Yeah.
[68:12] B: So like it would have been like every time I have like a moment if I kind of think I like just being a bird, just being free and just never knowing what's going to happen. But still enjoying life in a way.
[68:23] A: Right. You well. And that's it. We can't ever know.
[68:27] B: No.
[68:28] A: With any amount of certainty what's going to happen. Ever.
[68:33] B: And I can't change anything that happened. But I can change the way I see the.
[68:37] A: Right. And the thing that starts to happen with this is when those moments get complete, they're not being forwarded into the future. I get the resiliency because I made it through it. I get that I'm stronger. I get that I'm wiser.
[68:53] B: Yeah.
[68:54] A: Which means I have fortitude and agency. I have what I need to move through what might show up. So the reason that the bird isn't fretting or concerned is the bird's not worried about whether the bird has what it needs to deal with what might happen. The bird first of all isn't thinking about anything that might happen.
[69:17] B: Just staying in the moment.
[69:19] A: Because that's all the bird has access to is right now.
[69:22] B: Yeah.
[69:23] A: Right. So. But that's part of it.
[69:26] B: Yeah.
[69:26] A: And the bird has agency. So it'll do whatever comes to mind to do to deal with whatever's going on in the way that's best. To deal with it in that moment.
[69:37] B: Yeah. That's why I liked it because it.
[69:38] A: Was very, very true. Right. Which again, even if you start working in the, in the jail and prison, like.
[69:46] B: Yeah.
[69:47] A: You're not going to always have. No.
[69:49] B: I'm never going to know what's going to happen.
[69:50] A: That's right.
[69:51] B: I can walk into a ride or I can walk into the best day of my life.
[69:54] A: That's right. So it's going to be all over the place. And you are adaptable.
[69:58] B: Yeah.
[69:58] A: Right. And that's the cool thing. Yeah, yeah, it's very cool. Yeah. Awesome.
[70:07] B: Pretty cool.
[70:08] A: Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, isn't it weird that now as you're thinking about the stuff, it's not having the same feelings?
[70:17] B: No, I don't have anything.
[70:19] A: Right. Like they're not bothering you.
[70:21] B: Yeah. Just chilling.
[70:24] A: Right. It's not hurting. I don't feel bad about it. It's not making me feel bad about me. I'm not angry. Right. I'm not thankful. Yeah.
[70:35] B: That's very nice.
[70:36] A: I get to have that stuff be completed so that I'm at peace with it.
[70:41] B: Yeah. It is very nice being peaceful of it.
[70:45] A: Yeah. Because check. Is there anything that has happened, any other lingering stuff from early childhood to elementary to middle to high school to any other stuff? It's lingering that.
[71:00] B: Not really. Like I've been really like trying to like practice like even having like my nightmares. Yeah. Cause like I don't always remember. I'm like I had one like a week and a half ago and I just woke up screaming.
[71:13] A: Oh.
[71:13] B: But I have no idea what it was about. No idea. But like I kind of just like got up and I went outside and I breathed and I was able to go back. Right back to sleep.
[71:24] A: Yeah.
[71:24] B: Which usually I can't.
[71:25] A: Yeah.
[71:26] B: So ever. Like I've really been like trying to practice what you're like teaching me.
[71:31] A: Yeah.
[71:31] B: Like I don't want to live like that.
[71:33] A: Yeah. Well. And so nightmares, bad dreams.
[71:37] B: Yeah.
[71:39] A: The interesting thing about them.
[71:41] B: Yeah. I don't understand them at all.
[71:43] A: Well. So they're like paper tigers. So a nightmare, a bad dream is like a paper tiger. And what paper tigers love to do is they love to chase people. So I like to chase.
[71:57] B: Yeah.
[71:58] A: You might think, why would anybody run from a paper tiger? The reason they would run is that they didn't know it was paper.
[72:06] B: Yeah.
[72:07] A: Because if an 800 pound tiger is after you, you're running, you're running. I mean they're thinking it's a game and they're going to win. But you're still running.
[72:15] B: Still running.
[72:17] A: Give me a chance. Yeah, the big one. Chance.
[72:21] B: Yeah. But. Yeah, that's like my only really good thing that's been happening is what paper.
[72:26] A: Tigers hate is catching people.
[72:30] B: Yeah.
[72:32] A: Because as soon as they catch the person, game's over. Right? Game's over. So they don't like catching people. They don't like fire. They don't like water.
[72:42] B: They love to chase.
[72:44] A: They love to chase. So what is the makeup mostly of bad dreams? The part of my brain that's dreaming the dream is not my logical brain. It's my emotional brain. That's why my br. My dreams don't make logical sense. It's why I can be in the house that I'm in currently, but in the bedroom that I grew up in. How the hell do those things go together?
[73:09] B: But why don't you remember them? Like, I, like lately I can't even like, remember call them. I just know I wake up screaming.
[73:16] A: Yeah.
[73:17] B: I think that's why, like, kind of drives me nuts.
[73:19] A: Yeah.
[73:19] B: I don't know how to even work on it because I don't know what it is.
[73:23] A: Well, right, but see, the dream would be the processing of unconscious material. Right. So if material that I wasn't able to get through because whenever I thought about it, I felt bad. My brain's gonna try to do something in dream state. That's why it creates.
[73:48] B: Yeah, that's like really the big thing, like lately.
[73:51] A: Yeah. Do they happen every day? Are they happening?
[73:57] B: It's like once or twice a week.
[73:58] A: Okay.
[74:00] B: But then, like it'll just stop.
[74:02] A: Yeah.
[74:03] B: Randomly. Like after I. The last time I saw you, I didn't dream until literally like last week.
[74:09] A: Yeah.
[74:10] B: And then that was it.
[74:12] A: Right, and then that was it.
[74:14] B: Yeah.
[74:15] A: So you'll probably notice the same kind of thing.
[74:18] B: Yeah.
[74:19] A: Meaning it being less and less and less. So some of the things that you have to understand in doing this kind of work, when it comes to specific moments of troubling experiences, when you unplug it and then it becomes data. It's an immediate, noticeable change in how I feel. Right.
[74:45] B: Yes.
[74:46] A: But I've had a pattern of behavior over time that I've done in a certain way that trying to change that takes deliberateness. So for example, if I walk by a doorway every day at 2:00 and one of those big boxing gloves comes out and punches you, hits you like a jackass. Right, Right. If that happens every day, the first couple times I get caught off guard by it.
[75:20] B: Yeah.
[75:21] A: But If I know it's gonna happen, I. Before I get to it, brace myself.
[75:27] B: Or move out of the way.
[75:28] A: So when it hit. Or so when it hits, it doesn't.
[75:31] B: Yeah.
[75:32] A: So then if we take away the giant, you know, boxing glove.
[75:39] B: Yeah.
[75:41] A: And I still am walking by at 2:00, what am I gonna do? Unconsciously, I'm gonna tense up.
[75:48] B: Yeah.
[75:49] A: It's gonna go away faster because I didn't get hit. So the thing, why I'm saying that is with some of the things, it's a divergent path that we've moved down and now we've set it on a different trajectory. And so the farther and farther it moves away, the more different the courses become. Right. Like ships at the sea, if one is adjusted by a degree at first, it doesn't seem like it's adjusted at all.
[76:20] B: Yeah.
[76:20] A: But we know the farther it goes out in the ocean, the more different the courses become. So you're going to notice that as more of that unconscious material. But in a dream, because you're like a light beam, Right. You actually can't get time touched, hurt or harmed.
[76:39] B: Yeah.
[76:41] A: So the part of the brain that's dreaming is the part that's the fight, flight, freeze. It's why in a dream I'm either frozen that I can't move or can't speak or can't. Or I'm running or I'm trying to fight. But in a dream you can't get touched or hurt or harmed. And nobody dies. In a dream. Yeah.
[76:58] B: But it still feels like that.
[77:00] A: Yeah. So it's like going into a Halloween Horror night nights.
[77:05] B: Yeah.
[77:06] A: Do you follow me with that? Right. So what we know, the difference is when we go into Halloween Horror nights we're suspending are that we know that it's not real.
[77:18] B: Yeah.
[77:19] A: To be in the experience of.
[77:22] B: Yeah, I know it's gonna be over.
[77:24] A: Right. That. Right. So one of the things that's different that in a dream, as I'm dreaming it and as we're talking about it now, if I move towards whatever it is that I'm trying to get away from, it loses its power. See, the idea is once somebody get. Once something gets exposed, it loses its power. Right. So if I have a gun and I can shoot thoughts into people's heads. Right. And I shoot this thought into this guy's head at the park that his wife is having an affair with his best friend.
[77:59] B: Yeah.
[77:59] A: Right. We walk over to him, he looks really distraught and we go, Hank, man, what's the matter? He goes oh, my goodness. My wife, she's having an affair with my best friend. Do you know what? He's not gonna say, I'm being troubled by this thought that I'm having.
[78:13] B: Yeah.
[78:14] A: That my wife is having an affair with my best friend. The first way the thought has him. The second way he's having a thought. Right. The first way it's controlling him. Once it's exposed as a thought, it loses its power. So if you're walking down a school hallway and it's dusk, so it's kind of dark in the hallway and somebody jumps out of one of the classrooms wearing an ugly scary mask and goes, rawr. And you're startled and you're freaked out by it. And then you're now in the lit room with them and the mask is on the table and they say to you, oh, my goodness, Carrie, your facial expression was priceless. I gotta see it again. It was so funny. Let me scare you with the mask. Hold on, let me get it right. Because once it's gotten exposed, it loses its power.
[79:10] B: Yeah.
[79:11] A: So a dream is like a paper tiger, but I didn't know it was paper. So that's why I've been trying to get away. If I move towards. Towards it and move towards it with a open like this, not a defensive like this.
[79:26] B: Yeah.
[79:27] A: Right. Because if I go boxing, I'm like this. Yeah. Probably not straight on. Unless I want to get hit a lot.
[79:34] B: Yeah.
[79:34] A: Let me go ahead. You know, I got no targets at all. Right. But if I'm like this, I move towards it in a you aren't harming me way, because you can't harm it. Shrinks it. It takes the whole thing and changes it. So one of the things that you might notice because you don't always remember the dream after the dream has happened and you wake up.
[80:06] B: Yeah.
[80:06] A: But as we're talking about this and we think about, oh, I wonder what might happen, is your brain is listening to what we're talking about. Then in the dream, it's a paper tiger. And that you actually can't get hurt. And that if you do the opposite of what you were thinking and doing in the dream, it actually changes the whole construct of the dream. Because once it's exposed, it loses its power secondarily, a lot more stuff. Stuff in between. Right. The last time we got together and now a lot of stuff got cleared up.
[80:45] B: Yeah.
[80:46] A: Right, right. And yeah. Nobody notice him.
[81:01] B: Like, my dreams have definitely, like, gotten a lot less. The anxiety is what everything's like. A lot.
[81:08] A: Yeah.
[81:09] B: More enjoyable yeah, life, I guess.
[81:13] A: Yeah. Well, that's because you're becoming much more emotionally present. Your emotions are matching what's happening. Your mind is not so vigilantly scanning for the similar stuff to react to.
[81:30] B: Yeah.
[81:31] A: It knows I made it through it, so therefore it's got fortitude and solidness that I got what I need.
[81:38] B: Plus, like, I've been enjoying things, like.
[81:40] A: A lot more, I bet.
[81:42] B: Like, because, like, me and my girlfriend work, so, like, I'll usually go up. Like, I actually enjoy doing housework now. It's not like a chore. Like, you know, I mean, I enjoy. I enjoy having dinner ready for her. Like, I enjoy.
[81:53] A: Right.
[81:54] B: All these little. I enjoy just sitting at home one day on my day off instead of having to, you know, go crazy.
[82:00] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[82:01] B: Yeah.
[82:02] A: Yeah, it is.
[82:05] B: It's definitely interesting.
[82:06] A: Yeah. Right. It's easier to have more joy when I'm present.
[82:11] B: Yeah.
[82:12] A: Right. And I'm present to what I'm doing.
[82:15] B: And just laughing a lot more weird things.
[82:19] A: Things.
[82:20] B: And we were like, she dropped me. She brought me here. Like, she's waiting for me.
[82:24] A: Yeah.
[82:24] B: I don't know what. We just started laughing about something. She gave me a weird look. Why are you looking at me like that? It was like, just something weird. We started laughing. I was just like, right, what's going on?
[82:35] A: Right.
[82:36] B: You know.
[82:37] A: Yeah.
[82:37] B: Right. Yeah. It's definitely a lot easier.
[82:42] A: It's a lot lighter.
[82:43] B: Yeah.
[82:43] A: You've lightened up a lot. Blah.
[82:45] B: Yeah.
[82:45] A: The weight from the. That you went there anymore. Right.
[82:51] B: At all.
[82:53] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[82:54] B: It is very cool.
[82:55] A: Yeah. And you're being more mindful, you're being more present. You're noticing new and different and novelty.
[83:04] B: Yeah.
[83:05] A: You're paying more attention.
[83:07] B: Yeah.
[83:08] A: You're bringing your awareness to things. Yeah. It's easier for you to do stuff.
[83:16] B: It is.
[83:16] A: Right.
[83:17] B: I enjoy doing a lot more now.
[83:19] A: Right, Right. Even stuff that normally isn't enjoyable to do.
[83:23] B: Yeah.
[83:23] A: Right.
[83:26] B: Yeah. It is nice.
[83:28] A: Isn't that cool?
[83:28] B: It is very cool.
[83:30] A: Yeah. Who would have thought. Right. And who would have thought it would have been this easy?
[83:38] B: Yeah. Like, I've done therapy before.
[83:41] A: It wasn't like this, like once a.
[83:42] B: Week, like every week. It was just like, ah, it's a more dreadful coming to it than exciting coming to therapy.
[83:49] A: Right.
[83:49] B: So it is definitely a lot easier. You know, I never thought I'd be excited about coming to therapy, but, you.
[83:55] A: Know, here we are, it's changing. Isn't that cool?
[84:02] B: It is cool.
[84:03] A: Right? I mean, like, Just notice what's different with all that.
[84:06] B: Yeah.
[84:07] A: Right. And that isn't the thing about therapy. But. But therapy isn't the right tool.
[84:13] B: Yeah.
[84:14] A: For the problem you had.
[84:15] B: Yeah. Because nothing was being resolved. Nothing was right.
[84:20] A: If I don't have the right tool for certain things with plumbing, Good luck.
[84:25] B: You're going to be in trouble.
[84:26] A: I need to have some big monster thing to be able to turn. Like, I don't have that tool. There ain't no way I'm doing it.
[84:32] B: Yeah.
[84:33] A: If I have the wrong tool, I can have the best intentions.
[84:36] B: Yeah. But still not the same outcome.
[84:39] A: I can't get there.
[84:40] B: Yeah.
[84:40] A: Because it's not the proper way. Yeah. Right. That's what I love about this. It's like such a different. It is thing to do. And you're able to tangibly see changes for people.
[84:54] B: Yeah.
[84:55] A: While they're with you.
[84:56] B: Yeah.
[84:58] A: Right. Yeah. So think about, you know, being home and you're doing something. It's like, could you just stop it? You can't sit still, can you?
[85:06] B: Nope. Can't do it.
[85:12] A: So good cat.
[85:14] B: Right. She's so perfect.
[85:16] A: Notice I didn't do any of that thing. Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[85:22] B: Gave you the little stare down like that. Sorry. What's going on? It is nice.
[85:30] A: Yeah. It didn't make you feel bad about it?
[85:33] B: No.
[85:34] A: Right?
[85:36] B: No, it's nice.
[85:38] A: Yeah. Yeah. I remember my wife and I was talking to a guy actually earlier today and he was telling me, he's like, yeah, you know, I'll go set up a bonfire. My whole family, like lasted me, because I'll get the bonfire set up. I'll sit down for like two seconds and I'll get up. Go move that around. I'll sit down for two, then I'll get up at the plate.
[85:56] B: Keep doing it.
[85:57] A: You've got ants on your pants. Yeah, I do. Right? You can't sit still. Right. There's so many of us that have that.
[86:03] B: Yeah.
[86:03] A: Right. Or just like. No, I'm gonna do.
[86:06] B: Yeah.
[86:07] A: My wife is somebody that can sit down and, you know, watch like three shows on the. I can get through a show.
[86:15] B: Yeah.
[86:15] A: It's a half hour show. I might be able to get through two.
[86:17] B: Yeah.
[86:18] A: But after the second one, I gotta like, I gotta. So we would watch shows and I afford laundry.
[86:25] B: Exactly. Or like I'm doing stuff. Can you just watch it? I'm just like, I am watching it. I'm just also.
[86:34] A: I just need a fidget stick.
[86:36] B: Yeah.
[86:37] A: My fidget stick is the laundry. Yeah.
[86:40] B: That's True.
[86:43] A: Oh, so good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So where are things with you? Because I got. You say that you talk to dad sometimes. You have good relationship with mom and stepdad now?
[86:55] B: Yeah.
[86:55] A: Are they local?
[86:56] B: Yeah, they live in Clearwater and we live in St. Pete.
[87:00] A: You live in St. Pete? Okay.
[87:01] B: Yeah.
[87:02] A: Okay. That's cool.
[87:03] B: Yeah, I don't really.
[87:04] A: Where are they in Clearwater? What part?
[87:05] B: Bel Air.
[87:06] A: Okay.
[87:06] B: You know Bel Airs?
[87:07] A: I do. Pretty.
[87:09] B: Yeah.
[87:09] A: Yeah. Beller Country Club is.
[87:11] B: Yeah, they live on Alexander Road before the country. You know, country club right there. Then there's that little road that goes back. They live back there. Yeah.
[87:21] A: That's nice. Clearwater's got nice little pockets.
[87:25] B: It does.
[87:27] A: Beautiful places. Yeah, but they're pockets. They are pockets, like, which is always weird.
[87:32] B: Cuz it's like right there, like where Bel Air is. And you got the Scientology down the street downtown. And then like if you go back further, it's more like little tiny houses and you go down low. It's like mansions all over the place. Yeah, it is very like that.
[87:47] A: Yeah, it's like just this small pocket of like really big houses that have water views.
[87:51] B: Yeah. Like, they have a huge house. It's like a six bedroom house for two, three people. Like, why do you need that? It's a. It's a big move. Victorian house.
[87:59] A: Wow. That's cool.
[88:00] B: It was built like the 1800s.
[88:02] A: Wow.
[88:02] B: That's like her dream house. So they finally got it. I'm just like, whatever. You do what you want.
[88:07] A: Yeah, right.
[88:07] B: I'm just letting y'all know when you pass away, I'm not keeping this house because that's like a multi billion dollar house. And I'm good. Not happening. Don't care. Nope. She's like, I don't give a. I was like, all right. Just saying.
[88:22] A: We'll use that for other things.
[88:24] B: Yep.
[88:25] A: Money for other things.
[88:26] B: Yeah. Or I'll make it into like a sober living. I think it'd be a cool place to be. A sober living.
[88:30] A: Yeah. Because definitely Bel Air would definitely be a fan of that. Hey. Hey.
[88:36] B: Doesn't matter. My HOA house, so it's all owned privately. So it's a little different community.
[88:43] A: Might be like, hey, everyone needs help.
[88:48] B: You're so good.
[88:49] A: I love it. Yeah. Yeah. I lived in Pinellas county for a long time. For like eight years.
[88:58] B: You're not from here. You don't live in Brainton? I.
[89:00] A: No, we live. We live literally 10 minutes down the road.
[89:02] B: Okay.
[89:03] A: But I. We lived in Pinellas county when I first moved down Here I got a job in Pinellas county schools.
[89:08] B: Okay.
[89:09] A: And I worked as.
[89:10] B: I used to live in Lake Ranch.
[89:11] A: Okay. Yeah.
[89:13] B: On 64. Lakewood Ranch.
[89:15] A: Yeah.
[89:16] B: But. Yeah, that's where I live, too. But I was like, I don't like this area.
[89:19] A: No. Yeah.
[89:21] B: Don't like it.
[89:21] A: Yeah.
[89:22] B: So then that's where all this happens.
[89:23] A: I lived in Clearwater off of Drew street for a long time.
[89:27] B: Okay.
[89:27] A: I lived in Pinellas Park. Okay. In an apartment there, like 49th. And I worked at Dixie Hollands for a period of time. Yeah.
[89:39] B: We live in, like, Isla Isa del Sol. It's, like, kind of going towards Fort DeSoto.
[89:46] A: Yeah, right.
[89:47] B: All that right there. We live in little condos right there.
[89:50] A: Nice. That's great.
[89:52] B: Yeah.
[89:52] A: Yeah, it's nice. Yeah. And then the last time. Last place that we lived was in Seol.
[89:58] B: Okay. Like Largo.
[90:00] A: Like south of Largo. Yeah.
[90:01] B: Okay. Yeah.
[90:02] A: Right. Seminole was great. If you didn't have to go anywhere.
[90:06] B: Exactly. It's very busy.
[90:08] A: If. If you had to go. If you just had to be in your community and maybe go to the grocery store, go to the post office, that kind of stuff. Great. We were right on the Pinellas Trail, so I could take a bicycle. Like, that was beautiful.
[90:21] B: Yeah.
[90:22] A: The problem was if you wanted to leave Seminole and go anywhere, you can't drive north.
[90:27] B: No, it's busy.
[90:28] A: Or south. You can't drive east. West. In Pinellas, there's, like a thousand different roads there.
[90:32] B: It's insane.
[90:33] A: And they're all big roads with lots of red lights.
[90:36] B: Oh, yeah.
[90:39] A: Park. None of them are easy roads to drive.
[90:41] B: Yeah. That's why I like St. Pete. St. Pete.
[90:43] A: St. Pete is the best.
[90:43] B: It's, like, a lot bigger. It's broader. Like, you know, I mean, it's little streets. Yeah. Like, we live right by 275.
[90:52] A: Yeah, right. I know. Right where you are.
[90:53] B: Yeah, right there. So it's, like, perfect. She works out here.
[90:56] A: Yeah.
[90:56] B: She works at me at the hospital.
[90:58] A: Okay. Yeah.
[90:58] B: So she has to get on there every day.
[91:00] A: Yeah.
[91:01] B: So I love St. Pete.
[91:03] A: It's perfect. That. That whole. Where you guys are. And even into, you know, downtown St. Pete, you have. That's what's.
[91:11] B: So there's many different ways to go somewhere.
[91:13] A: You. The only part of Pinellas county is that St. Pete Port that has access to the interstate. Maybe up in Clearwater, like Safety Harbor. That's it.
[91:24] B: Yeah.
[91:25] A: So I. When I lived off of Drew street, that was a great. Great place to live, too, because I had the Bayside Bridge.
[91:30] B: Everything was Right there.
[91:31] A: Right. That was right there. I could get over on the Courtney.
[91:35] B: 20 miles just to get to the interstate. Like, that's where my family lives. Like Bel Air. They have to use.
[91:39] A: That's what I meant. That was what you had to do to go into from Seminole as well. You gotta drive.
[91:46] B: No one knows how to drive anymore. It's like you see a raindrop and it's like whole world shuts down here. Yeah.
[91:54] A: Yeah. I had to go buy my. I bought my car up in the Kia dealership off of US 19 by Palm Harbor. Like way out there. Yeah. So it was way up by where? The old countryside Mall.
[92:07] B: Okay.
[92:08] A: So that was like north. Yeah, Clearwater. And I get the car. Brand new car. Yeah. Haven't had a new car since 2002. I've gotten cars, but not new cars.
[92:20] B: So.
[92:20] A: So I'm driving literally up over the sunshine skyway and the thing goes motor error and then dies. Your co car and I coast.
[92:31] B: Oh, my God.
[92:32] A: Then I pull off to the side of the road, and it's an electric vehicle, so I turn it off. I'm like, maybe it's like. Like computers. It needs to restart itself. So I leave it the 10 minutes.
[92:39] B: I said that the other day, right.
[92:41] A: I push the button back on, comes on no air. I'm like, oh, good. I'm Gold Drive from the bottom of the 2 State Road 64. Does the same thing.
[92:50] B: Was your battery.
[92:52] A: It was a brand new car. I had it less than 50 miles. So apparently there was a motor warning and it had a fluid leak. So 10:30 at night, I'm like, where am I going right now? I'm calling through the Kia system. The roadside assistance.
[93:11] B: Yeah.
[93:12] A: And they're like, okay. Yeah. I'm like, well, you're gonna need to tow it back to Clearwater. I don't want this car. Keeping this car. Like, literally, I just bought this, right? They're like, okay, well, it'll cost you $600 to have them tow it. Like, is it. I'm like, it's a brand new car. Doesn't have the. Well, you're not showing under the Kia. So I'm pay 600 to have you guys. Okay, fine. And then finally the sales manager at like 10:45 at night called me back today because I'm outside at this point. I made it all the way to Texas Roadhouse on 70. And in the. You know, you can. As you're coming down, you can pull into that lane. I'm like, just at the front of that lane. Okay. This Is not the safest place to be. But like, hey, it's better. So he finally called me back. He's like, do you think you can get it home? I'm like, yeah. He goes, okay, we'll bring you a loaner car Monday morning and I will make it right and get you a different brand new car. Yeah, okay, fine. That's what I.
[94:09] B: Ours did it. Like, she has a Ikea too, and she just got home. We were going. We were actually going to Texas Roadhouse. We get in the car and all of a sudden looks like the car's possessed. So it's, like, starting. So. But like, then we find out the Kia batteries, you have to have a 12.7. If it's anything under 12.7, the car is garbage, really. So our battery was 12.4 voltage. And we had to go pay, like, $600.
[94:35] A: Holy.
[94:36] B: And they wouldn't even look at it for two weeks. So we had to go somewhere else and get it because, like, we need a car. The Kia was gonna take two weeks just to even see it. And they wouldn't get us alone or until they figured out what the problem was. I was like, yeah, this is great.
[94:48] A: Wow.
[94:49] B: Yeah, I love Kia.
[94:52] A: That's crazy.
[94:53] B: Yeah.
[94:54] A: So you guys, did you replace a battery?
[94:56] B: Yeah, we had to get a hold of the battery.
[94:57] A: Oh, yeah. Who put in the 12.4?
[95:01] B: No, the battery was at like. Like the voltage was on a 12.4. It's supposed to be a 12.7. The car go. So the battery was just like.
[95:09] A: Who put in the wrong battery?
[95:11] B: I don't know. I mean, we don't know. It's on a lease, so we're due to turn it in anyway. So we're like, just do it. We'll just get a new car. So whatever.
[95:21] A: You would think that if it's a lease and it's their. They should know what goes in it.
[95:27] B: So you would think. You would think it was insane. And then they wouldn't even look at it. They said, yeah, you can bring it here, but it's going to take two weeks just to see it. And we can't give you a loaner car until we process it to see what's wrong with it. I was like. So we. I was like, that doesn't make sense. Who has two weeks to not be able to drive anywhere?
[95:44] A: Do you know. Do you know the people that have that? It's the people that have the Ferrari, Lamborghini, high end Porsche. Yeah. All those people don't need you to give them A loaner car.
[96:06] B: Yeah.
[96:07] A: Because if you have one of those cars, you have more than one car.
[96:10] B: Exactly. Exactly. So stupid.
[96:16] A: So people who have, like, a Ferrari, they never give you a loaner Ferrari.
[96:19] B: Yeah.
[96:21] A: They'll take your Ferrari and they'll fix it. But you. They know that you have another. Yeah. You know.
[96:25] B: You know, you're rich.
[96:26] A: It's crazy. So after you get your records expunged.
[96:35] B: Yes.
[96:36] A: What does that then look like for application? How do you. What requirements do you need to. Is there any additional schooling?
[96:44] B: I already did on my general ad.
[96:46] A: You did.
[96:46] B: Okay, I did all that. So basically, I'm just. I gotta get my record expunged. I got some things I gotta do with my license. And then I just start school. I just go to their academy.
[96:59] A: Okay. They have an academy?
[97:00] B: Yeah. Every school pretty much has to get corrections.
[97:03] A: Okay.
[97:04] B: So I was looking at spc.
[97:06] A: Yeah.
[97:06] B: And then I was also looking at the name of it was. But, yeah, different schools. But they have, like, certain requirements. Requirements. You have to. Have to even get accepted into the drug program.
[97:18] A: Right.
[97:19] B: You know, so I've been looking at it. But we'll say you gotta have, like, a perfect physical. Like, you can't. Like, you know, I mean, like, you know, so what I have. But the other thing, it's like. Well, it's gonna take some time. Is like, the record, you know what I mean?
[97:35] A: How long it takes to expunge something.
[97:36] B: Like how. Yeah. Like, if it's how like, wants to do the interview and probably proved that all my stuff happened while I was being human trafficked. It could take anywhere from three to nine months.
[97:46] A: You know what I mean?
[97:47] B: Just depending on the justice system.
[97:51] A: Interesting.
[97:51] B: So, yeah.
[97:53] A: But, yeah, I don't know how any of that works.
[97:57] B: I asked my dad, because my stepdad's an attorney. He's a defense attorney. He said it could take. It just depends. Depends on how they do it, when they do it, who they do it through, you know? Because basically a judge has to, like, sign off on it. So I don't know. I don't know if they go to the judge that already I already had or if I have to start a whole new thing.
[98:18] A: I would imagine it'd be the same judge.
[98:21] B: I hope it is, because then she'd just be like, real quick, yeah, she loves me.
[98:27] A: Yeah.
[98:29] B: Yeah, that's pretty much it. So I'm waiting for this point.
[98:33] A: Yeah. Yeah. Cool.
[98:38] B: Yeah.
[98:38] A: Yeah. So as you're checking in and as you're thinking about stuff, and as you're thinking about what's currently going on and what's like headed your way. What do you notice?
[98:50] B: I don't know. I'm kind of just like in the moment.
[98:53] A: You are.
[98:53] B: I'm staying in the moment. Being honest.
[98:56] A: Yeah.
[98:57] B: You know. Cuz I now have to.
[99:00] A: I don't know whether you have to.
[99:01] B: I mean, I don't have to, but I want to.
[99:03] A: Well, I think you get to now.
[99:04] B: Yeah, I get to.
[99:05] A: Right.
[99:06] B: I want to be able to do it.
[99:07] A: So it's nice. Yeah.
[99:08] B: You not worried about what's going on.
[99:12] A: Yeah. As you think about the stuff.
[99:14] B: Yeah.
[99:14] A: Stuff that happened. Stuff that happened through childhood. Yeah. Things that dad said.
[99:19] B: Yeah.
[99:19] A: Right.
[99:20] B: It's not really bothering me.
[99:22] A: Yeah. Other stuff that happens. Stuff that happened when you're a teenager.
[99:27] B: And stuff that could continue that could ever happen.
[99:30] A: Right. Think about being in that hotel room with the guy. Yeah. Drug dealer, the knife.
[99:37] B: Yeah. It's nice.
[99:38] A: Right. About the razor blade.
[99:40] B: Nothing.
[99:41] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[99:42] B: I'm excited to go get dinner.
[99:46] A: So Perfect.
[99:48] B: Want right after this.
[99:52] A: Right, Right. See, that's the coolest part.
[99:56] B: Excited about, you know.
[99:59] A: Yeah. I give people the example sometimes when it's clear somebody can be telling you about the thing that they went through.
[100:05] B: Yeah.
[100:05] A: And you might be thinking, how can you not be troubled?
[100:08] B: Yeah.
[100:08] A: And they might be thinking, well, because like you're really a nice person. And I'm thinking about going to dinner in a little bit.
[100:14] B: Like think about going get a cheesesteak after this.
[100:17] A: Hello. Like, you know.
[100:19] B: Yeah.
[100:19] A: Right.
[100:20] B: Yeah.
[100:20] A: Which is so very different.
[100:22] B: Yeah.
[100:23] A: Than how it used to be.
[100:24] B: Yeah.
[100:25] A: Yeah.
[100:25] B: Because I probably would have been thinking about all this like the rest of the week. I probably was like all over, like thinking about it. But I don't really think.
[100:32] A: Right. Or hurting or sad or troubled or.
[100:34] B: Yeah. Not leaving the office with the smile on my face. Put it that way.
[100:38] A: Right. Yeah.
[100:39] B: So it's nice.
[100:40] A: Yeah, it's very nice. Yeah. Any other stuff that we haven't gotten to.
[100:50] B: Like the stuff you've taught me so far has really helped me just to like get through whatever, you know, because it is like a lot of it is like the yelling or like, like the objects or whatever. You know me from those situations, you know. But yeah.
[101:10] A: Everything seems to be. Yeah.
[101:14] B: Vibing right now.
[101:15] A: Yeah.
[101:16] B: I feel very vi. Is.
[101:18] A: Yeah. Right.
[101:19] B: Yeah. Like I could just. I could do anything I want at this point.
[101:24] A: Right.
[101:24] B: And enjoy it.
[101:25] A: You've got more space. And even when you have more space from something, you can turn the volume of it down.
[101:32] B: Why should Nice to.
[101:33] A: Right.
[101:34] B: Like I kind of just like throw it away and not have to worry about it.
[101:38] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[101:42] B: It makes me feel kind of like I have a lot more. I was one of one. He's like, I feel like I can accomplish a lot more now in a way. You know what I mean? Cuz like I'm don't. I'm not worried about.
[101:58] A: Right.
[101:58] B: You know.
[101:59] A: Right.
[102:00] B: Well, all those things and what it. What I thought it made me, but it didn't make me.
[102:06] A: Right. Notice the meaning that was attached to what happened to you.
[102:12] B: Yeah.
[102:13] A: Was part of what was making you feel so bad about you.
[102:16] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[102:19] A: Right. The memories got unplugged.
[102:23] B: Yeah.
[102:24] A: The meanings got adjusted.
[102:26] B: Yeah.
[102:26] A: Because you got to see it clearly.
[102:29] B: It's nice.
[102:30] A: Yeah. Good job.
[102:37] B: I'm happy.
[102:38] A: Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. Very cool. Appreciate you. A lot of pleasure. Yeah. If anything else shows up, we can certainly get back together. That's an easy thing to do.
[102:53] B: Do I see you again?
[102:54] A: I don't know. You can.
[102:55] B: Cuz they said they paid for three visits. I don't know what that meant.
[102:59] A: I don't know either.
[103:00] B: Okay.
[103:00] A: They do whatever they do and I do whatever I do. Okay. And then if they need more, then we do more. If they need less, then we do whatever. I don't. I. I don't have any. Like I. I always look at it like I want to do pieces of work and I want people to be in a space where they feel complete with what we've done up until now. Now.
[103:19] B: Yeah.
[103:19] A: That doesn't mean that life isn't gonna happen. And other thing that I didn't even know that I didn't even know that I didn't even know might come up, so. Which is why it's useful to know that we can get back together.
[103:30] B: Okay.
[103:31] A: Yeah.
[103:31] B: Okay. So basically qualify.
[103:34] A: Yeah. I mean that's the thing that you want to notice is just like pay attention for yourself. And if something's going on, then absolutely. We can get back together again. Okay. Yeah. I mean, we can schedule something in a couple months too. Whatever is.
[103:48] B: I might just do that just in case. Cuz I know it's hard to get in here sometimes. You're pretty good at. I think everybody wants to see you. I don't know. I don't know. All right, let's do that. Let's like schedule like two, two and a half.
[104:04] A: Okay.
[104:04] B: Something like that.
[104:05] A: Yeah.
[104:05] B: That way.
[104:06] A: Cool.
[104:07] B: That should give me a good span of time, Right?
[104:10] A: Exactly. Figure out and notice what's different. Yeah. And better. Okay, cool. All right, let's go do that. Come with me.
[104:17] B: I'm coming.
