[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 22nd of July, Katherine. This is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:17] B: That's okay.
[00:18] A: Cool. Okay, so I'm going to start off with a menu of the kinds of things that I know how to get better.
[00:24] B: Okay.
[00:25] A: And then I'm going to be asking you, what do you want our time to actually do for you?
[00:30] B: Okay.
[00:31] A: So kind of thinking of it in if we could change problematic ways that you feel, think, act, react, what do we want to get better for you? Right. And then the last part is what would be useful for me to know, to understand. Okay, but let me start with the menu.
[00:49] B: Okay.
[00:49] A: Sometimes people come in because they're a lot more on edge, meaning they're more easily irritated, agitated, aggravated. Maybe they're more quick or short tempered. Maybe they're reactive. Maybe they say or do things that later on they wish they hadn't said or done. They don't want to be feeling like that. Okay. Some people come in because they're more tense, nervous, anxious, they get racing thoughts. Sometimes it moves into full fledged panic. Sometimes it's in certain social situations. Excuse me. Or in groups where they're super self conscious. Sometimes it affects sleep, sometimes it moves into full fledged panic. They don't want to feel like that.
[01:30] B: Okay.
[01:32] A: Some people come in because they have had things that have happened that although the experiences are over and may have been over for a while, underneath the surface they continue to affect them again. Not that they think about it all the time, but if they do or if something reminds them of it, they're still yuckiness. Some people have grief issues that seem to be stuck or frozen. Every time they think about loved one, they still have that pain and grief. They don't want to be feeling like that. Some people are more. More down and depressed. They lack the interest and energy they used to in doing things. Some people, what I would say is they're more reactive. What is that to the world around them? They just have way more stuff.
[02:20] B: I think it's the third one.
[02:22] A: The third one?
[02:22] B: Yeah.
[02:23] A: Stuff that's happened?
[02:24] B: Yeah.
[02:24] A: Okay, so you've had things that have happened.
[02:27] B: Yeah.
[02:28] A: That although they're over, they affect you?
[02:30] B: Yeah.
[02:31] A: How so? How do they affect you now?
[02:34] B: Just basically like my relationships that I have, I don't trust people.
[02:38] A: I don't Probably a good idea.
[02:39] B: Yeah. I don't like people. I'm gonna cry.
[02:42] A: It's probably not a good idea to not trust people.
[02:44] B: I don't.
[02:45] A: Well, it's. That's a good idea because people are untrustworthy.
[02:48] B: Yeah.
[02:49] A: We live in a crooked world. Think somebody else has got my best interest in mind all the time is a bad idea.
[02:54] B: Yeah, I know.
[02:55] A: Really bad idea.
[02:56] B: Yeah.
[02:57] A: But we get told all the time that we need to learn how to trust.
[03:00] B: I don't like to trust.
[03:01] A: No, but it's not the. The trust is in the wrong position.
[03:04] B: I don't know what you mean by that.
[03:06] A: I bet. So here's what I mean by that.
[03:08] B: Okay.
[03:10] A: We tell people to learn how to trust others, but that's a bad idea.
[03:17] B: Okay.
[03:17] A: Thinking that they're gonna have my best interest at all times is not a good idea. They will have my best interest when mine matches theirs. As soon as my best interest doesn't match theirs, they have theirs, not mine.
[03:30] B: Yeah.
[03:30] A: Right. Right. So people ask me, I've been married for almost 23 years. They go, well, you must trust your wife. And I say, I don't. But I don't not trust my wife because it's the invisible leg of the table. Yeah. Right. It's only there. But I want to pay attention because if she tells me she's going to the gym and she comes back dressed up like she didn't go to the gym and smells like men's cologne, I should just believe her. No. Right. It would be dumb.
[03:59] B: Yeah.
[04:01] A: So I want sensory acuity. I want to pay attention. I want it to be more like a fire detector.
[04:06] B: Okay.
[04:07] A: Which isn't there to prevent a fire.
[04:10] B: No, it's to make you aware at.
[04:12] A: The earliest sign of smoke.
[04:13] B: Yeah.
[04:14] A: Right. Nobody goes into the house and says, I don't need one.
[04:18] B: No.
[04:19] A: This house will never catch on fire. But nobody puts them there thinking, oh, this one's gonna catch on fire one day.
[04:25] B: Right.
[04:26] A: They're there to alert us at the earliest sign of smoke.
[04:29] B: Okay.
[04:30] A: So the trust which we think of needs to be over there, needs to be in here, that I have better discernment. Right. The problem is you, if I'm understanding this correctly, haven't had the best discernment because you've been at the effect of trauma. Shit. That's happened.
[04:49] B: Yeah.
[04:50] A: So it's kind of fucked up, the discernment.
[04:52] B: Yeah.
[04:53] A: Okay, cool.
[04:54] B: Yeah. That's where I'm at.
[04:56] A: Okay. So we want to get that better.
[04:58] B: Yeah.
[04:59] A: And how else has it negatively affected your Relationships. Do you not pick good guys? Do you?
[05:06] B: I just. It's not even that I pick bad guys. It's just. I won't even allow people close to me. Like, I just don't. Like. Especially because I'm so new in recovery and I'm at such a vulnerable place and I'm trying to figure out who I am as an individual because I've always kind of been like, my therapist told me, like, I've always been in an ownership. I've never been in a real relationship, so it's hard for me.
[05:35] A: You've always been in an ownership?
[05:37] B: Yeah, it's like a give and take. Like, you give me what I want and I Like. It's. It's. It's never been.
[05:44] A: You're talking transactional relationships.
[05:46] B: Transactional. But even in my. Like, I don't even. It, like intimate relationships, there's always been drugs and. Or alcohol involved. So it's super hard to, like, know you're in a genuine relationship when your mind isn't clear.
[06:06] A: I see.
[06:07] B: So it's just. I'm just trying to figure it out at this point. Like, I'm just. I don't want anybody close to me because I don't want to be hurt again.
[06:21] A: Yeah. And you don't want to still be hurting.
[06:27] B: Yeah.
[06:28] A: But right now you're still hurting.
[06:29] B: Yeah.
[06:30] A: By whoever it was that hurt you.
[06:32] B: Yeah, I know.
[06:33] A: And it's like, wouldn't it be useful to get that, to stop hurting? Yeah. Right.
[06:37] B: But it's like, I think just because I'm talking about it and like. Like I've done my steps and stuff and I should be over it.
[06:46] A: But it's like. Well, that doesn't work that way, does it? No.
[06:48] B: I mean, it's supposed to. That's what they say. But it's like, I don't know why I still hang on to it.
[06:56] A: You're not.
[06:57] B: I'm not?
[06:58] A: No, no.
[06:59] B: Like, I am.
[07:00] A: I know. I know that you would think that you're hanging on to it, but I.
[07:05] B: Mean, I know those relationships weren't benefiting me, but at that time, some of them didn't benefit me. But now it's like I'm holding myself back from ever allowing myself to grow or, like, have a decent relationship because I just don't trust people at all. Like, I mean, I trust.
[07:28] A: That's okay. The issue, right. Isn't to trust people.
[07:34] B: Yeah. It's to find out when the smoke.
[07:37] A: It's to be able to trust in you, that you have what you need to Be okay in dealing with whatever shows up.
[07:50] B: I feel like I do.
[07:53] A: I feel like I do. Except in the other breath, you said, I don't want to get hurt.
[07:59] B: I don't.
[08:01] A: Right.
[08:03] B: So I don't want to let my walls down.
[08:07] A: Right.
[08:08] B: Okay.
[08:09] A: I don't want to get hurt. I have what I need to make it through.
[08:15] B: Yeah. Myself.
[08:16] A: I feel like I have what I need, but I'm afraid to get hurt. If I'm afraid to get hurt, maybe I don't feel like I have all of what I need.
[08:27] B: That's okay.
[08:30] A: It's not okay for you to get hurt, though. That's what you're saying?
[08:32] B: Yeah. No.
[08:34] A: Right. But you can't know. I can't buy a house knowing with certainty that it will or won't catch on fire.
[08:45] B: Yeah.
[08:47] A: Right. You can't know with certainty how a relationship's gonna go ever.
[08:57] B: That's true.
[08:59] A: You're wanting certain. That's where trust is. Because then I trust now. I don't have to pay any attention anymore. So we're okay? Certainty. We don't have certainty. What we want instead is that you're okay to move through uncertainty, that you don't need to know it ahead of time in order to be okay.
[09:23] B: I don't want to do that, though.
[09:25] A: Huh?
[09:30] B: I don't want to. Like, I don't want people to. I don't want to allow people in to hurt me.
[09:40] A: Right. Because that's what. That. That's what you'd be doing.
[09:43] B: Well, I don't know if that's what I would be doing.
[09:46] A: Right. You don't. That's the problem.
[09:49] B: Yeah, I know, but it's, like, rather safe than sorry. I know.
[09:57] A: Right.
[09:58] B: It's not healthy.
[10:00] A: Right. What I'm saying, the problem is in you not knowing. And the not knowing is because I'm still tied into or tied up by stuff that happened to me. I'm not clear. So it's a really good idea right now when you're not clear, to not date.
[10:26] B: Okay.
[10:26] A: That makes sense, because you're not clear. And when you're not clear, you would allow people that hurt in, and you don't want to do that. So the best option right now is to not date.
[10:41] B: Yeah.
[10:41] A: We're on board with that.
[10:42] B: Yeah, totally.
[10:43] A: What you and I want to do, okay. Is we want to get it so that you're no longer hurting.
[10:50] B: Okay.
[10:51] A: Over the stuff that happened.
[10:53] B: Okay. Yeah, that would be good.
[10:55] A: That's what we want to do. Because I don't know whether anybody explained this to you or not. And this is gonna sound crazy, I know, but we're not troubled by the awful things that happened because they happened.
[11:08] B: No, I know that.
[11:12] A: Why do you think we're troubled?
[11:14] B: I'm troubled because I don't know. I don't know why I'm troubled. I'm troubled because I don't know why I'm troubled.
[11:22] A: So I'll give you the thought, okay? Most therapists, and that's where you got the terminology, I need to learn how to let it go. Right. I need to learn how to let it go, get it out, release it. Right. That's the language that we use in the world.
[11:43] B: Yeah.
[11:45] A: There's a problem with that when it comes to emotions.
[11:49] B: Yeah. What is that?
[11:50] A: Knowing what my triggers are, knowing why I have them, knowing where they came from never stops me from being triggered by them.
[12:00] B: No, it doesn't.
[12:02] A: Right. So my knowledge doesn't change how I feel.
[12:06] B: Okay.
[12:07] A: Right. I can know that the abuse that my uncle did to me when I was 10, I can know that at 50, that wasn't my fault.
[12:15] B: Yeah.
[12:16] A: I can know I didn't do anything wrong. Yeah.
[12:19] B: But that's the easy part about it.
[12:21] A: Hold on. I can know that some of it felt good, not because I wanted it or because I'm gay, but because the body part touched in that way is designed to feel good. I can have done the work of forgiving my uncle. I do all of that and have had 40 years. Why inside do I still feel the guilt and shame? You would think once I know better and after all that time, I should feel better. But it doesn't work that way. Here's why. When we go through troubling moments, it short circuits the emotional part of the brain. What that means is, at that level, that part doesn't know it's over. I do that part. Never got that it ended. See, if I broke my foot when I was 10 and I told you about it right now, and I'm as emotional as when it happened, you're gonna look at me like, what is wrong with this guy? He's walking all over the place. His foot is fine. But if I told you about what my uncle did to me when I was 10 and I started to get emotional, you'd be like, well, yeah, of course. Yeah. But why? Why does the physical wound heal and the emotional wound doesn't?
[13:35] B: Is it because the emotional wounds are deeper?
[13:38] A: No, it's only because emotionally, the brain doesn't know it's over. The memory of what happened and the experience of it happening got glued together so they live as if they're the same thing. It's why anytime you think about it or something reminds you of it, it's as if you're back there in it again. Does that make sense?
[14:05] B: Yeah.
[14:06] A: So where therapy got it wrong is they thought that we buried it and we repressed it. Right. When you were going through something difficult, you weren't able to express how it was making you feel. You buried. You repressed it. You locked it behind closed doors, you put it under the carpet. We've got to get it out. No, we want to do the reverse. We want to get the good news into the part of the brain that doesn't know certain moments ended. We want to unplug the memory so emotionally the brain can read it as data about something that happened not happening. As soon as that happens, it is as dramatic as a light switch turning on. The pain that was attached was gone immediately. Go on.
[14:54] B: But how do we do that?
[14:57] A: How do we do that? See, that's one of my favorite questions. How do you know that my explaining this right now isn't already on the way to doing it?
[15:08] B: I don't.
[15:09] A: You don't, do you? But I do.
[15:11] B: Okay.
[15:12] A: If you do that, Scott, that is good. Right. Because only one of us in the room needs to know how to do it for. For you.
[15:19] B: Yeah.
[15:20] A: And it's not going to be you. No. Because you're in it.
[15:24] B: Yeah.
[15:24] A: Even the best dentist in the world doesn't try to pull his own cavity out. He goes to his buddy. Yeah, same thing. It's hard to make these changes for yourself. So you said earlier, I need to learn how to let it go. Well, watch. I'm holding on to this pen. You can see it.
[15:44] B: Yes.
[15:44] A: How much effort do you think it's going to take for me to let it go? Right. Why do emotional wounds feel so hard to let go of?
[15:59] B: I have no idea.
[16:00] A: Maybe because I'm not holding it. Maybe because it's got a hold of me. Maybe it's a glitch and an error in the way that your brain is working. That it doesn't know certain things that you've gone through are actually over. That you survived it. That you're okay. You up here, Catherine know that you did?
[16:29] B: Yeah.
[16:29] A: At a deeper level, your brain doesn't know that yet. So we have a lot of good news to get in about things that happened that were yucky.
[16:39] B: Yeah.
[16:40] A: So other than how it's negatively affected your relationships, what else about how that affected you doesn't work for you in today's world. I got the whole trust thing and that. I'm, like, a little bit more jaded on. On all of that. Not even ready for a relationship. Which is great because you're not. No. Right. So you're good. Like, that's really good in alignment with you to know that I'm even going there right now. Right. So that's perfect. How else has it been like, this stuff that happened? Negatively affecting now, like, do you get night terrors? Do you get panic attacks? Do you get. Are you down and hard on you? Is there.
[17:27] B: I think I tend to be negative.
[17:28] A: And critical about yourself.
[17:31] B: I think I push myself to expectations that, like, you know what it is? I just feel like I'm not. I don't even know. I'm still trying to, like, engage in behaviors that I know aren't good for me because I just don't.
[17:51] A: What does that mean?
[17:52] B: That means, like, I still find myself reaching out to people that I shouldn't be reaching out to.
[17:58] A: What kind of people? Like, guys for dates?
[18:03] B: Guys for money?
[18:04] A: Drugs?
[18:04] B: No, no, not drugs.
[18:06] A: Sex for money.
[18:07] B: Yeah.
[18:08] A: Okay. So it's just.
[18:11] B: I need. It's so silly because I need to let go, and I'm just terrified to let go.
[18:18] A: Let go of what?
[18:20] B: Let go of this person.
[18:22] A: The guy who gives you money?
[18:23] B: Yeah.
[18:24] A: Why do you want to let go of him?
[18:26] B: Because it's. I'm cheating myself. Because I feel like I deserve better, and I just, like. I don't know. Like I could do it by myself. I'm just scared.
[18:42] A: Scared of not having the money to pay for the halfway house?
[18:49] B: No, it's so stupid.
[18:50] A: No, it's not stupid. I just want to understand.
[18:53] B: I know, because I have a job. I have the money to pay for it, but it's. I don't know. I don't have a reason. That's the problem. Like, I'm just. It's not fair to myself and where I want to go and who I want to be today, and I'm cheating myself of that, and I know it. And I just am scared to make the final push, and I have to. I have to do it. I just don't.
[19:24] A: Okay.
[19:25] B: Yeah.
[19:27] A: So you have a guy that you get together with sometimes that gives you money for sex?
[19:31] B: No, it's not even that.
[19:32] A: He.
[19:33] B: It's not. Okay, let me explain it.
[19:35] A: So he gives you money for you showing him your feet? No.
[19:38] B: Like, I mean, I've had sex with him before, yes, but it's not like an every Time I see him, thing he takes. Like, he's been paying my rent the last two weeks, and he pays my phone bill, but I only see him once a week, and I've known him for so long, but I don't have any intentions of it developing into any kind of relationship. He's married. It makes me feel bad. It's just not good for my mental state. And, like, it's just. I know. It's just not like there's nothing better. I mean, the money's great and all, and it helps me, but I don't really need it, you know? And it's not fair to myself because I'm not that person, and I've worked so hard not to be that person, and I'm still doing those behaviors. So even though I feel better, it's not making me like, this is the only problem that I have is because I'm still doing this, and I've been lying to everybody, and it's just not good.
[20:51] A: Lying to everybody means.
[20:53] B: Huh? Like, my family and my therapist and. Well, I told my sponsor, and my sponsor knows, but.
[21:06] A: Okay.
[21:07] B: It's just.
[21:08] A: Who's your therapist?
[21:10] B: Are you gonna tell her? You can't tell her.
[21:11] A: Why would I tell her?
[21:12] B: I don't know.
[21:15] A: I'm just curious who she is.
[21:17] B: Ashley.
[21:18] A: Ashley from Salah?
[21:20] B: Yeah.
[21:20] A: Oh, okay.
[21:21] B: You're not gonna tell her, right?
[21:22] A: Why would I tell her?
[21:23] B: I don't know.
[21:27] A: What is that? She's not really a therapist.
[21:30] B: She is. I thought.
[21:32] A: Isn't she a case manager?
[21:33] B: Whatever she is. Yeah, I think so.
[21:36] A: She's a case manager.
[21:37] B: Yeah.
[21:37] A: Not necessarily a therapist. I mean, she might help you with therapy stuff, but she's not really a therapist.
[21:43] B: Okay.
[21:43] A: Kind of thing.
[21:44] B: Okay, I get you. I get you.
[21:45] A: Yeah. Okay. All right, so. So that's going on. You want to stop that, but you haven't yet. It's not now because you need the money.
[21:56] B: No.
[21:58] A: And then you said this other part, which is I'm cheating myself.
[22:02] B: Yeah.
[22:02] A: What does that mean?
[22:04] B: Like, because I'm. It's just so dirty, and, like, it doesn't make me feel good.
[22:14] A: So it used to not be a problem.
[22:17] B: Now you're a problem because I was on drugs.
[22:20] A: Now you're clean inside, sober.
[22:22] B: Yeah.
[22:22] A: And you're kind of looking at this thing going, I get money from this guy who's married.
[22:28] B: Yeah.
[22:28] A: And sometimes do sexual stuff with him. Not every time, but sometimes.
[22:32] B: Yeah.
[22:33] A: And he's paying my phone bill, and he's paid for rent for the past couple weeks, and that's all great, but that's, like, really small thinking.
[22:41] B: Yeah.
[22:42] A: I don't want to be his call girl anymore. I don't want to be the person that he's doing this shit behind his spouse's back. I don't want to be that anymore.
[22:54] B: No, I don't.
[22:55] A: But I've been scared to stop.
[22:57] B: Yeah, I shouldn't be, but I am.
[22:59] A: But scared to stop because.
[23:05] B: Because I. And when I was in active abuse.
[23:09] A: You're doing great.
[23:10] B: When I was in active use, he was always there, you know what I'm saying?
[23:17] A: And it's not using, but just there.
[23:22] B: No, he never used. But, like, for hotels and like, whatever I needed. Like, he was. He was like my supporter and my friend, I thought. But it's like there comes a point where, like, when I got out of treatment, I tried to set boundaries, like, and then I broke down because I. For some reason, I feel like I owe him, but I don't, you know? Like. And if he cared about me as much as he says he does, that he would understand that the reason I didn't call him the first month I was out was because I was going to try to do better. And then it's like my brain is. I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. It's like I'm just scared to let go because I've always had somebody taking care of me since I was, like, 19. So, like, I've just always had.
[24:20] A: You always had somebody taking care of you since 19?
[24:24] B: Yeah.
[24:25] A: Didn't have people taking care of you when you were a baby?
[24:27] B: Well, yeah, but I mean, for material stuff, like, irrelevant.
[24:33] A: You've actually been being taken care of your whole life?
[24:35] B: Yeah.
[24:36] A: Oh, yeah. Oh. What would it be like to be out on your own two feet?
[24:41] B: I mean, I've done it before as.
[24:43] A: The adult you without any of those extra side pieces of assistance.
[24:47] B: I don't know because I've never done it.
[24:49] A: Oh, you just said I've done it before.
[24:50] B: Well, but not that I've done it before, but I did it for someone else. Not because I was, like, wanting to do it. I did it because I thought that's what my ex boyfriend wanted me to do.
[25:02] A: Huh.
[25:03] B: So I've never really been.
[25:07] A: So. Notice how you're conflicted because I'm not being who I want to be.
[25:12] B: Yeah.
[25:14] A: Right. So are you worth it to you?
[25:17] B: Yes.
[25:18] A: Are you sure?
[25:19] B: Yeah.
[25:20] A: So the part of you that's having you go back to be with this guy, what do you think that that part Highest positive intention is for you.
[25:30] B: There is no positive intention.
[25:31] A: Well, there has to be.
[25:33] B: No, there isn't. There isn't, though.
[25:35] A: See, this is the problem. There must. There's always a higher positive intention to any thing that a part of you wants for you, even if it doesn't.
[25:45] B: Seem like financial security.
[25:47] A: And if you were financially secure, what would that do for you?
[25:52] B: I don't know. Just make me feel safe.
[25:55] A: You'd be safe. Right. Right. So let's check.
[26:01] B: Okay.
[26:03] A: Getting that money from him, does it have you feel safe? Yeah, it does?
[26:09] B: Yeah.
[26:10] A: Okay. It has you feel safe?
[26:16] B: Has me feel safe? Yeah.
[26:18] A: Getting the money from him as you feel safe. No, no, no.
[26:20] B: Like, what do you mean? Like, I don't understand.
[26:23] A: Well, you said that the part that's interested in you interacting with him is about getting you the money.
[26:30] B: Yeah.
[26:30] A: Getting you the money provides, like some form of safety.
[26:34] B: Yeah.
[26:35] A: Or security or.
[26:37] B: Yeah.
[26:38] A: So do you feel safe and secure financially, but not.
[26:44] B: Not really.
[26:46] A: Right. Because what is it not doing?
[26:49] B: It's not making me feel good.
[26:53] A: Right.
[26:53] B: Internally.
[26:54] A: Right. Because there's a thing called cognitive dissidence. It's the behavior that I'm doing doesn't match who I'm purporting to be.
[27:06] B: Yeah.
[27:07] A: And I'm not okay with that behavior. There's a big part of me. So in doing that, that's not making you feel safe, it's making you feel shitty.
[27:16] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[27:17] A: Right. See, the part of you that's been thinking and doing that is going to make you feel safe hasn't known that. What it's actually been doing is having you feel shitty, that I'm having to, you know, lie to my supports.
[27:34] B: Yeah.
[27:35] A: Right.
[27:38] B: I just feel like it's a tanking time bomb.
[27:40] A: Well, in. In that regard, it's also the thing that pushes me closer to the life I had.
[27:49] B: I know.
[27:50] A: That I wanted to be out of.
[27:52] B: I know that. I know. Yeah, yeah.
[28:05] A: Yeah. So if you weren't doing that stuff with him and you weren't getting that extra money, do you make enough money with where you're at to pay your rent? Oh, you do?
[28:17] B: Yeah.
[28:17] A: Oh. And that good?
[28:20] B: Yeah.
[28:20] A: Oh, you mean you're actually set up in a way that you can do it on your own? Yeah. What would it be like if you were doing it on your own?
[28:29] B: Make me feel a lot better.
[28:31] A: You would, wouldn't you?
[28:32] B: Yeah.
[28:32] A: Right. Feel a lot better because you're worth it to you.
[28:36] B: Yeah.
[28:37] A: Right. Because that ain't a real relationship. And that's the problem. It Never was. Right. That one was what we call the transactional relationship. Yeah, Right. Quit pro quo. You do this for me, I do this for you. You scratch my back, I scratch your back.
[28:56] B: Yeah.
[28:56] A: It was a partnership. Got it.
[29:01] B: Got it.
[29:01] A: When you first were interacting with him, you didn't know that. Yeah, I did know that fully.
[29:09] B: Yeah.
[29:10] A: Oh, okay.
[29:12] B: Yeah. In the beginning, and then somehow, I don't know, like.
[29:17] A: So in the beginning, you knew it was transactional.
[29:19] B: Yeah.
[29:20] A: You gave him is what he got and. Right, right, right. And then it changed a little bit because it didn't always have to.
[29:29] B: Yeah, exactly.
[29:31] A: Where before it started off, where I always had to.
[29:33] B: Yeah.
[29:34] A: Right Now I don't always have to.
[29:35] B: Yeah.
[29:36] A: Sometimes I do. I'm not sure which time, but it's.
[29:39] B: All a mind game.
[29:41] A: Do you know that? That is why it's been so hard to leave it. It's the same thing that they do with gambling. It's called an intermittent reinforcer. Strongest kind of reinforcement. Right. Gambling wouldn't work if every time I played I won.
[29:55] B: Okay.
[29:56] A: Gambling wouldn't work if every time I played I didn't win.
[29:59] B: Okay.
[30:00] A: Gambling works because I play, and every once in a while I win.
[30:05] B: Yeah.
[30:06] A: Right. But I don't know when. Or I will or I won't, and I don't know how much I'll win or not. Right, right. And I might get close to winning, but now it's that same thing. That's why it's been hard. Got it.
[30:19] B: Got it.
[30:20] A: Yeah. So we want you to be worth it to you. So the you that I'm seeing, she's grounded and centered in herself and who she's want and who she's becoming much more okay and comfortable in her own skin. The you that I'm seeing is feeling good about the things that she's doing as she's doing them, and glad that she did them the way she did. When she thinks back about having done it, she's free.
[30:51] B: Yeah.
[30:51] A: Got it.
[30:52] B: Got it.
[30:53] A: This is the you that I'm seeing. You, by the way, Catherine don't have to see this future you as clearly as I do, because the question isn't how it's gonna happen. It's would it be okay?
[31:06] B: Yeah.
[31:06] A: Yeah, yeah. So with it, okay, we want you to do a piece where you slightly lower your jaw. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. That's right. And you breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer. And you'll notice that as you're breathing in this Way. Right. How your body's starting to feel now? Right. Go ahead and open your eyes. How's your body feeling now? More tense or more calm? Yeah. See my nose? Continue to breathe. Stay looking at my nose. See my fingers? Stay looking at my nose. My fingers. Move out with the sides of your eyes. Pick up my fingers. Wiggling. Now stay looking. Sides of your eyes. Good job. Notice that when you do, you're aware of more space. Towards the windows, towards the doors, the space between you and me, beyond me, under you, behind you, above your head, beyond the ceiling and the roof, all the way out. As you're noticing the space, again, checking your body.
[32:35] B: I don't feel this hot.
[32:37] A: You don't? Do you Right now? Because we want you to be above and over it. Because, you know, people say I'm under a lot of stress sometimes. We want you to be above and over it. So just for a moment, close your eyes. And then imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof so that you rise above it all. In the sky, having this bird's eye view, you're seeing everything as being underneath and below you. Like a bird, you're free to soar through the space, the vastness of the sky above. Big, wide turns, curves, arching ankles. You soar, you fly. You're free. Right. Bring your awareness back down and into your body to rehab. Associate inside of you. Take one more nice, slow and deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And what are you noticing now? You are calm. Right. As your body's calm. Right. And we're knowing who you're becoming. Right. Think about that guy and some money. I don't need it. And what do you notice?
[34:06] B: I feel, like, detached from it.
[34:08] A: That's right. So to the extent that you realize seeing him is in direct conflict with what you want for you and your life, what you've worked already really hard to get clean, sober, and clear.
[34:22] B: Yeah.
[34:23] A: And start your life in a direction that you want. Right. So the extent that you realize anytime you see him is in direct conflict.
[34:33] B: Yeah.
[34:34] A: With what you want and who you're becoming. And then what we'll do is more work to unplug the emotional effect that the stuff has had so it's not weighing on you like it was.
[34:48] B: Okay.
[34:49] A: Got it.
[34:49] B: Got it.
[34:50] A: That's what we're gonna do. That way it'll be even easier to be unattached, separate, free. Makes sense.
[35:02] B: Yeah.
[35:03] A: Cool.
[35:04] B: Cool.
[35:05] A: All right, we're on our way.
[35:07] B: Wow. Yeah, that was good.
[35:09] A: Yeah. And then we'll get Ashley to get us scheduled for a multiple hour chunk of time.
[35:15] B: Okay. Perfect.
[35:16] A: Awesome.
[35:16] B: Thank you.
[35:17] A: You're welcome. My pleasure.
