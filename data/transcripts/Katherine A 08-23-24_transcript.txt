[00:00] A: So today is the 23rd of August, Catherine. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable and transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:15] B: That's okay.
[00:16] A: Cool. So one of the things that we know is that you have a whole bunch of stuff that has happened, right? Some of it more recent, some of it longer time ago. Heck, some of it might have been in early childhood. That although those experience experiences are over, they're underneath the surface affecting things. Not all the time and not in every way, but at different times in different ways it gets triggered. We want to get all of that to stop.
[00:43] B: Right?
[00:43] A: Right. So that's one of the things we want two, we want you to be much more emotionally present.
[00:50] B: Right.
[00:50] A: So that your emotions are matching what's happening. Right?
[00:55] B: Right.
[00:55] A: You have wisdom, but you're present. We also want the last part, you to be a lot lighter.
[01:01] B: Right.
[01:02] A: And more okay. In you. Right. So that when you interact with others in particular guys, you have better discernment.
[01:11] B: Right.
[01:12] A: Meaning you're able to notice things and you're aware of it sooner.
[01:17] B: Correct?
[01:17] A: Right. Not in hyper vigilant, but like open space so that I can see more. Right, Right. Because here's the problem. When we get triggered into flight fight freeze mode, it sends us down the dorsal side of the vagus nerve. Now the vagus nerve is an interesting nerve because it, it's called the wandering nerve. It comes from the brain and in the center of the brain and wanders down and it literally connects to all of the vital organs in the body.
[01:52] B: Oh wow.
[01:53] A: Right. And so when we go down that we're in fight flight freeze. When we're in flight fright freeze. All of the self talk that we have. Because your brain never stops thinking, never shuts off. No, it even when you're asleep, it doesn't stop. Right. You're always having thoughts. You can check it out because you know you can think about when and you're having thoughts. Right. Like so what, what characterizes the quality of the thoughts, Whether they're the more negative, critical, down on me. I'm. This has to do with when that got being down in that trigger because all of the self talk. So it has to do with the biochemistry within your body. Makes sense that characterizes the self talk. When I'm in that state I'm stuck because I don't have access to resources.
[02:46] B: Right.
[02:47] A: They're just not connected. So what we're going to be doing is we're rewiring the way that your brain reacts and responds to experiences and stuff.
[02:59] B: Okay.
[03:00] A: So that those same things that used to press the buttons in you, even when the button gets pressed, it's not doing that thing to you.
[03:10] B: Right.
[03:10] A: Does that make sense?
[03:11] B: Yes.
[03:12] A: Cool. Okay. So second part, what we know is as a human, we're not troubled by what we went through emotionally. Now, because what we went through was awful. Wrong. Shouldn't have happened. I shouldn't have done it. I was dumb. They were out. Like, it's not because it happened. We're troubled because when it happened, brain froze. Right moment. That part doesn't know it ended. Okay, got it. I do. That part got separated from the rest of my nervous system that moved on, knowing that I survived it and I'm okay. That part never updated. Okay, makes sense.
[04:01] B: How do we get it to update?
[04:03] A: How we're getting it to update is what we're doing now.
[04:05] B: Okay.
[04:06] A: Right. Because the first thing in order to change it is for us to understand how come it's continued to go and how we get it better.
[04:16] B: Okay.
[04:17] A: Right. And that's what we're doing now. Okay, perfect. Right? You're already picking it up. It's fast.
[04:21] B: Okay, good.
[04:23] A: No, really serious. So. So because that happened in the brain, doesn't update any thought about it. Reminder of it, similar to it can trigger as if it is it. And that's what you notice. So my brain confused the soda slide with the it falling on me from the X.
[04:50] B: Right.
[04:51] A: Make sense?
[04:52] B: Yes.
[04:53] A: Right. It was structurally similar enough, even though it wasn't the same.
[04:58] B: Right.
[04:59] A: And when that stuff is still active, that's why similar gets read as same.
[05:05] B: Right.
[05:06] A: When that stuff is unplugged, similar is experienced as similar, but different.
[05:14] B: Okay.
[05:16] A: There's that clear distinction. Right, Right. And the part that was problematic is different than what occurred around it. Right. Like, so the person who, I don't know, she got raped by a guy wearing a Taylor Swift shirt, which is a bad idea now because Taylor Swift is in everything and in all things. But every time she hears a song or somebody met, she's in it triggers.
[05:43] B: Right.
[05:43] A: But of course, when that was happening to her and she saw Taylor Swift's name, that wasn't the part of the experience that bothered her.
[05:52] B: Right?
[05:53] A: Right. What he did to her body, all that, that was what bothered her.
[05:56] B: Right.
[05:56] A: But because they co occurred.
[05:58] B: Right.
[05:59] A: It got stuck together. So when it's unplugged, then similar gets separated and that's no longer part of that. Right there. That's. The distinction is separate. Makes sense.
[06:14] B: Yes.
[06:15] A: And then the last part to that is because when we're little, we learned good things happen because I'm a good person.
[06:22] B: Right?
[06:23] A: Right. And by being a good person means good things will happen.
[06:26] B: Right.
[06:27] A: And I get toys, presents, candy, love, kisses, because I'm a good person. And good things happen when you're good, which is great, but life isn't always good.
[06:36] B: Right.
[06:36] A: But if I learn the good things happen when I'm good, it must mean the bad things happen when I'm bad.
[06:42] B: I don't think it works.
[06:43] A: I know it doesn't work like that in real life.
[06:45] B: Right.
[06:46] A: But it is what gets attached to anything that's bad. It feels like it's my fault.
[06:51] B: Right?
[06:52] A: Right. So the little kid who was molested by his uncle when he was 10 feels like some of that had something to do with him. Like maybe he should have known better.
[07:02] B: Right.
[07:02] A: Shouldn't have gone to uncles. No, he didn't know that. Right. But it feels like it was my fault.
[07:09] B: Right.
[07:09] A: Or the girl who had gone out on a date with a co worker's friend and later, as he dropped her off, he said, can I use your restroom? And she said, sure. And then of course he came out and forced himself upon her.
[07:21] B: Right.
[07:22] A: And she blames herself for being stupid and careless and putting herself in that situation. But again, because it was bad, it's my fault. So that's why that gets stuck all together.
[07:33] B: Right?
[07:33] A: Right. What we're going to do is unplug it so the emotion goes away and then what you know, you feel.
[07:41] B: Right.
[07:42] A: Because you know already. Just like the guy who's 40 knows what uncle did do when it's 10 wasn't his fault and he didn't do anything wrong. And some of it felt good, but not because he wanted it. Not because he's gay. But his body parts touched in ways are designed to feel good. He knows all of it up here.
[07:57] B: Right?
[07:58] A: Right. Why inside does he still feel that guilt?
[08:04] B: He's still attached.
[08:05] A: You would think once he knows better, he should feel different. Doesn't work that way. That's why we're doing the reverse. Right. He's not troubled because it happened. He's not troubled because he knows it. He's troubled because part of his brain doesn't know it's no longer happening, that it's over, that the experience no longer exists, which is what we're getting in. At a deeper level, does that make Sense.
[08:31] B: Yes.
[08:32] A: Yeah. Cool. Okay. Any questions about that?
[08:35] B: No.
[08:37] A: So to transition, all we want to do is get the body into states of rest. Using the other access to the ventral part of that vagus nerve. When we slightly lower our jaw and you relax the back of your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale and a little bit longer on the exhale, you're using levers within your brain to start to put your body in a state of rest down that ventral part of the vagal nerve. As you can see me in my nose, you'll see my fingers. Stay looking at my nose. My fingers. Move out with the sides of your eyes. Pick up the fingers wiggling. Notice the space. As you're noticing the space, Catherine, check inside your body. How's your body starting to feel now? Yeah. As your body's feeling more and more relaxed. Right. Think of a time in life when you are outside in nature and you see something beautiful. Right. What is it that you see?
[09:50] B: Waves.
[09:51] A: Waves. And there's a moment that as you're seeing the waves, you're experiencing that all wonder, excitement, peace, all at the same time. And people would tell you it is the waves that give you those feelings. Being there and seeing it. But we could also look at it from the other side. And what if being there and experiencing it simply drew your awareness down and in. In towards your center? And what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited? Kind of like if I'm at the campfire and I'm cold, and I take my hands and I move them down towards the flames and I say, holy cow, this fire is getting hotter.
[10:31] B: Right.
[10:32] A: Is it really that the fire is getting hotter? No, it's just getting closer. I'm becoming more aware of the heat. Okay, Right. Because I'm getting closer to the flame. So we know that in your life, there have been many times where awareness has been anywhere but at your center. The stressors, the upsets, the hurts, the griefs, the pains. But no matter where awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited in the same way you see us in this room. There's two of us. You know it. Your senses bring in data that's in intellectual knowledge. We call that light of knowledge at your center. It's the brighter light of wisdom. So now we've got knowledge and wisdom. And you might know, I work with all sorts of people who've had awful stuff happen. And I remember this one girl that I worked with. I don't know, she was seven. Her older brother was, like, 16. He used to take, you know, a Wiffle ball bat and put it down. Just all sorts of, right? We worked together, cleared it all out. All the pain, the disgust, the anger, the hurt, the grief, the guilt. Like, it's gone. And she's sitting across from me like you are. And I asked her the question. I go, you know, where was all that stuff? And she's like, it's gone. I don't feel it, right? I go, right, but where was it? And she's like, I don't know. I go, well, was it at the surface? She's like, it wasn't intellectual. I go, was it at your center? She's like, how could it survive in light? Or I'm peaceful and excited. It doesn't, right? So I said, then where was it? And this is what she told me. She goes, it was hiding in the light, in between the shadows, between the lights. And I said, well, what happened? She goes, the lights, they're now touching. The shadows are gone. And I said, cool. And then we started talking about how people mess up identity by thinking that we're our bodies. But what if you're not your body? What if you have a body and it's totally yours, right? But it isn't actually you. And I say that because my mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident when she was younger. But when she visits people, they don't say to her, susie, I'm glad almost all of you could show up, right? Because she's all there, even if that part of her body's missing, right? And that there's no part of your body today that's the same as it was. It's all been replaced, right? Every day, millions of cells are being replaced over and over and over again, right? So you have a body, totally yours, but it isn't you. Weird, right? So then we go, if you're not your body, you must be your thoughts, but you're not your thoughts. You're not even the thinker of them. Your brain is, right? And your brain is an organ, not you, okay? Just like your liver and your lungs and your heart. So you're not your thoughts. Oh, well, then maybe you're how you feel, but you feel different ways at different times. So you can't be a feeling.
[13:23] B: No.
[13:24] A: No. Weird. Maybe you're what you do, but you've done different things at different times. And when you stop doing one of those things to do a different thing, you didn't stop existing, right? So the weirdest question. If you're not your body, if you're not your thoughts, if you're not your feelings, if you're not what you do, then what the heck are you?
[13:42] B: I'm just me.
[13:43] A: Yeah, but who is? You say, just for our purposes, that the who you are is what you became aware of as you're seeing the waves. Let's see, in the moment that you're seeing the waves, you're experiencing the capital S self. That light at the center is you. Right? And that. That light can't get touched. Wow. Right? I know. Isn't that cool?
[14:14] B: Yeah.
[14:15] A: Right? Because light can't get touched. Even if there's an angry monster, it'll go right through it. Right? So as we're thinking of you more and more as light. Right?
[14:29] B: Right.
[14:30] A: You know, I go to the dentist. I'm super upset. And you go, why are you so upset? And I go, you'll never believe what he did to me. And you go, what did he do?
[14:39] B: Right?
[14:39] A: And I go, well, I mean, the first thing, he ushered me in, and he shuffles me, and I sit down. All of a sudden, my head is going down, my feet are going up in the air. It's like, we're weird. And you go, okay, you're at the dentist, right? Right. And I go, well, then, like, he's positioning this instrument, like, above it, and he flips on the switch, and all of a sudden, there's light in my eyes. I can't see anything. And you're like, yeah, but you're at the dentist. And then I go, catherine. And then he takes this cold instrument and he shoves it in me. And you're like, oh, my goodness. Andrew. What?
[15:16] B: Right?
[15:17] A: I go, my mouth. I'm at the dentist. But see, that is the same thing that I said to the girl, okay, with her brother when she was younger. I said, he messed with your stuff. And she said, he did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings, and it maybe screwed up a lot of what I did. And then she looked at me with this bright, vibrant, glowing smile, and she said, but you know what? What? He never touched me.
[15:51] B: Right?
[15:51] A: He messed with my stuff. Yeah. It screwed up my thinking and feeling, but he never got me me. And I went, whoa, that's cool, right? So take a nice slow and deep breath in. And then a long exhale, right? One more nice, deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. And just notice that with your eyes closed. Your eyes can rest that as your eyes. That's right. Rest closed. You also rest. Beginning to drift down easily, effortlessly inside. That's right. Towards that calm. That's right. Peaceful, easy, flowing energy. That's right. Because as your nervous system is down, regulating your unconscious is organizing the experiences in which order would be useful to bring to your awareness for us to unplug. That's right. So that it'll be even easier for you to. To be calm and present and with me now here. Because this is. And that stuff isn't. It's not now, even though it was then. And you don't even have to fully follow everything I'm saying to know that something's getting in at a deeper level. That's right. Your unconscious is responding to you, interested in your. Becoming more free and light. Present and. Okay. Yeah. So in a moment, you can take your time finding your way back. Up and up and up and up. So that whenever you're ready. That's right. A nice big deep breath in. Yeah. And eyes are open. Good. And check inside. Catherine, what are you noticing now?
[19:28] B: Nothing.
[19:30] A: Nothing. Oh, well. How's your body feeling?
[19:33] B: Good.
[19:33] A: It is? Like how? So? It's peaceful. Right. Isn't that a nice feeling?
[19:38] B: Right.
[19:39] A: And as your body's maintaining this peaceful state of energy, your unconscious is going to travel back down the timeline of negative experiences. One that we try to never think of, think about. Because when we do, it makes me. And it's going to begin to group them and then narrow down and grab one pinpoint and bring it to your awareness. You got one?
[20:06] B: Yeah.
[20:06] A: Good. The one that came to mind happened how long ago. You might have been how old?
[20:11] B: I was probably 22.
[20:12] A: Good. The feeling, as you think about it, is a feeling of what? Shame. Would it be okay to get the feeling of shame gone?
[20:20] B: Yes.
[20:21] A: If the feeling of shame is gone, does it mean what happened was okay?
[20:24] B: No.
[20:25] A: Right. You get to be okay even though that wasn't. Right. Got it. So then if that happened when you were 22, what's something you've done later that was more enjoyable than the thing at 22?
[20:35] B: I got clean and sober.
[20:36] A: You got clean and sober. That's way better than that. Good. Something else?
[20:40] B: I got a raise.
[20:40] A: Yeah, you got a raise. Good. What something else?
[20:42] B: I have nine to five. Job.
[20:44] A: Yes. Right. Good job. Like all of those things happen after that. That.
[20:47] B: Right.
[20:48] A: There's a part of the brain that doesn't know anything beyond it. Okay, so we have good news to get in.
[20:53] B: Right.
[20:53] A: Makes sense. So then you're just going to tell me what happened. Facts in a Matter of fact way. So it'll go. That happened, then that happened, then that happened, then that happened, then that happened, then that was over. Okay, got it. So when that thing happened, when you were 22, when it happened, you were where?
[21:10] B: I was on drugs.
[21:11] A: So you were on drugs. But where were you? North Fort Myers. So you're North Fort Myers. And you had been using.
[21:18] B: Harem.
[21:19] A: Harem. Right. So you shot up and then what happened next?
[21:22] B: I went to a call.
[21:23] A: So you went to a phone call?
[21:25] B: No, prostitute call.
[21:26] A: Oh, good. So. So somebody called and that. Right, Good. Then what happened next?
[21:30] B: He tried to rape me.
[21:31] A: So you got there.
[21:32] B: I got there.
[21:33] A: Right. And you guys were talking about whatever.
[21:35] B: Yeah.
[21:35] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[21:37] B: He put his hands around my throat.
[21:39] A: So he put his hands around your throat. Right. Check it out. Right now are they there?
[21:42] B: No.
[21:42] A: Right. Good. Cuz you're here. Hi.
[21:44] B: Right.
[21:44] A: Isn't it better to be here? Right. Good job. Right, Right. So then he put his. Right. And then what happened next?
[21:49] B: He told me to get naked.
[21:51] A: Right. So he told you to get naked. Right. And then what happened next?
[21:53] B: Then I jumped out of a window.
[21:55] A: Well, then you jumped out of the window.
[21:56] B: Yeah.
[21:57] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[21:58] B: And then the cops came.
[21:59] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[22:01] B: And then I went home.
[22:03] A: Oh, then cops came. They arrested him.
[22:05] B: No, he got away.
[22:06] A: No, he got away. Right. But they came and then they brought you home.
[22:09] B: Yeah.
[22:09] A: Right. And then that moment was over. Right, Right. And then later on you did something more fun. Right, Right. Like get clean.
[22:15] B: Yes.
[22:15] A: Right. Or get a raise.
[22:16] B: Yeah.
[22:16] A: Right. Or get a nine to five job. Right, Good. Right. Got it. Notice what's happening.
[22:21] B: Okay.
[22:21] A: As you were telling me about it, there was some discomfort.
[22:24] B: Right.
[22:25] A: But it was less.
[22:26] B: Right?
[22:27] A: Less. Because your brain was getting that. It's data. Okay, Right. We never go backwards, but when we do, it literally unplugs and takes away the charge. So we go backwards. Okay, Right. So we've got, you know, getting the 9 to 5 job and the raise and you know, getting yourself clean. Right, Right. And then before that you were back home. Right. And then the cops brought you home. And then the cops got there and then you had landed. And then you jumped through the window. And then he had let go, telling you, you need to take your clothes off. And then he had grabbed you. And then you guys were negotiating, then you'd gone over there.
[23:00] B: Yeah.
[23:00] A: And then you'd gotten the call. And then before that you'd shut up. And then before that you're doing Whatever, you're doing it as we go backwards compared to forward. Emotionally, how was it?
[23:08] B: It was easier.
[23:09] A: Right, because your brain is reading that. It's data. Now, the third one, emotionally, the brain doesn't get logic, but it does get patterns of association. And the error is that the memory and the experience are glued together, so they're living as if they're the same thing.
[23:23] B: Okay?
[23:23] A: But there are things you can remember doing that you know you're not doing, like putting on your hoodie.
[23:28] B: Right?
[23:29] A: You can remember doing it where you were when you did it. But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your hoodie on, and then I went, catherine, stop putting on your hoodie.
[23:37] B: Why?
[23:38] A: Right. You'd say to me, I'm not putting on my hoodie.
[23:40] B: Okay?
[23:41] A: Because, you know, there's a difference between the memory of you putting it on, okay. And you putting it on, okay? They're not the same thing.
[23:51] B: No.
[23:52] A: Right, right. Just like you can remember putting your glasses on.
[23:57] B: Right?
[23:57] A: Right. And if I said, well, remember putting your glasses on, and then, catherine, stop putting on your glasses, you'd be like, I'm not putting on my glasses.
[24:05] B: Right.
[24:05] A: Because, you know, the memory of doing it is not the same thing as doing it.
[24:10] B: Okay?
[24:10] A: The error, emotionally, with all yucky stuff, is that the memory and the experience are glued, okay? So they live as if they're the same thing.
[24:21] B: Okay?
[24:21] A: Got it.
[24:22] B: Right.
[24:22] A: So we play a silly game called the I'm not. You're not. It's not. Stop. Okay, Right. Because you can remember him doing that. You can remember jumping through the window. You can remember all that happening. You can also remember putting on your hoodie, right? Catherine, stop putting on your hoodie. Say, I'm not putting on my hoodie. Well, then stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then stop him from grabbing you by the neck. Say, he's not doing that.
[24:45] B: He's not doing that.
[24:45] A: Well, then you stop putting on your shirt. Say, I'm not putting on my shirt. Stop me from putting on my pants. Say, you're not putting on your pants. Right. Well, then you stop jumping out of the window. Say, I'm not jumping.
[24:55] B: I'm not jumping.
[24:56] A: Well, then stop it from happening. Say it's not happening.
[24:58] B: It's not happening.
[24:58] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[25:00] B: It's no longer.
[25:01] A: Exactly. Right. As that gets in, what do you notice happening to those feelings?
[25:06] B: I feel like I'm detached.
[25:08] A: Right. Notice how it's unplugging.
[25:10] B: Right.
[25:11] A: Right. Notice how I can remember it, but it's not making me feel bad. Right. Now, the last part is close your eyes.
[25:19] B: And.
[25:22] A: Right. Picture that earlier you let her know that that moment is over, finished. That experience no longer exists. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about getting clean. Let her know about her 9 to 5. Let her know about getting a raise. Let her know about her changing her life for the better. Let her know so that she's getting it. Let's. Right. And as that earlier you is getting it, what do you notice now?
[25:50] B: I feel fuller.
[25:51] A: Yeah. What happens to the earlier you's face? You feel fuller.
[25:55] B: She feels excited.
[25:56] A: She does, doesn't she? Yeah. And you can open your eyes. Right. Isn't that cool? Notice how things are changing.
[26:07] B: Right.
[26:07] A: Right. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And again, that part of your brain that knows is going to travel back down the timeline of other moments, other experiences. And again, narrow, pinpoint. And.
[26:25] B: My ex.
[26:26] A: And is there a particular moment, experience, time that comes to mind with that?
[26:30] B: X the mind games.
[26:34] A: But we want to think of one time cheated on me with my sister. Oh, well, that might be useful. Okay, so that one happened how long ago?
[26:45] B: Like five years.
[26:46] A: Five years ago. Right. Good. And so again, as we get this. Better. Would it be okay for you to be okay?
[26:51] B: Yes.
[26:52] A: Yeah. And if it's, you know, okay, does it mean what they did was okay?
[26:56] B: No.
[26:57] A: Got it. You get to be okay even though what they did wasn't. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So how'd you find out, my friend? So you're aware when this happens?
[27:09] B: In the car.
[27:10] A: So you're in the car. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[27:12] B: Daytime.
[27:13] A: Daytime. And are you driving or in the past. You're driving. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[27:17] B: She told me.
[27:18] A: So you're sitting. She got in the car with you.
[27:21] B: Yeah.
[27:21] A: Right. You guys have been talking.
[27:22] B: Yeah, we've been talking.
[27:23] A: Right. And then she's like, hey, I gotta tell you something. Right, Right. And she said.
[27:26] B: She said, Kirsten's Bernie.
[27:30] A: Right, Right. Chris and sucking Bernie. Right, Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[27:34] B: I freaked out.
[27:35] A: You're like, what the. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[27:38] B: I confronted him.
[27:39] A: And then you pulled. You drove to where he was.
[27:42] B: No, I called him.
[27:43] A: No, you called him. Hey, man, I just found out that you're right, Kristen. Yeah. And he said what?
[27:48] B: He said, you don't know that.
[27:49] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[27:56] B: I told him that I knew that she knew where he lived.
[27:58] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[28:01] B: We Broke up for the final time.
[28:03] A: Right. So then you broke up. Right, Right. And then you got clean.
[28:08] B: Yeah. And then I got clean.
[28:09] A: Right. And then later on you did something more fun.
[28:11] B: Yeah.
[28:12] A: Like get a new job and get a raise.
[28:13] B: Right?
[28:14] A: Right.
[28:14] B: Yeah.
[28:15] A: Right. Kick the other guy off.
[28:16] B: Someone better.
[28:17] A: Right? Kick the other guy off. Yeah, right. Got it. Right. So again, as you were telling me about it, some discomfort, but less because you're here.
[28:27] B: Right.
[28:27] A: We go backwards.
[28:29] B: Okay.
[28:29] A: Right. So we got, you know, getting the raise in the, in the job and getting yourself clean. Right. And then breaking up for the final time and then like saying, no, I do know. And then him like you don't know that. And then you're calling him and then her telling you and then you picking her up. Right, Right. And then before that you were doing whatever you're doing.
[28:47] B: Right?
[28:47] A: Right. As it goes backwards again, compared to forward emotionally, how was it?
[28:51] B: Easy.
[28:52] A: Right, Right. You can remember all that happening.
[28:56] B: Yeah.
[28:56] A: Right. And finding that out. You can remember putting your hoodie on.
[28:59] B: Yeah.
[28:59] A: Right. Well, let's stop him from doing that. See, he's not doing that. Well, then you stop putting on your hoodie. Say I'm not putting.
[29:04] B: I'm not putting.
[29:04] A: We'll stop me from putting on my sneakers.
[29:06] B: Stop putting on your pants.
[29:07] A: Yeah, well, I'm not sneakers. Right. So you're not putting on your sneakers. Right. Stop it from happening. Oh, it's not happening.
[29:13] B: It's not happening.
[29:13] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[29:15] B: It no longer.
[29:16] A: Him doing that. Did that have anything to do with you?
[29:18] B: No.
[29:19] A: Or your lovability?
[29:20] B: No.
[29:21] A: Right. Or even his lack of interest in you?
[29:23] B: Right? No.
[29:24] A: No. It had to do with whatever was up in him.
[29:27] B: Yes.
[29:27] A: And her Right. At that time.
[29:29] B: At that time.
[29:31] A: Got it. Got it. Right. Had nothing to do with you. But see back then a little bit that you felt like it had something to do with me. Like if I was more this or that, then he wouldn't be doing all that. Got it? Cuz we're looking at it clearly. Did it have anything to do with you? No. No. Had everything to do with what was off over there with him.
[29:51] B: Right.
[29:51] A: You didn't know that? No. Right, so you're going to repeat these four words after me. Here we go. It's. It's not. Not about. About me.
[30:00] B: Me.
[30:01] A: Right? It's not. It's not about me.
[30:03] B: About me.
[30:03] A: Right? It's not about me.
[30:04] B: It's not about me.
[30:05] A: Right. Now close your eyes. Picture that earlier. You. Right. Let her know that's over, finished, completed, defeated. It no longer exists. I'm done, complete, finite with him. That him doing that and being that way had nothing to do with me. Had everything to do with what was off with him and her then. Right. So that the earlier you was getting. It's not about me. Had nothing to do with me. It's not about me. Right. Let that earlier you know that you're okay about getting clean. Right. Starting your life. Yeah. Changing for the better. Getting a raise. Right. That's right. And as all of this is getting in, what do you notice happening now?
[30:49] B: Feel lighter.
[30:50] A: Right. And what do you notice happening to that earlier? You.
[30:53] B: She's getting happy.
[30:55] A: Yeah. And you can open your eyes. Right. Isn't that cool?
[31:00] B: Yeah.
[31:01] A: Right. So things are changing on the inside.
[31:04] B: I feel it.
[31:05] A: You do, don't you?
[31:07] B: Yeah.
[31:07] A: Right. It's changing on the inside because now think about that moment and what do you notice?
[31:15] B: It doesn't bother me.
[31:17] A: It doesn't bother you? No. Right. Think about the thing at 22, jumping through the window.
[31:22] B: Doesn't bother me.
[31:23] A: Yeah. Freaking acrobat on freaking heroin. Hello. The. Do you get yourself to do that? Aren't people like. Yeah, man, I got a lot of energy.
[31:31] B: Fight or flight.
[31:33] A: Holy cow.
[31:36] B: It was. It was interesting.
[31:39] A: You think it was interesting? Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's how. Lack of an interest I was in that person. What was going to happen with him. Yeah.
[31:50] B: No way. I didn't have time for that.
[31:53] A: Then I got to run through a window to get away.
[31:56] B: Yeah.
[31:57] A: Isn't that remarkable?
[32:00] B: It was.
[32:01] A: Yeah. Don't you think I got away? Yeah.
[32:03] B: He was a serial rapist.
[32:05] A: Right. You got away.
[32:06] B: I got away.
[32:07] A: Right, Right?
[32:10] B: Yes.
[32:11] A: Yeah. You took care of you. I took care of you. You did what had to be done.
[32:14] B: I did.
[32:15] A: That's right.
[32:16] B: I did. I put him in prison.
[32:20] A: Isn't that cool?
[32:21] B: Yeah.
[32:22] A: So he didn't actually get away?
[32:23] B: No. Oh, in the mid. In the moment.
[32:26] A: See, I wonder what it would be like for that earlier. You so close your eyes and let her know that he didn't actually get away. No, he didn't do it to you. But in you getting away got him caught.
[32:42] B: Yes.
[32:42] A: So he's unable to do it to anybody else ever again. That's right. Right. How proud we get to be of her, don't you think?
[32:55] B: Yes.
[32:56] A: Because in doing that got him caught. So he doesn't get to ever do that again to anybody. And it avoided it happening to you.
[33:04] B: Right.
[33:07] A: Right. That's crazy. Amazing. Don't you think, Catherine? My goodness. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Because Jack, what do you notice?
[33:22] B: Calm.
[33:23] A: You are. Right. Even when you think about that. Right? Right. Isn't that cool?
[33:30] B: Yeah. Nice.
[33:32] A: It is nice. Right. It's your unconscious responding to you. Right. And that's what we're doing. We're increasing your mind's responsiveness to you. It's the back brain, the part that beats the heart, the part that breathes, the part that digests food, the part that causes fight, flight, freeze, the part that runs all the automatic. We want that part to work more in the way that you want it to so that you're uptime and emotionally present.
[33:59] B: Right.
[34:00] A: Uptime means I'm now. Right. One of the experiences in the. The homework assignments you're going to have is. Excuse me. To begin to pay attention to what you can notice that's new and different for you in terms of how you react and respond or feel or intensity. Just start to notice the subtle changes that are happening because they're happening. Right. We're making dramatic changes because when you think about something that used to make you feel bad, you can think about it now and try to feel bad. It's not doing it Right. Notice with those two things, it doesn't do the thing.
[34:49] B: No.
[34:50] A: Right. So that's changing the past, completing it. It's also creating a new pattern that you're going to notice things differently than you did.
[35:03] B: Okay?
[35:04] A: Right. Because we don't want you to trust in others. We want you to trust in you. But we need to turn down the amplification of stuff so that you have discernment.
[35:20] B: Right.
[35:22] A: So that their words match their actions.
[35:26] B: Correct.
[35:30] A: That's what you want to pay attention to.
[35:32] B: Right?
[35:33] A: Right. Yeah.
[35:34] B: How do I do this?
[35:35] A: That's what we're doing right now.
[35:37] B: Okay.
[35:38] A: I mean, that's what's getting set up inside.
[35:41] B: Right?
[35:41] A: Right. So again, that other than conscious part can travel back down the timeline of experiences that were negative, growing you younger and earlier. And. And then again bring another moment, my cousin molesting me, that happened when you might have been out five. Five. Right. Good. So we want to get that clear. Right. All we do is we know that you're here now. Right. You can think about that moment then. Right. As you think about that moment, then it causes a discomfort in your body. And where do you feel the discomfort in your body?
[36:14] B: Internally.
[36:15] A: Yeah, but where in your body?
[36:16] B: Like in my.
[36:17] A: You feel it like right here?
[36:18] B: Yeah.
[36:18] A: Right. So just notice the sensations. And see, we never have an embodied experience of the sensations changing when we're in the Problem. But just notice the sensations and know that sensations have to change, even if they don't change fully in the way that you want them to. Yet as you do notice, what are you noticing happening to the sensations?
[36:45] B: They're not as intense.
[36:47] A: Notice how they're not as intense. They've already lightened. Right. You can think about that thing. How do we want you to be? Well, free and present Right now, Not then.
[36:59] B: Right?
[36:59] A: Right. And what's it like when you're now peaceful? It is peaceful, isn't it? Right. And you can see more.
[37:07] B: Right?
[37:07] A: Right. Notice that you can see me, but you see more space now. Now.
[37:12] B: Right?
[37:13] A: Right. Cuz you're present.
[37:15] B: Okay.
[37:16] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[37:18] B: I like that.
[37:18] A: It is really cool. Right. So then think about knowing what he, that cousin did then.
[37:24] B: Okay?
[37:25] A: Right. And you know that when you think about it, there's been that feeling.
[37:29] B: I don't feel it anymore.
[37:30] A: And now you're not feeling it anymore.
[37:32] B: Right.
[37:32] A: Isn't that weird?
[37:34] B: Right?
[37:34] A: Right. Cuz you were feeling it was. Right. But you're not feeling it. Right. And what was it that he did?
[37:41] B: He touched me.
[37:42] A: He touched you where? Like he touched your chest. Did he touch between your legs or just. And did he put his finger in your vagina? Yes, he did all of that. Right?
[37:50] B: Right.
[37:50] A: And then he stopped. Did he have you touch him?
[37:54] B: Yes.
[37:54] A: So he had you touch his penis? Did he put his penis in your mouth?
[37:57] B: No.
[37:58] A: No. But he might have. Did he put his penis in your vagina?
[38:01] B: No.
[38:01] A: No. My hands on your hands. Right. So you touched him, he touched you. Right. And then that stopped.
[38:06] B: Right?
[38:07] A: Right. And even as you're thinking about it, as we just went through it, what do you notice?
[38:11] B: I don't feel anything.
[38:12] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[38:13] B: I like it.
[38:15] A: So do I. Right. Because what's happening is, it's being experienced as data. It's just information about something that happened to my body. And by the way, when that happened in my body, there's no part of my body now that's the same as it was then.
[38:36] B: No.
[38:37] A: So in all actuality he never touched me.
[38:39] B: Right?
[38:41] A: Right. Because I have a vagina and I have a nose and I have two ears and I have 10 toes. But I'm not my nose or my ears, I'm not my fingers, I'm not my vagina. Right. I have it. It's not me.
[38:57] B: It's not me.
[38:58] A: Right. It's mine.
[38:58] B: It's mine.
[38:59] A: But not me.
[39:00] B: But not me.
[39:00] A: Right? Right. So he messed with my stuff.
[39:03] B: He messed with my stuff.
[39:04] A: Right. And for a long time it screwed up thinking and feeling. Yeah. But he never touched me.
[39:11] B: But he never touched me.
[39:12] A: Not who I really am.
[39:13] B: Not who I am.
[39:14] A: Right. He never touched me.
[39:15] B: He never touched me.
[39:16] A: That's right. And see as this gets in again, what do you notice happening to the earlier you?
[39:22] B: She's peaceful.
[39:23] A: She is peaceful. Right. Cuz it's just data about something that happened. Right?
[39:33] B: Right.
[39:34] A: Try to feel like that was your fault. Right. Try to feel like you should have known better.
[39:43] B: I didn't.
[39:45] A: Right. That's right. Isn't that cool? Notice how you're not beating yourself up. Right. Right. Yeah. So that's not hurting. Right. Notice how fast things are changing. Fast. Yeah. Right. Because you're quick. You're getting it.
[40:12] B: I feel like. I am.
[40:13] A: You are. Right. And you're really wanting life to be better.
[40:18] B: I do.
[40:19] A: And you're on a really good track with all the stuff that you can be doing.
[40:23] B: Right.
[40:23] A: You did all of the things that there were for you to do in between then the last time we got together and now.
[40:30] B: Right?
[40:31] A: Right.
[40:32] B: I did.
[40:32] A: I know. That's really cool.
[40:34] B: I did.
[40:35] A: Right? That's right. You did all those things.
[40:42] B: Yeah.
[40:43] A: Right. Because you're worth it. To you.
[40:44] B: I am.
[40:45] A: Yeah.
[40:46] B: I very much am.
[40:48] A: Yeah. So all that stuff that you had been through had contributed to you not feeling like you were good enough or lovable or worthy or. Or.
[41:00] B: Or.
[41:01] A: Got it.
[41:02] B: Got it.
[41:03] A: That's starting to change. Because it was never about being worthy to somebody else.
[41:09] B: I have to be worthy.
[41:10] A: For me it was always about you becoming more okay in you. You lightening up on you. Because you aren't. Those experiences, they're not a part of you. They are things that happened, but they're not a part of who you are. Right. You're not accumulation of all the fucked up shit that you went through. No, no. I mean, I know. Isn't that cool?
[41:36] B: That's refreshing.
[41:37] A: Yeah, I bet. So again that other part's just going to travel again back through those experiences and find another that would be useful to clear.
[41:48] B: I don't know.
[41:50] A: You don't know. That's right. You don't have to know. Your unconscious does know more than you do. Right. So all you have to think about is where are we headed? You present, clear, aware, relaxed, Emotionally present. Informed by what did. Emotionally handling what's happening now now free, lighter on you. Easier to be feeling good as you're doing the things that make sense for you to do. Glad as you think Back about what you've done. High five, baby. That's right. As all of this is happening, the other parts in circles, back down, back right towards a moment where there might be some guilt or disgust or grossness or shame or bad or false or blame or. Right. Ah. What comes to mind?
[43:22] B: My sister's boyfriend, Raymond.
[43:24] A: Oh, that one. That would be useful to get better. Right. You can remember that was how long ago?
[43:31] B: A couple years ago.
[43:32] A: Yeah. Right. And you're aware when it happened?
[43:34] B: In a hotel.
[43:35] A: So you're in a hotel. Right. And was it daytime or nighttime?
[43:37] B: Nighttime.
[43:38] A: Night time. Right. And like, you're sleeping. No, no. You're awake and, like, walking around or sitting on the bed or.
[43:44] B: I was on the bed.
[43:45] A: You're on the bed. Were you playing on the phone or. Right. Good job. And then what happened next?
[43:50] B: My sister asked me if I would have sex with him.
[43:52] A: So your sister's like, hey, would you have sex with. So your sister's there too, and she's in the bed and he's there too.
[43:58] B: Yeah.
[43:58] A: Right. So he's like, hey, will you do this with him?
[44:01] B: Yeah.
[44:02] A: Right. And you said.
[44:04] B: I said, why?
[44:05] A: Why? Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. What happened next? How you doing right now, by the way?
[44:11] B: Good.
[44:12] A: Yeah. You are doing good because you're here. Right. Notice how that's data, information about an experience that happened. Right. Right. So then what happened next?
[44:27] B: I said, okay.
[44:28] A: Right, Right. Good. And then, like, he crawled on top of you.
[44:32] B: Yeah.
[44:33] A: Kissed your body and touched you.
[44:35] B: Brutal.
[44:36] A: It was.
[44:37] B: It was just uncomfortable.
[44:39] A: Well, of course all of that was uncomfortable. Then he put his penis in your vagina and he did that for a period of time, and then he stopped. Right, Right. And then he got off of you.
[44:47] B: Right, Right.
[44:47] A: And then that moment was over. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[44:51] B: Right.
[44:52] A: Like get clean.
[44:53] B: Get clean.
[44:53] A: Right. Get the new job.
[44:54] B: Got a job.
[44:55] A: Right. Get a raise.
[44:56] B: Get a raise.
[44:57] A: Right.
[44:57] B: I got sober.
[44:58] A: That's right. Yes. Right. Got it.
[45:02] B: Got it.
[45:04] A: And again, as you were going through it. Notice. What are you noticing?
[45:07] B: It doesn't bother me.
[45:10] A: So you can remember that happening?
[45:13] B: Yeah.
[45:13] A: Right. You can remember them doing that? Yeah. You can remember putting your hoodie on.
[45:19] B: Yeah.
[45:20] A: Well, stop putting on your hoodie.
[45:21] B: Stop putting on your hoodie.
[45:22] A: Say, I'm not putting on my.
[45:23] B: I'm not putting on my hoodie.
[45:24] A: Stop them from doing that. Say they're not doing that. Well, no, Stop him from doing that.
[45:29] B: Stop doing.
[45:29] A: Say, he's not doing that.
[45:30] B: He's not doing that.
[45:31] A: Right. Stop him from doing it. Go. He's not doing it.
[45:34] B: He's not doing it, I said.
[45:35] A: Then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[45:36] B: It no longer exists.
[45:37] A: That's right. And again. That happening. Did that have anything to do with you?
[45:42] B: No.
[45:43] A: Right. Doesn't. Right. Right. And again. He messed with stuff. He didn't get you.
[45:54] B: No.
[45:55] A: Right. Right. See the. Who you really are. Right. And that light. That is. You can't be touched other than in moments of mutual respect or when you're allowing love in. I'll show you what I mean. Take your hand. Hold it up like that. Right? Maybe a little bit down there. Look at that spot right there. As you look at that spot right there, I'm going to take my hand over here and I'm going to move it towards your hand. As I move my hand in closer towards your hand, you're noticing that as it gets closer, you can begin to feel the energy from my hand.
[46:39] B: Right?
[46:40] A: Right. The energy is getting closer. You can feel it. You can feel the warmth from my hand. You can feel the energy.
[46:48] B: Right.
[46:49] A: See, the coolest part is right now I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body.
[46:59] B: Wow.
[47:00] A: Or hurt your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with mutual respect. Yeah. Right. So you can know that I have a nose, but I'm not my nose. And I have an ass, but I'm not my ass. Right. And that they mess with my stuff, but they never touched who I really am. They never touch. They never got me.
[47:28] B: They never got me.
[47:29] A: That's right. That's right. Take a deep breath in. That's right. As eyes remain closed, that arm can drop down, but only at the same rate in which you drop down deeper and deeper inside towards that cold. That's right. Peaceful. That's right. Easy. That's right. Flowing energy. That's right. The light, the waves is you connecting to even more of who you really are. Life tuning up on you. Seeing things clearly now. Present. That's right. That's right. That's it. That's it. Your unconscious. That's right. Letting you know change is happening inside each one of them. Wiggles. Wiggles. That's right. Twitches is just a way that your unconscious lets you know. Consciously. That's right. That's right. Things are changing. Lifting up inside, things are changing even more lighter. That's right. More clarity. That's right. More freedom. Lightening up space. That's right. And room. That's right. For you to be becoming even More connected to a delight. That is you. That's right. That's right. There you go.
[50:05] B: Whoa.
[50:06] A: Whoa. Right? Yeah. How's your body feeling now?
[50:11] B: Good.
[50:12] A: It is, isn't it? Right.
[50:15] B: New.
[50:17] A: Yeah. New.
[50:19] B: Yes.
[50:19] A: Isn't that cool?
[50:22] B: Wow.
[50:23] A: Right? Things are changing.
[50:27] B: Yeah.
[50:28] A: Yeah. And you're healing.
[50:29] B: I feel like. I am.
[50:31] A: You are. Right.
[50:32] B: I am healing.
[50:33] A: Because think about the thing with cousin. Try to feel really icky and bad. Right. Think about the thing with sister's guy.
[50:39] B: No.
[50:39] A: Right.
[50:41] B: I just don't feel it.
[50:42] A: Right. Think about the thing at 22.
[50:48] B: It doesn't bother me.
[50:50] A: Right, Right. Notice how you're becoming more okay in you.
[50:56] B: Yeah, yeah.
[51:00] A: Yeah. So what are some things currently or what things that you think you're going to encounter that typically would produce the.
[51:10] B: I don't know.
[51:12] A: You don't know.
[51:15] B: I have to set you boundaries.
[51:17] A: Yeah. But what might that look like, you know, if we were like, kind of be thinking about, like. Okay, so notice that we've got all sorts of things that are changing. And see, boundaries are one of these things that we think need to be these firm things that I've got to set.
[51:30] B: Right.
[51:30] A: But what if they're already set?
[51:32] B: They are already set.
[51:33] A: Right. And what if they fluctuate and move based on context, situation in whom I'm with?
[51:41] B: I think that's okay.
[51:42] A: It is okay. Because that's how it's supposed to be.
[51:44] B: Right?
[51:46] A: Right. With different people. We're. We are different. That doesn't mean I'm not being my authentic self with somebody.
[51:52] B: Okay.
[51:53] A: Right. I'm different with my college buddies than I am when I'm just with my wife than I am when I'm with my two daughters.
[52:00] B: Right. Versions.
[52:04] A: They're all different expressions of me.
[52:07] B: All different expressions.
[52:09] A: Right. They're all me being me. I'm not. Not being me when I'm with my kids, but I am being me when I'm with my wife.
[52:14] B: No, it doesn't.
[52:15] A: No. Right. You got it. Like I'm still being me. I'm just me being different. Because I'm different based on who I'm with. We all are.
[52:27] B: It's kind of like when you. You're like one version of yourself or you show one expressions at work than you will when you're around your friends.
[52:36] A: Sure.
[52:37] B: Professional.
[52:38] A: And then it can be that. Right. Or the same thing. I love both my daughters, but I love them differently. I don't love one more than the other, but how I love them is different.
[52:50] B: Different.
[52:51] A: Okay. It's different because how they love Me is different.
[52:54] B: Right.
[52:56] A: So I'm different with them. Everybody. We all have a way that we are that's different.
[53:01] B: Okay.
[53:02] A: Does that make sense?
[53:03] B: Yes.
[53:04] A: Yeah.
[53:05] B: It's okay to be different.
[53:08] A: Of course I like that. Yeah.
[53:14] B: They like me.
[53:15] A: Right? Yeah. As you're connecting to more of who you are, you're liking you.
[53:22] B: Right?
[53:22] A: I am. Right.
[53:25] B: I like who I am.
[53:26] A: Right. You just didn't like problematic ways you acted or felt or thought or reacted.
[53:34] B: Right.
[53:35] A: Right.
[53:36] B: But I'm not them.
[53:37] A: No, I know. It's not cool. Right. You're getting it.
[53:41] B: Right.
[53:41] A: Yeah. And it's making sense.
[53:43] B: It does.
[53:43] A: Right. And that means it's integrating. When change gets embodied, I no longer have to think about it. Right. Most of us don't have to think about how to ride a bicycle because we learned it a long time ago. Or how to tie our sneakers. We just do it.
[54:03] B: We just do it.
[54:04] A: So our brain likes to learn things.
[54:07] B: Right.
[54:07] A: And put it in automatic processing. So I don't need to think about. Right, Right. So the best change is when change becomes embodied. And now I don't have to think about it. I'm just different when the situation arises.
[54:23] B: Right.
[54:24] A: So the same button gets pressed that normally it's pressed, and I'm indifferent. Yeah. Or emotionally appropriate to the situation.
[54:36] B: Right. Emotionally.
[54:38] A: Got it.
[54:39] B: Got it.
[54:40] A: So if it would require a little bit of, you know, understanding, I'm understanding. If it requires a little bit of firmness, I'm firm. If it requires nothing from me, it goes by. Right. Like.
[54:54] B: I like that.
[54:55] A: Like, that's how it's being, like, discerned. That's how I'm determining. That's how my brain is interacting with stuff. Right. So as you think about work and what you've been doing and that things are. Are there things where you find yourself overly anxious or. Let's go back to what you had said with the guy. So.
[55:17] B: Right.
[55:17] A: Think of, like the ex.
[55:19] B: Okay.
[55:21] A: And that ex used to throw soda on you.
[55:24] B: Right.
[55:24] A: It definitely makes me want to stay with him. No, but I did for only until you really got it.
[55:32] B: Until I really got it.
[55:33] A: Right. And then you stopped.
[55:35] B: Stopped.
[55:35] A: Right. Because once it. You really got it.
[55:38] B: Right.
[55:38] A: Right. You were done.
[55:39] B: I was done.
[55:41] A: Right. That's what you said. For the last time, I was done. You're done. Right. You couldn't have been done until you got it.
[55:50] B: Right. But I got it.
[55:54] A: Even if you had hoped you got it sooner.
[55:56] B: I got it now.
[55:58] A: You got it when you got it. And you're done.
[55:59] B: I'm done.
[56:00] A: Now.
[56:01] B: Now.
[56:02] A: Right. Right. So think of him.
[56:07] B: Okay?
[56:08] A: Right. Think of something he normally would do that would cause the stuff in you.
[56:16] B: I can't.
[56:17] A: What's something that he might do that. He used to do that when he did it, it would make you.
[56:22] B: He made me feel stupid.
[56:24] A: Yeah. Like how he might go.
[56:26] B: He'd say, like, I don't know, he'd flip it around on me.
[56:30] A: Right.
[56:31] B: Try to, like, put problems on me.
[56:33] A: Yeah.
[56:33] B: Like it was my fault.
[56:34] A: So you might have brought something up that was an upset to you. And he's like, yeah, but it's because you and you dumb and you should be.
[56:41] B: Right, Right.
[56:42] A: Right. And you can hear him say something like that.
[56:44] B: Right?
[56:44] A: Right. And where do you feel the discomfort?
[56:46] B: In my head.
[56:47] A: You hear. Feel it here. Do you feel it in your body?
[56:49] B: I just feel annoyed.
[56:50] A: You just feel annoyed. Right? Right. Because the annoyance is, who am I learning about?
[56:56] B: Not. Not me.
[56:57] A: No, but back then you thought you were.
[57:00] B: Right.
[57:00] A: Are we learning about you right now? Well, we were learning about him in that experience.
[57:07] B: Right.
[57:09] A: That's what we're learning about. Always other people, never me. Yeah. When I'm interacting with other people, I'm learning about them, right. I'm learning about how they might be feeling about something I said or did.
[57:25] B: Okay.
[57:26] A: But even if I'm learning about how they might be feeling about something I said or did, I'm still learning about them.
[57:32] B: Right.
[57:33] A: Even if they feel angry and call me a fucking asshole, I'm learning that they're feeling I'm a fucking asshole. Does that mean that I'm a fucking asshole? No. Maybe. But, you know, it doesn't have to mean that. Right?
[57:45] B: Right.
[57:47] A: So that's what we want, is a lot of this stuff to be experienced internally.
[57:52] B: Okay.
[57:53] A: As information about them.
[57:55] B: Okay.
[57:56] A: Right.
[57:57] B: Right.
[57:58] A: So how do you want to be when somebody might be saying stuff? Oh, well, like, you're not smart. How else might he say it? Would he say, dumb bitch? Or would he say, no, you're an idiot or you're a moron? Would he say, I don't know? Oh, yeah, you just can't understand this stuff because you're dumb. Like, it's over your head.
[58:18] B: Yeah. He's like, you just don't get it.
[58:20] A: You just don't get it.
[58:21] B: You just don't get it.
[58:22] A: Right?
[58:23] B: Right.
[58:24] A: Right. It's really hard for somebody who's smart to get something that can't make sense because only somebody dumb would think it.
[58:30] B: Right?
[58:32] A: Right.
[58:34] B: Okay. Okay. Right.
[58:38] A: Right.
[58:38] B: It's not a reflection of me.
[58:40] A: No.
[58:43] B: It's them.
[58:44] A: Yeah. And you're really smart.
[58:48] B: Thank you.
[58:48] A: I mean, just check it out. How quickly are you picking this up? How long have we been at this? Like, it is like 50 minutes. Ish.
[58:58] B: Wow.
[58:59] A: Right? Look at how. How far ahead of the game we are.
[59:07] B: I'm really smart.
[59:08] A: I know.
[59:11] B: Whoa. Dang.
[59:13] A: I'm smart, right?
[59:15] B: I'm really smart.
[59:16] A: Yeah.
[59:17] B: I should go back to school.
[59:18] A: See, the thing about smarts is what makes you smart is when you're interested in it.
[59:23] B: Right.
[59:26] A: So that is the superpower of somebody with attention to deficit.
[59:31] B: What's that?
[59:32] A: Attention deficit disorder.
[59:33] B: Oh, add. Okay. Yeah.
[59:35] A: If somebody has that and they didn't do well at school, but they did well at some classes but not well at other classes, it was because the classes they did well didn't stimulate them. The classes they did well, they naturally liked.
[59:47] B: Oh, okay.
[59:48] A: The classes that didn't. They didn't like. So they didn't do well on them. Right, Right. When it's interesting and you're interested, you're all about it. You. You're in action.
[59:58] B: Right?
[59:59] A: Right. All you have been is in action.
[60:02] B: Right?
[60:03] A: Right. I'm interested in getting my life better. Okay. I come to the first session, I'm still kind of entangled a little bit. Okay. What is there to do? I gotta get myself detangled. Right. Okay. I got myself detangled.
[60:16] B: Yeah.
[60:16] A: Right. I got myself set up so that I can get the emotional stuff that keeps me tangled, unplugged and cleared.
[60:25] B: Right.
[60:26] A: So it's no longer running me. Right. So that you get to be more me. Yes. Yeah. And uptime. Now. Present. Present here.
[60:37] B: Yes.
[60:38] A: Right. So the way to be present is to bring your attention and your awareness to what you can notice. That's new. Okay. New in your thoughts, new in your interactions. Okay. New. And how others are. What things are you picking up New. That you weren't picking up before? Okay. Begin to cultivate it. Because that is what has us be in this state of being present.
[61:13] B: What does that mean?
[61:14] A: Decultivate, Cultivate is like how to grow.
[61:18] B: Okay.
[61:18] A: Right, Right. Like it's a. It's a thing where we're. It's like practicing. We're strengthening. We're cultivating the muscles, we're cultivating the garden. So we're making it more robust, bigger. Yeah. We want to begin to strengthen that muscle for you.
[61:37] B: Right.
[61:38] A: Of paying attention to what's new and different.
[61:41] B: Okay.
[61:42] A: Because it causes you to be now.
[61:44] B: Right.
[61:46] A: And that's the way that we're able to maneuver through stuff Better right now? Yeah.
[61:52] B: Present.
[61:52] A: Right, Right. So just check. How's your body feeling now?
[61:58] B: Excited, peaceful, Happy.
[62:01] A: Right.
[62:02] B: Free.
[62:02] A: Right. Right. Good. Yeah.
[62:07] B: I feel like I'm gonna go on an adventure.
[62:10] A: You are.
[62:10] B: I feel it.
[62:11] A: Yeah.
[62:12] B: I'm excited.
[62:13] A: Yeah. So again, think about, you know, that X or some other guy maybe that's similar to that ex that is saying things like, you're just so dumb, you can't get it. Like, this stuff is, like, way over your head. Are you sure you're not a dumb blonde? Mean.
[62:33] B: No, I'm not.
[62:35] A: Right.
[62:36] B: I'm me and you are you.
[62:40] A: Yeah. And that's just idiotic.
[62:43] B: Right?
[62:46] A: Right.
[62:48] B: It's not a reflection of me.
[62:50] A: No. Has nothing to do with you. No. Right. Like that's how we want to be. We want to be more indifferent to it.
[63:04] B: Okay.
[63:05] A: Like that's nonsense.
[63:07] B: Yeah.
[63:07] A: Right here.
[63:08] B: Nor there.
[63:08] A: Like. Right. It's nonsense. Not that we want to get political, but Donald Trump said that Camilla Harris used to call herself Asian, and now she's calling herself black. Right. And she could have got in, could have gotten upset, and her answer was, that's nonsense. Like. Like it's a non thing. Like, it's nonsense. Like, I'm not even addressing it. Like, I don't have to, like, come back. Oh, no, I'm not. Oh, yes, you are. No, I'm not. It's nonsense. Like, nonsense.
[63:39] B: I don't have to entertain it.
[63:40] A: You don't even have to entertain it. Right. Because it's nonsense.
[63:43] B: It's nonsense.
[63:44] A: Right. If some guy says, oh, well, you're too stupid to understand. Right. Right. What I mean, I'm learning about him. This is somebody that I'm not gonna let be with me.
[63:54] B: Right?
[63:56] A: Right. Because if I have a guy that thinks I'm dumb, then that's a guy that I don't want to be with.
[64:02] B: Right. I don't want to be with him.
[64:04] A: Right. Like, you don't get to hang out with me if you don't think I'm dumb.
[64:09] B: Yeah.
[64:10] A: Right.
[64:10] B: Like, it's that easy. Right.
[64:15] A: Right. And that's how it's. We want it to be always for women is as a woman, you hold the keys.
[64:25] B: I hold the keys.
[64:26] A: Mm. So what I mean by that is women who have successful relationships with men are women who hold the keys.
[64:34] B: I feel like I'm a key holder.
[64:36] A: Right. That means no sex before monogamy.
[64:40] B: What does that mean? Before marriage?
[64:43] A: No.
[64:43] B: Oh.
[64:45] A: Before we determine that we're a committed couple.
[64:48] B: Right.
[64:49] A: No sex before that. No. Right. Right. You've Got the goods and women are the regulators.
[65:00] B: Right.
[65:01] A: So what I mean by that is a woman is not an always yes.
[65:06] B: No.
[65:07] A: A woman is a yes when she wants to and a no when she doesn't.
[65:11] B: Right.
[65:12] A: A guy is an always yes.
[65:16] B: Okay.
[65:18] A: Because if the guy is interested in the gal, right? And the gal makes any innuendo that it's possible for us to maybe do a little. I mean, right? It doesn't matter if it's 3:30 in the morning and he's got to be up early. Hey, I'm really horny. Would you like. Yes. There's not a single time that he goes, no, I'm too tired. No, no, no. Right, right. So she's a no when she doesn't try to wake her up at 3:30. Get it away from me. Ew, God. What's wrong with you? Right, Right. So one of you in the relationship needs to be the regulator.
[65:57] B: Okay?
[65:57] A: One of you in the relationship also needs to be the one that's the chaser.
[66:04] B: Okay.
[66:05] A: And that's not the woman?
[66:06] B: No.
[66:07] A: So a female never runs after a male. A female never runs after the female panther, even when she's in heat. Doesn't run down a male panther telling him to her. No, no. She lets him know, you can approach me, cuz you approach me when I don't want you to.
[66:27] B: Right?
[66:29] A: Right.
[66:30] B: Right.
[66:31] A: So that's what the female panther lets him know. I'm approachable, but he needs to work to get me. Even with goats, they chase, Right. The female Goku says, hey, want a little? And then she lets him move a little bit closer and then she takes off.
[66:45] B: Right.
[66:46] A: So that's the nature of the attraction. One is the lean in and move away get you to follow, Right? Right. The Lord doesn't chase the fish.
[66:58] B: Right?
[66:58] A: Right. But I have say as a woman, I'm the regulator. I'm the one that determines the where and the when and the with whom and the how much and the how often. Right. And the what kind? Not him. Right?
[67:16] B: Right.
[67:17] A: I got the good, I've got the goods. Right.
[67:20] B: I'm the keyboard.
[67:21] A: Yes, you've got the goods. Because if a guy is interested in you, he absolutely likes the package, right? Right. So you've got the goods. We already know that you're not your body. No, but if he likes you, he definitely likes your body too, right? Right. For a woman it's not just that, but for a guy, that's primary, Right? It's why you can say to a guy, I've got the 10 characteristics that you wanted in a woman, and he's still going to ask you, yeah, but what does she look like?
[67:50] B: Where?
[67:50] A: If you told a woman, I got the 10 characteristics of the guy that you wanted, she says, cool, when are we get to go out?
[67:56] B: Right. So true.
[67:58] A: You follow me with that? Right. So it's also about training the guy in how I want to be treated.
[68:06] B: Right? Training.
[68:08] A: Right. It's training him how I want to be treated that he needs to open the door for me.
[68:13] B: Right?
[68:14] A: Right. That I get off the phone or the text just a little bit earlier than he would want to. I'm a little bit busier than he would want me to be. Right. I teach him that if he wants to go out with me and take me on a date on Friday, he needs to ask me on Tuesday, Wednesday at the latest. If he waits till Thursday or Friday, I'm busy. Even if I have no plans.
[68:39] B: Right.
[68:41] A: Even if it means I sit home not doing anything.
[68:44] B: Right. I'm doing this. Right.
[68:48] A: So happy. I'm doing so good.
[68:51] B: Oh, geez, I'm so proud of myself.
[68:54] A: Got it, Got it. Like that's how it works. Cause she has say, I have say.
[69:01] B: Wow.
[69:03] A: When a woman hands the keys to the guy, he drives recklessly and she gets hurt.
[69:08] B: Right. Can't give him the keys.
[69:10] A: Right. You hold the keys. If there's a place that you want to go eat, you let him know this is where you want to go. If you don't care, you give him a few places that you'd be okay going to.
[69:21] B: Okay?
[69:24] A: Right, Right. Cuz that way he doesn't pick a place that you don't want to go to.
[69:28] B: Right.
[69:29] A: If you care and you really want to go here you go. I'd really love to go to this place. If you don't care. Well, I'd like to go here, here or here.
[69:35] B: Right.
[69:36] A: And now he gets to pick.
[69:37] B: Right.
[69:38] A: But there's still picks within where you would want to go.
[69:41] B: Right?
[69:42] A: Makes sense.
[69:43] B: Yes.
[69:44] A: Right. Maybe he's a big seafood person and loves oysters. Right. And he's like, well, we're going to the Anna Maria Oyster bar. You know, you're like, so that's why if you're going out, well, you know, I'd like to try here, here and here. Or if there's a place. I heard about this place. I'd love to go to this place. Okay, that makes sense.
[70:08] B: Yes.
[70:09] A: Right, Right. It's not about going Dutch.
[70:14] B: What's Dutch?
[70:16] A: You pay. He pays. Oh, you pay your own part. No, it's Chivalry. He pays. You can offer to, you know, pay the tip or offer. Offer to take care of you, but like he pays. He's the guy. That's how it's supposed to work.
[70:30] B: Okay. I struggle with that one a little.
[70:36] A: Yeah? How so?
[70:38] B: Cuz I'm just. I feel like I just, I don't like when people pay for me.
[70:45] A: I don't know why I do.
[70:47] B: I do too.
[70:49] A: So I wonder what it would be like if that was freed up for you. Because again, what it is is that's something that's structurally similar. Right, right, right. There was an obligation out of being paid for. I needed to perform a service.
[71:05] B: Right, right. It's like you get me your.
[71:10] A: Right, right. That's not about performing a service. That's, you know, going out to dinner. I know, Right, right. So that whole thing where there's that discomfort about that, that's gonna take you back. Right. Because feel it. Think about, you know, okay, well, you know, if somebody pays for me, it means bothers me. Right. Well, now they owe. Now I owe them.
[71:36] B: I don't.
[71:38] A: Right, right.
[71:41] B: I have say.
[71:43] A: Right. We all know that. But now let's get to the feeling, the discomfort. Where do you feel it? In your body.
[71:48] B: Internally.
[71:49] A: Yeah. Where? In your chest. So notice the sensations. Be curious about how the sensations are going to change. And your shoulder. So just notice where you're feeling it. Right. And now just pay attention to how the sensations are going to change. Get curious and make the sound of curiosity go. Hmm. Yeah. I get really curious. How are those sensations changing? Right. And what do you begin noticing happening to those sensations?
[72:21] B: They get lighter.
[72:22] A: They're getting lighter. Right. And what if you lightened up on you. Right. And as the sensations are getting lighter, how's your body feeling now? Right, right. And as your body's relaxed, think about, you know, I mean, there was a time where like I was. I had to perform services. So even if I went out on a. What do they call them? A gfe? Is that what it's called? Yeah, yeah. So good.
[72:59] B: Something like that. That's it.
[73:03] A: Right. And maybe I did go to dinner, but it wasn't. I wasn't being taken out to dinner.
[73:08] B: No.
[73:09] A: I was.
[73:09] B: Sooner service.
[73:10] A: Correct. Right, right. They're not the same thing. No, Right.
[73:18] B: Not getting paid.
[73:20] A: That's right. No, it's not the same thing. Because just check it out. Even if you'd gone to dinner, it wasn't about going to dinner. No, right. That just came with the package of. Right, right.
[73:30] B: Nonsense.
[73:31] A: Right, right. Used to be how you know, the old porn was done versus just the scenes.
[73:38] B: Right.
[73:39] A: I got a whole like lead up to the experience. Right, Right. So now as you're seeing it, just check, think it, you know, you might be going out with a guy that like you've gone out with a couple times. And now we might take you to a nice restaurant. You might even be dressed up.
[73:59] B: Okay.
[74:00] A: Right.
[74:00] B: That's okay.
[74:01] A: It. Well, just check. Well, we want to just check whether it is okay yet or not.
[74:05] B: Okay.
[74:06] A: So just check inside. Think about it. Might even be one of those things that you get dressed up.
[74:11] B: I'm excited.
[74:12] A: Right.
[74:14] B: I'm happy.
[74:15] A: Yeah. You know, it might be a fairly expensive place. And so, you know, the bill comes and know he's taking the.
[74:22] B: I still don't have to perform a service.
[74:25] A: Right. Well, he's taking the card like he's putting down his card to pay.
[74:29] B: Okay, that's okay.
[74:30] A: And what do you know? Well, I just check.
[74:32] B: Okay.
[74:33] A: Here, check inside. How are you feeling? Does it feel okay or is it there some.
[74:39] B: No, it's okay.
[74:40] A: Isn't that interesting?
[74:42] B: Yeah.
[74:43] A: Notice how you're not feeling the right. Right. Does that mean after that dinner that you have to go and you know, give him a blowjob?
[74:54] B: No.
[74:55] A: Right, right, right. Because where we are with things is no sex before monogamy. There's two rules that I thought was really fun. There was this lady on TV a long time ago called the millionaire matchmaker.
[75:11] B: Okay.
[75:12] A: Patty something and others. She's a funny gal, but she had two rules that were really important rules. And the first rule was no sex before monogamy.
[75:21] B: Right.
[75:21] A: Because why buy the cow if I can get the milk for free?
[75:24] B: Right.
[75:24] A: And the second one for women is infer men too drink maximum.
[75:31] B: Right?
[75:31] A: No, more like you don't get shit faced.
[75:34] B: No.
[75:35] A: Right. Because then you lose control.
[75:37] B: Right?
[75:38] A: Right. You have say, I have say. Right? It's yours, it's mine. Right. You are the key holder. Right. He gets to pursue Chase. Right. You're the object of desire in the relationship. One of you needs to be the prettier one. And it's supposed to be you.
[75:56] B: Okay. I'm pretty, I'm pretty.
[76:00] A: I'm the pretty one, Right. In every relationship, you're supposed to be the prettier one.
[76:05] B: I am.
[76:06] A: Right. Not the guy. Even if he's a good looking guy. Right. But the gal's the prettier one always. Right? Got it?
[76:16] B: Got it.
[76:18] A: Right. And that's why she has say.
[76:21] B: I have say.
[76:22] A: Right.
[76:23] B: I have Say.
[76:25] A: And she's the regulator because she doesn't need a guy. No. Right, Right. She needs a guy as much as a fish needs a bicycle. Not at all.
[76:34] B: No.
[76:35] A: A woman has a body part. Sole purpose is sexual pleasure.
[76:39] B: Right.
[76:39] A: And that wasn't designed. The penis wasn't even designed for that. I mean, to me. But she's got a body part. That's all it does. It's cause orgasms. Right, Right. She doesn't need him. No. Right, Right. Right. She doesn't need him to take care of her.
[76:53] B: No.
[76:54] A: However, she trains him.
[76:57] B: Right.
[76:57] A: Because when he does caretaking, it feels really good.
[77:00] B: It does.
[77:01] A: Right. So when he's chivalrous, when he opens the door, when he's polite, when he's mannerful.
[77:07] B: Right. He's good.
[77:12] A: Right. And that's what you're paying attention to.
[77:16] B: Right.
[77:18] A: Do his actions match how he speaks?
[77:26] B: Determine that.
[77:27] A: And that's what you're gonna be noticing and paying attention because that will be what helps you determine where you go and what you do.
[77:37] B: Right.
[77:39] A: Right. And it's always changing. So the deal in life is not to be worried about making the right decision as that there's a right decision. It's about making the decision. Right.
[77:52] B: Making the decision. Right.
[77:54] A: Right. That once you make it, you steer your course.
[77:57] B: Right.
[77:59] A: Yeah. So again, check inside. What are you noticing now?
[78:06] B: Freedom. Peace.
[78:08] A: Yeah.
[78:10] B: I'm moving forward.
[78:11] A: You are?
[78:14] B: I'm excited. I'm not who I used to be. This is me.
[78:22] A: Try to feel, you know, those feelings, how I used to be. Think that was me?
[78:34] B: I don't feel anything.
[78:36] A: Right. I know.
[78:45] B: I'm not.
[78:46] A: What happened? No. What's the guy's name? Is it Bernie? Bernard? Bernie. Bernie, yeah. Weekend at Bernie's. Right, Right.
[78:55] B: Just a face.
[78:56] A: Nonsense. Doesn't matter. Right. Yeah. There you go. That's right. Yeah. That's right. Good job.
[79:26] B: Thank you.
[79:27] A: Yeah. Notice how things are changing.
[79:31] B: Right?
[79:32] A: Right. Notice how different you're feeling. You feel new. Me too. Isn't that cool?
[79:41] B: Yeah.
[79:42] A: Yeah. Yeah. So where have you been working? That's a 9 to 5 job.
[79:48] B: My dad's painting company.
[79:50] A: Cool.
[79:51] B: I'm an office manager.
[79:53] A: Really?
[79:53] B: Yeah.
[79:53] A: Okay. That's great. Where. Where is that? Down.
[79:56] B: Venice.
[79:57] A: In Venice. Okay. Very cool. So he has more than himself. He has other painters.
[80:04] B: He's got six crews.
[80:05] A: Holy cow. That's a lot.
[80:06] B: It's so annoying.
[80:07] A: It's so annoying. Right back. Yeah, it's a lot.
[80:10] B: It's a lot.
[80:11] A: So do you have to manage, like, where and which residents? And does he do both.
[80:15] B: Inside, outside, inside, interior, exterior.
[80:17] A: Oh, man, that's a lot.
[80:19] B: It's a lot.
[80:19] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[80:23] B: Because I do it. It's kind of slow right now. It's season. It's not season. You know, a lot of snowbirds are up north.
[80:29] A: Not only that, we. If you're trying to paint anything outside, this has not been the time to do it because we get rain every day. Every day and a lot. We have been getting a lot of rain.
[80:39] B: Yeah.
[80:40] A: Never experienced the amount of flood stuff that's happened.
[80:43] B: Oh, I know. I'm in Sarasota, and it's like I'm in a halfway house, and we lost one of our halfway houses.
[80:50] A: It got flooded.
[80:50] B: It got flooded.
[80:51] A: Oh, yeah. My neighborhood. In the other side of my neighborhood, if we were in the other side, like, a dozen houses were completely underwater. I'm like.
[81:01] B: Right.
[81:03] A: I'm glad we're on this side. Our road had water, and what was really. If I had had a kayak, it would have been really cool because there was no distinction between any of the retention ponds and the road and the river. Everything was together. So, like, that would have been really cool. Elevated, where our road goes up, over, and then it's up a little bit higher, and then our driveway is slanted, and it's two steps to the.
[81:29] B: Okay, so you got a little.
[81:30] A: And thankfully, three years ago, we redid the back because our back used to get flooded just with a light rain, and we. But even then, the back got like. Yeah. I mean, we have a whole way to. It sends it back down to the front of the house. I mean, it was just too much. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So let's check. Think about the stuff. Think about the stuff at 22. Think about the thing with cousin. Think about the thing with Bernie.
[82:01] B: It's just there.
[82:01] A: Right.
[82:03] B: It's just nonsense.
[82:04] A: Yeah.
[82:06] B: Not who I am today.
[82:07] A: Right. You know, you're dumb. You don't pick things up very well.
[82:10] B: I don't care.
[82:11] A: It's nonsense.
[82:12] B: It's nonsense. Yeah. I like it.
[82:17] A: Right.
[82:17] B: It's good.
[82:19] A: Right.
[82:20] B: It's just there. It doesn't bother me.
[82:23] A: That's right.
[82:23] B: It's not who I am.
[82:24] A: Right, Right. It's nonsense. Right, Right. That's why it's a perfect examination. Oh, she used to claim that if she's Asian, how she claims she's back. Okay. That's nonsense. Like, Right.
[82:38] B: I'm not. They don't know me.
[82:42] A: Right. It's not about me.
[82:44] B: It's about them.
[82:45] A: Yeah. Notice how clear that is. So Think of, like, another situation that you might encounter.
[82:51] B: Okay.
[82:52] A: Like, maybe it's at work. Do you get people who are pissed and.
[82:54] B: Yes.
[82:55] A: Angry yeller.
[82:55] B: Yeah.
[82:56] A: Okay. Like, what's something that might show up that normally, like, stresses you out?
[83:01] B: Trying to get an email from someone.
[83:03] A: What does that mean?
[83:04] B: Like, I'm trying to get their email to put in. I'm doing data entry right now for all the old files.
[83:09] A: Got it. Right.
[83:09] B: And if the customer is not happy and they want to vent about.
[83:14] A: Yeah.
[83:14] B: The job. They did. I just.
[83:17] A: Yeah. So you. You called them up.
[83:19] B: Yeah.
[83:20] A: And you're trying to get their. Hey, just checking in on the thing. Want to get your email?
[83:25] B: Yeah.
[83:26] A: Follow up on.
[83:27] B: I'm just calling to. Well, I say my name. You want me to go through the whole.
[83:34] A: Well, you say your name. But then we get to the person and they go.
[83:36] B: Oh. They go. Oh. You know, they didn't clean up. They didn't. I don't know.
[83:43] A: Just. Yeah. So I. You know, we're. I mean, the painting's fine, but they didn't, like, they didn't take care.
[83:49] B: At the end of the day, there.
[83:50] A: Was some still tape on the wall. They missed a hole. Right. They didn't take care of. And it didn't look the way that we thought they'd look when they would leave. It was unprofessional. Right, Right. So when they're saying something like that, how do you want to be indifferent? Yeah. Yeah. Who are you learning?
[84:07] B: It's not about me.
[84:08] A: It isn't about you at all, is it?
[84:10] B: No.
[84:10] A: No.
[84:11] B: It's not about me.
[84:12] A: Right, Right.
[84:13] B: How can I fix it?
[84:15] A: Yeah. Or, like, just understand it. Wow. So let me make sure that I'm following you. They didn't get the hole and they left, you know, some material, and that's definitely not how we want to be represented as a company. I very greatly appreciate that feedback, and I will get that to the, you know, boss man.
[84:38] B: That's easy.
[84:39] A: Right. It's not about you, but what your job is. When somebody says that kind of stuff is to say back to them as much as you can say back to them that you heard them say.
[84:53] B: Right. Okay.
[84:55] A: Right. Thank them for their feedback.
[84:58] B: Thank them.
[84:59] A: We want to be better. We want to be really sorry that that occurred for you that way. Yeah. Does that make sense?
[85:08] B: Yes.
[85:09] A: Yeah. So I hear you. Yeah. You're just letting them know that you're hearing because it's not about you.
[85:16] B: It's not about me.
[85:17] A: Right, Right. So again, you know, wipe that out. Think you Might be at work.
[85:21] B: Okay.
[85:22] A: Right. And you're calling.
[85:23] B: Hello.
[85:23] A: Hey, how you doing? And from so and so. And just wanted to check in. I need to get your email address. Yeah, well, I'm really annoyed that, you know, there's one of the rooms. They didn't even get one of the walls that they were supposed to paint. And how can I get easy or for you? Well, first we want to hear them. Right.
[85:40] B: Oh, yeah. I'm sorry that they missed the wall.
[85:42] A: How can I. I'll get in touch. Wow. Okay. Thank you so much for that.
[85:48] B: Right.
[85:49] A: I'm so sorry that we'll make that right. I'll make sure we get to somebody right away.
[85:54] B: We'll get to somebody right away.
[85:56] A: Right.
[85:57] B: Okay. Let's do one more.
[86:00] A: Got it, Got it. Yeah. So again, like, you're at work, you know, when you're calling somebody up and trying to get additional information and email address for them and, you know, you're telling them who you're with and, you know, they might say, well, you know, it was great, but, you know, they left some empty paint cans around the yard and, you know, a paintbrush. I don't know why they would leave this here. And how many paint cans did they leave?
[86:21] B: And do you know where they left paintbrush at? Will come and somebody send somebody out there to pick it up.
[86:26] A: Yeah, but see what you're doing too quickly. What is you're trying to solve their problem. They can't hear the solution when they're still troubled.
[86:38] B: Okay.
[86:39] A: So even if you have a good solution, they can't really hear it.
[86:42] B: Right.
[86:43] A: What you want to say back to them is what you heard, their gripe.
[86:48] B: Was, okay, I'm sorry they left the paper.
[86:51] A: So what I'm. So. Let me make sure I get this.
[86:53] B: Okay. Let me make sure. Sure I get this.
[86:57] A: We had some of our painters leave some paint cans and paintbrushes at your house. So. Yeah. Right. So that's what I'm understanding. And. And I appreciate, again, I appreciate that feedback for our company. You know, if they're still there, I can send somebody out. Or did you, you know, if you. Now I already threw them away. I'm just, you know, know, would have thought that they would have cleaned up. Thank you very much for that feedback. We're interested in getting better as a company.
[87:28] B: Right. We're interested in getting better as a company.
[87:32] A: Right.
[87:33] B: Thank you for your feedback.
[87:35] A: Yeah. And what you want to say is whatever their gripe is, you've got to say it back to them so that they are Understanding that you heard them.
[87:46] B: Okay.
[87:47] A: Because they're upset most of the time is people aren't ever heard.
[87:51] B: Right.
[87:52] A: Like, nobody really hears me. So if the person on the other end hears what I'm saying and says back to me, asking for clarification, like, is this what I. This is what I heard you say. Did I get it right? That person feels validated.
[88:07] B: Right.
[88:08] A: And sometimes that's all they need.
[88:11] B: Right.
[88:12] A: Is to be heard. Got it. So if you call somebody up and you're asking them for that stuff and they're like, well, here's my email address, you know? And, you know, I. Whatever. There's drop cloths that were left behind the house. I know they were trying to get out real fast, and, you know, it seemed like at the end, they, you know, didn't have. As they were just slapping it on the wall. And I don't feel like it looks as good as it did when they first started.
[88:46] B: Okay, so let me get this straight. Hold on.
[88:51] A: Yeah, you're doing it. Okay.
[88:54] B: They left drop. Oh. Let me get this straight for feedback. Thank you. No, let me.
[89:01] A: You're doing good.
[89:01] B: Okay.
[89:03] A: So I want to make sure I'm hearing what you said.
[89:05] B: I want to make sure I'm hearing what you said. So they left some drop cloths. It seemed like they were in a hurry. They were just splattering the paint on the walls. Thank you for your feedback.
[89:18] A: Yeah. And it doesn't seem like it looks as good as the other side.
[89:21] B: It doesn't seem like it looks as good as the other side.
[89:24] A: Yeah, I'll get. Wow. Okay. That's totally not who we are as a company. Thank you for that feedback.
[89:32] B: Thank you for your feedback.
[89:33] A: I will get that up the ladder and somebody will get out there.
[89:36] B: I will get that up the ladder and somebody will get out there.
[89:39] A: Something to that extent. Right. So it's. It's doing your best to say back to them what you heard them say.
[89:46] B: Right. It's think before you respond.
[89:50] A: It's having them feel heard. So the only way they know that you heard them is that you said back to them what they said to you. You can think you heard them. Right, but you didn't hear them if they didn't feel you heard them.
[90:11] B: Right.
[90:13] A: Got it. If you're like, no, I get it. And they're like, you don't get it. Guess what?
[90:17] B: I don't get it.
[90:17] A: Yeah.
[90:19] B: Customer's always right.
[90:21] A: Well, that. Yeah, that's part of it. Right, Right. It's not just that the customer's Always. Right. What time do we got here? Okay, we're good. We are so far ahead of time. My goodness is fantastic.
[90:32] B: That's okay. That means I took the day off and I can go and lay out.
[90:38] A: Right. Like, I mean, things are going well.
[90:40] B: I feel good.
[90:42] A: Right. So again, think about being at work and you know what's another stressful situation that happens at work?
[90:48] B: I get bored. That's not really stressful though. That's just bored.
[90:53] A: What do you do when you're bored?
[90:54] B: I listen to music.
[90:55] A: Okay.
[90:56] B: Or I like find something to do because I work at my parents house and I need hours. So I'll find something to fill my time with. Like it doesn't take me long to.
[91:05] A: Do the office work, like vacuum or vacuum.
[91:09] B: Pick the weeds, play with the animals.
[91:12] A: Yeah.
[91:12] B: Just do something to get hours, you know, I want to feel useful.
[91:16] A: Yeah. Do you listen to podcasts?
[91:19] B: I should more. I should stop listening to the music.
[91:22] A: I don't know whether that's true.
[91:23] B: No, it's good. Podcasts are good. I want to learn new things.
[91:27] A: Well, only if they're of interest.
[91:29] B: Only if they're of interest. This is true. Only if it's benefiting and educating.
[91:36] A: Well, if it's an interest of yours, it'll be easier to do it.
[91:40] B: Right.
[91:41] A: So in life we're supposed to follow some of our interests in doing a job that we can get really good at doing.
[91:56] B: Right?
[91:56] A: Right. The most successful people, the people who make the most amount of money in the world got really, really, really, really good at doing one thing. Something making money specializing.
[92:09] B: Oh.
[92:10] A: Because they're in all sorts of different industries.
[92:12] B: Right.
[92:12] A: Whether it be tech or housing or the people who got really good at doing. Got really success. Got really good at doing one thing.
[92:20] B: Right.
[92:22] A: So you, as you're thinking about it, you know, looking into, I wonder what it would be like to take a adult ed class at like for free. That I can. Cuz we're in Sarasota County.
[92:34] B: What's that?
[92:35] A: Adult education. So it's Sarasota. What do they call it? Suncoast. Sarasota County Adult Education.
[92:41] B: Okay.
[92:42] A: And there's multitudes of different classes that you can take for free.
[92:47] B: Really? Yeah, I want to do that.
[92:49] A: That you could do it remotely or virtually.
[92:51] B: Okay.
[92:52] A: Right. And you could do it in downtime. From when I'm at work.
[92:57] B: When I'm at work. Right. That would be good.
[93:01] A: Right. So I'm still getting that stuff handled.
[93:04] B: Right.
[93:05] A: But I also have like. Okay, so from 10 to 12 I'm gonna work on my school interest. Yeah.
[93:14] B: I want to look at that.
[93:15] A: So it's called ace, and it's through Suncoast, so adult continuing education.
[93:21] B: Okay.
[93:22] A: And there's tons of free classes. Let me see. Hold on.
[93:41] B: Okay.
[93:55] A: All right, let's see if I can go to her. No. What am I looking up?
[94:07] B: Ace.
[94:08] A: Ace. That's it. I tell you. Get into a thing. Yeah, there it is. Adult and community enrichment. And they have a ton of programs and lots of stuff online at Suncoast Technical College. So that's. That's certainly something. Just look up ACE Sarasota.
[94:44] B: I'm gonna look it up right now. I like learning.
[94:53] A: Yeah.
[95:00] B: On Google.
[95:02] A: Yeah. Type in Ace. Ace Sarasota, and a search and it'll come up.
[95:10] B: Okay, I see it. Adult and community enrichment.
[95:16] A: Right. If you go to course catalog, it says adult enrichment. And there, fall 24 calendar.
[95:28] B: But where do I click?
[95:45] A: Give me one second. This is my wife calling. Okay, that's fine.
[95:48] B: Okay.
[95:49] A: All right. So check in.
[95:52] B: I'm so happy right now.
[95:54] A: Yeah.
[95:54] B: I'm tired, though.
[95:55] A: I would imagine.
[95:56] B: I'm very tired.
[95:57] A: Yeah. There's been a lot of therapy done.
[95:59] B: I feel it.
[96:00] A: Yeah.
[96:01] B: I'm excited, though.
[96:03] A: Yeah. Right. So think about somebody calling. You're calling somebody at work, and they might be telling you about something that they didn't like about.
[96:12] B: Okay.
[96:13] A: Right. And whatever it is, you're just saying back to them what you heard them say.
[96:18] B: I heard. Just say back what I heard.
[96:21] A: Right, Right. Even when they say something nice. Yeah. And I just wanted to say, while we had a really great experience with your crew, the guys were timely. They were out of the house. They picked up after themselves. It was really great.
[96:39] B: Well, thank you for your feedback. I'm happy that our crews were on time. They got to the job done in a timely manner, and they were professional.
[96:47] A: Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Right. Got it. Same thing. Same thing. Right. Neither one of them are about you.
[96:56] B: No.
[96:56] A: You're learning about the crews. Right, Right. Which is useful. Useful because if crews aren't doing the right stuff, dad needs to know.
[97:05] B: Dad's got. Dad's got to correct it.
[97:09] A: That's right.
[97:09] B: Still not about me.
[97:11] A: No.
[97:12] B: Right.
[97:13] A: Dad needs to know.
[97:14] B: Dad needs to know.
[97:15] A: Right. Because dad's the one that's putting these people. That's right.
[97:20] B: Right. Okay. Just feedback.
[97:23] A: Right. It's just feedback. Right.
[97:26] B: Having them be here.
[97:28] A: Right. So think about, you know, you know, might. Might go out with the guy and, you know, he might take it to dinner or lunch, and, you know, as the bill comes or what have you. He's gonna pay.
[97:38] B: He is.
[97:39] A: Yeah. And what do you notice?
[97:41] B: That's okay.
[97:42] A: Yeah. Hand job's got to be in the car after.
[97:46] B: No, it doesn't work like that.
[97:50] A: That's right.
[97:51] B: It's not normal. That's great.
[97:56] A: Right? Right. Notice how different that is.
[98:00] B: Right.
[98:01] A: Right.
[98:01] B: It's good though.
[98:02] A: It is. That's how it's supposed to. Right.
[98:06] B: That's okay.
[98:07] A: Right. That you can be treated for dinner.
[98:09] B: Right.
[98:10] A: Right.
[98:10] B: There's no expectations.
[98:12] A: Right. Okay.
[98:14] B: This is normal.
[98:16] A: This is healthy. Yeah. Yeah.
[98:21] B: Unless I see different.
[98:23] A: Right. Right.
[98:27] B: Be aware.
[98:27] A: It's about being aware in a relaxed way.
[98:34] B: It's not a defensive way.
[98:36] A: Right. So think of even an athlete, you know, there's three seconds left and the play is being called and he's gotta catch the ball and.
[98:45] B: Right.
[98:46] A: Do we want them all tense and nervous?
[98:48] B: No.
[98:48] A: Or do we want him clear, present. Right. Awareness. That's right. Yeah. Right. Because notice just what happened there. You just integrated with that nice deep breath in. In that nice long exhale process. Yeah. The deep breath in. In the long exhale helps down regulate the nervous system.
[99:24] B: Right.
[99:25] A: Right. So you settle down inside. And when your body starts to settle it quiet your mind.
[99:32] B: Right.
[99:33] A: Right.
[99:35] B: It's okay to feel feelings.
[99:39] A: We want to feel feelings.
[99:40] B: We want to feel.
[99:41] A: Right.
[99:43] B: Feelings are not how I react.
[99:47] A: Well. Yeah. So let's think of something else that might show up for you. That normally is a worry. Concern, relapse, Relapse.
[99:56] B: That doesn't really pop up for me.
[99:59] A: Yeah.
[99:59] B: But it's always a concern.
[100:01] A: Well, it's supposed to be.
[100:02] B: Right.
[100:03] A: Right.
[100:04] B: But I don't have to dwell on it.
[100:06] A: No.
[100:07] B: Have to fixate and consume me.
[100:09] A: Right. Right. But it helps be aware. Yes. Because it helps me steer my course. Right. So I'm not around people or locations or places that'll trigger me. That not just will trigger me. That frequented drug use.
[100:30] B: Right. I have no business around them.
[100:33] A: Like, I'm not hanging out with those same people.
[100:36] B: No.
[100:36] A: I'm not doing those same things. Things.
[100:38] B: I'm not. I'm not those things.
[100:41] A: Right.
[100:41] B: I'm me.
[100:42] A: Right. Yeah. Yeah.
[100:46] B: Right. Okay.
[100:50] A: Right. That's right. There we go. Yeah. And it's getting in. Right. So how are you with your sister now?
[101:04] B: My sister?
[101:05] A: Yeah. I don't know, because you said that there. You said your sister and there was a boyfriend of yours that screwed your sister. There was a sister that. Her boyfriend.
[101:17] B: Sister.
[101:20] A: Okay.
[101:22] B: Yeah.
[101:24] A: How long ago was that?
[101:26] B: Five months ago.
[101:27] A: Five months ago. Okay. How are you with that she's not suffering anymore.
[101:33] B: I'm okay.
[101:34] A: Okay. Okay. When you think about finding out, like how you found out, is there still discomfort?
[101:43] B: No.
[101:44] A: Okay.
[101:45] B: I'm sad, but she was really not in a good place.
[101:50] A: Okay.
[101:52] B: I feel like peace. It's amazing she made it as long as she did.
[102:01] A: Yeah.
[102:02] B: Yeah.
[102:03] A: She wasn't well.
[102:04] B: No, she was. She was extremely bad on fentanyl and crack.
[102:11] A: Who am I?
[102:12] B: She was just an active prostitute. That's what her life consisted of.
[102:16] A: Yeah.
[102:16] B: Doing drugs, doing dates and getting high. That's it. She didn't have a life.
[102:23] A: Yeah.
[102:24] B: It was sad, but she's not suffering anymore.
[102:28] A: No.
[102:28] B: She could have had it different. Many times she just was consumed.
[102:34] A: Right.
[102:34] B: But I get to do it for both of us.
[102:37] A: Oh, isn't that cool?
[102:38] B: Right?
[102:39] A: Yeah. So do you sense and feel her with you?
[102:41] B: Always.
[102:42] A: Always.
[102:43] B: Yeah.
[102:43] A: Yeah.
[102:44] B: But it's different now.
[102:45] A: Right.
[102:46] B: It's like she's not actually with me.
[102:48] A: Right.
[102:49] B: And not around me.
[102:50] A: Right. Cuz she didn't ever leave here. No. Right. See, I have a thought that when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop.
[102:58] B: No.
[102:59] A: That their bodies stop.
[103:00] B: I feel closer to her now, actually.
[103:02] A: Yeah. And they exited. Right? Right. Okay. Right. She wasn't. Right. Her body. I had a woman one time tell me that her parents. She said it in this like really, like, secretive way, you know, my parents are in my closet. She goes, no, no, the remains of my parents.
[103:27] B: Oh.
[103:28] A: And I said to her, that's not even what remains of your parents.
[103:31] B: No.
[103:32] A: What remains of your parents is in the experiences that you acquired in being with them. And you can't lose them. Right. Because there are a lot more moments before she got hooked in that way then there are moments when she was hooked in that way.
[103:52] B: Right.
[103:53] A: Make sense. Right. Right. And she's no longer hurting. She's at peace. Which is why you get to feel okay. Because any amount of sadness or hurting was out of love for her but not serving her. Right.
[104:17] B: Just enabler.
[104:20] A: No, flip it around on this one. So you being sad is proof positive how much she means.
[104:31] B: Okay.
[104:32] A: But you're hurting. Feeling sad isn't helping her. Or you. Meaning she's not better off when knowing that when you think about her, you feel sad. And you're not better off thinking about her and feeling sad, even though the sad feeling is coming out of love.
[104:51] B: Right. I should be happy. I got to love her for the time I did.
[104:56] A: Yes. And that she's not gone. She's right here. You don't Pick her up like you used to. But our five senses are limited in what we're able to experience. Got it. So because our five senses are limited, there are things going on around us that we don't experience or feel but know are happening.
[105:26] B: Right.
[105:27] A: Like radio waves. We can go to your car, we can turn on 933 and listen to today's hit music. Right, but the radio waves were there before we turned on.
[105:41] B: Right.
[105:42] A: But we don't feel them.
[105:43] B: No, no, we hear them.
[105:46] A: I blow a whistle. No, we. We don't feel them at all.
[105:48] B: Okay.
[105:49] A: They're right here, right now. Radio waves. Do you feel them?
[105:52] B: No.
[105:52] A: No. It's not until they're tuned to the right frequency that music comes out. Makes sense.
[106:01] B: Yes. It's like energy.
[106:04] A: Yeah. I blow a whistle, it makes no sound. But the dog next to us is going, is it really making no sound or is the sound out of the range that we can hear?
[106:14] B: Sounds out of the range we hear?
[106:16] A: Yeah. Right. So when somebody's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, their body stops, they exit it.
[106:30] B: Right.
[106:31] A: We don't pick them up, but it doesn't mean they're not here. Right. Just like your love for her is as strong now as it's always ever been, so is her hers for you. Yeah. The difference is she feels yours, you haven't been feeling hers.
[106:46] B: Right.
[106:47] A: Not because it's not here, but because the shock of having known her the way you used to blocks access. Right. It's kind of like somebody walking outside on a cloudy day and looking up and going, there's no sun. And we go, no, no, it's still there. Just as hot and heavy as it was the day before. Your view of it has been clouded. Right? Right. So we want you to be more connected to more of who she is because she was never her body. Got it. And so there's the moment of how you found out. Right. And that moment has frozen aspects to it. Meaning there's a part that doesn't know that moment is over.
[107:29] B: Right.
[107:29] A: Right. And that part is blocking you having more access to her. Right. So when that particular moment happened and you found out, when you found out, you were where?
[107:42] B: I was in treatment.
[107:43] A: You were in treatment. Right. Good. And was it a phone call or an email? So mom came to see you. Right. And that was unusual or normal for mom to visit?
[107:53] B: It was unusual. It wasn't visitation.
[107:55] A: Right. So mom came and it wasn't visitation. So that was unusual. Right. And then what happened next?
[108:00] B: She was crying.
[108:01] A: Well, she was crying. Right. Did you go into a specific room, sit down?
[108:04] B: Yeah. Yes, I went into my counselor's office.
[108:07] A: Right. So you went to the counselor's office. You sat down maybe in a couch or chair. And so did Mom. Was the counselor there?
[108:12] B: Yes.
[108:12] A: Right. Good. And then mom said, she's crying. I'm so sorry. Right.
[108:16] B: And I knew.
[108:17] A: Right. And you knew that she was gone. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[108:21] B: I cried.
[108:22] A: Right. Good. And then what happened? And then I continued crying. No, no.
[108:28] B: My day.
[108:28] A: Right. And then mom left.
[108:30] B: Mom left.
[108:31] A: Right. And then did you go to the funeral awake?
[108:33] B: Made a celebration of life?
[108:34] A: You did. Did you see the body?
[108:36] B: No.
[108:36] A: No. Okay.
[108:37] B: I had her cream, her ashes.
[108:39] A: You do have the ashes. But you didn't. Right. Good. So. But then that was over. And then later on, you did something more fun like get clean.
[108:45] B: Right?
[108:45] A: Right.
[108:46] B: You get a new job and went to an A.
[108:48] A: Right. I do think you got to raise. Got a race. Right. I lived holding the keys.
[108:54] B: Hold key holder.
[108:55] A: Right?
[108:56] B: Right.
[108:57] A: That's right. And again, you can remember all that happening and mom telling you you can remember putting your flip flops back on, right? Yeah. Stop putting on your flip flops.
[109:06] B: I'm not putting on my flip.
[109:07] A: Well, then stop mom from telling you that.
[109:09] B: I'm not stopping Mom.
[109:09] A: See, Mom's not telling me that.
[109:11] B: Mom's not.
[109:11] A: Well, then stop sis from doing that. Say she's not doing that. Stop it from happening.
[109:15] B: I can't stop.
[109:16] A: It's not happening.
[109:16] B: It's not happening.
[109:17] A: Right. You stop putting on your hoodie.
[109:18] B: Stop.
[109:19] A: I'm not putting on my hair.
[109:20] B: I'm not putting.
[109:20] A: We'll stop it from happening. It's not happening.
[109:22] B: It's not happening.
[109:22] A: Where is it? Say it no longer exists. Right. That experience no longer exists. Close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You letting her know what you know. Now that's over. That no longer exists. And sis is much more than her body. Just like if we take a glass of ice and on the patio, it's s sits and an hour goes by. And now the ice is water. And the kid looks and says somebody stole the ice and replaced it with water. We would educate and say it just transformed from solid to liquid molecule. H2O is the same. We leave that glass of water. Week goes by, the water's gone. Kid said somebody drank it, stole the water. Nobody. It evaporated. Right. Went from liquid to gas. The molecule of H2O is a same. The kid's confused. He goes, but if I don't see It. How can I feel it? We go. Because you live in Florida. It's all around you. And then we take him to the desert of Arizona and we go. You don't feel it here, do you? And we bring him back to Florida. We show them the rain cloud and we capture the water and he learns it's all the same thing. Yeah. So when people's bodies stop, they don't stop. Right. So. So as you educate the younger you that your sister was much more than her body, that she's no longer hurting, that she's been doing better with this for a longer time than you have, and she's wanting you to be more connected to her so that you know that she's okay. Right. Opening up more. Because what's something you and her like to do, you know, as you think. Yeah. Play and listen to. I wonder what it might be like to be feeling more of her with you when you're playing and listening to music.
[111:12] B: I do.
[111:13] A: You do. Right. And now see an image of her with you and her in the image together right prior to any of that ever happening. You just see you and her together. Got it. Right now you're more connected. That's right. To feeling more of her presence ongoingly with you. Really excited that you're having your life work for the better for both of you. Right, Right, right. Uh huh. It is, isn't it?
[111:48] B: Yeah.
[111:49] A: She's really excited about the growth and change that's happened for you.
[111:54] B: She is.
[111:54] A: She is. Right?
[111:56] B: She's with me.
[111:57] A: Yeah. So again, as you're checking, what are you noticing?
[112:03] B: Connection.
[112:04] A: Yeah. Peace. Yeah.
[112:09] B: Wonder.
[112:10] A: Yeah.
[112:11] B: Curiosity. Happy.
[112:16] A: Yeah. This is not a good newspaper.
[112:18] B: Safe.
[112:20] A: Yeah, I'm happy. Good job. You did great work today. Thank you. Yeah.
[112:32] B: I feel like it.
[112:33] A: Yeah. You did decades of therapy.
[112:38] B: That's so crazy.
[112:39] A: Yeah. Right?
[112:42] B: Feel lifted.
[112:43] A: I bet.
[112:45] B: Yeah.
[112:45] A: Yeah.
[112:46] B: I feel like I need a nap.
[112:48] A: Well, like I said, we did a lot of therapy in just a few hours. A couple hours. Yeah. Cool. So what I like people to do is go live life. I can do that for a few weeks and then get back for a follow up.
[113:01] B: Perfect.
[113:02] A: Yeah. Yay.
[113:03] B: I'm so excited.
