[00:01] A: Today is the 23rd of October, Catherine. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful and valuable, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:14] B: Yes.
[00:14] A: Cool. So give me an update. How did our last session leave you? What have you noticed for yourself? When you think about the different things that we talked about, like what happened with Sis, what happened with Cousin, what happened with, like, when you think about those things now, what do you notice?
[00:30] B: I notice that it doesn't affect me as much as it used to. Like, I can think about it and understand that that was something that happened, but it didn't. It doesn't still affect me today.
[00:40] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[00:41] B: Yeah.
[00:42] A: Yeah. Like, it doesn't cause that yuckiness anymore.
[00:44] B: No.
[00:45] A: How cool is that?
[00:46] B: It's great.
[00:46] A: Yeah. Yeah. Right?
[00:48] B: And I've noticed, like, recently, like, I'm so. I'm in a relationship and With a different guy. No.
[00:55] A: Because there was one guy that you broke up with.
[00:57] B: No. Oh, I don't think we were ever together.
[01:01] A: Okay.
[01:02] B: But it doesn't matter.
[01:03] A: And then there was another guy that. You're holding the keys.
[01:06] B: Holding the key?
[01:07] A: Yeah.
[01:07] B: Which one?
[01:08] A: There's the guy that you're with. Dating.
[01:11] B: Yeah.
[01:12] A: And I talked to you about holding the keys.
[01:14] B: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I have. I have the keys and the lock and all of the situations.
[01:18] A: See, that's a really key thing. As a woman, you need to. Right. And there was that whole challenge with that, like, not feeling like it was transactional.
[01:27] B: Right, right, right, right, right.
[01:28] A: That whole thing. So I'm really curious, how has that been?
[01:31] B: That's been actually really, really, like, it's been a very different experience because, like, I've never been, like, in a healthy relationship. So it's like, I realized, like, the areas that, like, sometimes, like, I'll think about, like. Well, actually, I don't think about it. Like, someone called his phone, and then it triggered. Like, okay, well, why is this person calling his phone at 10:30 at night? And their name was Sketchy, and it was just like.
[01:58] A: Her name was literally Sketchy.
[02:00] B: No, their name was Junior. Junior Rivera. Which is, like. It was just weird. All right. So I'm like, who is that kind of name? Yeah. So I was like, oh, my God, it's probably a drug dealer. I went through all these motions, but I communicated it.
[02:13] A: Hey, look at that. And so he was just, like.
[02:16] B: He was like, the things your Brain thinks of is just amazing. And I was like, well, you have to understand. And like, we just communicate, like, how things. Like my thought process on things and how I get to. Because I still. Well, I don't think them anymore. And I have, like. I've been, like, really focusing on just understanding. It's just a thought. And it's exactly that. It's not the reality that I'm in.
[02:43] A: It's a thought I'm having.
[02:45] B: Yeah. It's a thought I'm having. And I understand that it's gonna take time for me to, like, break the cycle.
[02:52] A: Okay.
[02:52] B: Because it's like a. You know, it didn't take me a couple weeks to get into those thought process, I guess you could say. And it's just gonna, like. It's something I have to constantly work on and, like, understand. But it's not reality. So that's what's going on there.
[03:11] A: Okay. And we may want to do something around those thoughts.
[03:15] B: Yeah.
[03:16] A: So that they're not so often. Not so frequent.
[03:18] B: They're really not that frequent. I think it's just because, like, I'm in a relationship, so. And like, I. I have trust issues. It's something I. Yeah, but that's.
[03:29] A: You're supposed to.
[03:30] B: Yeah.
[03:31] A: And not issues you're not supposed to trust.
[03:34] B: Right.
[03:35] A: So. So if you think that I'm supposed to trust. The issue is that you're thinking you're supposed to trust them.
[03:41] B: Okay.
[03:42] A: You're not supposed to trust them. Trust them is I'm gonna do this, and you're gonna lead me around the office.
[03:49] B: Right.
[03:49] A: And I know that your intention is not to hurt me, but you might bang me into something.
[03:54] B: Right.
[03:54] A: Because I'm not taking care of me.
[03:56] B: Right. Okay.
[03:57] A: Right. I can't get blindsided unless I close my eyes.
[04:03] B: Right.
[04:05] A: So we want you to be alert and aware.
[04:08] B: Okay.
[04:09] A: While you're relaxed.
[04:11] B: Right.
[04:12] A: Right. Even the fire detector, its job isn't to alert us before a fire because it can't.
[04:22] B: Right.
[04:23] A: Right. It's to alert us at the earliest sign of smoke.
[04:27] B: Okay.
[04:28] A: We want to know earlier because the sooner we know, the more options we have and how to deal with it.
[04:34] B: Okay.
[04:35] A: Right. If it only tells me when it's here, it's too late.
[04:40] B: It's too late.
[04:42] A: So we don't want to trust them.
[04:45] B: Right.
[04:46] A: Anybody?
[04:47] B: No, but I trust myself.
[04:48] A: That's what we want to develop more trust in. Your ability to discern.
[04:54] B: Right. Okay.
[04:55] A: Your ability to know inside.
[04:58] B: Okay.
[04:59] A: Got it. That you have trust in you. That I'm paying And that the fire detector isn't going off when there's no fire.
[05:08] B: Right.
[05:09] A: Because what happens when I've had stuff go on and I've had people that I can't trust and I've had other stuff happen and there's been. My fire detector goes off way too frequent, way too often.
[05:20] B: Right.
[05:20] A: And so there's all these false alarms, which makes me not pay as much attention to it. Right, right. It's the old adage of the little boy that cries wolf.
[05:30] B: Right.
[05:30] A: Oh, there's a wolf. Everybody runs out there. Yeah, there's a wolf, Everyone runs out. There's a wolf. Now there's really a wolf. No, you gotta come. Right. Like, I don't pay attention to it.
[05:39] B: Okay.
[05:40] A: Because it was going off at the wrong time.
[05:43] B: Right.
[05:44] A: So we definitely want to turn stuff down, but we also want to be alert and aware.
[05:49] B: Okay.
[05:50] A: Relaxed. And that I'm noticing things so useful that when sketchy name pops up at 10:30 at night. Like, what? What is that?
[05:59] B: Right.
[06:00] A: Like my mind takes it to. Oh, it's his drug dealer that he's gonna meet up with that are gonna.
[06:04] B: Right.
[06:06] A: And then you voiced it and he's like, oh, no, that's his co worker. Right.
[06:11] B: That he didn't want to answer because he hasn't talked to in a long time and he just doesn't work for the company.
[06:15] A: And it's like 10:30 at night. And why would I talk to that person? Yeah, they're probably drunk or stoned or.
[06:20] B: Right.
[06:20] A: Using or, you know, 10:30 at night. Calls are not people like, hey, how you doing? No, nobody calls me at 10:30 at night. That isn't a little.
[06:28] B: Yeah, right, Exactly.
[06:29] A: Because it's 10:30 at night. Who calls me down there at night?
[06:32] B: Nobody.
[06:32] A: Right.
[06:34] B: 10:30 at night, I'm sleeping.
[06:36] A: Yes, exactly. Because we have to get up in the morning. Right, right. And that's the difference.
[06:43] B: Okay, so that makes sense.
[06:44] A: Yeah. So. So that's good. How has this been in the feeling of before? Everything felt like transactional. So I didn't want him to treat me or I didn't want him to because then that felt like I owed him one.
[06:58] B: No, it's good like that.
[07:00] A: I'm curious because, like, that was one of the things that you had going on before. So I'm curious how it is now.
[07:05] B: I just let him be the man and just, you know, it's not worth the back and forth of it.
[07:13] A: You let him be the man?
[07:14] B: Yeah.
[07:14] A: Yeah. What does that mean?
[07:16] B: That means he takes care of Things. And I take care of other things. And it's okay, because he's not expecting anything from me. Because even if we go out to dinner, you know, we're both in halfway. Well, I'm in a halfway house, and he's in his veteran house. And we just have to understand that this is just what's working for us right now to save money and get to a point further down the line where we. We can be together.
[07:42] A: Yeah.
[07:42] B: In that aspect of things.
[07:44] A: Yeah.
[07:45] B: So.
[07:45] A: And he might treat.
[07:46] B: Yeah.
[07:48] A: And that's.
[07:49] B: If I cover the tip.
[07:50] A: That's part of being the man.
[07:52] B: Right.
[07:54] A: Is that I treat.
[07:55] B: Right.
[07:56] A: Right. The problem. One of the major problems with young guys of today is that they don't have that view.
[08:03] B: Yeah, he's got it.
[08:05] A: That's good. But they don't have that view that they're supposed to be the one that. It's like, no, you need to get the job. No, you need to be making money. No, if you're gonna go out, you need to be treating her. She's not a damsel in distress. But it's chivalry.
[08:19] B: Yeah. So it's funny that you said that, because, like, we're saving money.
[08:25] A: Yeah.
[08:25] B: Right. So. And I was like. Because he's got more money than I do, but he's supposed to. So it was funny because I was like, I'm gonna go work at the labor pool. And he was like, my girlfriend is definitely not going to a labor pool. Like, that is crazy. And I was like, well, I just want to make extra money. He's like, I will pay you to not go to the labor pool. And I was like, no, no, no. I was like, no, baby. Like, it's okay. I was like, I get it.
[08:53] A: I get it.
[08:54] B: He's like, you don't know those people. Like, it's sketchy. Like, I've been there, and he wasn't having it.
[08:59] A: Yeah.
[09:00] B: I actually did take the money that he said he would give me, though, so that was, like, a big step, because I tried to fight it, and he was. He tricked me. He got my cash app, and he just sent it. So it's. It's cute. It's. It's weird, though. It's like, kind of like, just sit back and relax and enjoy it and. Yeah.
[09:20] A: Are you still working for dad? Like, painting stuff and making all the phone calls and setting up the appointments.
[09:28] B: And I don't even know what I'm doing in my job anymore. It's so much so like, the hurricane.
[09:33] A: Happened, which has been fucking Nuts.
[09:35] B: Yeah, well, my job.
[09:36] A: You guys have damage to.
[09:37] B: No, my halfway house is great. Like, I mean, our screen came down, but the tree, like, just. It was like, miracle because it just fell back and, like, one of the branches hit, like, the side of our pool cage, but that's easily replaceable. And everything else was fine. But my dad has three acres of land.
[09:54] A: Yeah.
[09:55] B: With a bunch of oak trees and, like, the whole night, so. Look at my hands.
[10:01] A: I get it. I got. I got all sorts of stuff on mine too.
[10:04] B: It's from raking. So it's like I do the office work and I do the yard work and I feed the animals. And I'm just, like, just grateful. Just try to remain in gratitude and, like, happy that I have a job. I'm actually going on a cruise.
[10:18] A: Cool.
[10:19] B: For my 30th birthday.
[10:20] A: All right.
[10:21] B: I've never been out of the country, and I'm going with my family and nobody drinks, and it's a secure group, so I'm, like, really looking forward to that.
[10:29] A: When is that?
[10:30] B: That's in, like, 10 days.
[10:31] A: Oh, cool. Good for you.
[10:32] B: I'm so scared. I'm like. I'm not scared. I'm excited.
[10:35] A: But I'm like, you have a passport and all that stuff?
[10:37] B: No, we're going to U. S. Territory.
[10:38] A: So I have.
[10:39] B: I just went and got my birth certificate and I got my ID and my. All my documents and so, like, like.
[10:44] A: A virgin island stuff, like.
[10:46] B: Yeah, we're going to Puerto rico.
[10:47] A: Okay.
[10:48] B: And St. Thomas.
[10:49] A: Because those are like 60 miles apart. They're very close.
[10:52] B: Yeah. So we're going down there and it's gonna be super exciting.
[10:55] A: But have you been on a cruise before?
[10:58] B: No.
[10:59] A: Okay.
[10:59] B: No.
[11:01] A: So it's weird. Just so you know, a cruise, Right.
[11:04] B: Okay, so tell them.
[11:05] A: So you get there really early in the morning, right. And you gotta make sure that you've got a bag of, like, if you want to lay out in the sun or anything that you want with you. Because they take all your bags and you don't get into your room until later and you don't get your. Your stuff until even later than that.
[11:21] B: Oh, man.
[11:21] A: So, like, you, they. They like you to be at the cruise, like, you know, 8, 9 o'clock in the morning, 10 o'clock. Like, they'll have you go all the way to 1:00 to check in.
[11:31] B: Right.
[11:31] A: You get there earlier. It's nicer. You get to use the facilities, but you have to have a separate bag. Right. Like, so if we were going with my family, we'd have a separate bag that would have, like, the kids bathing suits in them.
[11:42] B: Right.
[11:42] A: So that we knew the kids could change and use the pool and the slides and all that.
[11:46] B: Right.
[11:47] A: Because all of our baggage. And they need to be in hard cases because if you have, like, hanging stuff, you still want to put in a hard case because they're rough with that.
[11:55] B: Okay.
[11:56] A: And then they basically take it all on the ship. So you're separated from it for a good six hours. You'll get your room, and then they'll bring your luggage. Yeah, yeah. And then there's all the different excursions that you can go on. And then, like, the first thing, it's not until, like, 4 or that they finally, like. Or they embark on the thing. And depending on where you're leaving from Miami. Okay. So then it's just gonna go off, and that'll be fun. There's tons of people everywhere. You have tons of food everywhere.
[12:27] B: Right.
[12:28] A: There's gonna be tons of nowadays wet wipe wipes. Okay. Because, you know, everybody touches everything.
[12:36] B: Yeah.
[12:37] A: You probably want to use that before you touch the door and. Because you've got people's germs. Yeah.
[12:43] B: Okay.
[12:44] A: But it's fun to just walk around the ship and all the different things that they have on a ship.
[12:48] B: Okay.
[12:48] A: I'm excited, right. Because they have, like, you know, fancy restaurants. They have regular restaurants. They have, like, the burger bar. They have pizza joints. They got big, huge dessert stuff. They got buffet. They got. That's all the food. And then they've got neat things like they'll play bingo or you'll watch a show or, you know, they'll have this coming up excursion, or they'll have activities like they got a basketball court or they got the slides or they got, you know, rope swings or whatever they have on that particular ship. And it's all neat, fun stuff to do.
[13:14] B: Oh, I'm excited. Yeah, I'm excited. I want to go on an excursion.
[13:19] A: Yeah. Right. So when you get to St. Thomas or you get to Puerto Rico, you can go on one of those excursions.
[13:24] B: Yeah, that sounds good.
[13:26] A: Yeah, I'm excited. Yeah.
[13:28] B: So that's going to be really exciting.
[13:29] A: Good for you.
[13:30] B: And then I want to get another job because I'm just like. I mean, I've got better with the hours, but I want to buy a house.
[13:40] A: Okay. Why?
[13:41] B: Because I want to have. I want to flip it. I want to get into a position where, like, I can rent out properties on top of, like, what I want to do as a career. So I have steady income and just, you know, be more financially stable. It's not about being rich or like, I just want to be comfortable. You know what I'm saying?
[14:01] A: Yeah. Well, a house may or may not be the best option.
[14:04] B: Okay, so enlighten me.
[14:06] A: Well, so when you buy a house, the. The lowest cost you're going to. So let me flip it around. When you pay rent, your highest cost is rent, right? But you don't pay any more than rent. If something goes wrong with it, you call the landlord and they have to fix it.
[14:23] B: Right.
[14:24] A: When you buy a house, the lowest is going to be your mortgage.
[14:27] B: Right.
[14:28] A: Which banks and other people qualify you for more than probably you're qualified for. That's just what. What they do. But then there's all the other expenses that you have to pay.
[14:38] B: Right.
[14:38] A: That aren't figured into paying for a house.
[14:41] B: Well, I'm not talking about, like, anytime soon. Like, maybe in the next, like, five years.
[14:45] A: Right. But I mean, that's. That's one of those things that you want to pay attention to, that sometimes it's better to rent than it is to buy based on where you are financially and what you want to do with it. If you want to buy a house that. While I live in the house, I'm fixing the house up, right? And maybe it's easy fix up, like, oh, we paint it, but maybe it's more challenging fix up like we redo a bathroom or a kitchen, right. Then that's okay, too. But you have to remember, living in a house while you're working on a house is not very comfortable. Even when we had people come and work on the house and we were living in the house, like, was not a lot. We had a kitchen redone and, like, dust is everywhere and in all places, even in places that they didn't have, like.
[15:30] B: Right.
[15:30] A: Yeah, we did that like, three years ago. We did bathrooms this past year, and that was really challenging.
[15:38] B: Okay.
[15:39] A: So they're just things to put in the background of, like, we live in America and America goes, oh, well, what are you supposed to do? Oh, you're supposed to have the, you know, you're supposed to buy the house with the white picket fence. And that's the American dream.
[15:51] B: Right?
[15:52] A: Sometimes.
[15:53] B: Sometimes, right.
[15:54] A: Depending on where you live and what kind of interest rate you can get. And it may or may not be the best idea. Okay, so we just want to go, yes, I want to start saving more money, but I want to have bucketed savings.
[16:09] B: What does that mean?
[16:10] A: Bucketed savings means that there's a percentage of what I have that goes to what we'll call a financial freedom account.
[16:17] B: Okay.
[16:18] A: So that's like investing.
[16:20] B: Okay.
[16:20] A: So it would be typically pre tax dollars. Most employers. I don't know whether you guys do this or not, but most employers have a match where they have like either a simple IRA plan, they have a. What do they call it, a 401k plan that the company matches up to 3%. And you would want to put in what you at least what matches.
[16:49] B: Right? Okay.
[16:50] A: Because if you don't, then you're throwing away that money. So if they match up to 3%, you put in 3%, they put in 3%, that's 6%.
[16:57] B: Right.
[16:58] A: So you're throwing that away if you don't do that much.
[17:00] B: Okay, so wait, I got a question. So what would you suggest? Because, like, I have money in my bank that just sits there. It doesn't gain interest. It doesn't. It doesn't do anything. It's just there.
[17:12] A: Well, you may want to put that in a money market account first.
[17:16] B: Okay, what does that mean?
[17:17] A: A money market account is a savings account that pays a percentage on what's in there.
[17:26] B: Okay.
[17:26] A: So for a period of time when we had a higher inflation, now inflation's come down a little bit. When we had higher inflation, money markets were paying like five and a half percent.
[17:36] B: Okay.
[17:37] A: On your money now they're down like four percent. Some are like three and a half percent.
[17:41] B: Okay.
[17:42] A: When we had really low inflation, the bank paid you nothing ever for having your money in it. Right. So if you have some money, you can do that. You can take some of that money and you can invest it in a mutual fund. What you want to invest in, in terms of a mutual fund would be some kind of index fund. And an index fund is a fund that basically banks on the top 500 companies in the United States.
[18:08] B: It's like a Roth IRA.
[18:09] A: You can have a Roth IRA. The vehicle that you put into the Roth IRA, you want to go with index funds. And if you don't want to pay a lot of fees, you want to do something like Vanguard.
[18:20] B: Vanguard.
[18:20] A: So. So.
[18:28] B: Because I just feel like there's no point for my money just to be sitting in my bank when it's just sitting there. And I. I have it in my savings and I just put some in every paycheck.
[18:51] A: Okay. So money market account. So there's different buckets. So. So if we were to think of one bucket being, I call it Financial Freedom Account, that is the investing. It typically is Pre tax. So before you get your paycheck, it comes out.
[19:14] B: Okay.
[19:16] A: And it's for retirement.
[19:19] B: Right?
[19:21] A: Right. And the earlier, younger that you put.
[19:23] B: It in, the more money you'll get.
[19:25] A: The longer it allows that money to compound. And with that, that's where you'd want to put it into an index fund.
[19:32] B: Okay.
[19:33] A: Okay. There's a different one, which is what I would consider long term savings for spending. Ltss long term savings for spending. So that would be things like I'm saving for a house or I'm saving for a car.
[19:51] B: Right. Or.
[19:52] A: Or I'm saving on a vacation. So I'm going to use the money, but I'm saving up. So for example, my wife and I have begun because we want to do a summer trip with the children. We have begun on a monthly basis to put like $1,000, maybe $500, I don't remember what it is away. So that come July, we've got that money already saved.
[20:21] B: Right.
[20:21] A: So that we can use that for our trip.
[20:24] B: Right.
[20:25] A: Versus Hey, I just put it all on a credit card. I have to pay back that.
[20:28] B: Yes.
[20:29] A: Right. So that's long term savings for spending. Okay. The next one is called. Oh, wait, we got to do percentages. So each one of those is like 10% of what you make.
[20:46] B: Okay.
[20:47] A: You want to put 10% into the financial freedom account.
[20:50] B: Okay.
[20:51] A: You want to put 10% into long term savings for spending. You can change that, change it up and down, whatever. The. The next one would be like fixed expenses.
[21:05] B: Okay. So that's like car insurance.
[21:07] A: Yeah. So that would be like rent.
[21:10] B: Rent, okay.
[21:12] A: Car insurance, phone.
[21:16] B: Yep.
[21:18] A: If you have any subscription services, Netflix.
[21:21] B: And Spotify.
[21:27] A: It would be things like Internet. Right. Like utilities.
[21:36] B: Right.
[21:37] A: So power and garbage and all that, that's fixed expenses.
[21:41] B: Right.
[21:42] A: That they tend to say needs to be like 55% or lower of what you make should be on fixed expenses, you know, so rent, car insurance, phone, subscriptions, utility, anything that's a fixed expense that you have to pay ongoingly, monthly.
[21:59] B: Okay.
[21:59] A: Right. So now we, we're up to 75%. Right, right. Then we have a, what we call a. I call it a play account. That is another 10%. And play would be like, it's the money that I have that I can spend.
[22:23] B: Right.
[22:23] A: So kind of think of it as like guilt free spending.
[22:26] B: Okay.
[22:31] A: I can use that money on whatever. Right. So the other thing that would be a fixed expense would be like gas.
[22:36] B: Yeah.
[22:37] A: Like for the car.
[22:38] B: Right.
[22:40] A: Right. So now we're up to 85%. 5% people tend to think of as gifts.
[22:52] B: Okay. It's like budgeting.
[22:53] A: It's a little bit about budgeting. Gifts would be like, whether they be gifts for you or other people or Christmas or holidays or if people are tithe to churches or. And then I'm trying to think, what is the last one? We have 55, 65, 75, 85, 90. There's one more. Oh, regular savings. So the last one would be, I would say another 10%. And that's for like emergency fund.
[23:29] B: Okay. Like a tire goes out, right?
[23:36] A: Like it's an emergency fund. Like, oh, I just lost my job. So I've got a little bit of money that can hold me over till I get a new job. I'm not planning on spending it, but I'm putting it away so that if there's an emergency, I've got something in the coffers to help me deal with the emergency. Right. The other thing that I think would be really good and you can get this in audio or book form is a book called and it's a funny title, I will teach you to be rich.
[24:05] B: Okay.
[24:09] A: And he's got a podcast as well. He has a Netflix show, same title. His name is Ramit Sadie. I listen to his podcast just out of like, he interviews a lot of couples and how they are with money. And some people have money, some people don't. But like, how do you manage your money? He also has on his website for free, it's a thing called a conscious spending plan.
[24:39] B: Okay.
[24:40] A: And it's very similar to what we just outlined with those things.
[24:44] B: Right.
[24:45] A: But it's a conscious spending plan. And he calls his port portion that you want to have as part of your budget stuff guilt free spending.
[24:53] B: Right.
[24:53] A: So that, you know, okay, I've got this money, let's say I've got, you know, $35 a week that I can spend. Maybe we go out to dinner with it or maybe we go to a movie with it or maybe, you know, I, whatever, I buy something, I save a couple weeks and I buy a pair of sneakers. Whatever it is, it's guilt free spending, but I get to do whatever I want with it. Right. But the I will teach you to be rich is not specifically about. You're welcome. Is not specifically about being quote unquote rich.
[25:22] B: Right.
[25:22] A: It's about what does your rich life look like? So as you put it, like, I'd like to be more comfortable, I'd like to be able to have an income that supports me, but also have something on the side that I can earn some additional money with. Right, right. So that's a useful thing that, you know, just understanding it and reading it. It kind of talks about why do you want to put money in a Roth ira? Why do you want it? What vehicle would you use? Why would you want to use Vanguard? Vanguard doesn't have fees. Right. If you go with a financial planner or financial advisor, many of them are charging you 1 or 2%, which doesn't sound like a lot, but it adds up. But over the course of your lifetime, 1 or 2% could be the difference between you having an extra $800,000 or not. That's a lot of money.
[26:16] B: Right.
[26:17] A: So it's kind of gaining some financial literacy in an easily understandable way. And like I said, he's got a podcast. It used to be called I will teach you Be Rich. And now it's something about couples.
[26:30] B: Okay.
[26:43] A: Money for couples.
[26:44] B: Money for couples. Let me see if they have that on Spotify real quick.
[26:48] A: I'm sure they do.
[27:05] B: Could you write that down?
[27:06] A: Yep, it should be on Spotify.
[27:25] B: Money for Couples. Ramit C. Yeah.
[27:28] A: Ray, meet Sadie. That's him.
[27:29] B: Okay. There we go. Okay.
[27:34] A: But right, like, we don't get any training. Our parents don't teach us. Nobody really teaches us financial literacy.
[27:41] B: Right, Right.
[27:42] A: We don't learn it in school. We don't learn how to manage money. Nobody teaches us how to manage money. Like, when we're young, we just spend it because we get it. We get it, we spend it. And we don't have, quote, unquote, expenses. Right. So, like, when I was working as a teenager and I was busting my butt and I made some money, I didn't really have any expenses.
[27:58] B: Right.
[27:58] A: Right. My parents covered rent. My parents covered, you know, food at home. My parents covered. Yeah. So I had a couple bucks that I'd put gas in the car if I was borrowing their car.
[28:08] B: Right.
[28:08] A: Like, the rest of it would be money that I could spend on shit, whatever I wanted. Right. Like junk food, this that, you know, I want a Slurpee. Okay. I'll buy a Slurpee, that kind of thing. So it's the idea of, you know, as you and your guy, whether you're with this guy or not, are thinking about, what do I want to do, what kind of vehicles can I have? Why? I suggested a money market account. Even though it's not gonna pay as much if you have a portion of it in there, it's not as volatile as a stock market. Right, Right. So when the money market went Up My wife took a bunch of cash holdings and put it in to that because it was earning five and a half percent and that's not a bad thing to earn now if you have it in the market, you know, on a low end, you tend to think of over your lifetime it's going to earn 7%, maybe 8% growth over time.
[29:04] B: Yeah.
[29:05] A: So they're just, you know, we don't always get financial literacy and that's an easy one to understand and an easy one to listen to and get a little bit more financial literacy.
[29:17] B: Okay, that sounds good.
[29:18] A: Yeah, yeah. And if you got another job, like when would that be and what would you do?
[29:24] B: Well, I would definitely get a serving job and I would start after I got back up from the cruise. So that way I could do it for Beautiful.
[29:29] A: Yeah. And that would be a great, great time to start. Right, right. And with your job that you're working, doing the, the stuff for dad.
[29:37] B: Right.
[29:38] A: Is that typically like a 9 to 5ish job?
[29:41] B: Yeah, not really. I mean I can, it depends. Like I work whenever I want to work. Like I work Monday through Friday, typically 8 to 4:30.
[29:50] A: Oh, beautiful.
[29:51] B: But I mean I could, I want to get to the point because I can work from home, but I'm not in the position to do that yet.
[29:58] A: No, not at where you're staying.
[30:00] B: Well, no, I could, but my dad, I don't think my dad wants me to work from home. I don't really want to work from home because there's like a lot going.
[30:07] A: On, you know, too much chaos at the home.
[30:09] B: Yeah, there's just, there's.
[30:10] A: You go to dad's home?
[30:12] B: Yeah, I go to dad's home. Mortgage.
[30:13] A: So you do work from home? Yeah, just not yours.
[30:16] B: Yeah, exactly. Just on my own.
[30:20] A: Right. So perfect.
[30:22] B: It works out in that way, like if I do end up staying with this guy, like, you know, if we have a family or something like that, like I can work from home.
[30:33] A: Right. There's, there's options. Yeah. As you're young still, if I can work even, let's say 7:30 to 4.
[30:42] B: Right.
[30:42] A: And I can get the evening shift and have time to transition a couple nights a week. I work at a restaurant.
[30:49] B: Right.
[30:49] A: That I'm gonna be making tips at.
[30:52] B: That's a steady income that I could just.
[30:54] A: Right. Or I can also work on a weekend and maybe I do a double on Saturday and I work a night a week. Right, right. There's all sorts of different options depending on where. And serving has a good opportunity to earn a Decent wage, I think. In my opinion, I think everybody would benefit from working in the service industry.
[31:16] B: Right.
[31:17] A: I think it teaches people not to be such assholes.
[31:20] B: Right.
[31:21] A: I deal with assholes in the service industry. So it teaches you to not be such an asshole.
[31:27] B: Yeah, I could be an asshole, but I'm too friendly. So it teaches me to not be like, focus all my attention on one table. Because that's what I used to do when I worked at Perkins. Okay, I'd get caught. But I was also in my active addiction. So I just sit there and like.
[31:45] A: Yeah, you know that I want to provide good service for them, but it's also better if they get up and they eat. They get up and leave so that we can get another one there.
[31:53] B: Exactly.
[31:53] A: It's not great. I mean the morning shifts are notorious for people having breakfast and they're there for four hours. You're like, okay, right?
[32:00] B: Like, yeah, like I need.
[32:01] A: That didn't take that long to eat eggs and it didn't take that long for us to make the eggs. So now you've been here for an hour and a half and you're still here and we need that table to turn around.
[32:13] B: Yes, exactly. That's true.
[32:16] A: Different than I work at Flemings Fleming's. You where I'm going to have the experience of being at dinner for an hour and a half because nobody wants to eat their steak in 15 minutes. No, they want, they want to have their glass of wine, whatever it is that they have. They want to, you know, have their conversation. They want to have their appetizer, they want to have their meal. They might want to have a dessert. Right. Like that's not a stress. Like where breakfast is like I'm going to eat and go.
[32:43] B: Right.
[32:43] A: I got shit to do.
[32:46] B: Exactly.
[32:47] A: Okay, cool. So what else has been going on with you? How else have things been? Have you stayed in contact with Bri? How are you doing with Selah and all of that kind of stuff?
[32:58] B: With who?
[32:58] A: With Saa.
[32:59] B: Oh, yeah. I, I mean I go to class every Tuesday. I. I meet. I typically am supposed to meet with Bri in person, but I like, I have a home group and I work my, my recovery cuz that's like what has to come first sometimes. But I've gotten to a point where like with the hurricane, we missed a visit and like our just scheduling wasn't lying. So I mean other than that, I'm like, I'm meeting with her today to look into like what I want to do for like school and just see what Options to, like, further my education.
[33:31] A: And what else do you want to be doing career wise, as you think about that kind of stuff?
[33:36] B: I. I don't really know. Like, I just, like.
[33:39] A: No, as you think about schooling, what would that mean?
[33:41] B: I really want to look into, like, psychology because I feel like I'm an empath. Like, I'm really compassionate person. I can just. Very intuitive and I can, like, read people very well and. But I'm also scared because, like, I get attached really easily. Not as much anymore. Like, you know, I'm kind of, like, in the process of, like, focusing more on, like, what makes me happy. And, like, I have to set, like, boundaries with even some of the girls in my house because they just, like, they work their programs and, like, I'm not judging them, but, like, they gossip and they just talk about everybody. And it's just. I don't have that kind of energy right now. You know what I'm saying? It just. I don't want to hear what about. About what everybody else is doing. Like, I just want to focus on what I want to do because, like, I haven't focused on myself and what makes me happy and who I am and so long that it's just. And it's hard sometimes, but, like, I'm getting better at it. Like, I'm in the process of, like, branching out to, like, N.A. because narcotics was majority of my story. And it's really hard for me to relate to someone that only drank alcohol because I just. That's just not what happened for me. And so the steps through NA Get a lot more in detail, and I'm just like, I want to learn more about, like, why, like, feelings and, like, thoughts and, like, how they affect you and, like, all that information. So that's why I was looking into, like, psychology and stuff like that. And Breeze actually got school stuff for me. I'm meeting with her today after this. So I'm just like, I'm really looking forward now instead of just focusing on, like. Like, what happened to me and what I went through. And, like, it's just like, it's crazy to think about that that was even, like, me now. Like, it's like I don't know that person anymore.
[35:40] A: No. Right. That was just the stuff that you went through.
[35:42] B: Yeah.
[35:43] A: Who is never a part of you.
[35:44] B: No, I was never that person. It's just.
[35:47] A: Right.
[35:48] B: It's weird to think about. It's like, wow, I did that for a long time, but, you know, I'm out of it now, so I don't Live there anymore.
[35:55] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[35:55] B: It's really an amazing job feeling.
[35:57] A: Yeah.
[35:58] B: So, yeah.
[35:59] A: Right. That you're taking care of you. So kind of like exploring. What would it be like to learn more.
[36:04] B: Right.
[36:05] A: About different things. And if I do psychology, what would I want to do? I already feel like I'm good at connecting with people. I already feel like I can sense and feel what's going on over there, which is why I don't want to be involved in the. The Gossip Girl stuff.
[36:20] B: No. It just sucks a lot of energy out of me.
[36:23] A: Yeah.
[36:24] B: It's like, I just, like. I don't know. I'm really big on energy. Like, energy is something that I'm actually kind of intrigued by because I think, like, energy is something we don't talk about enough. You know, It's. It's. I don't know where I'm going with that yet, but something I want to look into.
[36:42] A: Yeah. And there's people's energy.
[36:45] B: Right.
[36:45] A: And then there's energy that the planet.
[36:47] B: Yeah.
[36:48] A: Has provided and what we're using up of it.
[36:50] B: Yeah.
[36:51] A: So we have lots of different forms of getting energy now. Like, we have solar, we have coal, we have natural gas, we have oil.
[37:00] B: Okay.
[37:01] A: Right. They're looking into nuclear again. But we don't realize how much energy we're using. Like, AI and like, the bitcoin stuff uses up so much energy. Right. And energy is somewhat finite. Right, Right. Once we use up all the oil, we don't have extra oil.
[37:23] B: No.
[37:25] A: Right. And even to make the things that are electric.
[37:29] B: Yeah.
[37:30] A: Require energy. Energy. Oil.
[37:34] B: Right.
[37:34] A: Yeah. So that's like the bigger, broader system. And then there's the energy of people.
[37:39] B: Right, Right.
[37:40] A: And there's certain people's energy that, like, they pull. Or there are certain people. Energy that don't fit, and then there's certain people that are energy suckers.
[37:48] B: Yeah.
[37:50] A: Right. My wife and I were talking about how, you know, Taylor Swift had concerts in Miami and that she puts on an amazing show, like three and a half hours, and she's go, go, go, go, go. The whole time.
[37:58] B: Right.
[37:59] A: Like, she's got to be exhausted at the end. I go, yes and no. Because she's got a stadium filled with 67,000 people.
[38:07] B: Right.
[38:07] A: All excited to see her sing. How much energy is she getting from the crowd?
[38:13] B: Right. That's a lot.
[38:14] A: Right. Like, if you can't get pumped up to see 65,000 people screaming your name and excited to hear you sing, like, who are you then? So there's the energy that the crowd is giving her, but she's also giving the energy back to the crowd. Right, Right. So maybe she's not exhausted at all at the end of it. I don't know. I think it's. It's an interesting thing because is. Are they sucking her energy or is she taking the energy from them? And is it a symbiotic thing or not? Right. Like, if I'm doing a training with people and they're all completely bored, they're sucking all of my energy.
[39:00] B: Right.
[39:01] A: I got to do something to change it to get them to not be so bored. But their energy drains.
[39:06] B: Right.
[39:07] A: I don't want my energy drained.
[39:09] B: No.
[39:09] A: So I want to do stuff that would have them be more engaged.
[39:13] B: Right, right.
[39:14] A: I think many people, me included, after the hurricane. Right. So we had the two hurricanes. Milton came through. Then there's all the cleanup from Milton. Then there's. I know. Last week, Monday, Tuesday into Wednesday, I was exhausted.
[39:27] B: Right. Me too.
[39:28] A: And I think it had to do with. I had a hurricane hangover.
[39:32] B: Yeah.
[39:32] A: Because there was everything you had to do with the stress of the hurricane. And it's a hurry up and wait game. Like, okay, board everything up. And then.
[39:40] B: Right.
[39:41] A: When is it coming? Oh, we're great. It's at night when I want to go to bed. Okay. That's what I'm hearing. The big one, winds and. Oh, is the roof gonna. Right. So there's all of that, and then there's the aftermath, and then what you have to do to get ready.
[39:55] B: Right.
[39:55] A: To be able to function again. And then there's just all of the debris.
[40:00] B: Yeah.
[40:01] A: All of the trees that every day you're driving by these huge piles. It's like, you know, I lived up north, and you'd have a huge snowstorm. There'd just be piles of snow everywhere.
[40:10] B: Yeah. Now we just have piles of leaves. We just got piles of leaves.
[40:15] A: Yes, exactly. But I think that that was like, why am I so tired? I'm like, oh, I bet that's what it is. That was such an energy drain that I couldn't be tired then because I had to get stuff done.
[40:30] B: Right.
[40:31] A: That after. When I didn't have as much to do and I saw the. Oh, that's why I did my job. And by the end of the day, I'm like, oh, my goodness, I'm exhausted. I'm never exhausted. At the end of the day, I'm like, what is going on with me? Oh, right. It's the drain from the hurricane.
[40:48] B: I was exhausted after the hurricane. I'M I've been exhausted. I haven't really been that exhausted this week because now I'm kind of like, in the routine.
[40:57] A: Yeah, I think last week was the hard week.
[40:59] B: Yeah, it was definitely. It was a lot. It was too much.
[41:02] A: But kids finally went back to school midweek last week, you know, where they weren't in school for two weeks because of the stuff.
[41:09] B: And I know that was a long time for the kids to be out of school.
[41:12] A: A long time. Yeah.
[41:13] B: That's weird.
[41:14] A: It is weird. The whole thing's been weird.
[41:16] B: It's been a weird experience.
[41:18] A: Yeah.
[41:19] B: That's so.
[41:19] A: Yeah. And. And it was that much more stressful with Milton because of how devastating Helene was to the beaches.
[41:26] B: Right. And then we just got hit round two.
[41:29] A: Right. And Milton, the whole time looked like it was coming right at us. There was no spaghetti models. It's like, oh, it's going to turn off here. Go. Maybe there. It's going to spin. No, no, it's like, head on.
[41:37] B: It's coming right.
[41:41] A: Okay. How often do you get together with the guy?
[41:44] B: A couple times a week.
[41:45] A: Okay.
[41:46] B: Yeah. So I see him on Tuesdays. We meet up at a meeting, and then. Or maybe like three times a week. Saturday we go and we do. Well, he's still on probation, so he's got to do community service. And I just want to hang out with him. So we go and we do volunteer work out of food. What is it called? Oh, my God. A food pantry.
[42:08] A: Oh, nice. Okay.
[42:09] B: So we do that on Saturdays, and then we go and have lunch, and then we'll go sneak back into his house. It's okay. And we watch movies and stuff. So it's just. It's been going good.
[42:20] A: Is his house not allowed to have girls in it?
[42:22] B: Well, they haven't said anything yet. I. I don't think they care because, like, he does what he's supposed to do. You know, it's like. But we don't. It's not like, I'm not gonna go and stay there overnight and stuff like that. Like, I just come over for, like, a couple hours and watch the movies.
[42:39] A: Yeah.
[42:39] B: Eat and then leave.
[42:41] A: Yeah.
[42:41] B: You know, I don't want to push it.
[42:43] A: Yeah.
[42:43] B: But we don't do it that often. Like, it's only, like, every, like, few weeks.
[42:49] A: Well, it's the good thing that it's forcing you to go slow.
[42:52] B: Yeah, I like it.
[42:53] A: It's really good.
[42:55] B: Yeah.
[42:56] A: Right. That it's forcing you to go slow. Right, right.
[42:59] B: It's really good.
[43:01] A: Right. So that you can Take your time.
[43:03] B: Yeah.
[43:03] A: And keep checking. Yeah.
[43:05] B: Keep my awareness work.
[43:07] A: Keep checking in with you. How does this feel? Not like, oh, I got lust and limerence and excitement, novelty, new. But, like, how does it truly feel? Is this guy continuingly treating me the way that I want to be treated? Right.
[43:23] B: Because he feels safe.
[43:25] A: Because we can look at it that I'm in a relationship, which is like a ship, so it looks like a thing. But a relationship, Katherine, is actually a process.
[43:38] B: Right.
[43:38] A: It's a process of relating.
[43:41] B: Right.
[43:42] A: And we're ongoingly relating. So you want to just continue to pay attention to. How am I relating to him? How is he relating to me?
[43:52] B: Okay.
[43:53] A: And he's. He relating to me in the way that I want to be related to? So that's. How is he treating me?
[43:59] B: Right.
[44:00] A: Right.
[44:02] B: It feels like it's going good, but I'm also, like, knowing that, you know, it hasn't been very long.
[44:09] A: Right.
[44:10] B: So, I mean, it's. It's. I feel like it's steady getting better, like, because we don't really know each other and we're trying to figure it out, and we're both, like, in these situations. But I like our communication. I like his consistency. He's very consistent, and he listens.
[44:25] A: What did he get on probation for?
[44:27] B: Oh, this time? I don't know. Sales. Sales, you know? Yeah. It's bad. But, you know, he does what he's supposed to do now, right now. Exactly.
[44:40] A: Yeah.
[44:40] B: So we'll see what happens when he gets off probation. That's what I'm kind of, like, waiting for. But that's another year away, and who knows what could happen in that time? But, like, you know, there's. He does what works for him, I do what worked for me. And then we meet in the middle and, like, figure it out. You know what I'm saying? Like, I'm just. I'm being cautious and kind of selfish.
[45:05] A: Because that's how it's supposed to be. Right.
[45:07] B: So it's just. It's just flowing. It's just flowing right now.
[45:12] A: It's supposed to be selfish.
[45:14] B: Right.
[45:15] A: It's supposed to be on your terms.
[45:18] B: Yeah.
[45:19] A: For a girl, the question is never do I get to be with that guy today? No, it's. Am I gonna allow that guy to hang out with me?
[45:27] B: Right.
[45:28] A: Right.
[45:29] B: He has to.
[45:29] A: That's what I mean by hold the keys.
[45:31] B: Yes.
[45:32] A: And he's gotta let me know with plenty of notice.
[45:35] B: Right. That's something we had to work on. And, like, it was funny because, like, he wanted to Hang out. And, well, I texted him. I was like, hey, what are your plans this weekend? And he didn't have an answer. So I made plans that weekend. And then he was like, hey, what are you doing, like, on, like, Thursday? I was like, I got plans. And he was like, well, what do you mean? I'm like, yeah. I said, what are your plans this weekend? You said you were either whatever you were doing. So I made my own plans because I'm not gonna. Right, sit and wait for you to decide what you want to do. Now he makes the plan.
[46:11] A: And even if I don't have plans, if he doesn't ask me in time, I tell him that I do.
[46:16] B: Right? Okay.
[46:18] A: Because I want to train him that if you want to go out with me and take me out on Saturday, you need to ask me on Thursday.
[46:26] B: Right.
[46:28] A: Friday at the latest.
[46:30] B: Right.
[46:31] A: If you wait and I'm busy, even if all I'm doing is sitting at home watching Netflix.
[46:37] B: Right.
[46:40] A: Because it's the training, and this is the time to train. How do I want to be treated?
[46:47] B: Right.
[46:48] A: Right. If I'm in it and I don't ever train, then I. You know, it's like the person who doesn't train the dog.
[46:54] B: Right. It's all over the place.
[46:55] A: Right. The time to train the dog is at first.
[47:00] B: Right.
[47:00] A: When you first get the dog and you first have the dog and the dog is with you.
[47:04] B: Right?
[47:04] A: Yeah.
[47:06] B: Sounds good.
[47:07] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[47:10] B: That's what he says to me sometimes. He's like, I don't know why you're trying to train me or what did he say? I don't know if he was trained. I don't know. Maybe he did, but he was like, change for him.
[47:22] A: Yeah.
[47:22] B: No, I'm not trying to change you. I'm trying to let you know what.
[47:25] A: I'm going to tolerate, What I'm okay.
[47:27] B: With, what I'm okay with.
[47:28] A: If that means you have to change, that's on you.
[47:30] B: Right.
[47:31] A: You get to decide. You don't have to be with me. I don't have to be with you.
[47:36] B: Right.
[47:36] A: So if we're going to do this thing, then there are certain things that I have as expectations.
[47:41] B: Right.
[47:41] A: Of how I want to be treated.
[47:43] B: Right.
[47:43] A: To make it that it's okay.
[47:45] B: Right.
[47:45] A: So it's not changing you. It's just letting you know what works for me.
[47:48] B: Right. I like that.
[47:51] A: That's what it is. Right. That's what it's about. You're in it. I call it training, but you're letting him know what works for you and what doesn't.
[48:02] B: Right. That's important.
[48:05] A: He then gets to choose what he does with it.
[48:07] B: Right. Exactly.
[48:10] A: And if he wants to have more time with you, then it would behoove him. It would make sense for him to treat you more and do more of the things that you want.
[48:19] B: Right. I like the sound.
[48:23] A: Yeah.
[48:24] B: Sounds good.
[48:25] A: Cool.
[48:25] B: Cool.
[48:26] A: All right. So you're gonna get with Bree. She's gonna talk to you about possible education opportunities.
[48:30] B: Yes.
[48:31] A: And other things that you can do. Right, Right. Maybe there's something with psychology maybe. Right. Maybe you might, after the cruise, pick up a, you know, serving job part time that will add extra income so that you can, you know, scroll it away more.
[48:46] B: Right.
[48:51] A: And then there's like step work that you're doing.
[48:54] B: Oh, yeah, right there.
[48:55] A: Say the stuff that you're doing. Do you have a sponsor? Do you have someone that.
[48:58] B: I have a sponsor, but I'm in the, like, a transitioning period, like I was telling you earlier, because I worked my steps through AA first because it was super simple and I could get through them. And I, like, got, like, the logistics of how it works. And then now I just. Last Friday, I started going to this women's meeting. It's called Women of Spiritual Principles. And so I have a. I already have a sponsor in mind. And she told me I just got to keep showing up. So I went last Friday. I plan to go this Friday. So I'm going to be starting that work soon. So I'm excited.
[49:32] A: And it's good to have just a woman's group.
[49:35] B: Yeah, exactly. No distractions.
[49:38] A: Right, Right. That's why they talk about that whole thing, don't date.
[49:43] B: I know they say that. They say that, but it's important.
[49:48] A: It is important. It is important to work on you.
[49:51] B: Yes.
[49:53] A: And follow what works for you.
[49:55] B: Right?
[49:55] A: Yeah, definitely. Cool. Okay. Any other stuff that's going on with you?
[50:01] B: No, nothing. I mean, work is a little stressful, but I just have to stay in gratitude. Like, I have a job. I can come to therapy when I need to go. I can leave early if I have something going on.
[50:15] A: How has work been stressful?
[50:17] B: It's just. It's not really stressful. I guess stressful would be a bad word for it. It's just. It's just. I don't know how to explain it. It's a lot of hard work bouncing between the yard and the office and back and forth and trying to, like. I know how to do the office work and, like. But I want to get hours, so I kind of overwhelmed myself with getting back out to the yard. So, like, I made a couple mistakes, but it wasn't like, major, like, oh, my goodness, this is really bad mistakes, but it's something I should know and know how to do. And so it's just trying to focus on getting different things done and getting hours and, like, trying to save and get ahead. It's just like. I don't know. It's really not like, anything now that I'm.
[51:13] A: Do you get different pay for different things?
[51:15] B: No.
[51:16] A: Okay, so whether you're outside doing a.
[51:18] B: Manual labor or inside, it's steady bay.
[51:22] A: Okay.
[51:23] B: Yes. That's a little aggravating. I mean, I understand. Like, I haven't been with my dad's company long, but, like, what I make now is not like I'm just barely surviving. You know what I'm saying? So it's just like he says, he has all these, like, goals, and I can do all these great things, like buy a house off the money that I'm making. But I don't see that right now. But it. It would just be easier for me if I knew the plans and the steps that I need to take to get to where he wants me to be. And I guess I gotta communicate that because. But he's really intimidating.
[52:06] A: That is.
[52:07] B: Yeah.
[52:07] A: Oh.
[52:08] B: I mean, I accept constructive criticism and I. I will learn, and I can be easily redirected, but he. His delivery is way off. He's very condescending and rude. When he tells me I made a mistake, it's just like. And it kind of like, makes me want to shut down or, like, get irritated and it's. I just have to understand.
[52:29] A: Well, how do you want to be?
[52:30] B: I don't want to be affected by people's words and, like.
[52:34] A: Right. So think of dad in particular. How do you actually want to be?
[52:37] B: I just want to be.
[52:38] A: If he's giving you this feedback, I.
[52:42] B: Just want to be talked to in a respectful man.
[52:44] A: That's changing dad.
[52:45] B: Yeah, I know that's not gonna happen.
[52:48] A: Okay, so given that we're not changing dad, how do we want it to be for you? Because dad might say it in a harsh way.
[52:54] B: I just have to understand that that's not.
[52:56] A: Have to understand.
[52:57] B: Okay.
[52:57] A: Because that's up here.
[52:59] B: Okay.
[52:59] A: And even if I understand, you don't not understand that.
[53:02] B: Right.
[53:03] A: You don't like how you feel.
[53:04] B: I don't.
[53:05] A: Right. So what you're thinking is, when dad does that, it makes me feel this way. That's not wrong.
[53:10] B: Right.
[53:10] A: It's just limited Power.
[53:12] B: Right. I don't need to let him have that.
[53:14] A: We can't change dad.
[53:16] B: Right.
[53:16] A: What if we could adjust how you find yourself feeling in response to that? Like, what if, as dad said it, you weren't hearing the harshness, you were hearing the feedback.
[53:27] B: Right.
[53:29] A: Of what he needs you to do instead of what you did.
[53:32] B: Right, Right. Right. That's. That's where I'm trying to get.
[53:34] A: I know. So what if it was. What if it was automatically that way?
[53:38] B: Well, that's what I want to do. That's where I want it.
[53:41] A: So think of dad, and think of dad saying it in a harsh way. Catherine, I can't believe you did this. You were supposed to do that. How could you have done this? You know better.
[53:51] B: Right?
[53:51] A: You've been doing this for a while.
[53:53] B: Right. I would just be like, okay, so.
[53:55] A: As he says that, how do we want you to be feeling like he is? Like, it's simply feedback.
[54:03] B: Right.
[54:04] A: So that I get better.
[54:05] B: Right.
[54:07] A: Got it.
[54:08] B: Got it.
[54:08] A: Think of him saying it and saying it in that harshness.
[54:12] B: I won't.
[54:13] A: Right now. And feel some of the discomfort.
[54:16] B: Okay, hold on. I gotta get there.
[54:18] A: Right. So you might be wherever you are, dad might come in, seeing that this thing was this and now it's not what it. And feel some of the discomfort.
[54:28] B: Okay.
[54:30] A: Right. Where do you feel it in your body?
[54:33] B: My heart.
[54:33] A: Right. So now just notice the sensations in your heart without doing anything with them or about them. Get curious about how you're going to notice them changing. Because the sensations are always changing. And the problem is that we freeze it. We're not really aware of it. So what do you notice, even if they're not changing in the way you want them to, yet, how the sensations in your heart are changing. What do you notice about it? Now go. Hmm. I'm wondering how they're changing.
[55:05] B: I'm wondering how they're changing.
[55:07] A: That's right. How am I gonna notice them changing?
[55:11] B: I just don't focus on them.
[55:13] A: Well, no, as you're focusing on them right now.
[55:15] B: Okay. Okay.
[55:17] A: Focus on the sensations. Right. What do you notice happening, Tom? The feelings in your heart.
[55:25] B: Calming.
[55:26] A: They are calming. How do you know?
[55:29] B: Because I can feel it.
[55:30] A: How do you know that you're feeling them? Calming?
[55:33] B: Because I'm focusing.
[55:35] A: You are focusing. But how do you know that it's feeling calmer?
[55:39] B: I can just feel it.
[55:41] A: Where?
[55:42] B: In my heart.
[55:43] A: Oh, so now it's feeling calmer in your heart. Right. Think about dad. Think about dad using that harsh tonality, being somewhat frustrated. And pissed. You know, all that talking down. Feel the discomfort. Where do you feel it?
[56:08] B: I know.
[56:08] A: No, you're not feeling it now. Well, really get in. It might be one of those times. And, like, he comes in like he's all a huff and puff. Just saw that this was this. And you were supposed to take care of that and you didn't take care of that. What the hell have you been doing?
[56:26] B: Just working.
[56:28] A: Right. How do we want you to be on to the next. Oh, okay. I'm getting feedback. Only getting it because he wants me to do better. Right, Right. Where do you notice it in your body?
[56:49] B: My head.
[56:50] A: Yeah. Get curious about the sensations in your head. Right. Open your eyes really big, like 10 seconds and go, mmm. What do you notice happening to the sensations in your head?
[57:08] B: They're calm.
[57:09] A: They're calm. Because what we're doing is we want to change the relationship to the sensations.
[57:16] B: Right.
[57:17] A: So it changes the relationship to the feeling because the likelihood that you're never going to have that feeling is low.
[57:24] B: Low.
[57:25] A: Right. So again, think about dad coming in, being harsh, critical, like, even calling, like, dummy, freaking an idiot. What is wrong with you? This is very important. You've got to do it this way, and you didn't do it this way.
[57:42] B: Okay.
[57:43] A: Right. How do we not. What you say to him? How do we want you to be feeling?
[57:47] B: Calm.
[57:48] A: Yeah. So think of him saying that as you're feeling calm. Right. What do you notice happening now?
[58:02] B: It's getting lighter.
[58:04] A: It is getting lighter. Oh, you mean you're beginning to lighten up.
[58:07] B: Mm.
[58:08] A: Mm. Yeah, that's right. Right. Think of him being pissed. I can't believe you did that. Do you realize it's one of our biggest accounts? You dropped a zero off. That's, like, not cool. How come you're not paying attention more? Where's your head? Are you using? Right. So you might say any of that stuff. Feel the discomfort. Where do you feel it in your body?
[58:39] B: I don't really feel it.
[58:40] A: You're not feeling it now, are you? Isn't that interesting? And you can open your eyes. Isn't that cool? You're not actually feeling it.
[58:49] B: Mm.
[58:49] A: Mm, mm. Right. Because what are you getting? Feedback. And why is he giving it to you? Yeah. So that it's better.
[58:58] B: Right?
[58:59] A: Right.
[59:02] B: It's good.
[59:02] A: It is good.
[59:03] B: It is really good.
[59:04] A: Feedback is good.
[59:05] B: Feedback helps.
[59:07] A: That's right. It's like when somebody makes a mistake.
[59:10] B: Mm.
[59:12] A: They get to do it over.
[59:13] B: Right?
[59:14] A: Right. That's why it's a mistake.
[59:15] B: Right.
[59:16] A: Right. They go, action. Guy messes up the lines, they go cut.
[59:19] B: Yeah.
[59:20] A: Okay. Here are the lines. Okay. Got it. Good. Okay. Action. Right. It was just a mistake, right? Right. Right. So, again, checking. You think about dad being pissy angry. Can't believe this. How come you didn't? What's wrong? You should have. You knew better. We already talked about this. What do you notice? How's your body feeling?
[59:48] B: Light.
[59:49] A: It is, right? You can open your eyes. There you go. So that'll be easier, right? Right. To take the feedback from dad.
[59:57] B: Right?
[59:57] A: Right.
[59:59] B: That's good.
[60:00] A: There you go.
[60:01] B: That's awesome. That's so crazy.
[60:05] A: Yeah. Isn't it?
[60:06] B: Yeah. I love that.
[60:08] A: Yeah. And notice how it feels different now?
[60:11] B: It does.
[60:12] A: Cool beans. All right, my dear, we'll stop with that for now. Tell Free I said hi.
