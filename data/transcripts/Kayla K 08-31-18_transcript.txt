[00:00] A: All right, so Today is the 31st. Wow. It is the 31st of August. And Kayla, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that there's also a video that's happening which is people from SELA in the clinical track for their masters, or some of them already are masters and are in the process of doing supervision for licensure, also learning how to do this kind of process. So given what we do today is actually transformative and life changing, recording that we're making may also be made available to teach and train others in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:42] B: Yes.
[00:43] A: Yeah. Okay. Do you have questions about all that?
[00:45] B: Well.
[00:48] A: Yes, because this is all like weird new and probably a smidge on the uncomfortable side. Right. I would imagine that that would be the case. Right. And probably because there's like a whole bunch of heaviness. Right. From stuff that you've gone through and other things like that. And you and I really haven't ever had any interaction together other than like, you saw me at the house a couple times.
[01:11] B: Yeah.
[01:11] A: Right. So let me kind of give you a framework of what it is that we do. If at the end, by the way, you don't want any of this known, we can delete it. I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me. I just am interested in, A, primarily doing really good work, and B, if we're doing really good work together, it can act as a teaching aid for others. So it can make a difference for others that might have had experiences. Yeah. So my primary role is all about getting rid of the negative effect that past experiences have had. So one philosophy goes, and it's weird. We're not troubled by the stuff we went through because what we went through was awful. We're troubled because when we went through it, it short circuited the emotional part of our brain. So what that means is that there's a part of the brain that doesn't know certain yucky things stopped you up here do. But at a different level, it's still stuck on. That explains why whenever we think about yucky stuff or whenever something in my environment reminds me of the yucky stuff, I feel yucky not because of how bad it was or it shouldn't have happened, or I shouldn't have done it or they shouldn't have done it, but because part of my brain never got that it stopped. That's the first issue. Follow me with that. Second, have you ever done, like therapy before?
[02:48] B: Only with Dr. Wiseman or Paul Weissman.
[02:51] A: Okay. And he did like this kind of thing. Did you find it useful?
[02:55] B: Yes.
[02:56] A: Okay. Did it help with stuff that happened?
[02:59] B: Yes.
[02:59] A: And the stuff that you addressed with him, when you think about it, does it still have the feelings or is that.
[03:05] B: I think that it's been coming back, but at the time it worked.
[03:09] A: Okay.
[03:10] B: So maybe it just. I don't know.
[03:12] A: So right afterwards it felt better, but it isn't completely gone. Okay, cool. All right. So we want it to be completely gone. That's the only kind of therapy that you've ever done before. Okay, well, that's interesting. That's cool. Because there are two things that I find happen in therapy in general that are sometimes problematic when we deal with emotions. And one is that in therapy we learn that people, what they call repression, which is kind of bury painful emotions, and that a therapist is supposed to encourage the getting the bad feelings out. Which kind of would mean that after a good cry, you feel better, which after a good cry you do feel slightly better, but you can get re triggered by the same crap. So this is different because it's not about getting emotions out. It's really about getting good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know yucky stuff is over. Got it?
[04:17] B: Yeah.
[04:18] A: Second part to it is most therapists would say that it's your job to get you better in a similar fashion. Like, you know, for sobriety, it's your job to keep yourself clean and sober. But when it comes to emotions, like, we don't actually choose them. Right. You don't wake up in the morning and say, today at 10:00 I am gonna be so freaking pissed, but at 11:45 I'm gonna feel peaceful and joy. It doesn't happen that. Right. Instead, stuff might be happening throughout your day and then you feel certain ways, but not because you decided to make sense, situational, all sorts of stuff. But what if it's not your job to change how you feel because you're not choosing the feeling in the first place? So what if it's more my job to do the work with you to get that stuff to adjust? Right. Because one of us should know what we're doing. And similar. Like, if you've ever gone to a dental hygienist, it's really her job to clean your teeth. She doesn't hold the mirror and give you the tool and you start scraping instead. She knows that it's her job to do the work she needs Your cooperation. She needs your collaboration. You're both going for the same thing. But she realizes that it's her job to do the work. Same thing with this. So when it comes to unwanted emotions, troubling feelings, it's actually my job to do the work with you to get that to lighten and lift. Got it?
[06:05] B: Yeah.
[06:05] A: Okay, cool. Third piece. Nobody would really care about anything that happened to them in life that's over already if it wasn't somehow negatively affecting them now. Right? Like, if my life was working exactly the way I wanted it to and I was feeling and I was thinking and I was acting and I was reacting exactly the way I would want to, nobody would care about any of that stuff. Right? The problem is that somehow my right now isn't working the way that I would want it to. Meaning in this present moment, I'm feeling ways that I don't want to be feeling. I'm having thoughts that I don't want to be thinking. I'm doing things that later on I wish I hadn't reacted to or done so. In that regard, Kayla, what I'm really interested in is learning what it is that you would be wanting our time to do for you. Right. Like, if we could change problematic ways that you've been feeling or thinking or acting or reacting. What do you want different for you?
[07:20] B: Everything.
[07:21] A: Everything. That's great. So. So then what would be useful for me to know, to understand what's been problematic and what we want different?
[07:36] B: Like what? Like how I'm feeling.
[07:39] A: Yeah, like. So I'll give you an example. Some people come in and they go, you know what? I'm a lot more on edge. Like, I'm a lot more easily irritated and agitated and aggravated. I'm quick, I'm short tempered, I'm reactive. I do and I say things that later on I wish I hadn't done or said. I don't want to be feeling like that. Some people go, you know what? For me, I'm more nervous, tense, anxious. I get these really racy thoughts where it's just on. Like, even when I lay down at night and I'm thinking, I'm tired. I lay down and boom, this thing's like, go. Sometimes it's more negative, critical about myself or about things that I did that I think now I shouldn't have done or things that happened to me that I wish they hadn't. Sometimes it's just jittery, uneasy. Like I'm just uncomfortable in socializing with other people. Sometimes it's like worries about well, what might they be thinking about me? Like there's all that kind of discomfort going on. Sometimes it moves into full fledged panic. They don't want to be feeling like that. They want that better. Some people come in and they go, you know what? For me, I get it that there's a lot of stuff that's happened and although it's over, it still underneath the surface bothers me. I don't think about it every moment of every minute of every hour of every day. But if I do think about it or if I still do have feelings, it's yucky. I don't want that to be happening. Some people go, for me, it's more grief. Like there are people that I was really close to and I've lost those people. And every time I think about them, there's a lot of anguish and pain. I don't want to be feeling like that. Some people have tremendous amounts of regret and guilt and remorse and shame over stuff they did. And even though they know they're not doing it now, there's still a lot of weight and heaviness. They'd like to get that lifted. And then some people are more, what we call down, depressed. They just don't have the same energy, the get up, the desire to do like what they used to and they don't want to be feeling like that. So those are the kinds of things in a current day to day situation that, you know, people tell me have been problematic, that they want better.
[09:59] B: I just feel like you need, you need every single thing that I have going on, except for like the irritable part, because I'm not really irritable, but I definitely have anxiety right now. I'm like super tense. I don't know why.
[10:12] A: You're in a session with me and there's a whole bunch of people watching us and we're recording it.
[10:17] B: Okay.
[10:19] A: I mean, that would do it to anybody even if they didn't have any crap. Right? I mean, you gotta be thinking about, wait a minute, I'm on stage, there's this, there's this, I've never met this guy. Okay. And I'm gonna start talking about really yucky stuff. Okay. I would be feeling that too, don't you think? Yes. So that's not uncommon at all. But we definitely want to lighten things and calm things down for you. Right. And we'll do that before we deal with any of the yucky stuff anyway. Okay. So the stuff that I mentioned has been stuff other than the irritability because you're not necessarily snappy and irritable, but definitely elevated sense of angst. Lots of stuff that happened, troubling emotions that you feel that you don't want to be feeling. That kind of stuff. Okay. All right. Any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know? Because, like, if we could get that going.
[11:19] B: I just been having, like, flashbacks.
[11:21] A: You have. Okay. And has that happened at different times throughout your day?
[11:25] B: Yes.
[11:26] A: Does it happen at night?
[11:27] B: Yes.
[11:28] A: Do you have, like, yucky dreams?
[11:29] B: Yes.
[11:30] A: Okay. They're not fun.
[11:31] B: No.
[11:32] A: Okay. So we'd like that to stop too. Okay. I know how to do that. I know how to get that to be better. Truly. Yeah. So we can get that to stop. Okay. Any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know?
[11:45] B: I don't know. Not right now. Just depressed, sad, anxious. My thoughts race all the time. And flashbacks.
[11:57] A: Okay. All right. Yeah. So if we could do things that quiet it up top and settle you, that would be a lot better? Yeah. Okay. I know how to do that. That would be great. Okay. So then I'm following you. And I don't even need to know, by the way, the specifics at this stage, because before we would deal with anything that's yucky, you and I need to be on the same page with how we're gonna get it better. Don't you think that would make more sense? So that we're going into this thing knowing what we're doing, and then we can get that cleared easily. So the first thing that I want to kind of lay down as a foundational way of thinking about things has more to do with our brain. So in life, we tend to look at life from the lens that the stuff causes feelings, Whether it's the past stuff that has happened, the current stuff I'm dealing with, or the future stuff that could. It's the stuff that causes feelings make sense. So it's not uncommon. Is there a question? No. Okay. So it's not uncommon in life for us to go. That person doing that thing made me feel this way. When that guy did that, I felt like this. When this thing happened, I felt this way. Silly example, guys driving down the road, jerk cuts in front of him. He slams his brakes. He's pissed. We go, hey, man, why you mad? And he goes, jerk cut in front of me. That's what pissed me off. That's the common way we relate to stuff, make sense. And when we look through that lens, it only gives us two options. Try to change it. We work hard to try to Change stuff. But if I can't change it, then I try to get as far away from this I can. Right? But as you know, in life, there's some stuff I can't change, and then there's some stuff I can't completely get away from. And then we all know that there's some stuff that has happened and I can't get it to have nothing happened. Right. So we got to do something else with the stuff, which is where I'm coming in. It's about adjusting how your brain, the more emotional, automatic, preconscious part, reacts and responds to stuff. So silly example, but it'll make a lot of sense. If we were to think of a lion approaching a zebra, we would agree that the lion makes the zebra scared, right? And that's how most people think of it. But if we looked at Akela from a slightly different lens, we could say that it's not actually the lion, but instead it's when the zebra itself senses, feels, sees, smells, or thinks that the lion is coming. It's really the zebra's brain that's making the zebra more alert, stronger and motivated. So it runs fast away. Right. It's doing it in response to the lion approaching, but it's the zebra's brain that's been doing it to the zebra. Make sense?
[15:30] B: Yes.
[15:31] A: From that weird lens, we're going to say that there's been some ways in which your brain has been working that's been causing you to feel bad. By bad, we're meaning the flashbacks, the racy thoughts, the uneasy feelings, the discomfort. Your brain might be doing it to you in response to stuff past, current, future, but you recognize that way of your brain working has been problematic. That's really the issue that's on the table for us to get tuned up and address so that it stops doing that to you. Make sense?
[16:09] B: Yeah.
[16:09] A: And the second thing to realize about that is you have a brain, but you're not your brain. Which sounds weird, I know, but your brain is actually an organ just like all of the other organs in your body. Your heart, your, your liver, your kidneys, your lungs. And we don't tend to over identify me as another body part. For example, if I've got an upset stomach and I've got gas, I don't say I am gas. But if I have a stupid thought and I say something dumb, I go, I'm an idiot.
[16:48] B: Okay?
[16:49] A: I seriously, right? I over identify my brain as me. The thing we want to realize is that your brain is simply an organ. And what we can do, given it's not you, and therefore you're not the problem. You don't like this feeling or those kinds of thoughts or those troubling memories. So you're not the problem. What's been problematic for you has been some glitches in the way that your complicated brain has been working. And it makes sense because it's a complicated machine. And all complicated machines have errors. Car engines, copy machines, computers, they're complicated. They have errors more. So if yucky stuff has happened. Got it. So we're just going to tune it up so that it stops doing that to you so that instead you're a lot lighter. Right. So the thing that I'm going to tell you now is when somebody starts talking to me about what's been problematic for them, which you've already given me really useful information, what I start to do is I start thinking, gosh, how do we want your brain to be working? What kinds of things do I need to be doing to get your brain to work more in the way that we, you and I, would be wanting it? Got it. So the you that I'm already envisioning, so that discomfort, some of what you've been feeling now, but even when you think about some of the yucky stuff, it has. The you that I'm seeing, she remembers having had those kinds of feelings, those kinds of thoughts and disturbing images. But the you that I'm seeing, she remembers having had it. But if you asked her to get any of that feeling discomfort, the you that I'm seeing, she wouldn't even know how to get it right. So for her, it's been lifted, it's cleared, it's gone. That's right. The you that I'm seeing is more and more what we're going to call emotionally present. She's more and more centered and at peace and more comfortable in her own skin. Got it. The you that I'm seeing is a lot lighter and even more easygoing, and she's free from the effect of the prior stuff. Got it. That's the you that I'm seeing. And again, my question isn't how that's going to happen, that I get you there. My question is, would that be okay with you?
[19:24] B: Yes.
[19:24] A: Okay, cool. So we got a green light. Your brain, by the way, with giving us a green light, is already organizing towards it. So it's already happening. Kind of like if we were to just take a package of seedlings and we were to have a nice patch of soil and we were to plant those seedlings in the soil, we cover them up with dirt, we water the top layer. A lot starts happening underneath the surface before we ever see any of the growth. Same thing has already begun happening inside of you. Change is happening at a deeper level because as I described where we're headed, you're in agreement with it and your unconscious gets to organize towards it. Make sense?
[20:14] B: Yeah.
[20:14] A: Cool. So the second thing I want to lay out for you has to do with more understanding of our brain and how come these glitches have been happening. Okay, so if we're looking at it from the weird lens that it's something your brain has been doing to you, making you feel bad, my first question is, do you think that your brain wants you to feel bad? Yes, it does.
[20:47] B: I don't know.
[20:48] A: It's out to get you.
[20:52] B: Maybe not, but I think it just goes in that direction.
[20:54] A: It does, but not because it's interested in you feeling like crap. I mean, it's also the thing that beats your heart and breathes for you and blinks your eyes when the bug splats the windshield. So it's really out for you, not wanting you to feel bad. But on the flip side, which is another weird question, do you think it wants you to feel good?
[21:14] B: Yes.
[21:15] A: No.
[21:15] B: No.
[21:18] A: Right. That's crazy. It's crazy thought because your brain doesn't give a rat's ass how you feel. Not because it's not concerned about you, but because that's not what feelings were designed to do. What we've learned in working with thousands and thousands of people is even though you're a bright gal, I'm a pretty bright guy. Almost all of our emotional brain works like an animal's brain. And an animal doesn't have feelings because the brain of the animal is concerned about that animal's mood or its affect, or how it feels about itself, or whether it's having a good or a bad day, its level of esteem or sense of self worth, or its own lovability. It causes emotion for three reasons. Get the animal to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. It's that simple. So when the rabbit sees the fox approach, the brain of the rabbit makes the rabbit experience fear. Not because it wants rabbit to have a bad day, but to motivate it to run really fast away. Okay, Right. Squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire pain. But not because the brain of the squirrel wants the squirrel to hate itself, Feel stupid and dumb like an idiot and a moron, marred be embarrassed around all the other squirrels. No it's actually simpler. Just get the tail out of the fire. So all of the negative emotions that you and I experience, the hurt, sorrow, sadness, guilt, shame, regret, remorse, resentment, angst, upset, worry, pain, all that stuff is being caused by, by the part of our brain that works like an animal for the same purpose. Motivate us, do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. So here's where the error comes in. Many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. It's why. Have you ever noticed we tend to feel crappy about the same kinds of things over and over and again? And it's causing us to feel bad, not because it wants us to feel bad, but the issue is that many of what it's trying to get us to solve are in time periods that are already finished. That's the issue. So it's not even about trying to solve the problem. It's about updating the timing mechanism. So the thing about human beings is that our bodies, our physiology is always in now. It's the only place it can be. Our thoughts and our feelings can be now based, but they can also be future or past. So here's where the problem comes. Let's say somebody is thinking about something that could or might happen. And if it were to happen, it would be really bad. When are they feeling all of the distress? Right now, because that's where their body is. If they're remembering awful stuff that happened, when will they be feeling all of it? Because that's where their body is. So the issue is that part of the brain is trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. The good news is that the problem is in a time period that no longer exists. So we don't actually have to solve it. It's much simpler to update the timing. Timing is where it malfunctions. And here's what I mean by that. You can know that you're sitting here with me right now. You can think about something you might do over the weekend and you can remember stuff that you did earlier this morning. No other animal can do that. They don't have access to the timeline of data. They're always now not a problem for you and I, when it's a positive experience or even a neutral one. Because positive or neutral experiences, our brain knows the difference between the memory of it and the experience of it. Somebody's telling me about a trip that they had to the Florida Key. And when they Were down there, they went lobster hunting and they caught like these little tiny blue lobsters. And when they tell you about that experience, you know that they know the difference between the memory of doing it and doing it. They're separate and crystal clear. The problem, Kayla, is when it's negative. And it doesn't matter whether it's a big one or a small one. It doesn't matter if it's one that happened a long time ago when I was really little, recent. And it doesn't matter whether it was a one time experience or an experience that happened many times through many years. All of those negative experiences, the shocking, the painful, the bad, the sad, the upsetting, the horrific, the catastrophic, the traumatic, our brain confuses the data, the memory of it thinking it's the experience. That's why we have the emotional reaction. So let's say this guy is 45 and he's telling us about what his uncle did to him when he was five. And as he's talking to us, he's starting to get emotional and nobody's surprised. We're all saying, of course he would be emotional because uncle did that at five. And that was awful. Except it's 40 years ago. Why is he still troubled? Logically, he knows that it's over. Logically, he knows that it wasn't his fault and he wasn't bad and he didn't do anything wrong. Logically, he knows it had to do with uncle and stuff being off with uncle. And he even knows up here that some of what uncle was doing felt good to him, but not because he wanted it and not because he's gay, but because certain body parts touched in certain ways are designed to feel good. He gets it all up here. Why does he have all the guilt, shame, anger, resentment, pain?
[28:07] B: Probably. Has he never dealt with it?
[28:09] A: I don't know. Because part of his brain never got that it stopped. There's an aspect of his brain that never got the good news. That experience ended. That's why it's stuck on. Make sense?
[28:27] B: Yes.
[28:28] A: Yeah. Once that gets stuck on, our brain does a second thing to us, and that is it scans through. Well, we'll say it in this way. Our brain attaches meanings to experiences, but because when we were little children, we were trained to believe that good things happen when I'm good and that bad things only happen when I'm being bad. Right. So mommy gives me praise and love, and I get presents and cookies. When I'm being good, I get disciplined, I get punished, I'm reprimanded. When I'm being bad. So it's simplistic. Now, as an adult, you and I realize that good things and bad things happen regardless of whether the person is being good or bad. But because of what we learned first, it sticks that if it's bad, it's my fault. So nobody's shocked when the 26 year old who had gone out to the bar with her girlfriends to celebrate a promotion, nobody's shocked when she, you know, met this guy who seemed to be friends with a friend of a friend and he seemed to be nice and he bought her a couple drinks and being a nice guy, he said, hey, I'll take you home. And he did. When they got home, he had forced himself into her apartment and then raped her. Nobody's shocked when she blames herself for being careless and stupid and putting herself in that awful situation. Right. People think, well, it was my fault, why she didn't do anything wrong, but because it was bad, it's my fault. Make sense? So not only do we have bad things happening, we get meanings that are attached that make me feel worse about me. The 4 year old's parents get divorced at 4. The 4 year old doesn't understand that it's a mom dad issue. 4 year old starts thinking, well, if I was a more lovable kid or if I mattered, they would be together. At nine, when dad tells the kid, I'm gonna take you to Disney and then never shows, the nine year old doesn't start thinking, oh yes, I get it. My dad's a drunken alcoholic, he's missing out on hanging out with me. The nine year old goes, if daddy loved me, if I was worth it, if I mattered, daddy would be here. Got it. At 14, when he's dating a girl and you know, middle school girls are pretty fickle. They date for two weeks and then she breaks up. He gets back to how unlovable I am. And at 27, when he's married and he's got a kid and his wife cheats on him, it just reinforces the notion of how unlovable I really am. And it just lives in that pattern over and over and over again. Got it. And once those two things are stuck, our brain does a third thing. It's going to scan through the environment looking for anything that's similar to anything that was painful, but it confuses similar as saying so. The dramatic example would be the soldier diving on the ground. When the firework explodes in the air, it's not because he didn't know it was the 4th of July and that he was at a fireworks celebration. Heck, he lit the firework. It's that a deeper emotional level confused the sound and thought it was the grenade. Make sense?
[32:17] B: Yeah.
[32:18] A: So that stuff can happen, or it could be something that happened at the same time that wasn't even a part of it. Like there was this song playing while the awful thing happened, and now anytime I hear that song, it does that reaction. Well, the issue wasn't the song. It was what was going on. But they happened at the same time, so it gets stuck. Make sense?
[32:45] B: Yes.
[32:46] A: So all of that will continue to haunt until we do one very simple thing. Do you want to know what the simple thing is? Yeah. So the one simple thing is unplugging the memory. Because as soon as the memory is unplugged, all of the discomfort goes away. It's gone, like a light switch turning on. Then what the person knows up here, where they're bright and logical, they actually feel it inside. So those emotions of guilt and anger and resentment and shame and anger and pain and sadness and hurt all evaporate. Gone. And then the cooler part, those other triggers that used to set me off, they can still happen, but I'm not set off anymore. So you get to truly be free from the effect. Won't that be cool? So, again, any questions about what I just laid down? Because that was a whole bunch of information I gave you all at once. There's no question you're following me and it's making some sense.
[33:55] B: Yes.
[33:56] A: Yeah. Cool. Okay, good. So then the next piece is what we really want to do is we want to get your brain and body into. Into a state of rest. The reason that we do that is because all accelerated healing happens when we rest. If you have a cold or a flu or surgery, what do they tell you to do?
[34:19] B: Rest.
[34:19] A: Right. It assists accelerated healing. So we're going to use some neuroscientifically proven brain levers to get our body into more of a state of rest. And the first one is, is you're going to slightly lower your jaw, which will sound silly. So it's not like, ah, but it's just a little bit, maybe the width of an index finger. When you do that, it stimulates our vagal nerve, which is a nerve that really connects to all of the vital organs in our body and begins to move us into parasympathetic response. So you're gonna slightly lower your jaw.
[35:03] B: Yeah.
[35:04] A: Yeah.
[35:06] B: Okay.
[35:07] A: Just. Just like that. You just did it perfectly. That. Right. And then you're gonna. I Know, it sounds silly and kooky. Right. Doesn't it? Right. But you did just a tiny little bit. Just like that. It was pretty easy, right? Yeah. Good. So you're gonna slightly lower your jaw, and then you're gonna rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. When you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, it begins to cause a satiated feeling in the body and also acts to turn down internal dialogue. So you lower your jaw and you rest your tongue. And now begin to breathe in a way that's just a little bit deeper and a little bit slower. That's right. Than how you automatically breathe. That's right. So as you're breathing in that way right now, that's just a little bit slower and deeper. Just begin to check in. And how is your body feeling now? Right. What do you notice? How's your body feeling?
[36:13] B: Feel a little calmer.
[36:15] A: Oh, you feel a little more calm. Right. Because we're having body moving into states. Rest and bringing the energy down. The next part we want to add to it is where all anxiety lives is when we're in narrowed focus, tunneled vision, so to speak. So we want to have the ability to move from that focused vision to more peripheral vision or expanded awareness. So again, you're going to slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, and breathe in a way that's a little bit slower. Right. And a little bit deeper than how you normally breathe. Just like that. And now as you're breathing in that way that's a little bit slower and deeper. Notice how you're looking straight across at me. And as you're doing that now, notice what happens, Kayla, when you allow your awareness to expand. Meaning you're still looking at me, but as you look at me, you can also notice my fingers moving towards the side. Right. And you can begin to pick up more of the space towards the side walls. You can notice the space in between you and me. And even the space behind me. You can notice that there's space underneath the couch that you're sitting on. You can notice that there's space up above you towards the ceiling. That's right. And that even space is behind you towards the back wall and the windows and even out beyond the windows. Notice how much more space and room you're becoming aware of. And as you're doing it again, just check. How's your body feeling now? It's feeling more relaxed. That's right. So as your body's feeling relaxed, I'd like you to think Of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something and it's just beautiful. Right. What is it that you see? Yeah. And isn't there a moment that as you're seeing the beach and the water, that you're experiencing, like, a sense of peace and excitement? Yeah. And people would say to you that it's seeing the beach that gave you those feelings. But if we thought of it from a slightly different lens, we could say that it's in seeing that beach that drew your awareness in towards your center. Because I don't know whether you realize, but at your center, you always are peaceful and excited. Kind of like if I'm at the campfire and I take my hands and I move it down towards the flames, and I go, kayla, the fire's getting hotter. Is it really that the fire is getting hotter? No, I'm becoming more aware of the heat. Right. So we know that in multitudes of occasions in your life, your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Stressors and upsets and angst and guilt and shames and pains. But the way you and I are going to think of things together is that no matter where your awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited. And you know, by the way, that two of us are in this room. Yeah. There's people watching, but there's two of us here. How do you know that?
[39:54] B: Because you're right in front.
[39:55] A: That's right in your senses. Exactly. Bring in that data. Your intellect organizes it. That's knowledge. And sometimes people call knowledge light. So we'll call it light of knowledge. We'll then say that at your center, it's a brighter light, light of wisdom. Right. So now we've got knowledge and wisdom. And I remember working with this one girl. This was probably a decade ago now. She had lots of stuff that had happened with her. Lots of angst and upset, Lots of, like, racy stuff, flashbacks. But one of the things, when she was really little, like five or six, older brother, matchbox car, upper leg. So you can imagine a lot of ugh around all of that. But when we work together, we cleared it out, all that ugh, gone. And so I asked her the question. I said, you know, all of that hurt, the pain, the guilt. I go, where was it? And she looked at me with the biggest smile, and she goes, it's gone. I don't feel it. I said, I know. Isn't that cool? She goes, yeah. I said, but my question for you was, where was it? And the two of us Started thinking. I asked her, I go, was it at the surface levels? And she's like, no, it wasn't an intellectual thing. I said, oh, well, then maybe it was at your center. And she's like, dude, that's dumb. Seriously, how could that survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited? So I sent it to her again. I go, well, then where was it? And she said, well, it was all hiding in the shadows in between the lights. I said, well, what happened? She goes, the lights have joined. They're now touching. Shadows are gone. I said, isn't that cool? She said, yeah. And then we started to think about our bodies. And did you know that you have a body and it's yours, but it isn't actually you? Weird, right? I know that because when my mom was 17, she had a freak accident with a snow cone machine. The tip of her finger off. Awful. Yucky. But when she goes over to visit people now, they don't say to her, hey, Susie, I'm so glad almost all of you could make it. They don't say that. Because even if that part of her fingers missing, she's still there. Did you know that there's no single cell within your body today? That's the same as it was when.
[42:26] B: You were born, Only because I've heard you say it.
[42:29] A: Yeah, they've all been replaced millions of times, right? Your feet alone are longer than they were when you were two. Yet despite all those changes, you're still you. You have thoughts. We already talked about that. You think your thoughts, except your brain thinks them. And you have a brain, and you're not it. So you're not even your thoughts. Well, maybe you're your feelings, except you feel different ways, so you can't be a feeling. And then there's things that you do and stuff that you've done. But when you stop doing one thing to do something else, did you stop. Stop existing? No. Which leads us to a very weird question, right? Because if you're not what you do, or your thoughts or your feelings, if you're not your body, then what are you? For our purposes, with what we're doing today, let's just say that who you are is what you became aware of as you see the beach in the water. Let's just say, Kayla, that who you are is the light at the center. That peace, that excitement. And you know what's interesting about light? It can't be touched or hurt or harmed. It's whole and complete. It's indestructible. It can Only be touched by the love and respect it allows. And I say that because, do you know, when people come in to see me, they screw up their identity all the time. They say things like, I'm anxious, I'm depressed, I'm shy, thinking that the way they feel is who they are. But when I go to the dentist and I come back and I'm upset, and you go, why are you so upset? I go, you'll never believe what he did. You go, what did he do? Well, he first put me in this room. Yeah. And then he put me on a chair where immediately my feet went up and my head went down, like. Yeah. Then he shined a light right in my eyes, and I'm blinded. You're like, yeah. Then he took a cold metal instrument, shoved it right inside of me, and you go, and you're what? And I go, my mouth. I'm at the dentist. But it's the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother. I said, when you were really little, your brother, he messed with your stuff. And she looked at me with that same glowing and peaceful smile, and she said, yeah, he messed with my stuff. And it hurt my feelings, and it screwed up my thinking for a long time. And then she started to brighten and a bigger smile. And she said, but you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body, and it hurt my feelings, but he never got me. I can't be touched in that way. I said, whoa, that's pretty powerful. So again, what you're going to do is just slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue. That's right. Begin to breathe in that way. That's a little bit slower and deeper as you're breathing in the way. That's a little bit slower and deeper. Notice what happens when you allow your awareness to expand out so that you can see me, but you can also pick up more of the space. You might begin to notice the space between you and the side walls and the paintings on the walls. You might notice the space between you and me, the space that's behind me, where the desk and the pictures and the painting and the artwork. You might begin to notice the space underneath the couch. That's right. And the space behind you that goes even beyond the back wall and windows, all the way out. And then just for a moment, become aware of the space between you and the ceiling. And as you're aware of the space between you and the ceiling, I wonder what would happen if you were to imagine being able to float up and out of Your body so that you go up way above the ceiling and beyond the roof so that you're up in the sky like a bird, you're able to soar, just fly, glide and move all around in all ways, way up above it all. And from that bird's eye view, you can see things below. But you're free to soar and glide and fly and move, right? That's right. And bringing awareness back down into your body. That's right. Just check. How's your body feeling now? It is feeling peaceful, isn't it? And see as your body's feeling peaceful, do you know what we have the opportunity to do? Free up additional energy to transform towards where we're headed. Because anytime we've gone through something that was yucky, energy is being used to deal with it, whether I think about it or not. So when those memories get unplugged, all the energy that was stuck gets released. And now it's renewable, restorative, healing energy towards where we're headed. Got it. So what's going to happen in a moment as we're organizing towards the you who's light and clear and free and at peace, no longer troubled by that stuff. Much more content and easy flowing as she's dealing with this stuff, Much more at peace and truly comfortable in her own skin. That's right. And notice how your body's feeling even that much more peaceful and calm. And see, your body's gonna stay in that peaceful, calm resting place. Your unconscious, though, Kayla, is gonna scan back through those negative things that have happened, whether they be recent or longer time ago, and it's gonna begin to categorize, like kind of sort them into groups. And then it's gonna narrow in and pinpoint a particular moment and bring that moment to your attention. Right. And you just got it, didn't you? Right. So let me explain to you before you tell me anything about it, how we're going to go about clearing it, because it's actually really simple. Okay. So one, you're going to intend to emotionally be with me here now. Why? Because this is what's happening and that isn't. And you're here now and that happened back then. Got it. So I want you with me. The reason I also want you with me is because we're organizing towards that you, which you and I are in agreement with. And three, I'm way more fun than sucky stuff, so I want you with me. Got it. Good. When you tell me the what happened, it's going to be facts. It's Going to be fast in a minute or less. So it'll go, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, and it was done. The moment that came to mind happened about how long ago?
[49:45] B: In December.
[49:47] A: So given that it happened in December and we're now in August, almost September, there have been many things you've done after that moment that were more enjoyable than that moment. Right. So what's one thing, anytime from when that happened until now that was more enjoyable than that?
[50:06] B: Coming to Salem.
[50:07] A: Yeah. Coming to Salem. Way more enjoyable. Good. Something else.
[50:12] B: Going to the aquarium.
[50:14] A: Yeah. Going to the aquarium. Way more enjoyable than that. One other thing.
[50:17] B: Church.
[50:18] A: Yeah, going to church. So we got Going to church. We got joining Salo, we've got going to the aquarium. All of those things more enjoyable than that moment. There's an aspect of your brain that doesn't know anything after that moment. So we also have good news to give it. Right. Not just good news that it stopped, but good news that we got to go to the aquarium, go to sailors, go to church. All of those things. More enjoyable than that. Good. So the thing that happened, it was December when it happened. You were where?
[50:48] B: I was in a house.
[50:50] A: So you're in a house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[50:52] B: It was daytime.
[50:55] A: Daytime. And you're where in the house?
[50:57] B: Everywhere.
[50:58] A: Okay. Well, you started where?
[51:00] B: In the living room.
[51:01] A: So you're in the living room. And then what happened next?
[51:06] B: Like, details.
[51:07] A: Yeah. What happened? You're in the living room. Then what happened?
[51:09] B: I'm in the living room and I'm arguing with my ex.
[51:14] A: So you're arguing with him. Right. Good. Like, you're saying stuff and he's saying stuff, and there might be yelling and those kinds of things. Good. Then what happened next?
[51:22] B: I tried to go out the front door.
[51:25] A: Good job. Right. And then what happened?
[51:26] B: He runs up behind me and grabs me by the back of my hair.
[51:31] A: And that hurt.
[51:34] B: Pulls me down and drags me from the living room to the dining room.
[51:38] A: Good job. So he drags me into the dining room. Right. And then what happened next?
[51:40] B: He starts punching me in my back.
[51:42] A: So he hit you in the back? And that hurt?
[51:44] B: My ribs and ribs.
[51:45] A: And that hurt.
[51:46] B: Back of my head.
[51:46] A: Right. And that hurt.
[51:48] B: Then he stops.
[51:49] A: Right. Which was better than when he was doing that part. Right. And then what happened next? And then you're with me. Yes.
[51:56] B: Yeah.
[51:56] A: Hi. There you go. Now you're back with me. Hi. Good. There we go. And then what happened next?
[52:03] B: I get up and I try to go out the front door.
[52:07] A: Good job. Right.
[52:08] B: And he somehow gets to me before I get to the front door.
[52:13] A: Good job. Right.
[52:14] B: Pins me down to the ground.
[52:16] A: Yes.
[52:17] B: Starts choking me.
[52:18] A: Good job. With his hand. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[52:21] B: He choked me for a long time.
[52:23] A: Right.
[52:23] B: And let go.
[52:26] A: Right. Which was better than when he was doing that. Right. And then what happened next?
[52:29] B: I got up and tried to run to the back door.
[52:33] A: Yes.
[52:34] B: And he got me again.
[52:36] A: Good job. Good detail. Right. Then what happened?
[52:38] B: He grabbed me by my throat and was trying to push me against the wall.
[52:42] A: Good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened?
[52:45] B: I was, like, pushing back.
[52:46] A: Yes.
[52:47] B: And something made him let go.
[52:49] A: Yes.
[52:50] B: So then I tried to run, and I went to the bedroom for some reason.
[52:55] A: Good job. Good detail.
[52:57] B: And he followed me in there, started throwing glass.
[53:02] A: Good job.
[53:03] B: And I was crying on the bed.
[53:05] A: Yes.
[53:07] B: And he told me I needed to.
[53:11] A: Shower to be here because I'm. I'm fine.
[53:13] B: And pinned me down on the bed.
[53:16] A: Yes.
[53:16] B: And was choking me again.
[53:19] A: Good job.
[53:21] B: Said that.
[53:22] A: By the way, check your throat right now. Right. Is anything there?
[53:27] B: No.
[53:27] A: Oh, right. Isn't that better? Right. Notice that you can take a big, deep breath. Right? You can, can't you? Take a big, deep breath.
[53:36] B: Yeah.
[53:37] A: Do it. Notice how it's way different. Right. Good. Then what happened?
[53:44] B: I was trying to, like, get free.
[53:47] A: Yes.
[53:48] B: And he told me that I wasn't going anywhere and that he'd killed me.
[53:53] A: Yes.
[53:54] B: And I started screaming, like, I was, like, fighting.
[54:00] A: Yes. And then what happened?
[54:01] B: He was holding me down.
[54:02] A: Yes.
[54:03] B: Punching me.
[54:04] A: Yes.
[54:04] B: And then he wouldn't let me out of the room.
[54:07] A: Yes.
[54:09] B: And he kept, like, stopping, and then he would go and start, like, talking to himself at the wall. And then I'm crying on the bed, and he's coming back and he's holding me down again and choking me. And.
[54:22] A: Yes.
[54:22] B: Finally our roommates came home.
[54:25] A: Yes. Which was better?
[54:28] B: He acted like I was going crazy and said he had to get out of there. And he left, and I took off and went to my mom's house.
[54:38] A: And then that particular time ended.
[54:40] B: Yes.
[54:40] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to the aquarium. Right. Or go to church or go to Salem. Right. Good. So notice as you recalling all of that, there was discomfort, but again, not because that was yucky, because your brain was confusing the memory of it, thinking it's the experience, and it's causing the feeling to try to get you to get it to stop. We've got good news. Know what the good news is? It already stopped Right. Because you're here. Right. Good. So, you know what's really weird is we never go backwards with a memory, but when we go backwards with a memory, it unplugs the memory. It flattens out the neurons, and it takes away the charge. So watch what happens. It's going to be really weird. I'm going to go really fast. Got it. Okay, so we've got, you know, going to church and going to the aquarium and then coming to Sala, and then you're at your mom's, and then you'd gone to your mom's, and then he had left, and then the roommates came home, and then he had been choking you and talking to himself and choking you and talking to himself. And then he'd had you on the bed, and then you'd ran to the bedroom, and then he had pinned you up against the wall, and then you tried to get out the back door, and then you had gotten. And then he had had you on the ground, and then you tried to get out the front door, and then he had let you up, and then you were on the ground, and then you tried to get out, and then he had dragged you into the dining room, and then you had been running, and then you tried to get out, and then you guys were arguing, and then before that, you were doing whatever you were doing. Right. And as I. Right. As I ran through it backwards, compared to you telling it to me forward emotionally, how was it?
[56:21] B: I don't know how to explain how that was.
[56:25] A: Well, I think you just did. Right, Exactly. It didn't have the same feelings, did it?
[56:31] B: No.
[56:31] A: Right. Because your brain is getting that. It's data about something that happened versus happening.
[56:39] B: Yeah. It was completely different.
[56:41] A: Right. Right. Isn't that weird? Right. So here's the third piece with that. Our brain works with what we call patterns of association, not logic. So emotionally, it doesn't get logic. It works with patterns of association. And the pants that you're wearing today, you can remember where you were when you put them on this morning. You can even remember putting them on. But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your pants on? And then I said, kayla, stop putting on your pants. You look at me and go, I'm not putting on my pants. Because you know that there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you doing it. Right. So remember getting dressed, putting your pants on. Kayla, stop putting on your pants. Say, I am not putting on my pants.
[57:24] B: I am not putting on my pants.
[57:25] A: Well, then stop putting on your Shirt. Say, I am not putting on my shirt.
[57:28] B: I am not putting on my shirt.
[57:29] A: Well, then stop me from putting on my pants. Say you are not putting on your pants.
[57:32] B: You are not putting on your pants.
[57:33] A: Well, then stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you are not putting on your.
[57:36] B: Shirt, not putting on your shoes.
[57:38] A: Well, then stop him from choking you. Say he's not choking you.
[57:40] B: He's not choking.
[57:41] A: Well, then stop him from pulling your hair. Say he's not pulling my hair.
[57:43] B: He's not pulling my hair.
[57:44] A: Well, then stop him from talking to himself. He's not talking to himself. Well, stop him from punching you. Say he's not punching me. Well, then stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that. So then where is that? Say it no longer exists.
[57:56] B: It doesn't exist.
[57:57] A: That's right. Which is what we want to get. There we go. Good job. That's right. Last part to this one that you a thought him acting like that had something to do with you. Did it have anything to do with you?
[58:11] B: No.
[58:12] A: No. You know that now, don't you? It didn't feel that way then.
[58:16] B: Exactly.
[58:17] A: Right. But you know that it did. Something was off over there with him, don't you think?
[58:24] B: Yes.
[58:25] A: Yeah. What just happened there?
[58:26] B: I was like. Well, I feel like something was off with.
[58:29] A: Oh, you do? Oh, so it had to do with you?
[58:33] B: I think it had to do with both of us.
[58:35] A: Oh, it did. Oh, so whatever's off with you warrants somebody punching you, pulling you by your hair and choking you?
[58:41] B: No.
[58:42] A: Let me give you an example. Kid comes home, he's got two Ds and two Fs. Mom's pissed. She says, wait until your father comes home. Kid's waiting. Dad gets home, he sees the grades, takes his belt off, starts whaling the kid. The kid is feeling I'm getting hit because I got the poor grades. But is he?
[59:01] B: No.
[59:01] A: No. Isn't there a thousand, at least different ways a dad could handle that other than hitting him with the belt? So did it have to do with the kid? It had to do more with what was going on with dad. Right. So that thing happening, did it have to do with you?
[59:17] B: No.
[59:17] A: Right. Had to do with him. They didn't fully feel that way. Right. So now close your eyes. Picture that earlier, you. And let her know a. That it's over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists. Let her know that that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Then let her know about joining Salah, Let her know about going to the aquarium. Let her know about being at church, that she gets it. That's right. And as that's getting in, just check. What do you notice? You feel happy, right? She's not troubled anymore. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah, that's right. So we got that one lifted and lightened up. Right? Because now as you think about that moment, because you can remember arguing with him and you trying to go out and going you by your hair and then hitting you bunches of times and then trying to choke you out and then being in the vet, the whole thing, you can remember all that happening. Right. And as I just went through that, what'd you notice?
[60:26] B: This is gonna sound. I get like thoughts of like liking it.
[60:35] A: I don't know why you get thoughts of like liking it. Liking it being.
[60:41] B: I don't know how to. Sometimes I.
[60:46] A: I'm like, what's the it that you're liking?
[60:52] B: I don't. Him choking me, like. Or that feeling of being choked. I don't know why.
[61:03] A: Well, okay, so what about you actually liking that aspect of it or how that aspect felt? Maybe not in the role that he was doing it in. What about that's not okay.
[61:18] B: It's not okay.
[61:19] A: Why?
[61:20] B: Because nobody should like to be getting choked. I don't know. It's weird.
[61:26] A: Why? How come?
[61:27] B: This is not normal.
[61:29] A: How do you know what?
[61:30] B: Because it's not.
[61:32] A: I mean, there's lots of people that like having pressure right there. In an intimate sexual experience. There are lots of people that enjoy that. Why do they enjoy it? Because that's part of what it is that kind of acts as a turn on for them.
[61:50] B: Okay.
[61:52] A: I mean, what you do in the bedroom might not be what I do. And what I do might not be what you. You do. As long as people are in consent, there isn't an issue.
[62:02] B: Okay, Right. So it's not normal.
[62:06] A: It's not abnormal at all. Right? Right.
[62:13] B: Okay.
[62:13] A: Right. I mean, you weren't actually liking the part where he was punching you and it was hurting.
[62:19] B: No, I wasn't.
[62:21] A: Right.
[62:22] B: But I think I'm associating it.
[62:25] A: Right. And there may be other stuff that we haven't even dealt with yet. Right. That would be useful to lighten up and maybe there's an aspect of it, you know, somewhat of like, you know, I deserve it. Right. Like some people like to get flogged. Do you know what a flogger is? It's like a big Huge kind of end of like a mop leather. It's heavy and they like to get whacked with it.
[62:49] B: Like what they used on Jesus, I.
[62:53] A: Don'T know what they used on Jesus, but like they get flogged on the high knee or whatever they like it. It's kind of one of their like kinky things that they're into. And if they're consenting adults and they're both okay with it, there isn't an issue. So one person isn't okay with it and the other person is still doing it. That's where it becomes problematic. But that's why I say what you do and what I do might not be the same, but as long as there's consent, it's okay. Right? Right. And again, we've only dealt with one thing. And so the thing. But the question I had for you wasn't about when I went through it, what part you actually said, oh wow, there's part of it that was like a turn on or like for me when I was going through it. Did you notice any discomfort backwards? No. Right. When I just ran through it just a moment ago and I said so you can remember, you know, you guys arguing and you trying to leave and him pulling you by your hair and then him punching you a bunch of times and then you getting up and running and then him grabbing you and throwing you on the ground. Right. You don't have those same feelings. Right. That's what I want you to realize, is that one's been cleared. Make sense? Yeah. And we're on our way to be doing more. So again, as we're organizing towards that, you light and clear and at peace and free, the unconscious parts again are going to scan back through negative things that have happened recent or long time ago, and it's going to bring another moment to mind. Right. And what comes to mind now.
[64:37] B: When I was trying to get away from my trafficker.
[64:40] A: Oh, that happened when?
[64:48] B: I think it happened like last July.
[64:50] A: Huh? Right.
[64:51] B: Or I'm so sorry, June. Last June.
[64:56] A: So you're where and what happened? So it's June.
[64:59] B: Uh huh.
[64:59] A: Uh huh. And you're where?
[65:01] B: We are at a hotel.
[65:02] A: So you're at a hotel. Good. It's daytime or nighttime?
[65:05] B: Daytime.
[65:06] A: Daytime. And you're where in the hotel? Like in a room or by the pool? In the room, in the room. Right. Good. And then what happened?
[65:12] B: I am arguing with him.
[65:15] A: Yes.
[65:16] B: Because he didn't come and pick me up.
[65:19] A: Right. So you're arguing with him. What the hell? Where were you?
[65:22] B: Right.
[65:22] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[65:23] B: And I said, said, I don't have to deal with this.
[65:26] A: Good job. Good detail. Right.
[65:28] B: I'm leaving.
[65:29] A: Yes.
[65:30] B: And one of the other girls.
[65:33] A: Yes.
[65:34] B: Got up from the bed, and when I went to go out, like, go out the door.
[65:38] A: Yes.
[65:40] B: JD Came and shut it, and she pulled me down.
[65:43] A: Good job. Good detail. Right.
[65:45] B: And me and her started, like, not fighting, but we were, like, wrestling kind of. Yeah.
[65:50] A: Okay, good.
[65:51] B: It was like, she didn't want to really, like, hurt me because we were friends, but she was doing it because of him.
[65:57] A: Right. And then what happened?
[65:58] B: And I screamed and I was like, let me the go.
[66:03] A: Yes. Good job, good detail.
[66:04] B: I'm gonna call the cops.
[66:05] A: Yes.
[66:06] B: And that kind of, like, shocked her. I think she let go. And I went to go for the door again, and JD Came beside me and said, you're not going anywhere. And punched me in my face.
[66:16] A: Yes.
[66:17] B: And it made me fall down.
[66:18] A: Yes.
[66:19] B: Next to the bed. And I just started crying.
[66:21] A: Yes. Good. And then what happened?
[66:23] B: And then I got up and went over the bed to go into the bathroom.
[66:28] A: Yes.
[66:29] B: And he came and followed me in there, like, after a couple minutes, and started saying, like, look what you made me do. I didn't want to.
[66:41] A: Good job. The detail. Writing that one up.
[66:43] B: And don't you remember where you were at when I.
[66:48] A: Good job, good detail. Right.
[66:50] B: Haven't I done everything for you? And then he's like, you're not going anywhere. And then he. The whole time, I'm sitting on the toilet crying, and he put down, like, a bag of heroin.
[67:06] A: Yes.
[67:06] B: And was like, here, do this. Take a shower.
[67:08] A: Good job, good detail.
[67:09] B: And when you're done, come out and we'll go get something to eat.
[67:15] A: Good job.
[67:16] B: And he was like, you're not fucking going anywhere.
[67:17] A: Right.
[67:18] B: And then that was it. And he shut the door.
[67:19] A: Right.
[67:19] B: And I did the drugs and took a shower, and we went out and got something to eat.
[67:24] A: And then that part ended. And then later on, you did something more fun, Right. Like a desela and go to the aquarium and see sharks. Right. Manatees.
[67:35] B: Yeah.
[67:35] A: Yeah. Right. And then he went to church. Right. So we got going to church, and we got being at Salem, and we got going to the aquarium, and then, you know, you had gone to eat, and then you had gotten out of the shower, and then you'd done the stuff, and then he had left the bathroom, and then he had left it there. He said, you're not leaving. Look what I did. Look at where you were. You made me do it. And then he come into the bathroom, and then you had gone into the bathroom, and then you were. You got up, and then you had been knocked down, and then you went to go get out the door, and then you had gotten up, and then you said, let me go. I'll call the fucking cops. And then you guys were wrestling, and then she had gotten you to the ground, and then you went to grab. And he had shut the door. And then before that, you're like, where the hell were you? And I don't need to put up with this shit. And then you were in that hotel room, and then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing. Right. Good. And again, as we run through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[68:26] B: It wasn't that bad.
[68:27] A: Yeah. Isn't that weird? It's already being unplugged. You can remember that happening? You can remember wrestling with her and him punching you in the face.
[68:34] B: Oh, yeah.
[68:35] A: Yeah. You can remember washing your hair. No, earlier today.
[68:39] B: Oh, today? Yeah. I was like, actually.
[68:41] A: Right, well, stop washing your hair.
[68:44] B: I'm not washing your hair.
[68:45] A: Well, good. We'll stop putting on your pants. We'll stop him from punching you in the face.
[68:48] B: He's not punching me.
[68:49] A: We'll stop her from grabbing you.
[68:50] B: She's not grabbing.
[68:51] A: Well, then stop that from happening.
[68:53] B: It's not happening.
[68:54] A: Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[68:56] B: It no longer exists.
[68:57] A: Bingo. And again, close your eyes. Picture that. You let her know that it's over, finished. That it no longer exists. Let her know that she's out of there and that she's okay. Let her know about joining Sala's program. Let her know about going to the aquarium. Let her know about connection at church. Right. So that she gets it. That's right. What's happening now?
[69:25] B: I feel happy.
[69:26] A: You do, don't you? Right. Yeah. So, again, things are lightening up. Yeah. So any of you out there have any questions for me about what we're doing? Anyone? You're certainly welcome to ask. Might be different than what you've known. Or not. Yeah. So you're checking in? Just check. How's your body feeling now?
[69:54] B: Relaxed.
[69:54] A: It is, isn't it? Right. Yeah. And we're all about getting all sorts of other things lightened and clear. So again, as we're organizing towards that, you. Your brain is doing all the work underneath the surface. The unconscious part, again, is going to scan back through stuff that happened that was negative. And brain, another moment to mind to clear what just came to mind. Now.
[70:23] B: Another trafficker of mine tracked me down to a hotel room.
[70:30] A: Yeah.
[70:31] B: And pretended like he was a client.
[70:35] A: Yes. So he, like, texted calls. All right, so you're in the hotel room.
[70:40] B: Yes.
[70:40] A: Right. And he kind of texted that because I left him.
[70:45] B: Right. He texted and acted like he was, like, a client.
[70:51] A: Yeah.
[70:52] B: And shows up at the hotel.
[70:54] A: Yes.
[70:55] B: And so when I open the door to. Because he was like, I can't find the room number.
[71:01] A: Yes.
[71:01] B: So I go to go out the hotel room door to. To, like, find the person.
[71:05] A: Yes.
[71:06] B: He comes around the corner.
[71:08] A: Yes.
[71:08] B: And it took me a second to realize who it was, but when I did, he starts running.
[71:15] A: Yes.
[71:16] B: And he has a gun in his hand.
[71:19] A: Yes.
[71:20] B: And he makes it to the door before I could, like, shut it.
[71:24] A: Yes.
[71:24] B: And he pushes his way in.
[71:26] A: Good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened?
[71:29] B: Just so happened that I had another girl there with me.
[71:36] A: Yes.
[71:37] B: And the new. The jd, the other trafficker.
[71:42] A: Yes. Was already in the room.
[71:43] B: Yes.
[71:44] A: Yes.
[71:44] B: And what? They were going to leave when I let. When I let them client. So anyway, they were in there, and Michael runs in, and he doesn't know that they're in there.
[71:57] A: Yes.
[71:58] B: I jump over the bed.
[72:01] A: Yes.
[72:01] B: And Michael's got the gun in his hand.
[72:03] A: Yes.
[72:04] B: And J.D. sees him, and Bella sees him, and they. J.D. says, oh, you fucked up now, and chased Michael out of the hotel room. So.
[72:14] A: Right.
[72:15] B: And then I stayed in the room.
[72:17] A: Just checking this out. As you're telling me that, what'd you notice?
[72:22] B: A lot. What do you mean?
[72:25] A: Well, as you were telling me that, what did you notice in terms of how you were feeling?
[72:29] B: I got a little bit more tense.
[72:31] A: You did. Right. But watch what happens now, because you can remember all that happening. You can remember getting the text, thinking it's going to be a client going outside to find the person, realizing it's him. Him running at you, seeing the gun, you trying to get in the thing and shut the door, but him kind of getting in, you continuing to run, jumping on the bed, and then JD's like, whatever. And then he runs out. And then that particular thing ended. Right. So you can remember all that happening. Right. And then later on, going to the aquarium. Right. So we got Going to the aquarium, and then JD coming back, and then him chasing him out, and then you jumping over the bed and Michael coming in and then him having his arm, and then you trying to shut the door, and then you running back in and then realizing 10 and then going out and then giving the text. And before that, you were doing whatever you're doing, Right. You can remember all that happening, right? You can remember, you know, putting your shoes on. Well, stop putting on your shoes. Well, then stop him from doing that. Well, then, where is it?
[73:34] B: It's not here anymore.
[73:35] A: Yeah, it's not here anymore. So close your eyes and let that you know that she's okay. That's right, that she's okay. And as she's getting that from you, who knows how she's dramatically changing her life now. That's right. What's happening now?
[74:08] B: Feel peaceful.
[74:10] A: You do feel peaceful. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Right. So all sorts of things are getting lightened up. Yeah, that's right. And see, we know that there's been all sorts of other stuff that's happened, whether it be violent stuff or sexual stuff that happened or things that happened in ways that you didn't want to have it happen. So we also want to get those things unplugged. Because what starts to happen with our unconscious is it's really good at taking what it's learned and beginning to generalize it out. But having ones that are different allows it to generalize to all aspects of things. So again, as we're organizing towards that, you who's becoming lighter and more. More clear and free, becoming more and more at peace, comfortable in our own skin again, the unconscious parts will travel back and it might grow you really earlier and younger and younger and earlier, all the way back, back, back. Right. And another moment will be brought to your attention to clear might be one that you haven't thought about in a long time.
[75:29] B: My mom's ex. Boyfriend.
[75:34] A: Yeah. So this thing happened. You were about how old?
[75:37] B: Five.
[75:38] A: You're like five. Good. All right. So you're five. You're where Be with me because I'm fun. Right. Notice how you're there for a minute. Right. So you want to be with me because I'm fun. Hi. Okay. See, there you go. Now you're getting back with me. I'm way more fun. Right, Right. And that's all we want to do because there's all sorts of stuff that got stuck then that we want organized. And don't we want that you to know what you know now? Right. We want her to be free from that, too. That's where we're headed. That's right.
[76:09] B: Yeah.
[76:09] A: So you're five. You're where when that one happened, and it may have happened more than once with this guy.
[76:17] B: It did.
[76:18] A: Right. But we want to think of one time that it did. Okay, got it. Okay, cool. So that happened. You're five. You're where.
[76:27] B: I am. I'm in his bed.
[76:31] A: So you're in his bed, like at his apartment? Yes. Right. So he's in an apartment and you're in the bed. It's daytime or nighttime? Daytime. And you're in the bed. You might have been taking a nap or you might have just been laying there watching tv or you just watch. Brought in there.
[76:44] B: He brought me in there.
[76:44] A: He brought you in there. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[76:49] B: From what I can remember.
[76:50] A: Yeah. Oh, you can make up what you think might have happened. It'll be similar. So he brought you in there.
[76:59] B: I don't remember what he would exactly say to me, but he would just do things to me.
[77:07] A: Well, what did he do? Like, what's one of the things that he. They did notice how it's already making that discomfort. I don't want you free from that.
[77:14] B: Yeah.
[77:14] A: Yes. He'll be here. Hi.
[77:16] B: He would have me.
[77:18] A: Yeah.
[77:25] B: He would have me, like, suck his.
[77:32] A: So you might have. He might have put his penis in your mouth.
[77:34] B: Yeah.
[77:34] A: Right. And that was weird. Right. And then it might have gotten bigger, and that was weird. Right. And then what might have happened?
[77:41] B: He would, like, do things to me down.
[77:44] A: So he might have touched between your legs.
[77:46] B: Yeah.
[77:46] A: Right. He might have put his finger in your vagina.
[77:48] B: Yes.
[77:49] A: Right. And then some of that might have felt good. Some of it would have been weird.
[77:52] B: Right.
[77:52] A: And then what might have happened next?
[77:57] B: That was basically it for a period of time.
[77:59] A: Right.
[77:59] B: Put anything in me.
[78:00] A: Right, Right. And then he might have ejaculated at some point, I think. So you wouldn't have known what the heck that was because it would have been, like, all weird. And then that would have been over. And then you would have left the bed. Right. And then gone on and done something else. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to the aquarium. Salah. Right. Or, you know, go to church. So we got being at church and Sala going to the aquarium. And then before that, you're out of the room, and then he might have ejaculated, and he, you know, was touching your body in between your legs and in your vagina. He might have had you touch his penis and then have his penis in your mouth. And then before that, he brought you to the bedroom. Then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing. Right. And again, as we ran through it backwards, you had a little bit. Right. Well, what's happening now?
[78:45] B: I just feel like that Was gross.
[78:47] A: It was gross. Yeah. When it happened. Then it did happen. Then it did, didn't it? And it's not happening now, is it?
[78:55] B: No.
[78:55] A: No. And that's a really good news thing. Right. And you know a lot more than you did then. Right. So you can remember getting your nails painted.
[79:03] B: Yes.
[79:03] A: Yeah. Well, stop painting your nails.
[79:05] B: I'm not painting my nails.
[79:05] A: Well, then stop me from painting my nails.
[79:07] B: You're not painting your nails.
[79:08] A: Well, then you stop putting on your pants.
[79:09] B: I'm not putting my nails.
[79:10] A: Well, then stop him from touching between your legs.
[79:12] B: He's not touching between.
[79:13] A: Well, then stop him from putting his penis in your mouth.
[79:15] B: He's not putting his penis in my mouth.
[79:16] A: Well, then stop me from eating cheese.
[79:18] B: You're not eating cheese.
[79:19] A: Well, then stop him from doing that.
[79:21] B: He's not doing that.
[79:21] A: Well, stop me from putting gel in my hair.
[79:23] B: You're not putting jelly.
[79:24] A: Well, then stop him from doing that.
[79:25] B: He's not doing that.
[79:26] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[79:28] B: It no longer exists.
[79:29] A: Right. And him doing that, did that have anything to do with you?
[79:31] B: No.
[79:32] A: Right. But you didn't know that then.
[79:34] B: No, I didn't.
[79:35] A: Right. So now close your eyes. Yeah. Let that earlier, you know that it's over. That it's finished. That it's defeated. It's defeated because it no longer exists and you're still here. Let her know. That's right. That that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with him. Stuff. Being off with him so that she gets it. That's right. That's right. Let her know about seeing the sharks in the aquarium. Right. Let her know about how she's transforming her life. Right. And you can even begin to let her know that she has a vagina, but she's not her vagina. Right? Right. Cause it's stuff. Isn't that interesting?
[80:24] B: Yeah.
[80:25] A: Yeah. And what's happening now?
[80:27] B: I feel lighter.
[80:28] A: Oh, you do? You feel lighter. Right. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. Right. And see, there's a really interesting thing that I want to show you. Take that hand. Hold it up. Good. Look at that spot there. Perfect. Now I'm going to take mine from over here. I'm going to move it towards you. It's moving in as it gets closer, you can see it getting closer. But you'll notice that before it ever touches, you'll be able to feel it right there.
[80:54] B: Yeah.
[80:54] A: Right. Isn't that cool, that here you can feel the energy from my hand. Right. Different when it's over there, you can see my point. With it here, you feel it. Now do you know what that means? I'm actually coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with respect and love. Right? So repeat these words. I have a nose.
[81:22] B: I have a nose.
[81:23] A: I have 10 fingers. I have two elbows and 10 toes. But I'm not my fingers and I'm not my nose and I'm not my elbows and I'm not my elbows and I'm not my toes.
[81:36] B: And I'm not my toes.
[81:37] A: And I have a vagina.
[81:38] B: And I have a vagina.
[81:38] A: And I'm not my vagina. My vagina is mine.
[81:42] B: My vagina is mine.
[81:43] A: But it isn't me.
[81:44] B: But it isn't me.
[81:45] A: So he messed with my stuff.
[81:46] B: So he messed with my stuff.
[81:47] A: And it screwed up my thinking.
[81:48] B: And it screwed up my thinking.
[81:49] A: And it hurt my feelings. But he never touched who I really am.
[81:53] B: But he never touched who I really am.
[81:55] A: He never touched my essence.
[81:56] B: He never touched my essence.
[81:57] A: He never got me.
[81:58] B: He never got me.
[81:59] A: He messed with my stuff. And it hurt my feelings.
[82:02] B: And it hurt my feelings.
[82:03] A: And it screwed up my thinking.
[82:05] B: And it screwed up my thinking.
[82:06] A: But he never got who I really am.
[82:08] B: But he never got who I really am.
[82:10] A: He never touched me.
[82:11] B: He never touched me.
[82:12] A: He messed with my stuff.
[82:14] B: He messed with my stuff.
[82:15] A: But he never got me.
[82:16] B: But he never got me.
[82:17] A: Right. Take a big deep breath in. Exhale. Good. Rest that hand down. Close your eyes for just a moment. And as your eyes are closed, letting that information filter all the way in towards your center. That light that is. You can't be touched. That's right. That's right. Strong and powerful. Becoming more and more free. Lighter. That's right. More and more peaceful. Letting that earlier. You know how strong, brave, powerful she is. That's right. That's right. That's right. And what's happening now just feel good. You do, don't you? Right? Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. Right. So I want you to just check for a moment. Thinking about what we talked about. What happened with the ex boyfriend before the roommates got there. What happened with JD what happened when Michael came in. What happened. What happened with mom's ex. When you think about all of that stuff right now, what do you notice?
[83:59] B: I. I don't know. I feel. I don't feel anything.
[84:03] A: You don't feel. Right. Isn't that interesting? Notice how different that is Right. Notice how different that is and how different than it's ever been. Right. Isn't that a good news though? Yeah. Yeah. So what has been some of the flashbacks that you've had?
[84:27] B: A lot of it has to do with my ex and I think it's because it's like the most recent thing that happened to me right before I came to Salah and my traffickers.
[84:37] A: Yeah. So let's think of like one of those that you used to have because those flashbacks would be like short little gifs, replays where they be pictures.
[84:50] B: Yes.
[84:50] A: Like photographs of it or would it be like a short little like it's.
[84:55] B: Like a photograph and a feeling.
[84:57] A: Like just a photograph and a feeling. Yeah.
[85:00] B: I can replay the whole thing if I want to.
[85:03] A: Right. But it's just typically a photograph of one particular moment.
[85:06] B: Yeah. And it can. It'll happen like out of nowhere and I don't know if it's a word.
[85:11] A: Sure.
[85:12] B: Somebody says or sound or smell or what, but it'll just be like.
[85:17] A: Yeah. So when you see them, those pictures, where do you see them?
[85:23] B: In my mind.
[85:23] A: Yeah. But like where, like are they like right in front? Do they come up from up? Are they on the sides? They're right in front. Is it like really close or is it out here?
[85:33] B: Very close.
[85:34] A: Very close. Is it like life size or larger than life when you see it?
[85:38] B: Life size.
[85:39] A: And when you're seeing it, are you seeing you in it or are you seeing it like you're looking through your eyes?
[85:45] B: I'm looking through my eyes.
[85:46] A: Oh, well, I wonder what would happen if you started seeing it where you were just looking at it as if you were to see you in the photograph as well. Oh, well, just check. You don't know, do you? And I wonder what would happen then instead of it being so close, close it move to the other side of the room. Right. So just check one of those things because you know what the content is and just see it over there. But see you in the picture too over there. And notice that we can make that picture just a little bit smaller so it like kind of becomes like a, you know, three by five picture over there that you're seeing you in it. And as you see that same thing that normally used to cause those feelings. What do you notice now about the feelings when you're seeing it over there and you're in.
[86:38] B: Doesn't seem as big or.
[86:42] A: It doesn't seem as big, does it?
[86:44] B: No.
[86:44] A: Do you have the same feelings? Oh, you mean it's not so scary?
[86:50] B: No.
[86:50] A: Or troubling?
[86:51] B: No.
[86:51] A: Huh.
[86:52] B: I feel like it's kind of like I'm watching somebody else.
[86:55] A: It does, doesn't it? Right. Because part of what you didn't know, why it was a problem is that you were seeing it from your own eyes. Right. You didn't realize that that was going on. And now I wonder what would happen, not just seeing that picture and you in it, but also seeing everything else in the surroundings. So everything else that was also going on when it happened. So if it happened in a room, you can see the entirety of the rest of the room and maybe the entirety of the rest of the area where that room is located, whether it be in a hotel or a house or anything else. And you can see all of that in that picture. What's happening now? It seems small. Right, right. And notice what's changed with it over there than when it was close, because, I mean, we could bring it. It could get closer. Right, right. And as it's closer, you notice it's a different. Right. Than when it's way over there. Isn't that interesting?
[87:59] B: Yeah.
[88:00] A: Yeah. That location matters. Right. And if we shrunk it to that three by five, and it's down on the bottom over there, and like, you're kind of looking down at it, so it's down by that baseboard thing over there.
[88:12] B: It just seems far away.
[88:14] A: It does, doesn't it? Right. And when it seems far away and you're seeing you in it and you're seeing all of the rest of the things that were also in that space. Right. How does your body feel now?
[88:30] B: Normal.
[88:31] A: Well, it does. Does it? And when you think about that ex boyfriend, because there's other stuff that he did. Right. And was he somebody that you were using with?
[88:40] B: Yes.
[88:41] A: You were. Right? Right. And so he was actually using, too. Oh, by the way, how long have you been clean?
[88:48] B: I have been clean since February.
[88:53] A: Since February. Good job. That's awesome. Right? You're gaining that much more distance from that stuff too, right? Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. Right, Right. And you're actually seeing more for you now, like what your life can be? Yeah. What are you seeing for yourself now?
[89:19] B: Like, what I want to. What I can be.
[89:21] A: Yeah. What are you seeing for you now that you might not have before?
[89:24] B: I'm going to be the best mom that I can be to my son.
[89:29] A: Oh, cool. How old is your son?
[89:30] B: He's four.
[89:31] A: He's four. All right, cool. And you're on your way, aren't you? And don't you know that you're a lot closer to it now than you were before you ever entered this program?
[89:42] B: Yes.
[89:44] A: Right. And you know that, don't you? Yes. Right. And you can totally get it. Yeah. Isn't that a good new study? It really is. Yeah. Good job. Right. So we're all about getting things to be rewired and reorganized inside so that you're much lighter. Right. Right. And there's been other stuff that's happened along the way, other yucky things. But what might be another one of those kind of like moments that you see the picture?
[90:22] B: You want me to tell you?
[90:23] A: Yeah.
[90:26] B: My stepdad was pretty abusive.
[90:31] A: Oh, how so? Physically?
[90:35] B: Yes.
[90:36] A: Verbally? Both. Oh. So he was a really great guy to hang out with.
[90:40] B: No.
[90:43] A: I'm sorry. He'd be a great guy to just like, kind of just like chill it. No. Right. So one of the times that happened with him, you might have been how old I was.
[90:56] B: I think I was like 14.
[90:58] A: Yeah. So you might have been 14. You might have been where?
[91:00] B: I was in the bedroom.
[91:01] A: You're in the bedroom. Good. Right. Then what might have happened? Like your bedroom, his bedroom, mine, Your bedroom. Right. Good.
[91:06] B: And it was nighttime.
[91:09] A: It was nighttime. Right.
[91:10] B: And somebody called the phone.
[91:13] A: Yes.
[91:14] B: He was asleep in his room. Somebody called the phone. And I answered it.
[91:17] A: Yes.
[91:17] B: And it was like past 9:00.
[91:20] A: Yes. And that was a no no in that house.
[91:25] B: And so he got up.
[91:26] A: Yeah.
[91:26] B: And he hurt. Well. And I was just asking, or I think I don't remember who it was. But anyway, he comes opening up the door.
[91:37] A: Yes.
[91:37] B: And he had already had the belt in his hand, so he must have heard the phone and.
[91:42] A: Yes.
[91:43] B: Already knew. I don't.
[91:44] A: Right.
[91:45] B: And.
[91:49] A: He be here because I'm fine. Remember?
[91:51] B: He snatches the phone out of my hand, grabs me by my arm and just starts like whooping my ass with the belt.
[92:00] A: Right.
[92:00] B: And not even on my ass. It was on my legs, on my ass.
[92:04] A: So he wasn't even very active back.
[92:06] B: No, it was really bad.
[92:09] A: He was bad aim to begin with too. So hitting legs, hitting butt, hitting back. Right. Then what happened?
[92:14] B: He wouldn't. He just wouldn't stop. He just kept going and going.
[92:17] A: Right.
[92:18] B: And I'm crying and he's yelling at me, saying, I don't even remember.
[92:23] A: Don't answer the phone after 9. Don't have people call.
[92:28] B: Totally warning.
[92:29] A: Whacking you with the belt so much. Then what happened?
[92:36] B: And he. He stopped.
[92:38] A: Yes. Which was way better than when he was hitting you.
[92:41] B: Yes.
[92:41] A: Yeah.
[92:42] B: And then that was it. He let he. Oh, I think he might have grounded me.
[92:45] A: And then went out because that wasn't punishment enough.
[92:48] B: Right. And then went, you're grounded, too.
[92:52] A: Great. And then he left. Right.
[92:57] B: That was it.
[92:58] A: Right. That was over. Right. But I want you to check, even as you were telling me about that, what'd you notice?
[93:06] B: I don't get it.
[93:08] A: Didn't have the same intensity, did it, that it normally did. Right. Isn't that cool? It's already getting less. Because what your brain is starting to do is get it and apply it to other things. So we can just. You can remember him doing that and hit you in on the legs and on the butt and on the back. Bad aim. I mean, come on, dude. If you're going to do it, you got to, like, at least, you know, get the right spot.
[93:31] B: Yeah, right.
[93:34] A: Right. He couldn't even do that. Right. That's right. Right. But you can remember him doing that and yelling you about the phone. You can remember the phone ringing. You can remember all that happening. Right. And you can remember washing your hair and then how long it took to dry because it's really long. That's right. Well, stop washing your hair.
[93:51] B: I'm not washing.
[93:52] A: Well, then stop him from hitting you with the belt.
[93:53] B: He's not hitting me.
[93:54] A: Well, then stop him from grabbing you.
[93:56] B: He's not grabbing.
[93:56] A: Will you stop putting on that bracelet?
[93:58] B: I'm not putting on the bracelet.
[93:59] A: Well, stop me from putting on my watch.
[94:00] B: You're not putting on.
[94:01] A: Well, then stop him from doing that.
[94:02] B: He's not doing that.
[94:03] A: So then where is it?
[94:04] B: Say it's not.
[94:05] A: It's not. Right. It no longer exists.
[94:07] B: It no longer exists.
[94:08] A: That's right. And again. That's right. Him doing that, was that about you?
[94:14] B: No.
[94:14] A: No. It felt like that.
[94:16] B: Yes, it did.
[94:16] A: Right. So let her know. Right. Close your eyes. Let her know it's not about moving. It's not about me. Had nothing to do with me and everything to do with stuff. Being off with him. That's right. That's right. Yeah. So that she gets it right. And that you start to lighten up on you, that you're okay and strong. Right. And brave, Powerful. That's right. Yeah. And what's happening now?
[95:02] B: I feel calm.
[95:03] A: You do, don't you? Yeah. Right. That's right. Isn't that a good feeling? And by the way, isn't it really different?
[95:12] B: Yes.
[95:13] A: Then how you felt when you walked in.
[95:15] B: Yes.
[95:16] A: Right. With all the uncertainty of what this was gonna be like. And then people Watching. Holy cow. Right. But notice what's happening.
[95:31] B: I feel good.
[95:33] A: You do, don't you? Right, right. So going back to that thing, because we got the X. And was there times, like, when you were being intimate at other things where feeling that pressure there actually was a turn on? Yeah. Right. Follow me with that. Right. So it's in context. Know what I mean by that?
[95:58] B: No.
[95:59] A: What I mean by that, it has its certain place where doing that is part of the fun of it. Follow me with that.
[96:11] B: I do.
[96:12] A: Which is different than it being done at times that I'm not. Okay. It's being done. Follow me. Right. So when you think about that and him doing that at that time that you weren't wanting him to do was a different thing.
[96:32] B: It was a different thing.
[96:34] A: That's right.
[96:35] B: I feel like he used it against me.
[96:37] A: Like, how so?
[96:41] B: Because that wasn't, like, the only time he, like, choked me out. So, like.
[96:48] A: I don't know. Yeah.
[96:49] B: Another time that he did, he was, like, choking me, but, like, we were arguing. So he's choking me, but he's. He's telling me, you like this shit, don't you? You know, and so he, like, totally twisted it around on me. And then so now, like, when I. I don't know, I feel it's just.
[97:12] A: Well, let's just check it. Well, it's because the part has been confusing. So what we want to do, Kayla, is get you clear.
[97:20] B: Okay.
[97:21] A: Right. Right. Because is there an aspect of it. Right. That is enjoyable?
[97:33] B: I don't know.
[97:34] A: Well, I'm following you. That you don't think it should be.
[97:37] B: Right.
[97:39] A: Which is different than the question I'm asking. Right. You don't think it should be. And how come you don't think it should be?
[97:47] B: Because I think that it can be used against you. I don't know. I don't know. People aren't nice, so they might hurt you.
[98:02] A: Right. So it's not okay when somebody's doing it in a way that's about hurting you. Right. Is it okay if it's being done in a way that's not about hurting you?
[98:25] B: Yes.
[98:26] A: That's about play and pleasure.
[98:28] B: Yes.
[98:29] A: Oh, right. So would it be okay to have it done if it's on your terms, as part of a sexual play thing?
[98:40] B: Yes.
[98:41] A: Right. Got it. That doesn't mean that that's what I want.
[98:48] B: Okay.
[98:51] A: You follow me? So what I'm saying is it can be in a particular context if I'm with somebody that I'm intimate with and we're both in agreement. And it's part of a play and I've got say as to how it's happening or whether it stops or not, then it's okay. Okay, follow me with that. If it's being done intentionally to hurt me, that's a whole different story. Right, because we all have different, what we call sexual templates. Templates are what we find appealing, erotic, desirable, and arousal. And nobody has the same ones. We all have varying degrees of different ones. We're all on a continuum. And it can go from heterosexual to homosexual, and it can go from any activity in between. So I worked with a woman one time, and one of the things that was a turn on for her was to have that pressure. Now, she had also had a lot of violence, abuse that had happened to her growing up. And what troubled her was that was a reminder of the other stuff that had happened.
[100:09] B: Yeah, it is. But why do I like it?
[100:13] A: Hold on. That's why I'm giving you this example. I'm following you. So the problem for her at first was that it was a reminder of all that yucky stuff. However, for her it was also a turn on. So she wanted her husband to do it at times, but was feeling really bad that she would be wanting it because she thought it was tied into all of that. Right. So is there a possibility that that would have been the case for her even if she hadn't had any of the other stuff happen?
[100:51] B: I don't. That's what confused. No.
[100:54] A: What wouldn't?
[100:55] B: I don't know.
[100:57] A: Well, I mean, does somebody wake up and decide to be gay?
[101:00] B: No.
[101:01] A: No. If somebody likes brunettes, do they decide that?
[101:05] B: No.
[101:06] A: Right. I mean, we hear the common ones for guys, I'm a butt guy, I'm a boob guy.
[101:11] B: Right.
[101:11] A: So if the guy's into that, does like, did he choose that all of a sudden? No. He could be into it regardless of whether he experienced it. If he's a boob guy, does that mean that his mom had to have big boobs when he was a baby? No. Might not be a part of it at all. Follow me with that. So that could be the case even if she hadn't gone through that stuff. However, the part that she liked was in being intimate with him. So what did we do? We got it. So that it was okay to put pressure here, which isn't here, but it almost does the same thing. And that she got to determine how much pressure and for how long. She got to be 100% in charge, which is the difference when it was happening to her at times that it was uncomfortable was when she was not in charge. Got it?
[102:23] B: Yes.
[102:23] A: When she's in charge that she gets to say the amount of pressure and for how long and if she wants it to stop, it does. That's a completely different thing. Right? Yeah. And as you're beginning to realize that, just check. What do you notice?
[102:51] B: Feel normal.
[102:52] A: Yeah. Right. Because that was the other part. You were thinking, wait a minute, it's not okay that that at times is a turn on for me. Right. Except as we're looking at it, with you completely in charge of it, is it? Okay? Yes, it is, isn't it? Right, Right. Because you get to have say and don't you get to have complete say about what happens to your body?
[103:25] B: Yes.
[103:25] A: I mean, it is yours. Right? Right. And that's where the ownership starts happening, that it's yours because you've gone through lots of experiences where it hasn't felt like your body and what happens to it is completely determined by you. There are times in growing up that it was determined by other people. There are times that when you were being trafficked and doing that, it wasn't always determined by you. Right. And we know that sometimes when I'm doing that whole trafficking thing, there might be a person that I'm more interested in. So it's easier with than a person that I'm not as interested in where it's awkward or uncomfortable. We know that that thing happens. Follow me with that. Right. So that wasn't all on your say, but how about now?
[104:22] B: My say?
[104:23] A: It is, isn't it? Right. It's your body, it's your say. Right. And now that you're clean and clear, you're stronger. Right. Did you know that?
[104:39] B: Yes.
[104:39] A: Yeah. By being clean and clear, you have to be stronger than you were. Can't be the same, can't run the same, it doesn't operate the same. Right? Yeah. So again, just slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue. Begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper than normal. Right. As you're breathing slower and deeper, allow your awareness to expand out. Right. So that you can pick up more of the space that's in between and all around the space that moves towards the side walls, the space out in front and behind, the space below and up above. How much more space in a room there is. That's right. And then in a moment, go ahead and close your eyes and with your body at rest, imagine what it might be like to float way up above beyond the ceiling and roof, up above in the sky, in space. And just like a bird, you're able to soar and glide and fly and move all around in all ways in all directions. Soaring, gliding, flying, making big wide turns, gliding through the sky, big arching angles. Soaring and moving all around in all directions. Light and free to become more and more of who you really are, which is so much more than all the stuff that has. And nobody goes through yucky stuff to get stronger, but everybody who makes it to the other side is much stronger and clear and resourceful. And you're becoming more and more free. That's right. Lighter and more easy going. That's right. Bring your awareness back down and into your body. Re associating within your body. Light, easy, flowing, energy free at the center. And then whenever you're ready. That's right. You can open your eyes. Yeah. What are you noticing now?
[108:10] B: I feel really light.
[108:14] A: You feel really light? Yeah. And calm, right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Do you know what's different in a dream? A dream tends to be like a paper tiger, which loves to scare people. And you might think, why would anybody run from a paper tiger? They'd only run if they didn't know it was paper. Because tigers are big and ferocious and will kill you in an instant. Do you know what paper tigers hate, though? Catching people, water, scissors, fire. Because once you realize that it's paper, can it scare you anymore? Right. So all those dreams where you've had bad ones, which tend to be about trying to get away, I wonder what would happen if you started moving towards. Some of them were all about being frozen and we're not moving. I wonder what happens if you're soaring. Would it be scary anymore?
[109:30] B: No.
[109:32] A: Right. You ever notice that all the dreams always happen, you know, when it's darker? What happens if it was light? Right. How scary do you think a horror movie would be if it was right in the daylight? Right. They don't do Halloween horror nights during the day, only at night. Because if you can see the person hiding behind the bush to jump out to scare you, it's not as scary. Right? That's right. So I want you to try to get troubled by one of those flashbacks now that you used to have, you know, where you'd see what you saw.
[110:14] B: I can't.
[110:15] A: No. It's not happening, is it? No. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. So where are you originally from?
[110:25] B: Bradenton.
[110:26] A: Here. Oh, my goodness. So you're not far away. And is Your son local then, too?
[110:32] B: He's in Riverview.
[110:33] A: He's in Riverview. So pretty local.
[110:36] B: Like an hour away.
[110:40] A: And who is he staying with?
[110:41] B: His father.
[110:42] A: Okay. And his dad is okay?
[110:45] B: Yes.
[110:46] A: Cool.
[110:48] B: Yeah, he is a good dad.
[110:49] A: Well, that's a good news then. Yeah. Yeah. And you're on your way, right? So is there any stuff that we haven't gotten to yet?
[111:02] B: I mean, there's a whole bunch of stuff, but, like.
[111:07] A: Well, just check one of those whole bunches of stuff right now. Just kind of run it mentally in your mind, you know, see it go by.
[111:19] B: I don't know. I can't think right now. Like, I'm. I don't know.
[111:26] A: What do you mean, you can't think right now?
[111:28] B: I don't know. I'm in a good place.
[111:31] A: You are? Oh, well, just think about one of those other things because, like, there's been years of stuff that's happened, right? Stuff that might have happened with traffickers, stuff that might have happened with sexual encounters with different people. Stuff that happened. Is there anything for you where there's been, like, lots of, like, guilt or shame, regret or remorse, those kinds of bad feelings? You're thinking about one of those right now. Are you feeling a little bit of it?
[112:07] B: I'm feeling more ashamed.
[112:09] A: Oh, okay. Would it be okay to get that gone?
[112:13] B: Yes.
[112:13] A: Huh. So what is it that you were feeling that about?
[112:31] B: It's kind of embarrassing.
[112:34] A: Well, they don't tell me if it's kind of embarrassing. I only like to know really embarrassing things. Kind of ones. I don't really care that much.
[112:41] B: It is really embarrassing.
[112:42] A: Oh, it is. Good. Phew. All right, then. I really want to know. Now you got my curiosity peaked. But you're embarrassed because it happened, or are you embarrassed because you can conceive of having not done it? Ooh, weird. What? What was that statement? Are you embarrassed because it happened, or are you feeling it because you can conceive of having not done it?
[113:10] B: Both.
[113:11] A: Oh.
[113:13] B: Yeah. I'm embarrassed because it happened, and I can conceive of not doing it.
[113:18] A: Oh. Well, what if you're not embarrassed because it happened? What if you're embarrassed because you can conceive of it having not happened? So let me give you what I mean by that. So let's say this guy's brother had asked him to go on a motorcycle ride a year ago, and he didn't go, and his brother died. He's feeling guilt. He's feeling it, thinking he's feeling it because he should have gone on the Ride. But he's not feeling it because he should have gone on the ride. He's feeling it because logically, he can conceive of having gone on the ride. And if he had, his brother might still be alive. That would be better. So because he can think it, his emotional brain goes, oh, if you can think it, we can do it. So it's basically telling him that feeling, hurry up. Go on the ride with your brother a year ago, quick. Can he do it? No. But that's where the error is. See, our emotional brain works like an animal, and an animal can only think of doing things that it can actually do. If it can't do it, it can't think it. Right. Porcupines aren't trying to build hang gliders to fly, because if they can't do it, they can't think it. Dogs aren't depressed because they can't climb trees.
[114:40] B: It's not fair.
[114:42] A: And wolves don't look at birds and go, if I had wings, I told be after those. Because if they can't do it, they can't think it. So animals live that. If I can think, means I can do it. So the embarrassment feeling is your brain trying to motivate you to get that to not happen. Hurry. Timing is screwed up again. But here's the second part. There's information that you know now, right. And if you had known everything that you know now prior to doing that. Right. Like, if we were to float back down the timeline to prior to you doing it, knowing everything that you know about it now, would you have done it?
[115:25] B: No.
[115:26] A: Oh, isn't that interesting? Did you know, by the way, that you can't actually have regret and remorse, guilt and shame about something you didn't know was gonna happen? Right. And see, that you back then didn't have all of what you know now? She didn't know that that was gonna happen. Because when we floated back along the timeline, I asked, if she had, would she have done it? And you go, no. So just check. What do you notice happening to the feelings now?
[116:02] B: I still feel bad.
[116:04] A: Oh, you do? Same. More or less.
[116:09] B: I don't. I just feel disgusted.
[116:13] A: Oh, well, would it be okay to get that gone? Yes, it would be. And you're disgusted because of what happened. See, I'm not thinking it is because you can remember doing it, right? Right. You can remember putting your shirt on.
[116:30] B: Yes.
[116:31] A: Right. Kayla, stop putting on your shirt. Well, then stop doing that.
[116:36] B: I'm not doing that.
[116:37] A: Well, then stop brushing your teeth.
[116:38] B: I'm not brushing your teeth.
[116:39] A: Well, stop me from brushing my teeth.
[116:40] B: I'm not brushing your teeth.
[116:41] A: Well, then you stop doing that.
[116:43] B: I'm not doing that.
[116:43] A: Well, stop putting on your pants.
[116:45] B: I'm not putting on my pants.
[116:46] A: Well, stop me from kissing my daughter.
[116:47] B: You're not kissing my daughter.
[116:48] A: Well, then you stop doing that.
[116:49] B: I'm not doing that.
[116:50] A: So then where is it doesn't exist anymore. That's right. And as you're getting that, just check with the feelings now. Oh, that's a good breath. And what do you notice happening to the feelings?
[117:03] B: I feel calmer about it.
[117:06] A: You do? We still don't like that you did it, though.
[117:08] B: No.
[117:09] A: Right. Do we have to.
[117:10] B: No.
[117:11] A: Think that it was one of the top three experiences ever?
[117:14] B: No.
[117:14] A: Right. We don't. But so now that it's not about what happened, it's coming from the thought that you shouldn't have done it. But we know that you didn't know what you know now, or you wouldn't have done it. Right. Which is starting to loop. But see, your brain is, like, yelling at you, trying to motivate you, to get you to stop doing that. So I'm going to say to you, remember doing that? I'm going to say, kayla, stop doing that. And you're going to say to me something different. You're going to say, well, there's nothing to be done. I'm gonna say, no, hurry. Stop doing that. And you're gonna go, there's nothing to be done.
[117:53] B: There's nothing to be done.
[117:54] A: No. Hurry, Stop doing that. Quick.
[117:56] B: There's nothing to be done.
[117:56] A: No. Come on, let's go. Stop doing it. Come on.
[117:58] B: There's nothing to be done.
[117:59] A: Why? Because it no longer. Because it no longer exists. That's right. And now check. What do you notice happening to the feelings?
[118:09] B: They are.
[118:12] A: Oh, is the embarrassment still there? No. Oh, it isn't. Hmm. But you had it there, right? How about the disgust?
[118:24] B: It's less.
[118:26] A: It's less. Okay. What are you disgusted about? Is it a sexual thing that happened?
[118:33] B: Yeah.
[118:34] A: That you're, like, embarrassed that it happened and disgusted that it did?
[118:39] B: Yes.
[118:39] A: So it had something to do with sexual stuff that you didn't want to have done?
[118:43] B: Yes, with my stepdad.
[118:45] A: Oh, okay. So he did sexual stuff. Right. So he might have touched between your legs. He might have put his penis in your vagina. He might have had you touch it. He might have had it in your mouth. That might have happened?
[118:57] B: Yeah.
[118:57] A: Okay. And you might have been how old?
[119:00] B: I was old enough.
[119:01] A: I was like, see, that's where the problem comes. Ah, right. Yes. Because you were 21. Right? Right. Huh. And, you know, you were, you know, completely clean and sober.
[119:13] B: No.
[119:14] A: Oh. Oh, you weren't. Huh? Well, you weren't actually completely clean and sober.
[119:22] B: No.
[119:22] A: Oh. And who gave you the stuff?
[119:25] B: Well, he gave me money, and I went and got the stuff myself.
[119:28] A: You did, right. To allow that to happen. Did he do it too? No, no. He just had you do it. Right, Right. To put you in a vulnerable position. Right. So that that stuff would happen.
[119:42] B: Yeah.
[119:42] A: Oh, right. And that. What's happening now. Right, right. Because I'm just going to check, you know, you even at 21, you know, completely stone sober and in your right mind, is that something that you're doing with him?
[120:07] B: No.
[120:08] A: Right, Right. Oh, so you didn't realize, right. That when he gave you the money to do that stuff, he had a whole different motive. Right. You didn't know that. Right. Because here's the other question. If you had known that him giving you money so that you could do that stuff was about him being able to do that with you.
[120:35] B: I don't know. Because I was so messed up. I don't know if I would have cared if that makes sense.
[120:42] A: Right. So you were so messed up prior to that?
[120:47] B: Well, I mean, I was dope, so I was like.
[120:50] A: You were.
[120:50] B: Weren't you willing to do anything, I guess, to get high or to not be sick? And so I don't know. And that's where I feel disgusted, is like, I don't know if I would have said no, you know? Like, I know that he. He gave me the money and I would and got the stuff and then came back home, But I feel like I knew what was gonna happen and I just didn't want to accept it. Or maybe I just didn't care at that time. And that's where I feel bad.
[121:26] A: Okay. So would it be okay for you to be okay even if that wasn't?
[121:32] B: Yes.
[121:33] A: Okay, cool. Cause here's where it's going. Going on, where the conflict is and why you're not fully okay yet with it, is that you're actually thinking that if I'm okay, no longer troubled by what I did, no longer having that discussed, it means that what I did was okay and what I did was not okay. So how the f. Can I ever feel okay? Follow me with that.
[122:00] B: Yes.
[122:01] A: Okay. So let's get that.
[122:03] B: Okay.
[122:04] A: You're doing great, by the way. Absolutely. It's fun. So when I was 12, I got my own basketball court. I love Basketball. I've got these big hands and I would shoot like every day, multiple times. Good basketball player, right? My dad tended to think of my basketball court as his driveway. Sometimes a dude would park right in the middle of my court. Now, I knew that if I put the car in n, we had an old Buick, it would roll down the driveway, it would be out of my court, I'd be able to shoot. Now, I don't know what was going on with my dad, but when I went to get out of the car, he was standing there, he was screaming at such a high decibel, I couldn't understand what he was saying. His face was like smoke and gray, had a vein pulsating. His eyes were dark. He grabbed me and he started punching me multiple times in the face. He broke my nose. I've got a lovely bump. There was so much blood, you could literally wring out my shirt. Now, some people tell me I'm a good therapist and I do good work and you've got a few years, but if you want your kid to grow up to be a good therapist, you should really. Right. Me being okay. No longer hurting, no longer troubled, no longer sad, no longer in pain about what my dad did. Does that in any way, shape or form mean that what he did was okay?
[123:40] B: No.
[123:40] A: Right. My dad on the flip side, no longer having an guilt, shame, regret, remorse, embarrassment over what he did to me. Does in that any way, shape or form mean that what he did was okay?
[123:59] B: No.
[123:59] A: Right. So I get to be okay and so does he. Right. Even though that wasn't okay. Right. Right. Which is what's starting to happen in you, that it's now become okay for you to be okay. Because you being okay doesn't mean that what you did was right. See, what was going on back then is you were being impacted by all the thoughts, feelings and experiences that were happening. And with all of that stuff going on the way that it was, in the situation that you were in, with the way you just did what you wanted occurred for you to do and you couldn't have not done it, even if from right now we don't like it that you did. Follow me.
[124:47] B: Yes.
[124:47] A: And that's why I said if you were clean, clear, sober, and in your right mind, not dope, sick and fucked up, would you have done it?
[124:59] B: No.
[125:00] A: That's right. Right. Right. That's right. And see, you doing that wasn't about you. You were trying to feel better because you were going through all sorts of withdrawal stuff from having been hooked on stuff Right. And then he did that. Right, right. And with all that you had experienced and everything else it was is going on, like, I just need to get and not feel this way. Right, right, right. Yeah. And as you're getting all of that, just check. What do you notice?
[125:44] B: I feel better.
[125:46] A: You do, don't you? Right, right. Because you doing that wasn't about wanting to do. We got that that happened. But it wasn't like, oh, yes, I'm gonna do this so I can do that. Right. What you were doing was trying to get yourself. Okay. Because you were going through all sorts. Follow me with that.
[126:11] B: Yes.
[126:12] A: And that's different. Your motive in going in getting that wasn't so that later on you could do that with him. That wasn't like your plan about it. Yes, that happened. And that might have been in the back of your mind that it could possibly happen, but all you were concerned about was like, I gotta not feel this way anymore. Follow me. Right. Yay. Now notice what's happening. Right. Notice how you're lightening up on you. Because where it's been is that you were pretty hard on you. Right? Right. Yeah. And what's happening now?
[126:57] B: I just feel. I don't know. Good.
[127:03] A: Yeah. Right. Because we don't have to like that it happened to be getting that it couldn't have not happened. Right. And we don't have to like that it happened to get you to be free. Right. From the effect that it's been having on you. Right? Right. Yeah. There we go. And now close your eyes and let that you back then when she was really dope sick, let her know that she's clean and clear, she's free from all that crap. She's been clean since February. That's right. Let her know how she is totally in charge now of positively transforming her life to become the best mom that she can be and more that she sees so much more for herself.
[128:08] B: Right?
[128:11] A: That's right. And as that's getting in, what do you notice now?
[128:18] B: I feel happy.
[128:23] A: Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. Yeah. Right? Yeah. You're becoming more at peace and you're lightening up on you because it's from this vantage point that you've been looking back at that earlier, you thinking that she was a freaking idiot. Except it's different. You can't be Monday morning quarterbacking with all that you know now. Right? Right. Because she couldn't have known that that was going to happen even if she had a thought in the back of her head that it could all she was really interested in doing was getting out of the state that she was in. Yeah. And you get to lighten up on you. Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[129:27] B: Yes.
[129:30] A: Right. So notice how things are changing. Notice how you're feeling different now. Right. Because just check. Is there anything about that one happening back then that's troubling you now?
[129:44] B: No.
[129:45] A: Right. Notice how different that is. And you don't even have that discussed. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. That you actually get to become more at peace with you. Hmm. Right. Yeah. We wouldn't want to actually feel really good about that. That's right. That's right. Because, you know, when people make really good decisions is when they feel good. You know when people make really bad decisions.
[130:09] B: What?
[130:10] A: When they feel bad. Right. So you're on your way to feeling a lot better. Yeah. Yeah. Right. And check again. Right. Because there's a whole bunch of content that we haven't dealt with. But what we're really interested in doing is changing the structure. And see, that one came up because it had some structural differences than what we had already dealt with make sense. So it enables the brain to begin to generalize out even more. Yeah. Right. So that your brain, on its own, begins to clear things. Right. We all learn how to tie sneakers on one pair, but once we've learned it and we get a different color, does somebody have to reteach us? No. If you learned on white sneakers and then you got blue ones, they go, whoa, these are different. They're blue laces, not white laces. Let me show you how they're done. You'd go, I got it. I know how to do this. Yeah, but you only learned on white ones. I know. It's the same thing. Right. Got it. Or the bicycle that you learned to ride on or the car that you learned to drive, you can drive all sorts of different ones. Now, I remember the first time that I was driving, my head and my arms were connected, so when my head turned, so did the car. That was scary for the person showing me, Right? Yeah. And I remember my stepdad telling me that when you go into a corner, as you're coming out of the corner, you need to accelerate out of the corner. So I did. But what he didn't tell me ahead of time is that going into the corner, I needed to slow down, so I went into the corner fast and then accelerated really faster. And there were people on the sidewalk that literally jumped out of the way because they saw this car coming really fast and turning right yeah. So just check with other stuff that you've gone through, other things that, like, you've got bad feelings or have had bad feelings about.
[132:36] B: Okay. I'm in my. I'm in Michael, my trafficker's trailer.
[132:49] A: Yes.
[132:50] B: And there's a group of us.
[132:55] A: Yes.
[132:55] B: And he has his gun.
[132:58] A: Yes.
[132:59] B: And I was just being a smart ass, but I was like, why do you always carry that gun?
[133:05] A: Right. Good job.
[133:07] B: Do anything with it.
[133:08] A: Yes.
[133:08] B: And he pulls it out and he fired it off like three times in the trailer. In the trailer.
[133:16] A: Yeah. He's a smart guy. Right? Like up in the air.
[133:19] B: Yes. And it was so loud and scary.
[133:22] A: Right? Loud in a trailer. Small.
[133:25] B: Yeah.
[133:26] A: And metal.
[133:28] B: It was. It was more actually like. It was like an rv, like.
[133:32] A: Right.
[133:32] B: But I call it a trailer because it was parked.
[133:34] A: Because it's metal, too. Right. So it would be louder. Right. And then it was loud and scary.
[133:39] B: Very.
[133:40] A: Right.
[133:41] B: And he did that a lot to.
[133:44] A: Show you that he would shoot. And you were going, yeah, but not at people.
[133:48] B: Right. So he fires it in the air.
[133:53] A: So check it out. Isn't that interesting? You're going, why do you. Why do you carry that gun with you? You're not going to use it. And he showed you. Yes, I will. And he shouted up, not at. And your whole thing was like, not. Oh, wow. That you can shoot it in the air. Actually shoot us. Right. And he didn't, did he?
[134:13] B: No.
[134:14] A: Right. You don't have any bullet holes in you.
[134:15] B: No.
[134:16] A: Right, Right. So I want you to just check. What are you noticing now, what you think about that moment?
[134:30] B: I just.
[134:33] A: Ooh. Right. Ooh, exactly. Right. Is it scary now? No. Right, right. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? All right. Because he did it in a way that. That's not what you were talking about. Right, right. Because you weren't meaning it in that way.
[135:08] B: I don't know why I said it.
[135:09] A: No. But it's funny right now because how he demonstrated that he would use.
[135:14] B: It wasn't even.
[135:20] A: Right, right, Exactly. He'd be better off not having anything in it. Right.
[135:30] B: It was just as scary.
[135:32] A: Yeah. How scary is it now?
[135:37] B: It's when I hear loud noises.
[135:40] A: Well, I want you to check right now.
[135:42] B: No, it's not scary.
[135:43] A: It isn't. But it had been scary. Right. So you can remember it happening. So now close your eyes and let that, you know what you think about it now. Why are you curating that? I can use it. Bang, bang, bang. Huh? Well, that wasn't what I was talking about in terms of Using it. Right. You didn't even use it in the way that I was scared of. Right. And it just made that loud noise. But that's because that you, in that moment, wasn't sure that she was going to be okay. Didn't know whether he was going to turn it out. But as you realize that you're okay, you made it through that. Right? Right. And so that she knows that she's okay, is it scary to her anymore? Right. It's not, is it? She's not scared, is she? Hmm. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So you're gonna notice that being different, because remember, our brain only confuses things that are structurally similar. If it thinks the other stuff is still on. Right. When it realizes that it's not, it stops. So you may even have a loud noise and it might start, but it won't do the same thing and it'll diminish and go away. Right. Because what we're really interested in doing is getting it so that you're more emotionally now present here with me. And ongoingly so it's quieter up top. And therefore we go decrease the intensity and stress. We decrease the frequency in the spikes, we shrink the duration in which it lasts. Because you're going to have challenging, stressful, troubling things, but we want you to move through them quickly because what's the likelihood in life that there won't be any angst or agitation or anger or hurt or.
[137:57] B: There'S going to be.
[137:59] A: Yeah, Right. So we just want you to move through it faster.
[138:02] B: Yeah.
[138:03] A: So instead of being a mountain to climb up over, it's a speed bump. Nobody likes speed bumps. They're annoying as all get out, but you know, once you're past them, they're over. Right. And it doesn't take too long to get through them. Right? Yeah, Right. Right. So just check. How's your body feeling now?
[138:31] B: Relaxed.
[138:32] A: It is, isn't it? Even though you've been talking about really troubling stuff, your body's relaxed, huh? Right. I wonder if that means that your body's getting it before you do. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Just like the seeds in the soil start growing before you ever see any of the results, and more happens underneath the surface before it sprouts. Right. Oh, what's happening now?
[139:04] B: I'm just thinking of imagining flowers growing.
[139:10] A: Right. And doesn't a lot happen below the surface first?
[139:14] B: Yes.
[139:15] A: Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing, that things are changing for you for the better and on their way to even better still? Right. Yeah. So what's another one that might, you know, pop up or has popped up?
[139:35] B: I can't think of anything.
[139:37] A: Oh. Huh. Isn't that interesting? Well, you know, try to get one of those flashes. You know, somebody might say something. There might be one of those smells you might be thinking of, like, you know, what happened with the axe or the trafficker or.
[139:54] B: I mean.
[139:59] A: Right.
[140:10] B: I'm imagining my stepdad, and he is really angry at my little sister, and she was, like, 3 years old, and he's holding her by her arm, and he's whooping, like, her ass with the belt.
[140:29] A: And was he a better aim then?
[140:31] B: Screaming? No, it was. It was even worse. And he's horrible. And after he's done, her nose starts bleeding.
[140:39] A: Right.
[140:39] B: She was so upset. Upset. And.
[140:47] A: Right.
[140:47] B: I. There was another time that.
[140:50] A: Well, you just thought of that. We still don't like that it happened. But how are you.
[140:57] B: Angry or just maybe upset about it?
[141:02] A: Would it be okay for you to not be angry?
[141:04] B: Yeah.
[141:04] A: If you're not angry, does it mean that what he did was okay? Right. And your sister, she's not three.
[141:12] B: No.
[141:12] A: Oh, so she made it through that? She did. Oh. And she's okay. Right. So close your eyes and let that you know that she's not three and that she's okay and that she made it through it. Right. Right. What's happening now?
[141:43] B: I feel calm.
[141:46] A: You do, don't you?
[141:48] B: But I feel like I'm angry at him.
[141:53] A: Mm. Well, then stop him from doing that.
[141:56] B: I can't.
[141:57] A: No. Hurry. Stop him from doing that.
[141:59] B: I can't.
[142:00] A: No.
[142:00] B: Hurry.
[142:00] A: What are you waiting for?
[142:02] B: I can't stop him from doing that.
[142:04] A: Why?
[142:04] B: Because he's not doing that.
[142:07] A: Yeah, well, he's not doing that. She's not three. Stop him from doing that. Hurry.
[142:12] B: He can't. He's not doing that.
[142:15] A: Right. So hurry. Stop him from doing that. See, he's not doing that.
[142:18] B: He's not doing that Right.
[142:19] A: Now check what happens to the anger. Right. Did you know that we have that emotion to get us to do something, to get something to stop, but when our emotional brain gets that, it stops. The feelings go away. Right. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. So what was the other one that came to mind?
[142:46] B: This was when. Before my mom got sober.
[142:50] A: Yeah.
[142:51] B: Alcohol.
[142:51] A: Yeah.
[142:53] B: Her and my stepdad were really drunk, and I heard, like, a bunch of noise going on in their bedroom, so I went to go and see what was going on, and he had her on the floor, and he was choking her out.
[143:11] A: Yes.
[143:12] B: And he, he. Well, I think. I'm so sorry. They were arguing and it made me go and get my grandmother. My grandmother lived next door, which is his mom. And I ran over there to get her, ran back to the house, and when I came back and went into the bedroom, he had her on the floor choking her out. And my, my grandmother was there and I was like 7 or 8.
[143:45] A: Yeah.
[143:46] B: So my mom is like, I'm like trying to get him to stop and he's telling her to go to sleep and. And my man is like trying to hold me back. And my mom's looking at me and she's saying, it's okay, baby. And I'm thinking in my head that he's going to like kill her because I didn't know that you could like choke somebody out and just pass them out. So I'm thinking, and my mom's eyes are closing and he did pass her out and he let her go and.
[144:16] A: Right. So notice how scary that was. Notice how you're there. Oh, well, be with me. Because do you know what? We have really good news. Yeah. Get here. Hi. Notice how you're there. So check. Watch. Be a mirror. Do you know what that means? If you were to be my mirror, what would you have to do?
[144:41] B: Look at you.
[144:42] A: Right? But what am I doing? Thank goodness you got it right. Do you know how many people actually put up the other hand? And I go, man, if I mirror did that, I'd be really freaked out. But now you're back here. Hi. Much better to have you back here with me. Yeah. So you can remember all that happening and how scary that was for that younger you because she didn't know what you know. You can remember him doing that. Right? But see that you didn't know that mom was going to wake up later, but you do. Oh, and that mom's gonna get clean and sober. You know that? I wonder what would happen if the seven year old. You got to know that from you. You can remember all that happened, right? You can remember washing your hair?
[145:24] B: Yes.
[145:24] A: Well, stop washing your hair.
[145:26] B: I'm not washing.
[145:26] A: Well, stop putting it in your pants. We'll stop him from doing that.
[145:29] B: He's not doing that.
[145:30] A: We'll stop her from saying that.
[145:32] B: She's not saying that.
[145:33] A: Well, stop that from happening.
[145:34] B: It's not happening.
[145:35] A: So then where is it?
[145:36] B: It doesn't exist anymore.
[145:37] A: That's why. Right. It doesn't exist, period. That's right. And now let that you know that mom's okay, right? That she goes through that and then mom later on wakes up and she's okay. Right? Right, that's right. So that she gets it. And then she knows later on that mom got herself clean, sober, clear. Right. She's okay. That's right. I don't know what's happening now.
[146:36] B: I feel calm.
[146:37] A: You do, don't you? Right. And think back to that seven year old you being really confused. How about now? She's not, is she? Hmm. Isn't that cool?
[146:54] B: Yeah.
[146:55] A: Yeah. Right. That lightens up. Mm. Right. So all sorts of things are getting healed, right? Yeah. Because check. How's your body feeling now? It is, isn't it? Yeah. Isn't that cool? Right. And we took care of lots of different things today.
[147:21] B: Yeah.
[147:21] A: Right. So can you even imagine how different things are going to be?
[147:28] B: No. I guess I don't know what's going to happen.
[147:30] A: Well, just kind of think, given all that stuff was content situations that had been really troubling, that whenever you thought about any of them, you had yuckiness. Now you can think about them. The thing that happened at 7 with mom and stepdad, what happened with little sister at three. The thing that happened with stepdad when you were dope sick. The thing that happened with jd, the thing that happened with Michael, the thing that happened with the ex. The thing that happened with the ex, boyfriend and mom. When you think about all that stuff, Right. What are you noticing?
[148:15] B: I just don't.
[148:18] A: It's just data, isn't it?
[148:19] B: Yeah.
[148:20] A: Yeah. And you're okay, aren't you? Right. Isn't that a good news thing? You're okay. Yeah. Right. You're becoming more free. And see, without all that there, guess what else you get to become? Oh, right. The sky's the limit. You get to be more of who you really are, which is so much more than any of that stuff. Right. Isn't that awesome?
[148:48] B: Yes.
[148:48] A: Yeah. And you're going to notice it in lots of different ways. So with what we've done, you're going to notice it in the moment. You're going to be in a situation that normally would produce that response and it's not going to be there. And you're going to think, that's weird. Wow, that's cool. You're going to go through experiences and after it, you're going to think back going, normally I would have been and I wasn't. That's cool. You're going to notice the intensity and the frequency and the duration all shrinking. It might come up and then it's going to go right away and you're going to be like, oh, okay. Right. And those things can't scare you like they did. Those images aren't going to be troubling because they're farther away and they're a lot smaller. And you're seeing you in it, it just looks like. Right. They can't run. It's kind of like the person who scares you with a mask on, and you don't know that they were wearing a mask, and then they take it off, and then they go, let me scare you with it again. Wrong. You're, like, not scary because I know it's a mask. Same thing. Got it.
[149:58] B: Yeah.
[149:59] A: Yeah. So that stuff's not going to be running you anymore. And then there's a whole opening for you to blossom. Right. And become even more of who you are and on the way to even that much more. And that's what's happening now. Makes sense.
[150:14] B: Yes.
[150:15] A: Yeah. Cool. So anything else left for you for today? All right, so then we're good for now. Cool. And then I will see you, I'm sure, at the house.
[150:29] B: Okay.
[150:29] A: You did great work today.
[150:31] B: Thank you.
[150:31] A: That was lots of fun.
[150:32] B: It was.
[150:33] A: Yeah.
[150:33] B: Very good.
[150:34] A: All right, let's see. I'm gonna let Kayla walk out, and I will talk with all of you on the Zoomer thingamajigger.
[150:43] B: Thank you.
[150:43] A: You're welcome. Hi, everybody. Hi. How are you? So any questions about what happened or how it went or any of that stuff? Have you guys ever seen anything like this? I've never seen anything like this.
[151:15] B: All right.
[151:16] A: I recently had some sessions with Dr. Rodrigo, so I, like, totally knew it, but it was cool to see it from a different perspective. Yeah. Right. Well, he does a lot more downtime. Meaning he does a lot more time with your eyes closed.
[151:32] B: Yes.
[151:33] A: Than I do. I kind of like doing a lot more uptime stuff than downtime stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Although he did three sessions instead of one long session. Well, he did. Right. But he's also going to do a lot more of you closing your eyes and using those kind of principles in that way. I kind of have to bring my personality and be silly.
[151:56] B: Yeah.
[151:59] A: Cool. Is there anything for anybody that I can clarify or elaborate? I'm gonna have questions, but I think I need a little time to process first. Okay. So maybe I'll put them on that box. Okay. Yeah. So notice that the whole emphasis with Kayla was about getting her to be more free. Right. And for those of you that were on at the beginning, could you see the difference in her affect? She was, like, rocking and Kind of just like tense and uh huh. That's beginning. Right. And then did you notice how she was when we were done? Light smiling. Yeah. And there's another part of how symmetrical she was. So you know that you get things cleared at a visceral body level for people when they become much more symmetrical, like their body aligns up. Yeah. So a lot of my communication, although it's going to be talking to her conscious mind, is really about working with her body, her unconscious mind. And I utilize that process with the brain based levers to get her body into a state of rest so that it's much more receptive and responsive for change. I mean there are processes that you can use where you use symbolic activators. Rodrigo, I would imagine uses some of those. Let's get a way to symbolize the you. You know, those are also all very useful things. But there are a variety of different tools. And if you notice, the essence of what I was doing was about keeping her emotionally present. So if you can remember one thing when dealing with any kind of trauma, it's always about keeping the person emotionally present as they recall the past experience. A lot of what I did at first was to pre frame or format her brain so that we could and that I had connection. But even in that last one when she was 7 and seeing her mom get choked out, she went right back there. She was in that moment for. And then my job was to get her out of it, not to encourage her to emote about it and how awful that was for her. And that had to be scary and horrific. It was about getting her back to being present because the adult self knows what the younger self didn't. And that information we want to get in so that she gets it as well. And that's what started to change that last part for her. Right. So we dealt with abuse that happened with traffickers. We dealt with sexual stuff, sexual stuff that happened with a stepdad when she was dope sick. We dealt with stuff that happened in childhood violence and childhood sexual abuse that had happened with mom's ex boyfriend, you know, and there may be things when I meet with her a second time that will be about dealing with issues that may revolve around mom because mom was kind of off to the side. And of course mom brought those people to her life. Mom had problems with addiction and mom had all sorts of things. And if she was 21 when the thing happened with that stepdad, then mom would have been with that man for a long time. And that man was pretty, pretty Verbally and physically abusive. But what an amazingly strong, powerful, resilient woman she is to have made it through all of those situations and still be here to be now clean and sober for six months more. Right. I mean, what an amazingly resilient young woman we have there. And how much better life is going to be for her. No longer being haunted. And one last little part. I did a piece about changing location and the modality and how it showed up. So I asked what I would call structure, not content questions like when she sees the flashbacks, where does she see them? And she said first in my mind and then I said no, but like where? And I gave her the reference point and it was really close. So in an embodied way, the bigger and closer something is, the more intense I'll feel it. She was associated, meaning she was looking through her own eyes at the snapshot versus seeing herself in the picture. Right. If she sees herself, she's disassociated. So that's going to change how her brain has it coded. We moved it, we made it further away, we put it smaller, we put it down below her, we put her in the picture. All of that changes how her brain is able to do it. It's about giving different points of view and perspective. Because trauma gets stuck in one point of view, one perspective, we don't see it from many. Kind of freezes it at that moment. Make sense? Okay, I just have one question about like when you would snap. Uh huh. Is that connecting to like just keeping her in the room or is that just like it's. Yeah, like auditory. So there's. There's two pieces to it, Val. One is where I'm snapping is up and to my left, which is going to be her foot. Future or visual construct. That's also where I put the future self of her being calm and clear. And what the snap does in a Pavlovian sense is it reminds her unconscious. That's where we're headed. And it's about getting it, that it's done, that it's data, that it's memory, that it's not happening. So that's why I go up into that snap side and I'm snapping up there because if I notice her being in the trouble, I want to be able to bring her out. One easy way to do it is snapping towards the future self. I put all of the positives of how we want her to be up in that same quadrant. So now it's all anchored and it becomes a chain of anchors and becomes a powerful resource state. For her. So that's why that happens. Other questions? Anything else that I can clarify? All right. Thanks for this. It was really awesome to be able to watch it. Cool. Well, very good. Awesome. If you got any other questions, certainly let me know and we can be good for now. All right. Anything else? Right. See, there you go. You're learning. Good job. All right. Very good. You guys have a great holiday weekend. You, too. Thanks. Alrighty. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
[160:18] B: It. They're like, you know, the macho and they're always back. Shut up. It's just like they're damaging something.
[162:50] A: Like a whole bunch of parents. Yes.
[162:54] B: It's just like I tell the guys at this point, because we don't know what to do or how to respond. I don't want to just not respond at all.
[163:01] A: Right.
[163:02] B: Until we figure out how to respond correctly, no response is better than bad response.
[163:06] A: Yeah. Neutrality.
[163:08] B: So.
[163:08] A: Right.
[163:09] B: Yeah. Okay. I'm glad I asked you.
[163:10] A: Yeah, absolutely. All right. Nice job.
[163:13] B: Thank you.
[163:14] A: Hold on. Hold on. An hour. In a month.
[163:18] B: Okay. Very good.
[163:20] A: Thank you. And then we can follow up if you ask or you talk.
[163:25] B: Okay, I will.
[163:26] A: I'm going to ask them right now. Okay. Okay. All right. Have a great weekend. Oh, did I go get the card?
[163:31] B: Yes.
[163:32] A: Okay. All right.
[163:33] B: Yes, you did. Okay. Okay. That party.
[168:49] A: La. It. I know that I don't want to.
[170:06] B: It. I.
[171:23] A: Yeah.
