[00:00] A: Alright. So today is the 27th of January, Madison. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is valuable, that might be made available in teaching and training others. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes. Yes. Okay, cool. So first I'm interested in terms of. And it's been a really long time, but how our last session left you.
[00:22] B: Good.
[00:23] A: What have you noticed for yourself? When you think about the different experiences that happened and the guys that did the different things, what do you notice in terms of how you feel about it now?
[00:32] B: More detached or really? Like, I'm not emotional about it. Like, I've been doing victim's advocacy course where I talk about more of like other people's rapes and other people's traumas. And I notice that doesn't affect me. Like, it can be like, maybe that's not good, or I can relate to that. It's not like a. Yeah, cool.
[00:50] A: Oh, that's awesome. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. What else have you kind of noticed in terms of how things have been for you? I know that you said a shit show. So, like, awesome. How so?
[01:04] B: I got Covid.
[01:05] A: Okay.
[01:07] B: And there's like a back house property. Like there's our main house and then there's like a back house that's like two of them. Yeah. And so when I got Covid, they're like quarantine and threw me into the back house by myself.
[01:20] A: Okay. And to just be by yourself.
[01:24] B: Yeah, to quarantine.
[01:25] A: Okay. So you weren't gonna be around other people no more. They bring you like food underneath. Yeah.
[01:29] B: I was like. Felt like I was in jail, but a little bit of a nicer jail.
[01:34] A: Nicer jail with a couch, bed. No change.
[01:37] B: No.
[01:38] A: Right. It was like, you know, you could go outside.
[01:42] B: Yeah.
[01:42] A: And walk around.
[01:43] B: Yeah. But I got very depressed in that. Didn't really want to be there anymore. And I felt like people weren't hearing me and felt sort of abandoned and sort of the facade of I'm okay broke. And I was just like, not okay. And I started to accept that more, which is good. I overcame that and I broke a pattern of running when things are uncomfortable, which is good.
[02:09] A: Oh, so maybe you needed to actually go through something that caused you to be uncomfortable and not run. Yeah. Right.
[02:16] B: So it's good now.
[02:18] A: It wasn't fun going through it.
[02:20] B: No.
[02:20] A: But you're better off for it.
[02:22] B: Exactly.
[02:22] A: Because you got that there's something bigger than even the momentary discomfort. Right. Because we don't have to. Like, exactly where I'm at right in this moment, but it's not gonna last. Exactly.
[02:35] B: And it sucks. Cause I was supposed to start school, and then I got sick, so I couldn't start school. And it was like all these things that I was, like, expecting to happen just didn't happen, so.
[02:41] A: Oh, you mean you actually got life happening? Yeah. Oh, good. Fuck life, man.
[02:46] B: Yeah. I thought it'd be easier once I got clean, and that was a complete lie.
[02:50] A: Yeah, some bullshit.
[02:53] B: Get clean because life will be better. Well, it will, but it won't, you know, in other ways. Right.
[02:58] A: Yeah.
[02:58] B: Actually. To deal with life. Yeah.
[03:02] A: So. Okay.
[03:03] B: Yeah.
[03:03] A: And you did.
[03:04] B: Yeah.
[03:05] A: Yeah.
[03:06] B: Someone, somehow.
[03:06] A: And you learn that even though I didn't feel good and I was down, I didn't like what I was dealing. All the stuff that I had anticipated happening, not happening. I still move through it, and I'm okay.
[03:16] B: Yeah.
[03:17] A: Yeah. How cool is that? It's cool, right?
[03:19] B: I mean, like, the most part.
[03:22] A: What isn't cool about you moving through it and being okay?
[03:26] B: Moving through it? I think it's just being in the moment of the emotions and trying to deal with the emotions and how to cope with them appropriately and how to. Like, I've been struggling how to express how I feel.
[03:35] A: Feeling right now.
[03:38] B: I mean, not now.
[03:39] A: Oh, when?
[03:41] B: With the advocates.
[03:42] A: Oh, just expressing how you feel with them so that they get it.
[03:46] B: Yeah.
[03:46] A: No. What are they supposed to do with it once they get it?
[03:49] B: Well, I don't know.
[03:55] A: You better get this thing and. Yeah, yeah.
[04:06] B: Christy just laughs at me after that. I was just like, wait, wait, what? It makes sense in my head. But then I say it out loud and, like, that doesn't make sense.
[04:16] A: Yeah. Now you're getting it. Right. So go back to Right. Okay. There's two things I haven't been being able to feel like I've been expressing myself in a way that people understand where I'm coming from. Mm. Okay. So there's that, but then there's the. I went through being put in ELP when I had Covid, and I was more isolated, and that left a lot more time up here. And then things that I had planned on happening for me couldn't happen because of it. And then I didn't like being alone or in this situation. And then it didn't feel like people were there for me. Even though I'm in the back house on the property where everybody is, they're not there. Not because they're not there for me, but because I have Covid.
[05:03] B: Yeah.
[05:04] A: And they go, no, I don't really want to be in the same room. No, Come on, give me a hug. No, no.
[05:14] B: That makes sense, guys.
[05:16] A: Right. So that was all going on and you had to deal with all of that. Yeah. And what got activated in you is the thing that was the normal operating system, which is if I start getting uncomfortable and I try to get the. Right. But you did, right?
[05:30] B: No.
[05:31] A: How cool is that?
[05:32] B: It's really cool.
[05:33] A: Right? Yeah. That doesn't mean that in life I'm not going to go through difficult things.
[05:38] B: Yeah.
[05:38] A: But notice how the intensity for you didn't go as high.
[05:43] B: Yeah.
[05:43] A: Right.
[05:43] B: It's easier to, like, manage it.
[05:46] A: Right.
[05:46] B: I was able to, like, tell a staff, like, hey, this is where I'm at. And so.
[05:51] A: Yeah, that's what happens with change work.
[05:55] B: Yeah.
[05:55] A: Right. Because the normal operating system would be to run and flee. However, I, at the same level, go, wait a minute. This thing that I'm doing now, although I don't like this temporary part, what I've got is the bigger picture is actually valuable for me.
[06:11] B: Yeah.
[06:12] A: And that actually holding that there goes. Oh, well, then running doesn't fit with that.
[06:18] B: Yeah. It's like more. More rational.
[06:22] A: Well. And you're valuing you.
[06:24] B: Yeah.
[06:25] A: Right.
[06:26] B: Because I'm like, where would I go? Like, I know where I could go, but we don't really mean.
[06:30] A: Well, there's a lot of shake. There's a lot that I can do.
[06:41] B: Been very. Having a lot of ingenuity in the past, but I haven't had anywhere to go. But, you know, don't really, like, it's that. More thinking, that more delayed reaction.
[06:51] A: Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Good job. Yeah.
[06:53] B: And I've been more authentic.
[06:55] A: How so? What does that mean? That you're inauthentic all the time?
[06:58] B: Not inauthentic all the time. But I think that I had put on a performance of like, everything's okay.
[07:08] A: One of those.
[07:08] B: No, similar. Like, I act like I have my shit together and everything's okay.
[07:13] A: Look, I'm sorry. Reading intellectually stimulating books that.
[07:20] B: Not at all. Yeah, maybe a little.
[07:23] A: Okay, so.
[07:27] B: Yeah.
[07:28] A: How do you know that things at those moments weren't actually going okay?
[07:32] B: Because I knew internally, but for such a long time I've, like, put on the show of, like, I'm good, everything's okay. Like, nothing's wrong with me. I can manage all of this. When in reality I was really stressing out about it. And so Covid sort of like, broke that, like, no, nothing is okay. And I'm really struggling. So now I've been more authentic and been more like, I'm not okay with this, I don't like this. Or.
[07:55] A: Yeah, so you've been expressing things that have been happening or ways that you've been feeling that you don't like. And prior to that, if I'm following you, you wouldn't say. Say those things. You'd be like, oh, well, yeah, no, I. Getting slapped in the face. Wonderfully implying. Let me go back to the page. You were pretending.
[08:18] B: Yeah.
[08:19] A: When actually, God, that really sucked. And I'm fucking mad. I don't want to punch him back and what's going on. Yeah, okay. Okay.
[08:26] B: Yeah.
[08:27] A: So that's different now for you.
[08:28] B: Yeah.
[08:29] A: How have they been?
[08:31] B: Not the most. I mean, they've been. Okay, sorry, sorry. Told you this.
[08:42] A: Okay, so tell me more. What would be useful for me to know?
[08:48] B: No, I don't. Like, they've been receptive. But then I was supposed to like.
[08:52] A: Phase and that they are the advocates. Yes.
[08:54] B: And the like staff and stuff. But I was supposed to phase up yesterday.
[08:59] A: Phase up too, of higher.
[09:01] B: Phase in like the program.
[09:02] A: What phase?
[09:03] B: Action.
[09:04] A: Action. Action. Action.
[09:06] B: Yeah. So like I could be a cheerleader. You should be. I think we should have you at the house to just do like woo.
[09:14] A: Cheers.
[09:14] B: I think that'd be great.
[09:15] A: Yeah. Okay. No, Pod pon.
[09:17] B: I. That was the image I was getting.
[09:19] A: So. All right. So you're supposed to.
[09:27] B: Yeah. And then they talked.
[09:28] A: What do you mean supposed to? Like you were working towards it and you're up for determining whether you can or not.
[09:34] B: Yeah. And that was yesterday. And they said no.
[09:36] A: Okay.
[09:36] B: Which I didn't like.
[09:38] A: Good. But you weren't actually supposed to go. You were to the place where they make the decision whether you're going to or not. Yeah, not that I'm supposed to. It's kind of like when people say it's supposed to rain. Who said, according to whom, that it's supposed to rain? We got that. The weather forecast has predicted rain at this time and therefore maybe it will happen. But it's not because it's supposed to. Just because he said it in the morning doesn't mean. Right.
[10:03] B: Me.
[10:03] A: I was supposed to make it to the next level and then they told me no. Can you imagine that bitching. Okay, so they told you no and you didn't like it.
[10:15] B: No.
[10:15] A: And then what happened?
[10:17] B: Um, you might have gotten a little upset with them.
[10:20] A: Uh huh. Like screaming, yelly. Yeah. Oh, loud.
[10:23] B: Yeah.
[10:23] A: I slammed the door oh, that's always a good action that the 16 year old does.
[10:29] B: I mean, pretty much, what the hell? I stayed here, y'all.
[10:38] A: How old are you? I'm 25.
[10:42] B: I revert back to like a toddler sometimes.
[10:45] A: Sometimes it happens. Yeah.
[10:47] B: Temper tantrum. And then I'm better.
[10:49] A: Yeah. Okay.
[10:50] B: Or not. You know, it just depends.
[10:52] A: And they went, wow, this was probably a really good decision that we didn't move her up. That's what I would be thinking. You storm out angry. I go, I guess it was a really good decision that we didn't move her up. Probably because if she's like, oh, yeah, no, I realize that I'm not to that phase yet. Even though I really want to be. I get it and you know I'm gonna do more to be better. They go, oh, wow, maybe we should have moved her up to that face like you. Hello. Then we go, oh, we probably made the right decision. All right, good. All right. We were all paying attention. Yeah.
[11:31] B: I just was like, I thought I was doing a lot better than I guess I have been. And so that was a shock to me.
[11:37] A: Oh, okay. It's good to get feedback. Yeah, yeah.
[11:47] B: Even if we don't want to hear it.
[11:49] A: Yes. Because it's feedback. So I'll give you an example. One time I, the buddy of mine got me on the radio. I was young, I was still young. And it was a morning show and I didn't know that every other word I said I used the word like. So like when you were going like to the like, I didn't know I was doing.
[12:16] B: You didn't.
[12:16] A: And I'm on the radio and they're like, dude, you gotta stop the likes. And I. Because it was so unconscious, I couldn't stop the likes. We can't have you on the radio. I was done. Oh, man. Okay. So not knowing that can't do anything to change it.
[12:33] B: Yeah.
[12:33] A: It just rivals knowing. It goes. Okay, so now I want to pay attention to me saying it so that I realize that I'm saying it because before it was unconscious. I want to notice that I'm doing it and I'm still probably going to say it, but I want to stricken it.
[12:49] B: Yeah.
[12:50] A: So I want to like replace it or get rid of the like or. And then it starts to get eliminated from my speaking and then is only added to enhance a particular thing. It's not a tick, repetitive thing or whatever you would call it. That's being said. If I didn't learn that, that could be something that's Ongoingly happening for me. So for me, whenever, like, when I did a lot of training and going to people for training, and I had a couple instructors that were really harsh with how they would come back with feedback, kind of make you feel stupid, so to speak. Like, that's what it would change trigger. It never triggered that in me, because no matter how harsh they were, what I had in my mind, the only reason that they're really giving this kind of feedback to me is they want. He. That instructor wants me to be better at working with people. I also want to be better at working with people. So I'm not offended by what he's telling me. Instead, I'm taking it as he's noticing that I was doing it like that, and he's wanting me to do it like this. Okay, so let me start doing it like this. Because he's really good.
[14:00] B: Yeah.
[14:01] A: And if he's thinking that it would be better, then I'm gonna do it because I want to be really good like him. Like, that was my mentality. There were a lot of people that got. I can't believe you.
[14:10] B: I'm talking like that.
[14:12] A: You're so rude. Like, all those kinds of things that people would do because they get personally offended. I was just going, well, he wants me to do better. That's why he's telling me that I fucked up on this.
[14:22] B: Yeah. And I think that's where they were coming from. But for me, it was like a. Because I'm being authentic. Like, that's wrong. So I think that was, like, childhood shit coming into it of, like, I.
[14:33] A: Like your socks, by the way, and my white shoes. Would you get to wear white after Labor Day in Florida?
[14:44] B: I never paid attention to that.
[14:45] A: No. Well, you weren't a northerner.
[14:49] B: Why does it matter?
[14:50] A: In the north, you cannot wear white after Labor Day.
[14:52] B: But who made this rule and why?
[14:53] A: I don't know. Puritans. Because it's white. And that's the rule up north, that you can wear it from Memorial Day to Labor Day, but you can't wear white after Labor Day unless you live in Florida. Then you can wear white whenever the F you want.
[15:12] B: What happens if you wear white in between?
[15:15] A: I need a shot. Oh, my God. No. I mean, it is a little bit serious out there. That's why people don't. I mean, you don't even want to chance it telling you the truth.
[15:27] B: Serious.
[15:28] A: Right. And who wants to wear white pants when it's snow? And it could be, like, all the gas in the cars, and now it's all black. And so the black splatters up and gets on your white pants. At least it's jeans. You can't really tell they're dark pants like that. Shit, you're set.
[15:42] B: I mean, that makes sense.
[15:43] A: Yeah. Huh. Interesting. It's crazy. See? Really good. Okay, so you told him that you thought it was wrong?
[15:51] B: Yeah.
[15:52] A: Yeah.
[15:53] B: I mean, I just. I guess I can see the feedback now, but in the moment, I couldn't.
[16:02] A: Okay, so are you thinking. Let me ask it in this way. Are you thinking that. That reaction that you had to them saying that you getting disappointed because you wanted to reach this thing and they said you couldn't yet. Not that you couldn't, but you couldn't yet. You will at some point, just not right now. Yeah, right. But that thing. Do you think that your reaction was more than the situation needed?
[16:24] B: Yeah.
[16:24] A: Okay.
[16:25] B: Because I felt that they weren't seeing everything that I was doing and, like, the patterns I were. I was breaking or am breaking by staying. And so I think that that was. Yeah, that was, I think, the most frustrating thing to me because I. Whenever I hear feedback or, like, whenever it's like, someone says something good about me, but then they say something negative, all I hear is the negative and not the positive.
[16:49] A: No. When are they saying the positive?
[16:52] B: Well, there's like a, like, sheet where it's like, you do these things really well, and then you need to work on these.
[16:56] A: Do they give you sandwich feedback? Have you heard of it? Like that, like, sandwich feedback is you give the person a positive, and then if they need you, give some more, and then you give them the meat, which is, like, the thing, and then you bring back at the end the positive. Yeah, sandwich feedback.
[17:12] B: But all I heard was the negative. What do you mean?
[17:18] A: What was the negative?
[17:19] B: The negative was that I don't. Like. Like, I don't. I struggle with change. So, like, if things are changing or if, like. Okay, if we're planning on doing this thing, and then all of a sudden we can't do it. It's not like world's ending, but on some level it is.
[17:41] A: Okay, that's intense. Like my daughter used to do to me. Dad, can we go here? No, we can't go here today. But we could go to. Well, I'm not gonna want to go tomorrow. Okay, fine. Write that kind of thing. Okay. My kids like to do that. And I used to do this to them. Go ahead. It's good stuff. Now my daughter's 13, so sometimes her emotions are all over the place and I have no idea why. I do know why.
[18:19] B: She doesn't want to hear it.
[18:20] A: No. But they're all over the place. Because she's 13.
[18:23] B: Yeah.
[18:23] A: That's fun. Puberty, the whole, like, awesome. Lucky her.
[18:29] B: Lucky you.
[18:31] A: Because it doesn't, like, then go through the whole family and everyone's just. It's good. It's fine. You don't know what it's like to be in the house full of women.
[18:40] B: Not at all. Not from your perspective.
[18:44] A: Yeah. So. So. So what? They say you weren't gonna do it.
[18:47] B: Um, I'm not good at, like, rolling with, like, going with the flow. Okay.
[18:51] A: So going with the flow.
[18:52] B: I'm not good with direct communication. Like, so if I have an issue with someone, I'll go to the staff and be like, hey, I have an issue with someone, instead of just going to the person being like, what the hell? I mean, maybe in a nicer manner, but, yeah, I'd rather the staff handle it for me than I handle it for myself.
[19:09] A: Okay. Sometimes.
[19:11] B: Most of the time.
[19:13] A: Do you feel discomfort in going to talk to somebody? Mm. Okay.
[19:18] B: Yeah.
[19:20] A: If you didn't feel the discomfort, would.
[19:21] B: You go, where are you? Grabbing somewhere.
[19:29] A: If you didn't feel the discomfort, would it be okay to talk to him?
[19:34] B: Probably.
[19:35] A: Would it be okay to talk to him even if he had a little discomfort?
[19:38] B: Yeah, it's more of the, like, reaction I'm gonna get. And is that person gonna hate me? And I'm living with that person, so it'd be easier to just keep the peace than, like, telling them how I really feel. But then it builds resentments, and then it doesn't really help anything.
[19:52] A: Okay.
[19:53] B: Makes a lot of sense, but none.
[19:54] A: Well, yeah, so the thing is that there are things that the other residents are doing that sometime negatively affect you, and you have been. Well, there's something that's been in the way of you telling them, for fear of whatever repercussion that might be from them, that instead you overhear. Yeah. Mom, Johnny took my milk. Okay, Johnny, go ahead and give her back your milk. Mom, stop. Right? We just. Johnny. Right. But you think that it's better to have the intervention come from over there so that we can be like, you.
[20:41] B: Know, I didn't know about that.
[20:43] A: That. Wow.
[20:44] B: That was. You know, I play dumb. Like, wow. That's feedback someone gave you.
[20:49] A: Oh, okay. So that's really fun. That's so awesome. Do you want to be more free?
[20:56] B: Yeah.
[20:57] A: To be able to say what's there, but in a way that doesn't have to be so harsh.
[21:03] B: Mm. Because I think I get like nervous and I forget my words and then I. I'll do this too where I over communicate. Like I go on a random ramble because I feel uncomfortable, but then I never get my point across because the person stopped listening.
[21:17] A: Yeah. Okay. Okay.
[21:21] B: Yeah.
[21:21] A: So more clear communication with us and more ease in doing it. Right?
[21:28] B: Yeah.
[21:28] A: That even if they get upset, you're gonna be okay.
[21:31] B: Yeah.
[21:32] A: Right. Even if they get upset, you're gonna feel okay.
[21:35] B: I'm just gonna walk away.
[21:36] A: You're gonna be okay. Yeah. That would be cool, right?
[21:40] B: Yeah.
[21:41] A: Because then it won't matter.
[21:42] B: Yeah.
[21:42] A: If inside how I am is that I'm okay regardless of what goes on over there, then I'm more free to share. And again, way that's tactful.
[21:52] B: And yeah.
[21:53] A: You know, again, we want it in situation. Maybe empathetic, understanding, compassionate, firm, direct in different situations, but like more clear. Okay. So there's that. That they said. Yes. There's this like, how come you're not just able to more roll with things? Yeah. Okay. What else?
[22:18] B: Those are like the main two. Like they just want me to like communicate how I'm feeling and like being able to like handle. Because I'm getting more added onto my plate cuz I'm starting school in February. So like with that comes more responsibilities. There's other like responsibilities I'm doing. So they just want me to be able to like acknowledge when I'm at my capacity to like handle situations and tell people that or just like express how I'm feeling in the moment or be able to like communicate myself in a more clear way. Because I think sometimes I'll have like a tone or I'll be sarcastic or. That's not clear.
[22:50] A: Oh yeah. Okay.
[22:54] B: I feel very sarcastic when I'm like.
[22:56] A: Yeah, well, sarcasm can be okay when you smile.
[22:59] B: Mm.
[23:01] A: If you don't smile afterwards, then people get really offended. I mean, it's true. I mean, totally. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that's. So the concern is because I'm going to be doing more than I have been doing. I'm adding the workload of both going physically to school, doing the work that's related to school, in addition to the other things that I've already been doing that I can tell people when it's way too stressful or I'm overwhelmed or maybe I'm a little more edgy because I'm stressed about stuff. Yeah. Okay.
[23:45] B: Yeah. And I think their concern too is sometimes like when I'm in public Situations and there's a lot of noise, there's a lot of people. Like, that is something that I can. I get overwhelmed with. And then I like, I'm not paying attention to, like, you know, paying attention, but I'm not paying attention to like the advocates with other girls. And I'm just like la in my own place and.
[24:04] A: Yeah. So how does that problematically affect you? Like, you might be aware when that happens. And what's the thing that's not.
[24:11] B: Like, we went to Walmart on a Saturday and we went with a newer advocate who.
[24:16] A: It's a whole other situation.
[24:17] B: But she's special.
[24:19] A: She's.
[24:20] B: Yeah, she's new and she doesn't understand things in the way that older advocates do. And so because of that, she just, like, I'm used to being able to like, go off in the store and like, do, you know, shop by myself. And she wanted us to be together. So then I was like trying to remember that rule, but then I was overwhelmed because there was just a lot going on and I forgot that rule. And so that was sort of problematic in their eyes because they saw it as, like, it could be seen as being defiant when that's not the case. And like when there's new girls in the house, they don't want it to seem as though like I'm a long way anxiety to like, take over and me not like, listen to rules.
[24:55] A: I see. Yeah. Okay.
[24:58] B: I don't know if that makes sense, but.
[25:00] A: Okay. So. So that situation, you got distracted.
[25:04] B: Yeah, I just like, sometimes it's a lot going on. It's a lot of overstimulation. So I just want to go off by myself for like five seconds to like, breathe and then I can come back, you know?
[25:16] A: Okay.
[25:16] B: So it's hard for me sometimes when they like, want me to be like conjoined in the hip with them and I can't go, like, find an aisle that's quiet and like breathe.
[25:26] A: I don't know whether that's true. Okay. That you wouldn't be able to do it. I think what's problematic is that you go do it without letting them know.
[25:35] B: Probably right.
[25:37] A: If you were to say to them, hey, I'm a little bit overwhelmed. I'm gonna just step over here for a moment to catch my breath and then I'll rejoin. Join you. Yeah. They'll go, you, you need to. I'm putting that little lesson kids have and you're coming with. We got the dog things. All right. We got 15ft. Hope that's enough. Back in, right? Yeah. Right.
[25:59] B: You got the kids backpacks with like the leashes attached.
[26:01] A: Yeah, yeah.
[26:02] B: Well, my problem is is that when I get overwhelmed, I'm just like, it's like a white noise machine in my head and I can't hear, function or communicate. Just like. Okay, so that's not a good thing either.
[26:15] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So it's not that if you were to go take time but actually tell somebody, that wouldn't be a problem, but you're thinking that when it happens, it comes on too much.
[26:30] B: Yeah.
[26:31] A: Okay. How do you know when to feel it?
[26:33] B: How do I know when I'm feeling it or how do I know?
[26:36] A: How do you know when to feel it?
[26:39] B: That was weird verbiage.
[26:41] A: It is. How do you know when to feel it? I don't know when to feel it.
[26:45] B: I just feel it.
[26:47] A: Well, how do you know when to have it happen? I don't, I'm not so sure. I don't think it's something that you're consciously doing. Yeah, but think of that. There's a program running in you that turns that on. Something external has to be turning it on. So it's something that you're seeing and saying to yourself, it's something that you're hearing. It's something that you could be feeling. It's so there's a trigger that's triggering, turning on that program. So as you think about the experience of being in Walmart and this new advocate saying, hey, it's going to be more comfortable for me to have everybody like stay together. So that's what we're going to do this time because I haven't done this before. And everybody's like, absolutely, we're on.
[27:38] B: Then there's me.
[27:40] A: Well, so how did you know when to have that happen? So you started walking in the store.
[27:46] B: Yeah.
[27:47] A: And you're where. What are you seeing, hearing, saying to yourself, feeling. What's the initial thing that starts. So kind of check that out for a second.
[27:59] B: I think it was frustration and I think it was a lot of like just people. Like there's people.
[28:11] A: Is there a certain number of people that it like requires before you start feeling that frustration?
[28:17] B: No, I think this is gonna sound really racist, but I think it's black people.
[28:20] A: Huh?
[28:22] B: Sorry. That probably sounds like you're at Walmart. I think it's really like honest. Cuz I like there's like two black guys and I'm like, I don't know why.
[28:37] A: Okay, so you saw them?
[28:38] B: Yeah.
[28:39] A: And then what did you notice?
[28:41] B: I started getting more Anxious.
[28:42] A: You started feeling what in your body?
[28:44] B: Anxiety. Over overwhelmed frustration.
[28:47] A: Did you start feeling. Were there sensations that accompanied it? Did you feel fluttery or edgy?
[28:54] B: I felt edgy.
[28:55] A: Restless or.
[28:57] B: Yeah, I think edgy.
[29:00] A: So you saw them. You were told you saw them. You started feeling that discomfort in your body and then it continued and then there was more frustration and then it was thing. Yeah. That had you step away. Yeah. Okay, so if that wasn't going on for you. Right. So the synesthesia is. I see them and then I start to feel the stuff. Make sense.
[29:34] B: Yeah.
[29:34] A: So we. If seeing them no longer come pause this. Like, how would you be content? Yeah. What would it be like to move through the store feeling content?
[29:46] B: Be a blessing.
[29:49] A: Okay.
[29:51] B: Normally I'm like, like, I hate going to Walmart. I'm like, God damn it.
[29:55] A: Yeah. Right. We want you to feel more content and at ease. Still alert and aware, but contented. At ease.
[30:03] B: Yeah.
[30:04] A: Yeah. Okay. Okay. So that's where that thing goes. What else would be useful for me to know? What else do we want our time to do for you?
[30:14] B: I think that's really, like those are the main components, Main issues.
[30:18] A: Okay. I know. Christine sent me.
[30:20] B: Yeah. I think that I'm trying to remember. My brain's like, I love how the co cuffs of your shirt are like little paintings.
[30:32] A: Isn't that cool? All right. Christine said one wants to feel more free and competent to bounce from one thing to the next during the day, especially on busy days, because she usually gets overwhelmed and it's hard to function. Two, wants to feel lighter about not being in control of her day to day schedule. Yes. I want to understand that more. Okay. Then three was triggered when she was quarantined in elp. Felt the same as her parents, sending her away to different places to fix herself. Okay. We talked a little bit about that. Not quite to fix yourself. Want to feel freer to be herself, make mistakes and not buy into other people's expectations of her. So those are the two?
[31:21] B: Yeah.
[31:21] A: The one that is wants to feel lighter about not being in control of her day to day schedule.
[31:29] B: Okay.
[31:29] A: What does that mean?
[31:32] B: I want to be able to, like, I struggle with not being in control. Like, I know I can't control shit, but it still is like a problem for me when, like, I can't control my schedule. Like, I.
[31:47] A: How so?
[31:50] B: Because I don't. I think I struggle. I don't know why. It's like more of just like I get anxious and I get really overwhelmed and I get frustrated and I wish things Were different. And then I become slightly incompliant or trying to control the situation in other aspects.
[32:04] A: And so anything less than letting go wouldn't be total control when you're feeling free.
[32:12] B: Okay.
[32:13] A: And are you not in control of your feeling free?
[32:19] B: No, I am in control.
[32:21] A: You are. So anything less than letting go wouldn't be total control. So how do I just, like when you're feeling free.
[32:29] B: So how do I just. Like.
[32:31] A: So that's the thing. You get how you've been.
[32:33] B: Yeah.
[32:34] A: And how you don't want to be. Mm. You don't know fully how you want to be, but how we want you to be is free to be able to go with the flow.
[32:44] B: Yeah.
[32:44] A: Because as I'm free to go with the flow, that's when I'm most in control.
[32:50] B: More control over my emotions.
[32:51] A: Why? I'm most in control because I'm going with the flow.
[32:54] B: Yeah.
[32:56] A: Does that make sense? So anything less than letting go wouldn't be total control when you're feeling free. And are you nodding control of your feeling free. That's right. So the thing that you're in control of is your feeling free.
[33:11] B: Okay.
[33:12] A: Free. As you're being more free. Free is all about being able to go in the flow because I'm free to do it. And the thing that I can control is me being free. So we want you to be more free to go with the flow.
[33:29] B: Flow.
[33:30] A: To have more ease. Because then you'll actually be in control because you'll be feeling free. That's right. And you're in control of your feeling free. Not always in what you have to do. Yeah. Right. Right. It's. So the thing that we want you to. Where we have actual say in being in control is in here.
[33:52] B: Yeah.
[33:52] A: And how I respond to things. That's right. And we want you to be free. Okay, cool. So we got that.
[33:58] B: Yeah.
[33:59] A: Last part.
[34:00] B: Yes.
[34:01] A: I'm gonna read it because I don't remember. Want to feel free to be yourself, to make mistakes and not. Not buy into other people's expectations.
[34:11] B: So I think that goes into, like, the whole, like, I've been more authentic, but I also feel this sort of, like, resistance from, like. I feel like I'm. I feel like I'm wrong for being more authentic. I feel like I'm being punished for being more authentic in regards to, like, phasing up and stuff. Like. And I know that's not the case, but it feels like that. And it feels like because I'm being more authentic, they're punishing me.
[34:36] A: But I don't think it's punished. Maybe it is.
[34:39] B: I don't know.
[34:40] A: I mean, that's what they're all about. I mean, part of Saylor's philosophy. Punish the girl. They have not been punished enough. They had it easy.
[34:56] B: You put it like that.
[35:00] A: That's so good. It's in the tenets.
[35:04] B: I think 10's in the core values. Punish.
[35:09] A: You see that on the wall? Punish.
[35:12] B: Penal system.
[35:13] A: You know, isn't that weird? Right? Okay, so. So I want to understand a little bit more about. There's been resistance to me being more authentic or more sharing.
[35:30] B: Well, I think it's just that, like, I don't always feel heard or feel like. Or I feel like I'm expected to know why I do the things I do. I mean, if I knew why I did the things I did, I wouldn't be where I'm at today.
[35:42] A: I don't know about that. I can know why you did them and still.
[35:47] B: Still do them.
[35:48] A: Yeah. I mean.
[35:51] B: True.
[35:52] A: Yeah.
[35:53] B: But I also, like, sometimes they're like, well, why do you do this? I'm like, I don't know why the hell I do this. I just do this. Like, this is just what I do, you know? I think that sometimes they're like, no, I have a lot going on for me, but then they expect me to handle it better than I am. And I. And I hope to be at the place where I can handle it better. But I also feel like sometimes it's like I'm not allowed to just have those bad days or to not handle things great. And I think that's where I struggle with, like, do I put on a performance of being okay or do I continue to be authentic? And I would rather continue to be authentic because putting on a performance has gotten me nowhere.
[36:29] A: Oh, okay. Yeah. But there's a place to be authentic.
[36:38] B: Yeah.
[36:38] A: There's a time to be sharing information with people. Right. So as you're thinking about, okay, so I shared stuff. I've told them things, and as a result of that, I haven't gotten to where I wanted to go.
[36:56] B: So.
[36:56] A: So the thought was, because I told these things and shared these things, that's what's prevented me from moving up. Yes, I see.
[37:07] B: And it's been explained to me that that's not the case, but that's how it feels.
[37:12] A: Okay.
[37:14] B: Because they're more of like. Because you've been authentic, we wanna help you in this phase for a little bit longer so that when you get to action and you have more freedom and we're not going to be holding on to you so tightly or helping you as much like you'll have the skills, too, which I get.
[37:33] A: Are we in a race with myself to get out who can move through programming the fastest? You know, like it's a competition. Okay. What. Who's the fastest one? Okay. What am I going to do? Okay, that. Is that what it's about? Isn't that interesting? Yeah. Right. It's a weird thought, though, but it's.
[38:05] B: Like I expect myself to be in a place that I'm not. And when I'm not in that place, I'm like, well, why the hell am I not there?
[38:12] A: Right.
[38:13] B: So I get mad at myself, and it's not like I'm racing against anyone else but myself.
[38:17] A: Okay. Okay. So what got exposed were certain things that you didn't know that would be useful for you to get better with before you move forward. Yes, that's what's going on.
[38:29] B: Yeah.
[38:29] A: Not because they're out to kick at you or punish you or don't want you to succeed.
[38:33] B: It's the opposite.
[38:35] A: It really is the opposite. Okay, so. So this whole thing that happens with. With you where you find yourself feeling that they're thinking, I should be able to handle things better than I am. Right. So they might ask you a question. Well, what made you do that? And you go, I don't know why I did that. Well, I mean, some of the why you did that is because there's certain parts of how I do life that's kind of screwed up. Yeah, that's why. And this is one of those areas. That's why I did it.
[39:09] B: Yeah, but it's like, shouldn't you guys know that?
[39:11] A: No, no, no.
[39:13] B: Aren't they. Aren't they supposed to be educated in our life?
[39:16] A: No, but that's not what they. That's not how they think. Because it's not up to them to be in the recognition of the how come. It's in me. Because in the recognition of the how come, then I have the ability to change it. See, in the same way, if I didn't know that I was saying, like, then I can't do anything to change it.
[39:39] B: Okay.
[39:39] A: Until it's brought out. Right. And then I recognize somebody told me and I still didn't. Couldn't stop it. Then I started to recognize, oh, yes, I do say this often. Now I have the ability to start to change it. So it's not in them, in recognizing why you have done the thing you just did. It's for you to start to recognize, because that's the way that it takes it from unconscious and makes it conscious.
[40:06] B: Okay.
[40:07] A: Once it's conscious, I have the ability to do certain things with it. Right. The things that control us the most are the things that are most unconscious.
[40:16] B: Okay. That makes sense.
[40:18] A: So we want to start to bring some of that into the light. So I have a little ability. Does that make sense? Yeah. Okay.
[40:26] B: Yeah.
[40:26] A: Because that would be. And as you get that, just check. What do you notice in terms of how it feels?
[40:32] B: It makes more sense.
[40:34] A: Yeah. Well, how's your body feeling now?
[40:37] B: More relaxed.
[40:37] A: It is, isn't it?
[40:38] B: Like. Huh?
[40:39] A: Right.
[40:40] B: Okay.
[40:40] A: Right, Right. So think of being in one of those situations where, like, you've done something. Yeah. Right. And they're like, well, why? Why did you do that? And what do you notice? First of all, as they say it, how does it feel?
[40:54] B: First, like, I don't know why, but now that we've had this conversation, I.
[40:57] A: Can be like, first question. Did it feel inside like you were being attacked? Like that there's something before?
[41:05] B: Yeah.
[41:05] A: Is it now?
[41:06] B: No.
[41:07] A: Got it. Notice that that's the difference.
[41:09] B: Because it's the perception shift.
[41:11] A: Yes. Because it's not about. It's not about, like, bad or wrong. It's that. Oh. Them doing that is to prompt me to take something that was unconscious to start to make it conscious so that I can change it. Because what I actually want out of this program is to become a better version of me. I don't need to stay the same version of me. Right. I want to be a better version of me, which requires me changing. Yeah. Which I'm actually really good at. Even though you don't think you are really good at changing. Because all you are is change. Meaning all you are, Madison, is always changing. You're different today than you were when we met the last time. Right. If you and I came back one year from today, 99.9999999, meaning almost all of the subatomic particles that make us up would not be here. All we are is always changing.
[42:07] B: Okay.
[42:08] A: Right. It's that we don't always pay attention to how we're changing. But you can't not be changing every cell within your body. It's always changing. You're different. I've read a book, and then five years later, I've read the same book, and I'm like, I read this book. Really? It's the same freaking book. Right. But I've changed. Your perception's changed all sorts of things. Have changed. That's one of the ways that I can change. So the thing that you've been troubled with is this whole notion that I'm not somehow okay with change, when really I am change? Yes, always. And we want to put it in the actual instead of the nominalization, which is change a thing, we want to make it back a process. So all you are is change. All you are is always changing.
[42:57] B: Okay.
[42:58] A: It's an ongoing, always happening, never ending process. All you are is always changing. Right. Very rarely our brain, conscious brain, likes to make predictions of the future to think or accurate. But because it wants to make predictions so I know what to expect, that's what the weather forecast does. It makes a prediction. So I know whether it's a good idea or not to bring my umbrella. So if it's 90% chance of rain, probably gonna take my umbrella. If it's 20, it probably won't. Now is there an off chance that it'll be completely wrong and downpour on me? Yeah, totally. But they're trying to make predictions to give a sense of security or certainty about the future. What we want to have inside of you instead is the certainty that regardless of what this future brings my way, I have what I need to deal with it. Right. That's the certainty that we want is at a deep level, you know, that it doesn't matter what shows up. I've got what I need to deal.
[44:01] B: With it and be able to roll.
[44:02] A: With the flow and to be able to move with the flow because I'm free. The thing that I'm most in control of is me being free. So let's think of a you who's free and light and a lot more easygoing. Right. Who's hearing others comments towards you as true feedback, even if it's in their distorted way of wanting me to be a better version of me. Got it. So that I'm reading it in that way, adjusting it it so that when I'm at like a place like Walmart, I'm much more content, still alert, noticing what's around me but free to truly breathe. Make sense? Yeah. So this is where we're headed. Okay. Again, the question isn't how it's gonna happen, it's would it be okay? Anything else we want to add to the future you we just described?
[45:11] B: I don't think so.
[45:12] A: Yeah. So we're thinking of you being more free to be more okay in you.
[45:18] B: No matter what life brings.
[45:19] A: That's right. Connecting to that. I'm always changing and where I'm headed is a better version of me. So if they ask me how come I did this thing that I wasn't even sure of, it's all about me taking because I didn't know why I did and try to move that into why so that I have the ability to start to intervene and change it on my way to becoming a better version of me. Right? So we're all about that. Right? And as you do this, then what you want to do is slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower. That's right. And a little bit deeper than how you. That's right. Automatically breathe. Because as you're breathing in this slightly slower and deeper way, again, check inside. How's your body feeling now?
[46:13] B: More relaxed.
[46:14] A: Right? And as your body's feeling more relaxed, we're thinking of a you who's free to say what's so about somebody else? Because again, it's providing feedback based on, yes, it may have bugged you, but you're also interested in them being a better version of themselves. Right? So again, jaw slightly lowered, resting your tongue. Beginning to relax the back of your tongue. Breathing in this way. That's a little bit slower, not longer, deeper than how you automatically breathe. As you're aware of your breath, notice that you can see me and notice what happens as my fingers move out. Stay looking at me. See, this is the cool part. Did you see? I know, like, wait a minute, right? We want it so. So that it's easier for you to stay present here, looking at me so that your awareness expands. Remember, the problem feels big only when that's all I can see. When I put the problem within all the space and everything else, that's not the problem. The problem's not so big. I gain more power free. That's right. You're in control of your feeling free on the way to be doing it now. Right? So again, your jaw is lowered, you're resting your tongue, you're breathing a little bit slower and deeper. You're seeing me. You see my fingers. And now with your peripheral vision, you pick them up as they move further to the side. Then out here, you can see the fingers way. As you do, you pick up more of the space in this room. Space towards the windows and door, space between us, space behind me, space behind you underneath and up above. And how much more space there is in this room than there is anything else. Go ahead and close your eyes. And with your your eyes closed, Madison just Begin to notice what it would feel like to float up and out of your body well beyond the ceiling and well beyond the roof so that you're way, way, way up above it all in the sky, having a bird's eye view, seeing everything as being underneath and below you. Free, like the bird to soar and fly, to glide, to move all around in all ways and in all directions. Free, light, clear. That's right. When you're ready, bring awareness back down and in the body. That's right. And just check inside. How's your body feeling now? More at peace. It is more at peace. And as your body's more at peace, think about being in Walmart and you see the two black guys and what do you notice happening now?
[49:38] B: It's not like I'm anxious.
[49:41] A: That's right, that's right. Because you can see them even in the periphery, even in the sides. Right. The best basketball player is seeing you, but is seeing movement so that when they notice it, they can pass the ball. They're still looking here, maybe they might even look away. But it's because they've got a more panoramic lens. We're interested in as you're out in public, because a place like Walmart, just think about being in Walmart and there's all of the things that are in Walmart, whether it be the furniture, the clothing, the tools, the supplies, the groceries, the people. Right? Yeah. That bin that's got all balls that are. Right. So we've got all of those things in Walmart. But now as you think about being in Walmart, no, notice instead of the objects and things, the space maybe that's above those objects, the space that's in between the aisles, the space between you and another, the space behind you, the space between racks of clothing. Notice just more of the space. And as you're noticing more of the space, what do you notice happening?
[51:08] B: Wow, Walmart's big.
[51:10] A: Yeah, that's right, that's right. And see, we start paying attention to more of the other things that are all through there. It opens up the field of vision that creates my body to be in more of a state of flow. Alpha waves is what surfers are in when they're surfing. They're in flow. Athletes call it being in the zone. Right. When you get into a really good book and all of a sudden times disappear. Right. You're in the flow of that really good book. Happens with movies or conversations, all that kind of stuff. Are moments where I'm in flow. Right. How, how much more content do you feel and flow as you're moving through.
[51:58] B: Walmart, more relaxed, not as anxious.
[52:02] A: You might notice different people. Heck, there might be blacks and Hispanics and maybe even a native American. That's right.
[52:12] B: Getting real ethnic at Walmart.
[52:13] A: That's right. For you. Caucasian, brown haired girl.
[52:22] B: It's like one of those wildlife shows where like I spy. That's right.
[52:27] A: Yeah, that's perfect. So again, just check. What do you notice now?
[52:34] B: Not anxious, just acknowledging that they're there.
[52:37] A: That's right. That's right. And see, when you see them, there may have been a reminder. Right. So what does that feeling tone when it started to get that, what does that take you back towards?
[52:51] B: Just a state of anxiety and a state of like fear of black men. I think that.
[52:56] A: What does it take you back towards? So just for a moment takes me back towards trauma maybe. What does it take you back towards? What experience starts to come to mind. So as you think about it.
[53:08] B: Yeah.
[53:08] A: You notice there's that little bit of thing that starts coming.
[53:12] B: Right.
[53:12] A: If you were to take that feeling tone and let that feeling tone guide you back.
[53:17] B: I think when I ran away from home for the second time, I was with a black guy and then that whole situation just escalated and that's sort of what was the evolution of my like prostitution phase and drug use. And so there's a lot of abuse and a lot of just chaos in that time and a lot of like mistrust. And then that just continued because it was seemed to be mainly black men who abused me. And so that fear was always there.
[53:47] A: Yeah. So now we want to narrow it to a particular time where you really felt that fear in something that happened.
[53:58] B: I think the night that I went.
[54:00] A: You got one?
[54:00] B: Yeah.
[54:01] A: Good. We know how to clear it. You be with me because I'm fun and that isn't. And this is. Yeah, right. And we're headed towards this. You. Right. And something later that you did after that, that was more fun. What's that?
[54:16] B: Signing up for college classes.
[54:17] A: Yeah. Right. Way more fun. Good. So that thing happened. You're how old? Where?
[54:22] B: I'm 16.
[54:23] A: 16.
[54:24] B: At an apartment complex.
[54:25] A: You're at an apartment complex. It's daytime or nighttime?
[54:27] B: Nighttime.
[54:27] A: Nighttime. And you're wearing the complex like out front of like the complex where the resort style pool was. Oh, wasn't that a kind of an apartment complex?
[54:39] B: So it was like a trap.
[54:40] A: Okay, so so you were out front. Yeah. Right.
[54:43] B: Yeah.
[54:44] A: Like in the parking lot.
[54:45] B: No, so like, you know how like they'll have like the communities of, like, apartment complexes. And, like, you have, like. Like, there's one, and then it. There's like a little, like, lawnish area.
[54:56] A: Right, right, right. So you're in the little lonish area.
[54:58] B: Yeah, right.
[55:00] A: But you're in there. Good. And then what happened?
[55:04] B: There was, like, 10 other black guys, and they were, like, arguing over who wanted to take turns with me first.
[55:10] A: Right. So they're going like, okay, who wants to go first, second, third? I want to go last. We'll get that one out of the way. I want last.
[55:25] B: I didn't know that's what I was walking into, but I was, like, really inebriated, and I was like, yeah, right.
[55:30] A: Yeah, like, good. Well, let me start with the guy who's last and I'll be done. Yeah, that's right. Right. So they were arguing. He's gonna go. Right. And you're kind of like in a. Whatever. And then what happened next?
[55:44] B: Shots rang out.
[55:46] A: Yeah, right, good.
[55:47] B: Because apparently this was worth shooting someone over.
[55:51] A: Right.
[55:51] B: But I got thrown in the bushes and was told, like, just wait.
[55:54] A: Yes.
[55:55] B: And then they came pick me up and then.
[55:57] A: Right, right. And you can remember all that happening? Yes. And even as you're telling it to me, it's already less.
[56:03] B: Yeah.
[56:04] A: Right. But you can remember it happening in the same way you can remember putting on your sandals. Stop putting on your sandals. Well, stop them from doing that.
[56:11] B: I can't.
[56:12] A: Well, then you stop going there. Okay, I'm not going there.
[56:15] B: I'm not going there.
[56:15] A: Stop putting on your shirt.
[56:16] B: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[56:18] A: Then stop going there.
[56:19] B: Not going there.
[56:20] A: Good. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[56:22] B: It no longer exists.
[56:23] A: Right. As you get that, what do you start noticing now?
[56:28] B: Less anxiety.
[56:29] A: Right.
[56:30] B: It's not as like a.
[56:32] A: Right, right. And at that time in your life, did you have a lot of time spent being with, you know, black guys? Yeah. Prior to that.
[56:43] B: No.
[56:44] A: Oh, no. No, you didn't, did you? No.
[56:46] B: I went to, like, a white school.
[56:48] A: That's right.
[56:49] B: In like, a college preparatory. So, like, I.
[56:51] A: That's right.
[56:52] B: Saw black people, but I never really interacted with.
[56:54] A: That's right.
[56:55] B: A lot of the negative connotations that come with, like, a racist white family or my family.
[57:00] A: That's right.
[57:01] B: And then it added to those.
[57:03] A: Oh, surprise, surprise, shocker. Right, right. Yeah. Here, woman. Here's what slavery is like. Yeah. Cool. Well, I'm glad I got to have that reversal of experiences. Yeah. Yeah. But I'm not anymore enslaved by them. Right. No, sorry. I was like, Wait, I know. Right, Right. But you're not, are you?
[57:30] B: No.
[57:30] A: Right. You didn't know that then. No. Right. You didn't even know that that was gonna go on in that way.
[57:36] B: No.
[57:36] A: Right. So close your eyes and think back to the younger you. Let her know a. That it's over, finished. That it no longer exists. Clearly, if you had known that it was gonna go into all of that, that earlier, you certainly wouldn't have done that. Not gone there in that way. Might have done other things, but not that. Right. So that she gets it, that she just didn't know that it had more to do with the situation and circumstance that she was in than the color of the skin. That's right. Which she didn't know. Right. That it was about the set and setting that she was in that had more of that happen. That's right. Let her know about being free. Right. Because you're totally in control of your feeling free now to. To be more okay in you. To lighten up. Right. To go more with the flow. Let her know about signing up for classes. Right. And again, as that starts to get into the younger you, what do you notice happening to her face?
[58:38] B: She's lighter.
[58:39] A: That's right. She's lighter. She's beginning to lighten up. Right. And what do you notice happening in you?
[58:50] B: I'm not so worried about the color, like people's skin color, because of the experience I had. It's just what they look like.
[59:00] A: Yeah, right. Well, because of course, it's the darker of the skin. Yeah, right. The lighter is not as.
[59:09] B: Not as harsh, but I think it's like I just associated all black people being bad block people, which I know is.
[59:14] A: Right.
[59:15] B: Really racist.
[59:17] A: Yeah. You came by it naturally. Yeah, right.
[59:23] B: Yeah.
[59:24] A: Right. But if we think about it, if you were in a community where it was Hispanic and that thing was going on, wouldn't they have done the same thing?
[59:32] B: Yeah.
[59:32] A: And if you were in a community that was more, you know, inner city white. Yeah. Right, Right. Yeah. So now again, think about being in Walmart. Okay. Because you might go there. I mean, probably because, I mean, they got a lot, like a lot of stuff in Walmart.
[59:50] B: Yeah.
[59:51] A: And like, it's one of those stores that you pretty much can get anything that you need there.
[59:56] B: It's a little scary. It's like Amazon, but in person.
[59:59] A: Yeah. Right.
[60:00] B: Could you imagine if Amazon opened up a store?
[60:02] A: No, I wouldn't want to go in there.
[60:04] B: Well, I should be broke by the time you left.
[60:06] A: No, I just think it would be like too. There'd be robots delivering shit to me. Like, I'd walk in and I'd have a thought and they know the thought. And then the robot, oh my gosh, I know. The drone would fly it over here.
[60:18] B: You should watch the Social Dilemma on Netflix.
[60:22] A: Yeah. I try to get rid of the avatar that they have with me by picking things that I don't like at all.
[60:31] B: Don't tell them. They're probably listening.
[60:33] A: Well, they are always. I mean, hey, Siri. Right. Because that's all they're looking. They're just hearing the word Siri.
[60:44] B: Yeah.
[60:47] A: They don't pay attention to the rest of it. That's why the whole worry of like, you know, government tracking us because of a virus that we're going to get a shot. Yeah. They don't actually have to do that in that kind of secret.
[61:00] B: They're already doing it.
[61:01] A: You've already given them permission.
[61:02] B: Yeah. People don't realize that.
[61:05] A: Yeah. The social dilemma is scary, but it's so accurate. Yeah. It's why I don't, I don't, I don't really do any of that social media stuff.
[61:17] B: I think more people need to understand that. But you know that's not true. Oh, no, it's true.
[61:24] A: Well, it's scary because they know you better than you know you.
[61:28] B: They can predict what you're going to like.
[61:30] A: What did they say in that There was a like 300% increase in self harm behaviors and depression and suicide in kids, you know, 13 through 18 since the social media became on a handheld device in 2008. Nine, whatever.
[61:50] B: Yes. And so now it's all they know. They're constantly comparing themselves to people that aren't even accurate or even look like that.
[61:57] A: Yeah.
[61:58] B: It's amazing what a good photo angle can do for you.
[62:00] A: Yeah, it's right. You used to just get bullied by the people that you went to school with. Now it's the world. It's crazy.
[62:11] B: Yeah.
[62:13] A: But here's the other problem. Facebook. Do you know how originally it came from?
[62:22] B: No, I don't.
[62:23] A: It was a program that was written where the pictures from the yearbook of the girls at Harvard would pop up and the guys would rate them. That was the original. And they send it to different. That was the original incantation of Facebook. Isn't that crazy?
[62:41] B: Why Harvard girls?
[62:42] A: Because they were at Harvard.
[62:44] B: Oh, so they're sexy and printed college. Oh, so it was Harvard.
[62:48] A: That.
[62:49] B: Wow. Was it like one of those, like where you can like rate how like the sex was or whatever?
[62:56] A: Like one of those it wasn't just about. No, it wasn't. It was, like, their looks. Right. That's where it originally started. And then they would pass it around so it would go to people's things, and that became, like, a site that people could go to to kind of rate the look. So there's a undercurrent of, like, sleaziness that's attached to that.
[63:21] B: That sounds like almost like a. Like, erotic reviews or erotic monkeys where they can, like, rate, you know, the women.
[63:28] A: That's fun.
[63:29] B: Yeah.
[63:30] A: And I like that they call it erotic monkeys.
[63:36] B: I thought that's such an interesting thing.
[63:40] A: That's awesome. Yeah, good. Baboons and chimpanzees.
[63:51] B: She created a profile of, like, an actual monkey on there, right?
[63:53] A: Yeah. George, he was curious. Yeah. Yeah.
[64:01] B: Oh, man, the shit they have out there nowadays.
[64:04] A: Right, Right. So let's say, you know, something might happen where, you know, you might have done something, and they might be like, but, Madison, why. Why'd you do that?
[64:20] B: It's not gonna affect me.
[64:22] A: What do you notice?
[64:25] B: They're doing it to have me recognize something that was subconscious so that I can now be conscious.
[64:31] A: Yeah. Right, right. They're also interested. Even if at every moment I don't feel like they are, they may deliver it in a poor way that I get offended by. However, their intention, as part of an employee in a program is that they're wanting to support you in becoming a better version of you. Even if they screw up sometimes, Even if they don't say it in the most tactful, polite way. Even if they say it in a way that you get offended by. So now let's think about, like, a. Okay, so there are different residents. Some you stay in the same room with.
[65:18] B: Yeah.
[65:19] A: One.
[65:19] B: One. Yeah.
[65:21] A: Others you see around the house.
[65:23] B: Yeah.
[65:23] A: Right. And what's something that, you know, somebody either has done, could do, might do, that normally would, like, upset you, that you just are like, hey. They don't let him know that I. Yeah, one of those kind of moments.
[65:49] B: It sounds so stupid now. I'm thinking, so perfect.
[65:52] A: Right? We like stupid things.
[65:57] B: I'm sharing a room with someone, and I like, on my. On the chore chart, it said that I was supposed to clean the bathroom. I cleaned the whole bathroom.
[66:05] A: Yes.
[66:06] B: She comes to me and says, hey, can you clean half of the room?
[66:09] A: Yes.
[66:10] B: I was like, I cleaned the whole bathroom. I didn't ask you to clean half of the bathroom.
[66:14] A: Right.
[66:16] B: So I just said, yeah, that's fine. But then I went to the Advocate.
[66:19] A: And told her she's asking me to.
[66:21] B: Do more than I should.
[66:24] A: That's the. You know, my daughter does the same thing. Daphne, can you pick up the plates and put them. Well, why? Might have to do it.
[66:31] B: Daisy didn't pick up the airplane. It sounds like me and your daughter.
[66:37] A: Have a lot in common. Pretty good, right? That kind of thing. Okay, so now she does it, right? Let's say that happens, right? How do we want you to be when she says that?
[66:56] B: I want to respond in a way that honors my feelings.
[66:59] A: Okay, so let's think about. What would you be wanting to say to her?
[67:08] B: Well, I cleaned the whole bathroom, and I don't mind cleaning my part of the dresser, nightstand, but if I'm cleaning my half of the room, I don't feel like that's necessarily fair because I cleaned the whole whole bathroom.
[67:21] A: Hip Madison. Life's not fair.
[67:25] B: I like not fair.
[67:27] A: No, life is not fair.
[67:28] B: Oh, life is not what the told.
[67:29] A: You that it was. They totally lied to you.
[67:34] B: My parents. You can talk to them about that.
[67:37] A: Yeah, they lied.
[67:38] B: I grew up thinking that, like, white picket America, you know, like the perfect family with two kids, one son, one girl. Ivy League schools, everything's fine. Like, that's how I grew up. Yeah, I realized that real quickly.
[67:56] A: So is that what you really want, to say no to her? I mean, hey, man, like, I don't mind, like, doing my own dresser and making my own bed, but, like, if I, like, have to, like, do like, that when I already did all of that and I asked you to, like, clean the shower while I clean the toilet. I kind of did all of it. I don't think it's going to rip like that I have to do that. Is that what you really want to say? What would it be like to just say, yeah, no, I can't do that, or just, like, no, thank you. Can you go?
[68:41] B: I feel like I have to justify my.
[68:42] A: Madison, can you go ahead and clean half the room? No. Yeah, no, thank you.
[68:48] B: I'd run.
[68:50] A: Or. Yeah, no. Or what would it be like to. Yeah, sure, I'll go ahead and make my bed.
[68:58] B: Okay.
[69:01] A: Right. Like, think. Think about. Like, they're asking you. She's asking and making a request. You don't feel like you've got the freedom to deny the request?
[69:11] B: Yeah, sure.
[69:12] A: Yeah, no, I'd love to. Actually, could I go ahead and clean your half, too? And is there any other chores that you don't want to do that you could give to me? Because, like, I'd like to do all of them. Right. So I want you to think of her saying that and you not feeling free to actually say anything, regardless of a variety different things. Go ahead and do it. Right. There's that feeling like, because that presses that same. But so I want you to think of her doing that, whether it be her or somebody else. And you can't really get that discomfort. Okay. Right. As you get the feeling, let the feeling tone guide you back. Let the feeling tone take you back so that it grows you earlier and younger. Back, back. And what experience comes to mind?
[70:07] B: Specifically with my parents, you might have.
[70:10] A: Been how old and what was the thing that happened? Because we want to narrow it to a time, even though it happened more than a time.
[70:19] B: The I think with my dad, when it came to sports, and I would tell him like, no, I don't want to do this sport. And he wouldn't accept it. And so I felt like I had to rationalize like why I didn't want to do something or why I want to eat the way that he ate. Or I felt like my feelings weren't valid or what I. My no. Wasn't valid.
[70:37] A: Uh huh. So now that's the overall explanation of it.
[70:42] B: Yeah.
[70:43] A: Let's think of a time that it happened. You're where?
[70:47] B: Mm.
[70:49] A: Like, are you at his house? You're about how old?
[70:53] B: Um, I'm trying to think of like a specific time.
[70:58] A: Yeah, we want to narrow it to a particular time.
[71:04] B: Was at. Was at his house.
[71:06] A: Yeah. So you're at his house. You're about how old?
[71:08] B: Probably like 15.
[71:12] A: And you're where in the house?
[71:14] B: We're in like the hallway having a conversation. Well, more of an argument.
[71:17] A: Right. So he's saying, he's saying, why aren't.
[71:20] B: You like doing sports? Why aren't you doing these things? And yes, when I've told like I told him.
[71:26] A: You said, because I don't want to. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[71:29] B: He said, well, you need to do them and.
[71:31] A: Right. Good. Then what happened?
[71:33] B: Then I felt. I felt like he wasn't hearing that. I don't want to.
[71:36] A: Then what happened?
[71:37] B: I shut down and.
[71:39] A: No. Then what happened? Notice how it's stopping at the worst spot. But then what happened next? He said, well, no, you have to. And then what happened?
[71:52] B: I think I went to my room.
[71:53] A: No, you went to your room. Right. Which was better than when he talked to them. Yeah, I was saying that. And then maybe you had gone to a practice.
[72:01] B: Yeah.
[72:01] A: That you didn't want to have to go to. And then that moment ended. Right. And then later on, you signed up for school because you wanted to.
[72:07] B: Yeah.
[72:08] A: Right. Not because he told you you had to. Right. So we got that you signed up for school.
[72:12] B: Yeah.
[72:13] A: Right. And then you might have gone to a practice. And then you went to your room. Right. And then he said you had to. And you're like, but I don't want to. And he's like, how come you're not doing this? And then you guys were like in that thing. And then you were at his house before that. You were doing whatever you're doing again, going backwards now, checking it out. What do you notice about the feelings?
[72:31] B: Not as severe.
[72:33] A: You can remember him doing that. You can remember putting your sandals on. Well, stop putting on your sandals. We'll stop him from saying that.
[72:40] B: He's not saying that.
[72:40] A: We'll stop him from making you do that.
[72:42] B: He's not making me do that.
[72:43] A: Well, then you stop getting this tattoo.
[72:45] B: I'm not getting this tattoo.
[72:46] A: Stop me from putting on my glasses.
[72:47] B: You're not putting on glasses.
[72:48] A: Well, stop that from happening.
[72:49] B: I can't. It's not happening.
[72:51] A: So where is it? It doesn't exist. It's in the past.
[72:53] B: No, no, it doesn't exist. Doesn't.
[72:55] A: There isn't a place that we can go to to watch it called the past 15 year old you. Come on, buddy. You have to. You're really good.
[73:07] B: I'm not gonna.
[73:19] A: Pretty soon, dad, I'm going to be older than one of the girls that you date. So again, now as you're thinking about it, that earlier you didn't have say then. Right. Why?
[73:50] B: Because my parents spent lesser. Because I. Because.
[73:55] A: Because you were younger. Yeah, 15. Living in their house.
[74:01] B: Yeah.
[74:02] A: With parents that were dictating what you could or couldn't do. You didn't live in a free country then.
[74:10] B: True.
[74:10] A: Right. Like in a country communist or a dictatorship. If they say, this is what you have to do, then you do it. I go, yeah, but I don't feel like it. There's no not feeling like it. Yeah, but I don't want to. Yeah, no, there's no. I don't want to. Actually, you can say, I don't want to. I don't fucking care that I don't want to do it anyway. Right. The world, the military works the same way. In the United States, if the superior officer says, you need to go clean those toilets. Yeah, but I don't want to clean those toilets. Oh, well, then you're, give me 20 foot. No, I'm not gonna do that. And it'll go to, like, you'll go through the brink. You'll get locked up like they. You in the military fight for freedom. You're not free when you're in the military.
[75:00] B: Yeah, right.
[75:01] A: But you fight for everybody else's freedom, but you're not free in the military.
[75:05] B: Yeah.
[75:05] A: Yeah. Isn't that interesting?
[75:07] B: Very interesting.
[75:09] A: So that you thought that she should, but it wasn't that she couldn't because clearly she did. Right?
[75:17] B: Yeah.
[75:18] A: Didn't you stop doing the sports? Yeah, you did.
[75:21] B: Yeah.
[75:21] A: Right. Like you didn't do any when you were 16? No. No. And when that guy took you and you were, like, lost in that whole thing, you weren't actually, like, playing sports then? No. Oh, I. I know that you guys want to gang bang rape me tonight, but could you get me to the field hockey game first? I'll be wearing that skirt, so it'll be. Yeah, but I gotta play in the field hockey game first. And then there's swim practice, so make sure, like, you pick me up after swim, y'all. Right. That wasn't happening, was it? No. I feel like we don't know what to win. Right. Do you realize that I have a game today?
[76:03] B: Get it together.
[76:04] A: I mean, volleyball practice, you know, starts in 10 minutes. I'm gonna be late. That wasn't. So you actually did stop.
[76:18] B: Yeah.
[76:18] A: You just didn't think you could.
[76:20] B: Exactly.
[76:20] A: Right. But what you know now is that you actually did so you could. Right. You got say. You had total say, even if they didn't want you to. That's right. By the way, dad's upset, was that about you or about him?
[76:35] B: About him.
[76:36] A: Yeah. You didn't know that then either?
[76:37] B: No.
[76:38] A: Right. So close your eyes. Think back to the younger you. Let her know that that's over. That it no longer exists. That you did actually get to stop. That you have full sense. Right. Let the you know that you're now a grown up. That's right. That is in control of your feeling free. Maybe not all the things that you might do or have to do, but absolutely you're in control of your feeling free. Let the younger you know that dad's upset was about dad. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Let her know about signing up for classes because she wants to. Right. For staying. Even though she had the thoughts and feelings of wanting to leave. Right. Right. That she has say. Right. She has say to choose to be in the program. Even if that means that while in the program I don't. I don't have Full say of everything I do. Right. But I'm absolutely in control of your feeling free. Right. And as all of this gets in, again, check inside you what's happening now.
[78:00] B: More understanding, more peace.
[78:03] A: Right, Right. And as we think about that whole other component. Right. The other thing that's going on with all of this has been that feeling that in order for me to say something, I have to have a lot of justification as to why I'm saying what I'm saying. Right? Yeah. So notice how that's been problematic. You can open your eyes. Right. That's something that you kind of find yourself kind of in that. Well, I got it. Like, explain, because it. Right. If I want to fire somebody and I've already made the decision that I want to fire them, do I have to give them a reason why I'm firing them? Not in Florida. It's a right to work state. I can just tell them that you're not a good fit for this practice. And if they ask me the question why, I say, well, this practice is not a good fit for you. And if they say why, I go, well, because you're not a good fit for this practice. And we can continue that statement back and forth forever, but think we're done. Right. If so, so what would it be like for you to be more direct, more freeing, meaning more succinct with what you're saying? That it's not about justifying why I feel the way I feel. So, yeah, no, I don't want to, like, clean the other side of the room because, like, I've already done my chore and this is like, your chore. So, like, because I. Maybe if I hadn't already done my chore, if you were going to help me with my chore, then maybe I would help you with your chore. But because I've already done my full chore, I don't really want to have to help you with your tour.
[79:51] B: Because it's spot on.
[79:53] A: It's so great, isn't it? Right. Versus, like. Yeah, no, I don't really want to do that.
[80:02] B: Be a lot simpler. Probably save about five minutes of my life.
[80:05] A: You think, oh, my goodness, like, you think I got a lot of stuff on my plate. Well, jeez, I just freed up a whole chunk of energy and time. Right, right. So. Got it.
[80:17] B: Yeah.
[80:17] A: So here's the thing that earlier, younger you again, was thinking that it was in the explaining that would get her to be able to do it. Got it.
[80:28] B: Yeah.
[80:29] A: So it wasn't just okay to stop doing something Right. Like, hey, Dad, I don't want to do volleyball anymore. Well, why? You know, it's just not my thing. I don't want to do it anymore. I'm not having any fun. Yeah, but why? Well, like, you know, it's not like a good thing. Well, you can't quit.
[80:50] B: Yeah.
[80:51] A: Mid season. You've got to finish out the season. Well, I really don't want to play. No, you have to. Yeah. Oh, okay. Right. It doesn't do anything. Maybe if I come up with a stricter one. Well, like, you know, I don't really want to play. Well, why? Well, because of all those other. Yeah, but why? Well, the coach is molesting me. All right, well, then you don't have to play. Finally, I figured out a why that would work. It wasn't true, but, yeah, it works. Fuck that guy's life. But I didn't have to play volleyball anymore.
[81:33] B: So true.
[81:35] A: Right. So the younger you had been thinking that it was in the explanation that was going to give her the ability to. But what we know is that it didn't matter how much explaining she did, because in those moments, she didn't have the freedom. Right. Right. What we know now is you do. So what would it be like for you to be free to say no?
[82:07] B: Amazing.
[82:08] A: Right? You know, I don't really want to. I don't. I don't want to do that. Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you thinking of. I know, you know that I always like to do extra things for other people, so I appreciate you thinking and offering an extra thing that I could be right. I mean, right now, can you clean up the other half of the room? I could. I'm not gonna. Yeah, it's not. The question. Isn't. Oh, so you were just checking whether I had the ability to. I totally have the ability to. I mean, I could. I'm not going to, but I totally could.
[82:46] B: Yeah.
[82:47] A: I just don't really want it. Yeah. Right. See, what would it be like to be able to say, I don't want to, and it be okay to say no and it'd be okay. Right. So let's think of a. You free to say no.
[83:01] B: Okay.
[83:02] A: Right. In the situations that it makes sense. Got it. And again, go ahead and close your eyes. Take a deep breath in and a long exhale. Good. Continue to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper. That's right. As you're breathing in this slower and deeper way, slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue, relaxing the back of your tongue. That's right. Drifting deeper and deeper down inside towards light at your center. That calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy, the light that is you becoming more free to be more okay in all the ways you're ongoingly changing. That's right. More and more free. Because you're in total control of your feeling free. Beginning to lighten up on the inside more and more. Okay. That's right. Free to say no to the things that don't work. That's right. To the things that I don't have to. I don't want to. Right. Always with the knowledge that if I did want to, I totally couldn't. That's right. And as all of this is starting to sink in to grading in different ways inside, that other than conscious part can also travel back down the timeline in your own personal history of things that were negative to grow you younger and earlier and earlier and younger and younger. Back, back, back. Right, right. And it may actually move to a time where it was in the explaining and I do feel like you actually could do or didn't have to do. That's right. As that part travels back to the moment, what is it that comes to mind?
[85:32] B: When I did have to explain.
[85:37] A: It could be a moment that it felt that in the explaining, it worked for me to either have to do something or not have to do something.
[85:47] B: I think like the explaining of why, because my parents had me on a really busy schedule.
[85:53] A: That's right.
[85:54] B: With.
[85:55] A: So you're about how old? I would say.
[86:01] B: Probably 11.
[86:04] A: Yeah. So you're 11 and you're aware and what's happening?
[86:11] B: I think I was going to therapy at the time, and I was telling my therapist, I was like, I'm tired of the schedule. I'm tired of the back and forth.
[86:17] A: That's right.
[86:18] B: And came up with some explanation that was partially true and partially not. But it got me to have an easier schedule.
[86:23] A: So the therapist and you kind of worked out a way to say it to your folks. Yeah. And then you did what? You sat down with mom and dad.
[86:30] B: You, mom and my mom. And then I told them separately.
[86:35] A: So you're with mom and you said. Said to mom the thing that you and the therapist said. Right?
[86:39] B: Yeah.
[86:39] A: And mom's like, oh, okay.
[86:41] B: Yeah.
[86:41] A: But you need to tell your father. Yeah.
[86:43] B: And then she's like, we're willing to work on a schedule that'd be best for you.
[86:46] A: That's right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[86:49] B: And then I told my dad. My dad was like, if your mom's okay, then with it.
[86:51] A: Then we'll work on it. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[86:54] B: We changed the schedule.
[86:55] A: That's right. And then that was over. Right. And see that you was thinking that it was in the explaining. Right. Did it have anything to do with the explaining?
[87:07] B: No.
[87:08] A: No. What did it have to do with your parents also thinking that they want what's best for you. Right. I mean, in that moment, they're going, okay, if the feedback that we've just gotten is that there's too much, maybe. Maybe we need to do less. Right, Right. Like one of the things that I make sure with my children is they're not in too many activities because I like my own life. I love my kids, Totally love my kids. But I also want my life to work. Yeah. Right. So if I am always doing. And they've got this activity, that activity, that activ. Activity. That activity, that activity. Well, I'm gonna make them choose. Right?
[87:58] B: Yeah.
[88:00] A: So what we're noticing then is it had more to do with the whom you talk to about it first. Right. Than it did with the explanation.
[88:14] B: Yeah.
[88:14] A: And it had everything to do with that. They were. Mom and dad were okay with it because guess what? If you had told him all of that stuff and. And they still weren't okay, what would you have had to do? What they wanted you to do. Right. Because when you're 11, you don't get to decide. That's right. You don't really get to decide what your bedtime is. You don't get to decide what you're going to eat for dinner because you eat what's being made. Sometimes they might ask you, what do you want? You might be able to say, but even then they're gonna make whatever they make could be what you asked for, but they're gonna make what they make. And then you're gonna have to eat that. Right. You don't have say. Yeah. Right. But you do have say. So did it have anything to do with the. With the explaining or did it have to do with that they were in.
[89:07] B: Agreement that they were in agreement.
[89:09] A: Yeah. And. And not the second third part. But it also made it easier for them. Yeah. Right. So the explaining wasn't it? Is that it got to a win win. Good for me. Good for you.
[89:24] B: Yeah.
[89:25] A: Right. So close your eyes, think back to the younger you and let her know what you know now that it had nothing to do with the long winded explanation and everything to do with that. It was win, win for them and me so that she gets it right. And again Check inside. And what are you noticing now?
[89:49] B: More confidence and just saying no.
[89:52] A: Yeah. So you can open your eyes and let's say, you know, your roommate's like, hey, could you go ahead and, you know, clean at least your side of the room?
[90:02] B: No.
[90:03] A: Yeah. Why not? What the hell?
[90:06] B: Because I've already cleaned the bathroom.
[90:10] A: I don't want to. Yeah, right. I don't want to. Yeah. But normally when I ask you to do things so I don't have to, you do them. Fuck's wrong with you?
[90:25] B: A lot.
[90:28] A: Guess what? I'm in a fucking program for women who have been trapping. There's nothing. A lot. Which one? That's perfect. Right.
[90:45] B: That's when I would exit stage. Right.
[90:47] A: So good. Right. So again, just think about like you might be somewhere else in the house and somebody's gonna sit, say something to you, or do something that normally causes that thing. So what's something else that either has or might happen that normally produces that in you?
[91:07] B: They leave old moldy food in the fridge because they don't understand the concept of expirations.
[91:15] A: Yeah. So let's say that happens. Right. What normally goes on with you? So you open up the refrigerator. Yeah. And you pull something out that you wanted to eat and then you open it up and you see that. Yeah.
[91:32] B: Fungus among us.
[91:33] A: Right. Good. Right.
[91:35] B: Yeah.
[91:35] A: And then what happens normally?
[91:37] B: Normally I just throw it out and I'm just sort of pissed off about it and I don't say anything.
[91:41] A: Huh. It's not a thing. What's going on right now, as you think about it?
[91:47] B: Slight frustration.
[91:49] A: Uh huh. What is it that's missing? I mean, you already said earlier, you know what I'm saying?
[91:57] B: I mean, just saying something about it.
[91:59] A: What? What is it that somebody doesn't know?
[92:02] B: What is it that someone doesn't know?
[92:04] A: Yeah.
[92:04] B: What I don't tell them, like they can't know what I don't tell them.
[92:07] A: That's for sure. But about the food and the rest. Refrigerator. Okay. What is it that they don't know that would be useful for them to.
[92:16] B: Know that bothers me?
[92:18] A: Oh, no, no. I'm not sure they really give a. No, no. Lost sleep for me. Wow, she looks really pissed that she had to throw away moldy food.
[92:37] B: I wanted a strawberry.
[92:39] A: Right. What do people need to know that they don't know that food can get moldy?
[92:45] B: Oh, yes.
[92:47] A: Right.
[92:48] B: And if I saw you saying bring it to their attention maybe.
[92:59] A: What a crazy concept, right? Maybe what we want to put in with the strawberries to preserve them Longer is a paper towel. I know. So it's not so moist. Moist.
[93:18] B: I hate that word.
[93:23] A: Duncan Hines makes moist cake. Right. Lovely. So that's not going to be the line that you want the guy to say. Wow, you know.
[93:39] B: My involuntary gag reflex, like.
[93:45] A: Awful. But, like, what would happen if you were to bring it to somebody's awareness?
[93:52] B: Then they would be aware of.
[93:54] A: Yeah. And as you think about doing it now, how does it feel?
[93:59] B: Enlightening.
[94:00] A: Oh, right. Any discomfort?
[94:03] B: No.
[94:03] A: Right.
[94:05] B: Because it's realizing that.
[94:07] A: Right. Sometimes I'm providing feedback because people don't know.
[94:10] B: Yeah.
[94:11] A: Like somebody's got parsley in their tooth. Why do you know that you got parsley? That'd be. How long have I been walking around with parsley? You know me. You're my friend. You didn't tell me. Hey.
[94:27] B: Why didn't you tell me this sooner?
[94:31] A: Right. You know, you got toilet paper hanging out. Awesome. I'm so glad I walked around and that. That. Yeah. Great. That explains why they were pointing at me and laughing. Thank you. I thought I had parsley. Yeah, right. So what's one other thing that might happen? Typically happens that normally would.
[95:03] B: Probably just like. I don't.
[95:09] A: I mean, maybe somebody asked you to something.
[95:11] B: Yeah. I think it's really just like when people. When people ask me to do something because.
[95:17] A: So let's think that what might be something that somebody predictably is going to ask you to do that. Because they normally have and that produces. Normally that. Yeah, sure, of course.
[95:28] B: Can you help me do something?
[95:30] A: What would be the thing?
[95:32] B: Be specific. I don't know why, but everyone comes to me with there, like, questions about school and like, how, like, how do you spell something? How do you.
[95:41] A: Like.
[95:41] B: And it's not like I don't mind helping someone spell something, but it's like, hey, can you help me solve this algebraic equation? It's like, yeah, sure, I got you. But like, at the same time, I'm like, I got my own shit to do.
[95:49] A: Like, you know, so what would it be like? See, it's not about never doing it. Yeah. It's about doing it on the terms and times that it works for you. So more of just not having to when it doesn't. So let's just think of that somebody might come up to you and go, hey, can you spell, you know, capital C, a P, I, T, A l. Thank you.
[96:10] B: 10 points.
[96:12] A: They might say something like that. And that's a very fast one. Easy for you to do. Hey, could you help me do my bath homework? Give me a Minute, right? Yeah. Give me a minute. Or I can't do it right now. Maybe little bit later. Yeah, right. As you think about just saying that, how does it feel? Better.
[96:35] B: And, like, I'm still, like, I don't mind helping, but I'm doing it on my terms.
[96:40] A: Thing that we want is somebody who does caretaking, which you have some of that, and caregiving gets benefit out of it. They feel good that they've done something that's helped somebody. The problem is when they don't feel they can not do it, they feel that they have to. Then it feels obliged, and then they become resentful over having to do it.
[97:00] B: Yeah.
[97:00] A: Right. So what we want, and this is what we've been doing, is to get it so that you're free to do it when it works for you and free to not have to when it doesn't and feel okay both ways. Right. Okay.
[97:16] B: That makes sense.
[97:17] A: Right. Hey, can you clean half the room? No, I can't do it this time. I'm doing this other thing. This book is fascinating.
[97:28] B: I'm diagnosing all of y'all.
[97:30] A: That's right. I mean, all that. Whatever you want to do with that. But notice what you notice now as you think about saying that. Right, Right. Yeah. Hey, did you know that they asked me about his algebra problem and I didn't want them to ask me.
[97:47] B: Can you tell them to not ask me?
[97:54] A: Sure. Okay, everybody, don't ask her about algebra problem. Geometry is fine, she said, but not algebra. Okay, I'm not sure. Is this algebra or geometry?
[98:10] B: Does it have a shape in it or no?
[98:12] A: Tell me whether this is right shape again. Just check. What do you notice now?
[98:22] B: It feels better because I'm honoring myself and honoring myself.
[98:24] A: That's right. That's right. So it's not about always saying no. It's about only saying no when it doesn't work for me. And the freedom to say yes when it does. And the freedom to say no when it does. Right, Right. Because you're totally in control of your feeling free.
[98:42] B: Yes.
[98:42] A: Right. To do it when it works and not when it doesn't. And feel okay both ways. Right. And it's not about explaining because the explanation doesn't matter. If I've already made the decision to fire the person, my explanation as to why doesn't matter because the net result is they're still fired. Right?
[99:11] B: Yeah.
[99:12] A: So if I say to them, well, you know, you're fired because of the inappropriate common ingestion thing that you did with the client last week, Or I tell them that you're fired. Because, you know, I've been getting feedback over time about how people don't actually particularly benefit from your therapy. It's not like they're gonna go, oh, my goodness, wow. Well, thank you for that. And I'll work on being a better therapist. It's not like they're gonna say, oh, my goodness, you should have gotten rid of me sooner.
[99:47] B: Yeah.
[99:47] A: I can't believe you kept me on this long.
[99:49] B: Yeah.
[99:50] A: No, they're gonna come up with a reason why my reason is good enough reason for them.
[99:54] B: Yeah. And it's gonna turn this whole debate or bubble, and we don't need to.
[99:57] A: Go there with that. So notice I get the freedom to say yes when it works and know when it doesn't. And feeling okay both ways. Okay. Right.
[100:05] B: Yeah.
[100:05] A: Cuz check it out right now. Hey, you know, can you clean out the room?
[100:09] B: No.
[100:09] A: Right, Right. Yeah.
[100:15] B: It's a lot easier.
[100:16] A: It is, right? And what you may get up front right away is people that are like, like, how come?
[100:24] B: What the hell?
[100:25] A: Like, because this is not what we're expecting of you. Mm. Right. You might get that. And that's okay because, again, that's about them. Yeah.
[100:33] B: And it's about me honoring myself. And so if they don't like it.
[100:36] A: Then, oh, well, why can't you? I mean, it's not like it's that hard. It's your side. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't want to.
[100:44] B: I don't want to.
[100:50] A: Really. Not this time. Yeah. I appreciate you taking care of it, though. Yeah.
[100:58] B: Okay.
[100:59] A: Right.
[101:01] B: Makes sense.
[101:04] A: It's not on me this time. So's you.
[101:09] B: Yeah.
[101:10] A: All right, Melissa. I mean, there are times that it's actually my turn to clean the room, and I do.
[101:15] B: Yeah. There's times where it's my turn to clean the bathroom when I clean the bathroom, so.
[101:19] A: Right. Yeah. Right. And I wonder what it would be like sometimes for you to even ask them. Hey, do you think you could make your bed for me so I don't have to? Yeah, sure. Mark. Now. Okay. I'd like to feel like I have a maid today, but check it out. How are you feeling now?
[101:40] B: It doesn't feel daunting.
[101:42] A: Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[101:44] B: Yeah.
[101:45] A: Yeah. All right. You did great today. Thank you. Yeah. Maybe we can get together again and, you know, not in, like, another six months.
[101:53] B: I would hope so. Hopefully fall, you know, shit doesn't hit the fan.
[101:58] A: Right? There we go.
