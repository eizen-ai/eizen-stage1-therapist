[00:00] A: So today is the 4th of October, and Madison, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful and transformative, that recording may be made available in teaching and training other professionals and how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes. All right, cool. So I'd be really interested in two things. One, getting a sense of what we want our time together to get accomplished for you, and two, whatever you think would be useful for me to know, to understand how things have been. Okay, Right. So sometimes people come in and they tell me things like, I'm a lot more on edge. I'm more easily irritated, agitated, aggravated. I may be quick or short or reactive. I might say or do things that later on I'm like, I wish I hadn't said or done that. And I don't want to be so reactive in that.
[00:52] B: Okay?
[00:52] A: Some people go, you know what? For me, I'm more tense, nervous, anxious. I get racy thoughts. Sometimes it affects sleep, sometimes it moves into full fledged panic. Sometimes in certain social situations, I find myself having all sorts of uneasiness and I'd like that to stop. Some people go, you know what? I recognize that there's been a lot of shit that's happened. And although much of it is over and some of it may have been over for years and years underneath the surface, it still has an effect. Not that I think about it all the time, but if I do or if some reminds me of it, there's still a lot of about it. I'd like that to be gone. Some people come in and they go, you know what? For me, it's more about grief. There's people that I was really close with that I witnessed die or other things happened, and I've got a lot of like around that. Some of it might be like guilt or shame. Some people come in and they're more down, depressed, they're lethargic. They used to have interest in energy and now they don't have that. They want that better. And other people have problematic thoughts, cravings, desires. They'd like that to stop too. So those are like the biggest broad generalities, right? So that being said, I'd really be interested in learning more about what you would be wanting our time to do for you. Right. Like if we could really truly change ways that you think or feel or act or react, what do we want to get better for you?
[02:17] B: I think that what you said about the underlying, like, you know, the underlying stuff that. Or the stuff that's happened in the past still sort of, like, affecting, you know, like certain things. Triggering, I guess.
[02:27] A: Yeah. Like, how so?
[02:29] B: I don't know. It's like, random stuff. But I. Like, the one thing that pops in my mind is I know we drove past, like, a hotel that I was at when I had. Most recently, I had the whole abuse case thing happen. So, like, with that, I think just, like, it brought up stuff. And then I think I'll go back. I'll go to, like, romanticizing it and not really, like, remembering, like, what really happened, I guess.
[02:54] A: Romanticizing the black eye?
[03:00] B: Yeah. Like, it's not that bad.
[03:02] A: I love. I mean, I was trying to be more of a raccoon, so they got one of them done and. Yeah, right. Halloween's coming and, you know, I told.
[03:15] B: Her I'm always like, well, it wasn't that bad.
[03:17] A: Oh, okay.
[03:17] B: You know, I justify it where I'm like, minimize.
[03:22] A: Wasn't that bad. Is there any of it, like. Well, you know, I kind of, like, deserved it. Does that ever show up? Yeah, no, it does. Awesome. Okay. So sometimes it brings stuff up where there's discomfort, but then sometimes you kind of flip it around. Well, okay. Whoever it was with, it really wasn't that bad. And maybe they do really care about me.
[03:47] B: Yeah.
[03:48] A: In a really fucked up, weird way. But maybe they. They do care. Yeah, I kind of care that they care. Okay. So we'd like that whole thing to get adjusted.
[03:58] B: Yeah, totally.
[04:01] A: So that. That's not running in there.
[04:03] B: Yeah.
[04:03] A: Okay. Yeah, Cool. I follow you with that. What else would be useful for me to know?
[04:10] B: I think the grief of. I gave my daughter up for adoption. I did open adoption, so that's difficult.
[04:16] A: What does that mean?
[04:17] B: I. So I did an adoption where someone else is raising her, but I'm still part of her life. So, like, I still have to get pictures, I still get videos. I still get to see her once a year. But it's still a lot of shame and guilt around, like. I don't know. It's a very. It's like, I need.
[04:33] A: There's a lot of shame and guilt around that. You. Your daughter got adopted into a more better environment than the one you were giving her.
[04:40] B: Yeah, I think it's more of like, what a jerk. I know. I'm such an asshole.
[04:49] A: Man. I mean, she could have been with that guy just punching me in the eye. I mean, that would have been better.
[04:57] B: He's in prison.
[05:00] A: Shit. Then where would she have gone?
[05:03] B: Okay, but we when you say it like that, you know.
[05:12] A: Yeah. Okay. So we'd like to get the bad feelings that have been attached to having done that.
[05:18] B: Yeah.
[05:19] A: Lighten and lift it so that it's not so weighing on you and that.
[05:23] B: I can see her and interact with her in a positive way and that I can still, you know, like, it not be so hard to interact with her.
[05:30] A: Because right now you get a lot of, like, bad feelings when you do. Like when I see picture or.
[05:37] B: Yeah. Like I'm not there. I should be there. I should have had my shit together. I should have been able to go from a meth heroin addict to being clean while pregnant and getting, you know.
[05:50] A: Yeah.
[05:50] B: Working minimum wage and supporting myself like that, you know?
[05:53] A: Absolutely.
[05:54] B: Very hard on myself.
[05:55] A: Okay. So we'd like you to lighten up a little bit.
[05:58] B: Just a little bit.
[05:59] A: Yeah, yeah. Because it's not helpful for her.
[06:02] B: No.
[06:02] A: For you to feel bad.
[06:04] B: No.
[06:04] A: That she's in a better environment than the one that you are going to be able to provide at that time. Yeah.
[06:09] B: She would have been a hotel.
[06:11] A: Right. Not so good. The guys coming in. Oh, don't worry about her. She's coloring. She's coloring. She's not paying any attention. It'll be fine. Is that a baby crying? You don't know? No. Right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
[06:27] B: Yeah. All right.
[06:27] A: So we'd like you to lighten up on you a little.
[06:29] B: Yeah.
[06:29] A: Okay, cool. I know how to do that.
[06:31] B: Okay.
[06:33] A: What else would be useful for me to know? What else are we wanting better for you?
[06:37] B: Shit show, hot mess.
[06:44] A: I don't know what else would be useful. I follow you. That one of the things that you recognize that's been problematic is that there are certain things that you'll see that remind you of yucky stuff that happen. Second, that there's a tendency when. And it's been bad stuff that's happened to you to kind of minimize or romanticize who they were for you versus what you actually experienced. So you kind of like minimize that to see them. And there's that whole connection thing. And that's been problematic. I get that you've been really hard on you about having given your daughter up for adoption, even though you recognize that you weren't in the right place to be able to raise her in a way that you would want her raised.
[07:30] B: Yeah.
[07:31] A: Okay. So I follow you with all.
[07:32] B: Yeah, cool.
[07:33] A: What else would be useful for me?
[07:35] B: I don't know.
[07:36] A: Done a good job so far.
[07:37] B: Yeah. I don't know. I mean, I think that there's just. I've been to a lot of different therapy.
[07:46] A: Oh, what does that mean?
[07:47] B: I've done attempted. Someone attempted to do EMDR with me. Yeah.
[07:53] A: Watch the fingers. Quick, go.
[07:55] B: Yeah, yeah.
[07:56] A: Did they do vibrations light bar?
[07:58] B: They did the metronome sound thing. Oh, yeah.
[08:03] A: That was fun, right?
[08:04] B: Oh, it was freaking fantastic.
[08:05] A: Worked really well.
[08:06] B: No, it didn't. I ended up in a turtle suit a few days later.
[08:16] A: Okay. So we don't have to worry about that.
[08:21] B: That didn't work out. Yeah. No.
[08:25] A: So you've done some therapy and some even trauma based therapy.
[08:28] B: Yeah.
[08:29] A: And it hasn't been all too helpful.
[08:31] B: No.
[08:31] A: Right. Do you know why it's not helpful?
[08:34] B: Because I'm just like. They're not worried about fixing anything or, like, making anything. Like, I don't know, I feel like it's just more focused on, like, what happened and not, like, how can we make it better. Like, I mean, they are, but it's. I don't know. Or not. I feel like they, like, keep you stuck there. I don't know if that makes sense.
[08:58] A: I follow you, but I'm gonna tell you a little bit of a different thought on it. I think that the reason that therapy hasn't been effective isn't because the therapist doesn't have a good intention. It's that they think that it's your job to get you better and that they're there as a support, a guide and encourager, but that it's your job to do the work similar to what AA will promote. That it's your job to, day by day, keep yourself clean and sober. Which in that regard, that's true. Because you're with you all the time.
[09:34] B: Yeah.
[09:34] A: Right. So if you get an unwanted urge or craving or desire, your job is to finish the story. Right. I mean, that's one step of aa. We want to, like, play the tape all the way through. Not like, oh, wow, that'd be fun to feel. Oh, my. What does it lead to? Right. So it stops being so desirable. And then second, if it keeps spinning, I gotta either a get to a meeting or get to a sponsor so that I can, you know, get myself back. That's fine. In that regard, when it comes to unwanted emotions or thoughts or feelings or reactions, the problem is you're not choosing them.
[10:13] B: Yeah.
[10:13] A: It's not as if you went, okay, so when we drive down the road and we go by that hotel, I'm gonna feel this way.
[10:18] B: Yeah.
[10:19] A: No, you didn't even know that it was gonna happen. You saw it and Boom. You're right in it. Yeah. Oh, he's wonderful. No, wait. Right. Yeah. So when it comes to unwanted thoughts, feelings, behavior, reactions, you're not choosing it, so how could you choose to not have it?
[10:40] B: Yeah, exactly.
[10:42] A: So then the flip side is maybe it's not your job to get those things better.
[10:46] B: Mm.
[10:47] A: Maybe it's somebody else's job with your collaboration. In the same way, when you go to a dental hygienist. Totally her job to clean the teeth. Yeah.
[10:55] B: But we should be keeping them clean.
[10:57] A: Well, that's. Afterwards. But her job to do the teeth cleaning.
[11:01] B: Yeah.
[11:01] A: She needs you there collaborating and cooperating with her. Right. If you're like, okay, we're not getting anything done. Right. So she needs you there. You're in connection. Collaboration, cooperation. But it's her job to do all the work.
[11:18] B: Yeah. And I think that some partially. I wasn't really wanting. I didn't think I had a problem, too, when I was doing some of this therapy.
[11:26] A: Well, you didn't.
[11:27] B: No, I didn't think that for a while.
[11:29] A: Have a problem. No. No.
[11:31] B: Until I ended up in handcuffs multiple times.
[11:33] A: And then. Even then.
[11:35] B: Even then, it was like, it's not really that bad, but it was getting there, if not there.
[11:41] A: So you've done lots of therapy. The therapy wasn't effective. Maybe some of it had to do with you going into it. Maybe some of it. And readiness. Right. Maybe some of it had to do with how they were approaching it.
[11:52] B: Yeah.
[11:53] A: But regardless, it didn't really do what it was designed to do for you.
[11:57] B: No.
[11:57] A: Okay. So we want to actually do things that get things better. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And lots of times, EMDR can be effective for particular trauma.
[12:11] B: Yeah.
[12:11] A: But not for cumulative.
[12:13] B: Yeah. And that's what they're like. Okay. Like, let's make a list of all your trauma.
[12:17] A: Well, that's fine to do.
[12:18] B: I'm like, that's fricking fantastic. Let me write you a book.
[12:20] A: You know, that's really. First of all, it doesn't cause any amount of discomfort in me to start listing all of the awful things that I've gone through.
[12:29] B: What is the checklist? Yeah, it's like, we're just gonna go down the list and make a checklist. Like, this sounds fabulous. What are we, grocery store shopping?
[12:36] A: Yeah. Right. No, not so good. Okay. All right. We don't have to do that either, because we know ways to heal without reliving.
[12:46] B: Yeah.
[12:47] A: Right. And before we actually deal with specific things that have happened, we want to have a clear understanding as to how Come they've continued to affect you and how we're going to get it better. Once we've got those two things, then we can do work.
[13:04] B: Okay.
[13:05] A: Change it. Yeah. Cool. All right. What else would be useful for me to know?
[13:09] B: I don't know. I guess, like being overly, like, like paranoid or like over analyzing. Like, not over maybe overanalyzing, but fearful, I guess. Or anxious. Yeah. So because I put away. Well, I'm in the process of putting away the person that gave me the black eye and like, help me captive for a couple days before I went to the hospital. And so I'm constantly worried about, like, is he gonna find me? Even though I know logically he's not gonna find me, but still being worried about that because he's the one who gave me the death threat.
[13:44] A: Oh, yeah. So he's a really good guy. Oh, he's definitely romanticized that guy all.
[13:53] B: The way, you know?
[13:56] A: Okay. So for you, there's underneath the surface a lot of, like, angsty worry about what could or what might.
[14:05] B: And if.
[14:06] A: Even though, you know, he's in a place that he can't get out of right now.
[14:11] B: Yeah. Okay, well, we're working on. I think. I don't know if he's been. Yeah. They're supposed to be getting him on drug trafficking, which will then give them time because he's a convicted felon. He carries a gun with hollow points. He'll then go away for 10 years for that.
[14:25] A: Really? Definitely romanticize that. Convicted felon, drug trafficking, carries a gun and gun with hollow. Not. Not just gun with regular bullet and an extended clip. Oh, well, I mean, if you're gonna shoot, you've gotta really shoot and shoot to blow up. Okay. Wow.
[14:49] B: I choose winners.
[14:54] A: Okay, so. So we want to turn down the level of angst. Worry around all of that.
[15:02] B: Yeah.
[15:02] A: Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah, that would be useful.
[15:06] B: Yeah. Not overanalyzing every car that like.
[15:09] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Still be aware but not hyper aware. Right. Kind of like we. Like fire detectors in our houses.
[15:20] B: Yeah.
[15:20] A: Because they're supposed to alert us when there's the first sign of smoke early on. Right.
[15:27] B: They don't always do that.
[15:28] A: No, they're not. All right. And we don't very much always pay.
[15:31] B: Attention to them or keep batteries in them. I was just looking around, like, do we have a fire alarm?
[15:37] A: They're hidden.
[15:38] B: Okay. Like that. Yeah.
[15:41] A: Okay. All right, so I follow you with that. What else?
[15:44] B: I think that's it. I don't know.
[15:45] A: That's it.
[15:46] B: I don't know.
[15:47] A: Nothing else? I can't think of nothing.
[15:52] B: You came in with like a grocery list?
[15:54] A: I don't know. I mean, I'm really interested in understanding how things have been.
[15:59] B: Okay.
[16:00] A: And what we want to get better. So what I've gotten. Yeah, go ahead.
[16:03] B: Okay. No, go ahead.
[16:07] A: What I've gotten so far is for you, there's a whole bunch of unwanted emotions that you experience, whether it be around certain places or things that are reminders or stuff that you've done, like with your daughter, that that stuff stuff goes on and we'd like to get that lightened and lifted and cleared. I get that there because of some things that have happened. A whole bunch of over the top worry, angsty vigilance y kind of stuff running. And we want to get that turned down. I get that there's a tendency for you to beat yourself up for some of the things that you did or got into. I get that your picker's off because we're not picking the right kind of like people to hang out with.
[17:01] B: So I don't look like it's turned on.
[17:03] A: I think it's just that thing's been broken. Been way off. Right? Yeah. And we want to get that thing adjusted.
[17:10] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's.
[17:13] A: So those are the things that I've gotten so far. Okay. What else would be useful for me to know, to understand how things have.
[17:20] B: Been, like, in regards to, like in regards.
[17:26] A: I don't know.
[17:27] B: I was gonna say life, but then I'm like, that's a broad category.
[17:30] A: Yes. Right.
[17:37] B: I don't know. I mean, I think I'm like, I like you state. I'm over, like I'm hard on myself. I'm definitely not too professional. Perfectionist, struggle with voicing my opinions. Although I've gotten a lot better about that.
[17:49] A: Okay.
[17:51] B: Like knowing I think my identity, like knowing who I really am because I've allowed others to dictate who I really am.
[17:58] A: How so? What does that mean?
[17:59] B: Like I've lost myself. I lost myself completely in my addiction. I was just someone I wasn't. And then even before that, my family was very like, you know, I'm the pastor's daughter. Well, stepdaughter.
[18:12] A: So like, oh.
[18:18] B: So there's that.
[18:19] A: Is that why you went to Utah?
[18:23] B: Bad for the reputation, you know.
[18:27] A: So your mom married a pastor.
[18:30] B: Uh huh.
[18:30] A: Okay.
[18:31] B: Yeah.
[18:31] A: When you were how old?
[18:33] B: Nine. Nine. My dad's still in the picture. They divorced when I was 2. They still co parent. He's had all his foreign women.
[18:41] A: Dad goes for foreign women.
[18:43] B: Young foreign women.
[18:44] A: Yeah, better.
[18:46] B: Russian, Polish, South American foreign women.
[18:49] A: You want to make sure that they're young.
[18:50] B: Yeah.
[18:51] A: Okay.
[18:53] B: Yeah.
[18:54] A: So there's my age and there's the gal that Dad's dating, and we're kind of like, born in the same year. Well, that's weird.
[19:01] B: Yeah. Okay, so Barely legal.
[19:08] A: Okay.
[19:10] B: Move them in, give them the green card, you know?
[19:13] A: Yeah. So he's done that multiple times. And then Mom. Mom went the other direction.
[19:18] B: Yeah. Yeah. And she's always been conservative. My family. My whole family has been. But then with the whole imagery of the whole pastors thing and gotta be good for. Because my mom was my elementary school. Like, worked in my elementary school. My grandmother was the principal of the elementary school. Stepdad was the pastor of the elementary school.
[19:39] A: Okay.
[19:41] B: Yeah.
[19:42] A: That's cool.
[19:43] B: No, no, Too much family involved.
[19:46] A: Yeah.
[19:47] B: So you gotta always, like, look the best, be the best.
[19:49] A: Okay.
[19:50] B: So I sort of lost my identity. Like, I never knew my identity because of that. So I was always what everyone else wanted me to be, which then I think played even more roles further down the line. And then I lost myself completely when I started going by a different name altogether.
[20:06] A: Not Madison.
[20:07] B: No, Joy.
[20:08] A: Joy. Right.
[20:12] B: No. It's better than Fine White China, which I went by for a very long time.
[20:17] A: Okay. That's awesome. Right. Trying to be a foreign Adele. Of course. No daddy issues, I promise.
[20:32] B: None at all. What are you talking about?
[20:37] A: Okay. Okay.
[20:41] B: I told you. I'm a hot mess. Yeah. So, like, totally skewed my identity. Who I was. Didn't even know. Someone was always telling. Well, not. Yeah, Someone was always telling me what I should do or what. Who I should be or. I was always worried about pleasing, like, being there for other people and not being there for myself and. Yeah. So I think that's like, another issue.
[21:04] A: Just like. So you learned how to be a chameleon.
[21:07] B: Oh, very good chameleon at that. Or at least I thought I was.
[21:11] A: We probably were.
[21:12] B: Yeah.
[21:12] A: Right.
[21:13] B: Especially like when you're escorting, you know, you're. You just sort of morph into whatever.
[21:20] A: Yeah. It was a useful tool.
[21:22] B: Yeah.
[21:23] A: Right. And it still is.
[21:25] B: Yeah.
[21:26] A: Just. We want it more on your terms.
[21:29] B: Yeah.
[21:30] A: Not because.
[21:32] B: Yeah. And not so much of, like. I'm just doing this because I think it's what others want me to do. It's what I want to do.
[21:39] A: That would be useful.
[21:40] B: Yeah.
[21:42] A: So.
[21:42] B: Yeah.
[21:43] A: Okay.
[21:43] B: Yeah.
[21:44] A: So you have lots of different things around. Growing up stuff.
[21:49] B: Yeah.
[21:49] A: Dad, mom, that whole interaction. Grandmom being Mom's Mom?
[21:54] B: Yes.
[21:55] A: Oh, cool.
[21:56] B: Yeah, she's. She's your classic definition of an old lady. Like, she just doesn't know. Like, she's very like, set in her way. She. I love her to death, but I just. Family, like, definitely gonna like as much.
[22:11] A: As I love them.
[22:12] B: I gotta keep my distance because I just. They. They are the like biggest ones I want to please, but then I lose myself in that.
[22:18] A: Ah, okay. And then you go the opposite direction.
[22:22] B: And then I'm like. Then I'm mad at them for something they don't even know that they did. So then I rebel and then it turns into.
[22:28] A: Yeah, okay.
[22:30] B: Yeah.
[22:31] A: So we're really interested in you becoming more of a. Yeah. Yeah.
[22:37] B: Because I don't think I can start talking to my family until I'm more okay with myself.
[22:40] A: Yeah. Like freed up.
[22:42] B: Yeah.
[22:43] A: Yeah.
[22:44] B: Because I think there's a lot of shame around what I've done and they'll hold it to me. My dad even has been counting the years since I started all of this.
[22:52] A: Your birth dad has been counting the years?
[22:55] B: He's like, since January 2014. That's when you. 2014. That's when you fell off the rails. Like. Oh. So we're keeping a timeline on this.
[23:04] A: Okay, well that's useful to know.
[23:10] B: Yeah.
[23:10] A: Thanks, dad.
[23:11] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[23:13] A: So yeah, that was when Svetlana.
[23:17] B: That was actually Kosherman's Lanka.
[23:25] A: So. Good.
[23:28] B: Very close.
[23:28] A: Very close. So you haven't been then in contact with birth dad, Stepdad mom and stepdad and mom are still together?
[23:40] B: Yes.
[23:40] A: And grandma's still alive?
[23:41] B: Yes.
[23:42] A: Okay.
[23:42] B: Stepdad and I have our own issues.
[23:44] A: How it would be so surprising.
[23:47] B: He's extremely inappropriate.
[23:50] A: Oh. As a pastor.
[23:51] B: As a pastor, yeah. He bought me alcohol. Underage. Tried to. Yeah. Always try to just do weird crap, never achieve, but you know, just. Yeah.
[24:04] A: Okay.
[24:04] B: He's just weird.
[24:06] A: Uh huh.
[24:07] B: I didn't like him from like the day my mom like introduced us and.
[24:11] A: Yeah.
[24:12] B: So there's that whole can of worms.
[24:15] A: Okay. And does mom know that?
[24:16] B: Oh, yeah. Weird with you? Yeah.
[24:18] A: Oh.
[24:19] B: She told me I was lying.
[24:20] A: Well, right. You know why she would do that?
[24:25] B: Yeah.
[24:25] A: Not because you're lying. No, no. Do you know why she would do it?
[24:28] B: Because she doesn't want to admit it.
[24:30] A: Oh, no. Not because she doesn't want to.
[24:34] B: What is it?
[24:35] A: No. So. So it's interesting. She can't go there. Not because she doesn't want to admit it, because of what it would mean about her that her own husband would be doing that to her kid.
[24:48] B: Makes Sense.
[24:49] A: Right. Like I can't even be with it. Right. Like somebody says uncle Tony molested me. And the mom says, don't you dare say that about my brother. Not because she doesn't believe her kid.
[24:57] B: She can't believe herself.
[24:59] A: No, not.
[25:00] B: She can't. It can't. Like it wouldn't sit well with who.
[25:04] A: What it would mean about me.
[25:05] B: Okay.
[25:06] A: That my own brother would do that to my. I can't even, like, I can't, I can't even. So much discomfort in all of that. I can't like. So it's got to go.
[25:15] B: Yeah, it's just like when I'm.
[25:17] A: It's really, really. Yeah, yeah. That, that happens with people.
[25:22] B: Yeah.
[25:22] A: Right. So it's not about you, it's about what it. And not that she doesn't want to believe it. And not that she doesn't. She wants to excuse it. It's what it would mean about her. That makes sense that her guy would do that. This, you know, holier than thou pillar. I mean there's like, you know, God and then there's like pastors.
[25:43] B: Yeah, right. But he thinks he is God. I think sometimes.
[25:46] A: Well, yeah, I mean, yeah. I had a guy in my office and mom got, what do they call it? Mom got a God told her that she needed to go be a pastor on the other side of the country from where they lived.
[26:08] B: Uh huh.
[26:09] A: But she asked him, you know, would it be okay to go? God is telling me that I need to be.
[26:14] B: Yeah.
[26:14] A: But I won't be close to you. Is it okay? What is the 12 year old kid supposed to say to that? It's me or God. Like, I mean.
[26:28] B: Like I'm gonna be like in hell if I say no to this God.
[26:32] A: I mean like, yeah, I guess. Go, Mom. Like, of course if God's telling you you need to go. I mean, you gotta go. Right?
[26:38] B: I have some issues with that.
[26:39] A: Right. Don't you think? Yeah, he had a lot of issues, but I had to finally tell him. I go, you know what your mom did? She's like a really good magician who is kind of setting it out like you've got free choice, but not. Right. Pick any card you want. Any card. Pick card. Pick card. Pick any card. What you don't know is that the card's already chosen. Right?
[27:04] B: That's what my parents do really well.
[27:06] A: Yeah. Oh, they're good magicians too. Yeah. Oh fine. Awesome.
[27:10] B: Yeah. Okay, we're gonna give you this free choice to go, you know, do what I like, do this. But really we're controlling you still.
[27:18] A: Awesome. See, I like it when people do that.
[27:20] B: It's. Yeah.
[27:23] A: Oh, good. Free will.
[27:24] B: None.
[27:25] A: None. Yeah, but I thought I had choice.
[27:27] B: Exactly. Okay, I thought me getting out of the whole prostitution room when I was underage and going to your friend's house in the Everglades was my free choice, but really it wasn't because it was a way for me to get out in the boonies where there's nothing so that you could send this, like therapeutic kidnappers. Basically, they hired people to come get me in the middle of the night when I was asleep so that they could take me on a plane to Utah. And that's how I got to Utah.
[27:53] A: Oh, well, then that was gonna be a really good trip to Utah anyway. I mean, just in how you got there. It wasn't like, hey, by the way, we're thinking of this place. It might be really good for you. No, no, no. Surprise.
[28:06] B: I woke up in the middle of the night. This is the best thing for you. And there's some guy with the police badge. And I'm thinking of getting arrested. And then I.
[28:13] A: One more time.
[28:16] B: What's going on? Yeah, it's behind the hands. They're behind the hands.
[28:22] A: It doesn't work so well out here. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so that's fun.
[28:28] B: Yeah. So that's. Another aspect is I feel like they are always doing something manipulative because they'll do group text messages or like group emails about me so that my uncle, the psychiatrist. Psychologist can like.
[28:40] A: Chip. Your uncle is a psychiatrist for the va. Awesome. Madison, this is really cool.
[28:53] B: My aunt is a translator at mafe. My dad owns a company that's in Wawa. You know, my family's just all over the board.
[29:03] A: Your dad owns a company that's in Wawa? At the gas station. Yeah.
[29:07] B: You know Waiakki? It's a flying volcano. Water.
[29:11] A: That's his company.
[29:12] B: Yeah.
[29:13] A: And they get water from like fort.
[29:15] B: From like the Hawaii. Volcanic. I don't know, something in Hawaii.
[29:19] A: Sure.
[29:20] B: It's probably where you find his. His random women.
[29:23] A: Cuz she seems to always come back.
[29:25] B: With.
[29:27] A: I got laid. Wait, no, no, that's not what we're talking. Okay, so there's a whole bunch of stuff.
[29:38] B: There's my family and. Yeah, we're a shit show.
[29:43] A: All right, cool. What else? So there's stuff with mom, stuff with dad, stuff with stepdad.
[29:50] B: Yeah.
[29:50] A: Uncle's a psychiatrist, aunt's a translator, who.
[29:54] B: Just says it how it is.
[29:55] A: Nice.
[29:57] B: Not always the nicest way.
[29:58] A: No, no.
[30:01] B: Yeah.
[30:02] A: And then there's you. Yeah.
[30:05] B: Who's the black sheep and the black mark on the family.
[30:09] A: Any siblings?
[30:10] B: Yeah, my brother who's 11 on my. My mom. From my mom. My stepdad. Brother's 11, sister's 14.
[30:16] A: No, no, they're not like 11 years old right now. Yeah. And you're how old?
[30:21] B: I'm 25.
[30:22] A: Oh, so they're not close?
[30:24] B: We were, but not really because I left home very. Yeah, I was like a.
[30:30] A: Because I mean it's not the same. So if she's 11 and you're 25, that's 14 year difference.
[30:36] B: Yeah. And I was a parent very much to them because my mom was still teaching my stepdad, you know.
[30:41] A: Yeah.
[30:42] B: I mean I even got asked.
[30:43] A: So you got a 11 year old.
[30:46] B: Sister and a 14 year old brother.
[30:48] A: And a 14 year old brother.
[30:49] B: Uh huh.
[30:50] A: Yeah. Not again.
[30:51] B: No.
[30:52] A: Okay.
[30:52] B: Yeah. So they don't.
[30:54] A: Any other siblings? That's it. None from dad and Kishiwa?
[31:00] B: No.
[31:00] A: Okay.
[31:07] B: No, not from them.
[31:08] A: All right. Yeah. Yeah. Any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know? Are they still all in like Lauderdale?
[31:14] B: They're in Lakeland.
[31:15] A: They're in Lakeland?
[31:16] B: Yeah.
[31:16] A: Good.
[31:16] B: So. Cuz my stepdad got like a higher position in the church so they moved to Lakeland.
[31:20] A: Beautiful. Which is a great place to live.
[31:23] B: I hate Polk County.
[31:25] A: Lake lynch in the middle of nowhere.
[31:27] B: Well, Sheriff Grady, he's not.
[31:31] A: He's. I don't know who that is. I don't really interact with the sheriffs. I don't have a lot of experience. I mean I literally went like this in the back.
[31:44] B: Unless you're being like shackled like you know, multiple people. Then it's in front, but you know.
[31:48] A: Yeah, yeah, sorry.
[31:55] B: Get it right. Yeah. I think that's like. I don't. Yeah, I think that's really like the main stuff. I think it's just like a. Like I think that's the unhealthy still like wanting to please others, be happy with me. Which I think is like. But then I lose myself. But that's really it.
[32:21] A: Okay.
[32:21] B: What does your tattoo mean?
[32:23] A: Which one?
[32:24] B: The one on your arm.
[32:25] A: This is of the hometown that I grew up in.
[32:27] B: Oh, okay.
[32:28] A: It's Lake George.
[32:29] B: Okay.
[32:29] A: So it's a.
[32:30] B: Sorry, I was just.
[32:31] A: Lake in the adirondacks. That is 32 miles long. Okay. And two miles at its widest spot. And it meanders through the mountain. That's cool. So this is like if you took it off a map.
[32:42] B: Map and put it on your Arm.
[32:45] A: Then I have other ones. But I mean, I've got one up here that's like of my.
[32:49] B: Sorry, I got distracted.
[32:50] A: I was like wondering what of my kids. I've got a daisy and a Daphne and I got a butterfly up here with a V in it for my wife Vanessa. So. Yeah, there's good stuff. I think I broke my. I think I did.
[33:02] B: What happened?
[33:03] A: I don't know. I popped a button.
[33:05] B: Oh no, that's alright.
[33:08] A: At least I found it. Somebody can fix it. Probably not me. Although I did learn how to sew. That was one of the two classes that were useful in high school. I didn't Home ec.
[33:19] B: Uh huh.
[33:20] A: Because you learned how to do certain things. And typing.
[33:24] B: Yeah, typing.
[33:25] A: Typing. Out of all the classes that I took in all of high school, that was by far the number one best class I ever took.
[33:32] B: See, I took it in elementary school.
[33:34] A: Because I now know how to do it.
[33:35] B: Yeah.
[33:36] A: If I had to do this with all the amount of like all the old people. Awful, like, I can do this. This I'm still not very good at. I keep fucking up the thumb. Stuff never says. Right. Like I try to type in the word golf, it goes gold. I'm like, what? No, like that's not what I.
[33:52] B: Have you ever had text to talk problems where like you're talking into your phone and it just completely messes it up?
[33:58] A: Gibberish. Yeah. And then I hit send. I'm like, oh, that's not what I said. Yeah, I don't like that. Yeah. Okay. All right. So let me give you kind of a framework.
[34:12] B: Okay?
[34:12] A: Right. So a couple different things. One, when it comes to shit that we've gone through, we're not troubled because it happened.
[34:18] B: Mm.
[34:19] A: We're not troubled because we went through it or it was bad or wrong or if what I did was bad or wrong. We're troubled primarily because when it happened, emotionally the brain short circuited.
[34:33] B: Okay.
[34:33] A: So what that means is there's an aspect of the brain that doesn't know certain negative experiences are over.
[34:39] B: Okay.
[34:39] A: That part of the brain will be more vigilant and sensitive and look for it, okay. All over the place. Anything that's similar to it to trigger. Primarily because in the animal world, the sooner I react to threat, the better chance I have to survive. The rabbit who hears a twig snap and runs has got a much better chance of survival than the one who heard the twig snap and thought it was George. Right. So that's one of the things that you want to begin to understand Second, we have a saying in our country culture all around, really, that says time heals all wounds. Well, we were talking about physical, Right. So if I told you about falling out of a tree when I was 11 and I broke my foot, if when I told you about it, you'd look at me like, what the fuck is wrong with him? His foot is fine. I saw him walk. Why is he so upset? But if I told you about what my Uncle Max did to me when I was 11 and I started to get all of emotionally. Yeah, of course. So isn't it weird we have this saying that time heals all wounds. We have this other saying, sticks and stones might break my bones, but names will never hurt me. Both of those fucking lies. Because over time, the physical wound heals. Why does the emotional wound.
[35:59] B: Not because we're still stuck in the past slightly.
[36:04] A: Right. Not because we're still stuck in the past, but think of it more. That there's a part of our brain that never got the good news that the negative experience stopped, that I made it through it, that I'm okay.
[36:17] B: And I can imagine that if you have compound like with me, where it's like just one trauma after another after another, your brain is like, oh, yeah, gets used to it. Like, not used to it. But.
[36:27] A: But part of the brain doesn't know that the negative experiences are over. Second part to it, when it's negative, it also connotates my fault. I'm to blame for it. Because when we're little, little, little, like two, three, four, we're trained to believe that good things happen because I am good and to good people. Right. We learned the message of Santa Claus, who brings presents to the good boys and girls and cold to the bad boys and girls.
[37:01] B: And then parenting all of Christmas and prior to that is, do you want Santa to bring you a toy?
[37:06] A: Right, Right, Exactly. I'm. And if we really thought about Santa Claus as a character, it's a little creepy. Not just a little creepy. I mean, think about it. Old fat man who sits around all year long watching children.
[37:23] B: Yeah. Have you heard about the serial killer that used to dress up as a mall Santa?
[37:28] A: No.
[37:28] B: Yeah.
[37:29] A: Yeah. But, you know, so don't bring your.
[37:31] B: Kids to wall Santa.
[37:32] A: We put kids on. On his lap. Hello, little child. Come and sit on Santa's lap. I've got presents.
[37:42] B: I mean, grooming tactics.
[37:44] A: Right. It is disturbing the idea of this old man watching children all year round, all year round, writing their names on lists. Yeah. Just a.
[37:55] B: Just teensy bit.
[37:56] A: Who's getting Spanking.
[37:58] B: Let's go to the dungeon.
[38:00] A: Right. I mean, it's just like so, so, so when we.
[38:03] B: Mrs. Claus is in on this, right?
[38:04] A: Yeah. Oh, yeah. She's the dominatrix. That's right. Standing the nickel clamps. Rest of the year. Right. Eyes not well.
[38:18] B: Sometimes someone else.
[38:21] A: So the problem is, if we have something bad happen and the meaning that's attached to it is somehow it was because of me, some inequity in me, something not okay in me. I'm not good enough. Because then it gets locked. So that's really the problem. Where therapy got it wrong is they thought that we repressed, we buried, we locked behind closed doors, we shoved under the carpet emotional troubling experiences. And that our job was to get those bad feelings out, which encourages people to be emotive. Let's get a good cry on. Which after a good cry, I do feel a little bit better, but I get re triggered by the same stuff. So this is different than that in that we're all about getting the good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know that it's over. See, the really good news is you've already gone through the hardest parts. Surviving and making it through the easy part is to get part of your brain who doesn't know that I'm not getting punched in the face to know I'm not getting punched in the face. Right?
[39:33] B: Yeah.
[39:35] A: Or sent to Utah or raped or using or all that stuff. We want to get in the good news versus get the bad feelings out. Right. We tend to, like in life that it's the circumstances and the things that cause the feelings. When that person did that thing, it made me feel this way. When that happened, I felt like this. But as we reverse it, we look at it from the other lens that it's not so solely the stuff that causes the feelings, but instead it's something that my brain is doing to me not because it's out to get me, but because of errors and glitches in a complicated machine.
[40:17] B: It's like programming.
[40:19] A: Exactly.
[40:19] B: Just gotta reprogram it.
[40:20] A: That's what we're gonna do. Totally reprogram your brain so that it works automatically more in the way that you want it to. Right. When a lion approaches a zebra, most of us would say, lion makes zebra scared. That makes a lot of sense, right?
[40:36] B: Yeah.
[40:37] A: I don't disagree with that at all. But if we looked at it from another lens, we go, no. Isn't it actually when the zebra itself sees senses, feels, smells, or thinks that lion is coming. That it's actually the zebras brain, not the lion.
[40:52] B: Yeah.
[40:52] A: That's immediately making the zebra alert, motivated and stronger. We do call it scared. It does run away. Yes. The brain is doing it to the zebra in response to the lion coming, but it's zebra spraying that's doing it. So we're gonna say there's been ways in which your brain has been working that causes you to feel bad. By bad, we're meaning the lingering, like guilt, shame, regret, remorse over daughter adoption. Right. By bad, we're meaning the romanticizing people that treated me like shit. Right. By bad, we're meaning the lingering effect of the stuff that's transpired in a different family. Your brain might be doing all of it to you in response to the stuff. Hyper vigilant, whatever. What you've been able to recognize and what we're going to be making changes in the programming is, is how your brain automatically reacts to this stuff. Because totally in life, we can't get rid of everything that presses my buttons because even if it's a person, there's another person behind that person ready to press the same one.
[41:59] B: Yeah.
[42:00] A: So instead we want to unplug the buttons so that even if they're pressed, they don't cause the response inside. Right. We want you to lighten up. We want you to become more at ease and more comfortable in your own skin so that you know you. And we also want you to realize that you're not what you do. Yeah. Nor are you your thoughts. Right. That you can play different roles, but that's not even who you are. See, the craziest part is people go, I am X. The problem is if I think I'm this, then I can't be that.
[42:39] B: Yeah.
[42:40] A: See, if I walk around going, I am a therapist. What can I not be anything that's not a therapist. But aren't I more than just a therapist? Yeah. Is that who I am? No. Is that what I do? It's an activity I do, but not who I am. Right. So we want to get all of that stuff adjusted so that you're more at peace in you.
[42:58] B: Okay.
[42:58] A: You're more comfortable in your own skin, that you're lighter. Yeah. And that's where we're headed. So the next visit is we're gonna get together for a chunk of time, a few hours, all at once to change things. So that when you leave, you notice it's different shit that used to bother you. You'll think about and go, fuck. It doesn't bother me. Oh, wow.
[43:20] B: Okay.
[43:21] A: That's what you're gonna notice. Yeah. Cool. Any questions for me before we stop for now?
[43:26] B: No.
[43:26] A: All right, we'll stop for now.
[43:28] B: Thank you.
[43:28] A: You can come with me. We will head on out.
[43:30] B: All right.
