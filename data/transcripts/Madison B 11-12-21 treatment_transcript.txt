[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 12th of November, Madison. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful, transformative, that recording may be made available in teaching and training other professionals on how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:16] B: Yes.
[00:17] A: All right, cool. So when you were in here the last time, you mentioned that there have been a ton of different things that you've gone through, some of them more recent, some of them longer time ago, but that although those experiences are over underneath the surface, they continue to have an effect. Not that you think about them every moment of every minute of every hour of every day, but sometimes just like you talked about earlier with that, sometimes shit reminds you of it and you're like more in it. Sometimes you do think about it when you don't want to. Sometimes moments of it flash. We want to get the effect that that stuff has had cleared and gone. Right. And then you had also mentioned that at times you find yourself feeling ways that you don't want to be feeling, whether that be in more angst stuff or more agitation stuff or more just what. We want to get that adjusted too, so that you get to be more comfortable and more at peace in your own skin. Right. And then any of the stuff that had happened more when you got out of the thing in Utah and then life stuff transpired, we want to get those experiences cleared and better too, so that you get to be more at peace and free and then your mind actually works more in the way that you want it to naturally in response to the stuff of life. Cool.
[01:37] B: Okay.
[01:37] A: So that's like the broad stroke of what I'm remembering, at least from what we talked about, which was a really long time ago.
[01:44] B: Very impressive.
[01:46] A: So that being said, any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know, any other things that we would be wanting our time to actually get accomplished for you today, we.
[01:58] B: Talked about last time. I don't.
[01:59] A: Okay.
[02:01] B: Can't think of anything.
[02:03] A: I have not gone to Wawa yet.
[02:05] B: Okay.
[02:05] A: To get water.
[02:06] B: Yeah, you should.
[02:08] A: I know you said, but I haven't.
[02:09] B: Or just get a chocolate cookie and cream milkshake. Those are really, really good. Been wanting one.
[02:20] A: That's awesome.
[02:22] B: Can we just go to Wawa? No, kid, can I door dash it.
[02:27] A: Uber eats. Gosh, you're having a hard enough time getting your inhaler, so just like, take it easy.
[02:37] B: I feel like I'm asking for too much here.
[02:41] A: All right. So what we kind of ended with the last time is we tend to look at life through the lens that the experiences, the situations, the things that have happened caused the feelings in me. So when that person did that thing, it made me feel this way. When I did that thing, I felt like this. It's the stuff that causes this in me. And that lens is not wrong, but it gives us this much power because we have two choices. Either change it, work hard to change it, or avoid it, which is how we deal with stuff. But you've already recognized there's some stuff I can't change and some stuff I can't completely avoid. And then a whole bunch of stuff that's happened. I can't get the bad stuff to have not happened. So we got to do something else, which is where I'm coming in. We're going to adjust the way that the. We'll call it preconscious, more automatic part of your brain reacts and responds to stuff. I like to use this example I think I did the last time with the lion approaching the zebra, because most of us would say, lion makes zebra scared. Yeah, of course. But if we looked at it from another lens, we go, no, no, no. It's actually the zebra's brain. When the zebra itself sees, senses, feels, smells, thinks. Lion's coming. Zebra's brain, not lion, is now making zebra immediately alert, motivated, and stronger. Now, of course, it's doing it in response to lion approaching, but it's zebra's brain. Got it.
[04:06] B: Yeah.
[04:07] A: So, yes, there were and have been bad experiences and shit that's happened and crap that's gone on in and in and in, which sucked to go through. The reason, though, that I stay bothered, so to speak. And again, not always at a conscious level, not always. I do. I am I in it. But why those experiences stay on isn't because they were so awful, which is what most people say, right? Physical experience. No. I break my foot, I tell you about it. If I'm upset, you're like, but it happened 25 years ago. Are you troubled? Your foot is fine.
[04:45] B: Yeah.
[04:45] A: But if I tell you about what Uncle Mike did to me and how he did all, and I'm now emotional, you go, well, yeah, well, yeah, because my uncle was awful. Right. So. But is it because that was awful. So was the foot. But one healed and one stayed active. Why Weird, right?
[05:08] B: Yeah.
[05:09] A: So the deal is, when we go through emotionally charged, difficult, shocking, painful, weird, confusing experiences, part of the brain short circuits emotionally. That part of the brain never gets that the moments Are over. It gets stuck on. Tends to get stuck on at the worst part of it. Okay, so the knife was headed towards me. Well, then what happened?
[05:28] B: I don't know.
[05:28] A: I don't remember it like blanks out at the worst moment. He then pulled my pants down and he put. Then what happened? I don't know. Right. Is it still there?
[05:38] B: No.
[05:38] A: Well, something must have happened. Right? So our brain stops stories at the shittiest spots and that's where it freezes. And then at that level, it is on always. Now I only notice it's on if I think about it or if something reminds me of it. Right. Like I drive by the intersection where the traffic accident happened and I'm in a panic attack. Oh, shit. That happened 10 years ago. Why am I freaking out? Right. And it wasn't the intersection. It's what actually happened at the intersection. Those two roads converging is not the thing that troubled me. Getting smashed by the car is the thing that troubled me. But because they co occur, they get stuck. Right? So when we go through troubling, shocking, painful, scary, awful, bad stuff, that part of the brain short circuits. That's the only reason that it stays on. The issue isn't where therapy got it wrong, that. Oh, no, you know what? You buried it, Right. You learned from your family that we just don't talk. So you shoved it on the carpet. Yeah. Kind of pretended like it wasn't there. There is no bloody rhinoceros head. We've got a sheet over it. Nobody can see it. No. I'm kind of thinking it's still there. No, no, no, no. Well, it's kind of smelly now. Okay. Right. We don't have feelings trapped inside of us that somehow we need to release and get out. It's really the reverse. It's that we want to get the good news in to the aspects of the brain that froze certain experiences that don't know that those awful experiences are finished, that I made it through it, that I'm okay, that I'm here, not there. Because that's the issue is that part of my brain, when I think about it or I'm reminded of it, thinks I'm there, not here. And here is way better than there, right?
[07:18] B: Yeah.
[07:18] A: I tell people all the time, the only thing that I want you to do when you're with me is just intend to emotionally be with me. Because I know I can be just a little bit more fun than awful experiences. And I don't have to try hard. I'm hoping that being with Me is better than the worst experience of your life. Because if that's not the case, holy fuck.
[07:41] B: The whole mo is fucked.
[07:43] A: I mean, we got nothing there.
[07:45] B: Right.
[07:46] A: And secondly, of course, with troubling moments that you've gone through, one of us in the room needs to be doing better with it. And I also hope that that's always me. Because if all of a sudden, as you start telling me something, I start telling go ahead and get up and leave, I don't know what the fuck's.
[08:02] B: Going on with him.
[08:04] A: That was not helpful at all. Right. So I always look at it different than therapy, which says it's your job to do the work to get you better. That it's my job to do the work with you in collaboration, but I'm the one responsible to get it better for you. I mean, you're a bright gal. If it was up to you, you would already have it better.
[08:21] B: Yeah.
[08:24] A: So maybe it's not your job, you know? Right. So that's what we want to get adjusted. So first aspect is we go through those experiences. Part of the brain doesn't know they're over. We could say it then that your brain right now, in response to stuff, is making you feel bad. Do you think your brain then wants you to feel bad? No, it doesn't want you to feel bad. Right. Do you think it would want you to feel good?
[08:52] B: Yeah.
[08:52] A: No. That's the fucked up part about our brain.
[08:58] B: So it just wants us to be melancholy.
[09:01] A: Here's the craziest shit. Because we're human beings and we can think and we even map it on to animals. What we've discovered is the part of your brain that directs your emotions actually works most like a simple animal. A pig, a goat, a rhinoceros, rabbit.
[09:19] B: Okay?
[09:20] A: And animals don't have emotions because the brain of the animal is concerned about the animals or whether it feels good enough or smart enough or pretty enough or tall enough, whether it feels like it's wearing the right clothes or whether it'll fit in. Right. It doesn't cause those emotions because it's thinking it's unlovable or unworthy. It causes emotions for completely different reason. Only reason is to motivate the animal to do something, to get something, to stop, to solve the problem. That's so simple, so basic, but that's what's behind all of our emotions. All the hurt, the anger, the sadness, the grief, the guilt, the shame, the angst, the upsets, the worries, the pain, all of it is actually being produced by that part of Our brain for the same reason. To motivate us to do something. Get something to stop or solve the problem. Right. If the squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire, the brain of squirrel will immediately make squirrel experience intense pain. But not because it wants the squirrel to feel like a stupid dumb moron because it was too careless and now it's embarrassed cuz it's marred. No, just get tail out of the fire. That's it. It's not any more detailed than get your fucking tail out of the fire. I mean, that's it, right? So the problem is all those emotions are caused to do the same thing for us. Here's where the error comes in. Many times our brain makes us feel bad. Their brain does, trying to motivate us to solve a problem just like theirs. But the problem that it's trying to get us to solve is in a time period that either A hasn't happened yet or B hasn't already over. So it's in a time period that doesn't exist.
[11:08] B: It's time traveling.
[11:10] A: Well, no, that's the problem. It's causing the emotion to try to motivate us to get something to stop. It's why we have a bad feeling about the same kinds of things over and over and over and over and over and over again. Good news, as I just said, many of the things that we feel bad about that our brain is causing that in us trying to get us to solve are in time periods that haven't happened or are already over. So we don't have to solve it.
[11:32] B: Okay?
[11:33] A: The air is just what you talked about, time traveling. Animals don't time travel. Animals are always now. There is no other time than right now for the animal. And they're only reacting to what's happening now. Right? When the mama ger gets pissed at the man who poked the stick at her bear cubs, she is pissed right in the moment. She may attack him, she may kill him, she may scare him off, he may get away. But either way, the mom is not sitting there going, ah, geez, do you think I overreacted? I didn't need to kill him. Now my, my little bear cub saw me like demolish that guy. Like, I mean, is that going to be traumatizing for her? I don't know. Right? Or after the fact, is she getting all the bears together? Okay, this is what the guy looks like. Let's go out look for him. If you get him, you hold him, I'm gonna come and I'm just gonna rip him to shreds. Right? No, because for the animal, the emotion matches what is happening. And as soon as what's happening is over, the emotion goes away. Right? There are no lingering, resentful rhinoceroses out there in the world. Motherfucking alligator stole my goddamn fucking baby. I'm gonna right. Not happening. There are no guilty giraffes. Oh, my goodness, I feel so bad that I left my mother away. Not happening. They don't have those lingering emotions like we do because they're always. Now, the issue is that we've got a whole other part of our brain that the animal world misses, and that's our intellect. And with our intellect, we have time. Man made time. You know, you're sitting here now, you can think about something you're gonna go do over the weekend. You can remember something you did yesterday. No other animal could do that. And again, that's not a problem if it's positive or even if it's neutral. Because in those two instances, our brain totally distinguishes the difference between the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening. Even a great trip. Somebody's telling us about how they went to the Florida Keys and they love fishing, and they went out deep sea fishing, and they got to see a Florida marlin. Holy cow. Right?
[13:29] B: Yeah.
[13:30] A: Well, they came back, they were on Duvall street, they got a T shirt, they had a couple cocktails, right? They took their picture next to the, you know, sign that says 90 miles from Cuba. They wrote mopeds. They tell us about that experience. But you and I know that they know the difference between remembering being there and being there. It's totally clear. But negative experiences, again. Weird, bad, awful, sad, upsetting, scary, horrific, catastrophic. Traumatic brain confuses memory with experience, causing us to have an emotional reaction, right? So this guy is telling us about what his uncle did when he was 8, right? And he's 38. So it's 30 years later, right? At a logical level, the guy knows it's over. He's okay.
[14:14] B: Yeah.
[14:15] A: What the guy did wasn't his fault. Knows all of that. But as he starts telling us, he's ling, right? Emotional, we're nice people. We were kindly listening to him. What the fuck is happening? Really?
[14:31] B: Yeah.
[14:32] A: And what we say is he's reliving re, experiencing re. But what's really happening? Brain, emotional, confusing memory, thinking it's experience. Because when we go through those moments, the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening get locked together. They become the same thing, right? We can tell it's affecting that guy when he Was telling us, we freaking saw it. And we're very perceptive. I mean, we could tell with all these tears. And he's like, trembling cheek.
[15:05] B: Wow, that looks.
[15:07] A: That looks like that's really bothering him, huh? We are so perceptive. Right, but see, it was affecting him even when he didn't talk. I know, right? It was affecting him, though. Even when he wasn't talking about it. He was, you know, over the weekend playing catch with his son. It was still affecting him just under the surface. Like we said, logically, he knows that it's over, that he's okay, that it wasn't his fault. That problem part of his brain. Brain never got the good news. So that's the first issue, is that it gets stuck, right? The memory of what happened and the experience of it happening get glued together, which is why we developed a crazy way to get it unplugged. And it's gonna sound stupid and really silly. Okay, but think of it in this way. If the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening are being read emotionally as the same thing, that emotional brain then doesn't work with logic.
[15:56] B: Okay?
[15:57] A: Like, I can't logically say to it, well, that happened four years ago. I'm here right now.
[16:01] B: Yeah.
[16:02] A: Why are you bothering me about something that. No, because it's going. Look for your. I don't even know what that means for you. Like, if you're thinking it, then it's happening. So, like, no, we're responding. So memory and experience are confused. Okay, but see, there are things that you can remember doing today. Totally remember doing today, that with certainty you. You know, you're not doing, like putting your jeans on. You can remember doing it. You can remember even the room you were in when you did it. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your jeans on, and then I went, madison, stop putting on your jeans. You go, I'm not putting on my jeans. What's wrong with this guy? Because what's crystal clear is, you know, that there's a difference between the memory of it and it. And so because our brain works with patterns of association, when we have a moment, that's a yucky moment, and we do a pattern of association game where I'm not putting on my genes. Well, you're not putting on your genes, and that's not happening. Oh. Oh. And see, because the brain is only causing the emotions because it doesn't know that it's not happening, as soon as it gets, it's not happening. He goes, oh, well, all right. Never Mind. I mean, literally, there's like a squirrel moment, right? Never mind. Like, oh, oh, you mean that's not. Oh, so I don't have to. Oh, well, then never mind. And the feelings go. I mean, like, light switch turning on, that thing that used to bother me, gone. Like yesterday, I had a guy in my office. He's a funny guy, he's a good guy. His brother molested him multiple times. And then later on in life, after his brother OD'd, he found out that his brother had been molested by another guy. So, like, common, right? But as we're going through it, like, we went through the experience and we. I did the process with him and, like, okay, now think about it and try to feel bad. And he goes, yeah, but I don't feel bad. Oh, I know. Well, try really hard. But I don't feel bad anymore. I go, I know, right? But try to get it. It's like, what are you talking about? Like, try to get the feelings. Now they're gone, right? They're gone. Huh? Which is weird because he was somebody that anytime any of those feelings or thoughts came up quickly go this way, right? No, they didn't have this way. So anytime he did think about it, he had discomfort. And then I said, well, think about it on purpose and try to feel the discomfort. And it's not there anymore. So weird, right? Like, it changed. Yeah, right. That's the first thing. We want to unplug it, right? The other part about memory, which is crazy thing about memory, we only go forward when we remember something. We never go in reverse. Like, if somebody's telling you about a story about something that they went through, they don't go from the end of that story all the way back to before it ever happened, right? And then you're like.
[19:13] B: I'm lost.
[19:14] A: I know, right? But here's the other part. Because the brain doesn't know it's not happening, if the memory is able to go backwards, then the brain goes, well, then that can't be happening. So we go backwards with the memory sometimes, and it literally unplugs the memory and it takes away the charge. It's really cool because who would have thought that that actually changes it, right? And the whole thing is, the essence is have the person be intentionally or intending whether they stay all the time, but intend to be emotionally present with me here now, because this is. And that isn't, as they remember, a negative experience, because as they intend to be here, that's the first thing that starts to loosen the hold Then the memory is going to be read as data. I still don't like that it happened. I never will. I'm not gonna go. Well, you know, that was probably top three experience of my life. Yeah, right? Being held up in a cage and raped. Multiple. Now that was fucking awesome. Right?
[20:16] B: 10 out of 10 would recommend, you know.
[20:18] A: Exactly. Right. Anybody interested in that same experience? Right? Not that, but I can think about it, I can remember it, I can talk about it. And it has no discomfort. It doesn't feel about me in any way, shape or form. That's where we want things to be. I want you to be free. So first thing, right. It gets stuck. Second thing meanings. And you grew up with some religious slant.
[20:47] B: Yeah.
[20:47] A: And then had weird religious dude. Fucking weird, right? Like weird weird. Right? Like, didn't you run to school thing too, Right. Weird. Yeah. Okay, good. Awesome. I want to send my kid there. I'll give you the name Our lady of Perpetual Torture. That's so fucking crazy. Anyway, some of the things that happen to people that I hear, I'm like, oh, my.
[21:21] B: We thought that was a good idea.
[21:23] A: You can't fucking make this shit up. Like, no, you really can't. It's un Believable. But here's the problem. When we're very little, impressionable children, we are lied to by all adults, by all society, by all cultures. The lie is life is good. First of all, I think we'd be better off walking around thinking life isn't good. And then we're not so disappointed when the bad shit happens. And then if every once in a while something good happens, we get to be, hey.
[21:48] B: Exactly.
[21:49] A: But we get to tell kids life is good. Which reinforces the notion that if they're good boys or good girls, their life will be good. Yeah. And then because your life is good, you get to live happily ever after. And of course, that gets reinforced. I get praise, I get presents, I get candy, I get love, I get hugs. I get presents from. A strange dude comes to my house once a year because I'm good.
[22:16] B: He watches me all year.
[22:17] A: Fucking pervert. There are times that I don't want to be watched. Right? I mean, it's one thing to watch me like I'm in here. That's fine.
[22:26] B: But.
[22:26] A: But there are times that I'm doing things that I don't need to be watched. And that makes me really uncomfortable that somebody's looking at me as I'm doing this. Like, you know, having children. You try to go to the bath now. Could you just give me A second. Like, it's not gonna take. Could you. Like, why you come. All right, whatever. You know, so if we tell children that life is good and that good things happen when they're being good, then the opposite also has to be true. Bad things happen only if I'm bad or if I've done something wrong or worse. There's something wrong in me, therefore, I get all of the. I'm not lovable. I'm not good enough. I'm not pretty enough. I don't do it right or flip it around. I should have never. Better. I put myself in that bad situation. I shouldn't have let that happen. All those kinds of things, right? Like, those are the messages that get installed. And we do it with women all the time. I mean, women get hammered with this more and more and more, primarily because it was fucking useful. You knew that, right?
[23:34] B: It was what, Eve's fault? Eve's fault?
[23:37] A: Yeah. Yeah, right? Bitch fucking took the apple. And of course, with her womanly ways, she got him to eat it. I mean, we're weak when it comes to. I mean, we're. What am I? I'm not gonna eat the apple. When she's like, hey, you wanna eat?
[23:51] B: I'm gonna eat the apple.
[23:54] A: But it's totally her fault. It is, right? That's why, you know, when she was wearing the dress, that showed a little bit of this. Well, then that gave me fine. Right. To manhandle her.
[24:03] B: Yeah.
[24:03] A: No. No, it didn't. No. No. You ever heard the look, don't touch thing? No. No. Right? Yeah. No.
[24:09] B: You ever heard the song, like, stop, don't touch me there. This is my Noto Square. Have you ever heard that song?
[24:14] A: But that's what we slam women with all the time. You know, a woman reports a rape. Well, what were you wearing?
[24:20] B: Yeah.
[24:20] A: Oh. Cause that mattered.
[24:21] B: Mm.
[24:22] A: Right? I was wearing a fucking snowsuit, asshole. There couldn't have been more buttoned up than that, right? Yes, but what kind of. What kind of stuff did you have underneath? Oh, okay, right.
[24:38] B: Show me his X ray vision.
[24:40] A: Now, was it matching? Yes, but I don't have my life together like that. I've only got one pair that actually match the rest. Don't. I happened that day. Oh, you're right. If I hadn't matched, it wouldn't have happened. Oh, I get it. Right? Totally my fault. I should have known. I mean, all that stuff gets slammed in to women. Makes sense. Happens to other stuff, too. You know, kids get to. Parents get divorced. It goes to the same thing if they really cared, they'd be around more. It's not true. My parents can have their own challenges.
[25:16] B: Mm.
[25:18] A: Yeah. Makes sense. I had a woman the other day, and it's really funny because her dad's like an older guy, and the wife that he married, you know, 20 plus years ago now is six years older than her. Well, she's like a sister wife again, you know, I mean, it's awful. But you went to Utah.
[25:37] B: It's okay. I saw a lot. I was like, this is wife, sister, kid. I'm not quite sure. They all look very.
[25:43] A: Yes, they are.
[25:44] B: It's confusing.
[25:45] A: They need name tags. Wife, sister, and kid.
[25:48] B: They need name tags to, like, label themselves.
[25:51] A: Yeah. How come she looks a little bit younger, but she's the mom?
[25:54] B: The plot thickens.
[25:56] A: Yes, it does. Right? Yeah. So that being said, we've got not only bad experiences, we've got the meanings that are glued to them, which in turn make me feel worse about me and then in turn make me more susceptible to more of it happening. Right. Like, there's not a single person that has not had early childhood sexual inappropriate stuff happen that hasn't been like trafficking survivors. One of the things is that that happened. Mm. That doesn't mean that all girls who have had that happen get trafficked. But what does it make them more susceptible to? That's right. That's the whole problem. Right. So now we've got this meaning, which I keep trying to not have be about me, but it still keeps feeling like it is about me. Right. I didn't get picked for the. It's for the team. Well, it's not because I didn't get picked for the team because I'm maybe not good at that game. It's because nobody likes me. And then the next thing that goes on is another reinforcement of how, like, nobody really likes me or how I'm not good enough or how I'm a loser. How do I get picked on because I'm not good enough or I'm a loser? No, you get picked on because you cry. Has nothing to do with whether you're a loser or not. You're just an easier target. And if I'm gonna throw rocks at something and it's a barn or a Coke can, I'm gonna hit the barn a lot more frequent than I hit the Coke can. Has nothing to do with that. But that's what gets stuck. Does that make sense? Yeah. So with those things stuck, that's why our brain becomes more vigilant and sensitive. That's why it Starts scanning for anything that's similar, but it doesn't scan in like a wide open. Like I see things with distance lens. It scans as if I am looking through a tiny little pigeonhole and I've got a constant moving it around to see the world. Right. My whole vision narrows like this. And it scans looking for anything that's similar. But the issue is that not only does it confuse similar as same, but the reaction is always more than the situation needs. Primarily because in an animal world, the fastest way to survive threat is to respond to it as quickly and as tensely as you can. So the rabbit is kind of hanging out. Here's a twig, snap, takes off, gone. Rabbit hanging out. Here's twigsnap. Thinks it's George. Not George. I'm dead. Right. So pre born into us for survival purposes, we react to threat. And if my brain thinks threat is still happening, it's going to scale through looking for it. And anything that was similar to it or anything that was a reminder of it or anything that co occurred gets merged into the same thing. So I may have shared with you. The woman who had an aversion to Nilla wafers. She had an aversion to Nilla wafers. Was very distraught that her friend could put it in the banana pudding that she brought over for dessert. What's wrong with her? Like, how could she put that? Well, when she was nine, her parents told her they were talking, divorcing. She happened to be eating a Nilla wafer.
[29:07] B: Okay.
[29:08] A: And again, we know that Nilla Wafers don't cause parents to get divorced. Logically.
[29:12] B: Logically.
[29:12] A: But part of the brain that caused the reaction, it got stuck. That happens to people all the time. Where I don't even know why I would have this times of year does that with, like, grief. Yeah. You know, my grandmother died in June of 2010, and now every June, I get depressed. But what Does June of 2021 have to do with June of 2010? Nothing.
[29:36] B: You just get stuck.
[29:37] A: But is there some similarity? Yeah, it's June. Right. The guy's making out with the gal. He's into it, she's into it. They're wanting it. She touches his thigh. He goes like this. What is wrong with me? The girl who I'm liking is touching me in a way that should feel good. And I did this. Yeah, but is there any similarity to his uncle? He's sure it's a hand. It's on his leg. Yeah, but that was grubby man hand. This was dainty female hand. It doesn't matter. It's fucking hand.
[30:02] B: Well, she has man hands.
[30:05] A: I have man hand too. So with those things going, they continue to run us. The good news is they have one common denominator. It's all distorted. It's that the brain just doesn't know that certain things are over. As soon as that happens, the pain, the emotion that hurt, it goes. It's never there. Because my brain is like, let's have you hurt. No, I think because I'm moralistic that you should feel really bad over having done that thing. So the girl says, you know, I feel horrible that I had cheated on my husband. Husband. Because I know what it felt like to be cheated on. Yeah, you're not troubled because of that. You don't have guilt because of what you did. It's not there because of that. Really? Yeah, no, it's not there because of that. I mean, it might be there because you can conceive of having not done it, but it's probably there trying to motivate you to stop doing it. Yeah, but it was over 10 years ago and we're a better relationship now. Yeah, I know, but it's still trying to get you to stop doing that 10 years ago. Hurry, quick. The timing is all fucked up. So that's the major error in our human brain is because we've got those two different lenses that it doesn't quite compute. And the oldest system, which is fight, flight, freeze, is the one that takes over because that one's all about survival. And Maslow says I first need to survive before I can self actuate and fucking read it. Oh, wow, there's a threat outside. Let me just go ahead and continue. The tornado is coming through. Well, I'm just. I gotta flip. Oh, wow, the wind took that page. No, I've got to deal with survival first before I can go up level. So any questions about that kind of stuff makes sense.
[31:56] B: Yep.
[31:56] A: Cool. So then always we need to have a target. Because in order to change something, we need to know how we want you to be when we're done. That would make sense, right? Like if we're gonna like, it would be really crazy if I said to you, okay, Madison, here's what you're gonna do. Get in the car and start driving.
[32:12] B: Where are we going?
[32:13] A: Well, that might be what you ask. Just start driving. Three hours from now, I'm gonna tell you where to go. You'd be like, but which direction? Yeah, so I'm just gonna drive. No, we need to know where the fuck to go. Okay, I won't drive yet. Cuz I could drive three hours in the wrong fucking direction, asshole. Right? I mean, that whole thing could be going on like that. So what we want is we want to know how we want you to be, right? So I bet right now you can think about any of the stuff that's happened and feel just a little bit of the discomfort, right? Try it.
[32:47] B: Okay.
[32:48] A: See? Notice how it doesn't take a long time. Yeah, right. So crazy, right? But you did it on purpose. Which isn't a problem if it only happens when you choose it. The issue is that your brain does it to you at times that you're not choosing. That's the glitch. So this you that I'm seeing remembers having had those kinds of feelings, but if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't know how to get it. It's like completely cleared. It's gone. Right? The you that I'm seeing is emotionally present so that she's dealing with what is happening without the effect of what has or the worry about what might. The you that I'm seeing is connected to her resources, knowing that she has what she needs at a deeper level to be able to move through whatever might come her way. The you that I'm seeing is more outwardly focused so that she actually experiences other people's crap as being about them. And it's not making her feel anything about herself. Yeah, got it. The you that I'm seeing is much lighter and a lot easier on herself. This is the that I'm seeing. So my question isn't how it's going to happen that we get you here.
[33:53] B: I was hoping you would know that.
[33:56] A: The question is, would it be okay? Yeah, See, with it, okay, we've got a green light, which means we're closer to it. Then we want to do processes that are designed to get your body into the right states. So what we've discovered again is different bands of information exist at different brain waves, okay. That when we're stressed, we're in highly elevated beta waves. Beta is fine most of the time because it's what we're in for most waking states. So good for focus, concentration, communication, conversation, social interaction. Good for things like arithmetic. But when it elevates, it spins at a higher hertz. It's where all the agitation, anger, worry, upset, fear, concern, live. And it does that tunneled vision. Okay, we're gonna move into alpha waves. Alpha waves are highly correlated with what surfers like to call flow.
[34:53] B: Okay.
[34:54] A: Hey, man, like, have you ever noticed Like a surfer. Like, hey. And it's not just because they're stoned. They're just, like, out on the water. Right? Because they, like, have expanded awareness. They just kind of go with the flow because they can't fucking control the goddamn waves. All they can do is learn how to ride the board and catch the edge of the wave. They got no other control. So that's why they're chill. That's why they're in flow. That's what alpha waves are correlated with, or what athletes like to call being in the zone. It's alert, it's relaxed. But alpha as the brainwave state is also going to help put the body into states of rest, which allow accelerated healing to happen. Colds, flus, surgeries. We tell people to do the same thing. Rest. Why am I getting this thing done during Thanksgiving? Because I don't have a lot that I have to do.
[35:57] B: Yeah.
[35:57] A: That week I'm certainly not making the meal. Thank goodness.
[36:03] B: Just set something on fire if you have to, and you'll never be asked.
[36:08] A: Realize that, you know, I'm not that good at that. I'm not.
[36:12] B: It stresses me out.
[36:13] A: It's not my thing. Like, I'm good at a lot of things, but that's not one of them.
[36:17] B: It just stresses me out.
[36:19] A: Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Here's what I'm really good at. Putting toast in the toaster. I can manage that one really well. The other thing that I can do. You ever had, like, one of those, like, chick patties? Yeah, I can put that in the toaster oven really well and turn the timer so that it's on long enough so that it fully cooks.
[36:43] B: Can you put. Can you, like, put a pop Tart in a toaster oven? Ooh, is that next level?
[36:48] A: I don't. Does it have frosting on it? Because. Oh, man, I don't know. That's very.
[36:55] B: It's next level.
[36:57] A: Next level. Okay.
[36:58] B: Yeah.
[36:58] A: I don't really like touching hot things. Bread is hard enough, so be like.
[37:04] B: Isn'T the bread hot?
[37:05] A: Yeah, it's hot. Yeah. I don't really like it, but I can do it.
[37:09] B: At least. You can survive off of a lot of carbs.
[37:12] A: Isn't that all we're supposed to eat? Carbs? We're not supposed to take carbs to check.
[37:19] B: I do. I don't listen to whatever.
[37:23] A: So we want our body to be in the right states for healing. We want to open up the pipeline into also deeper level brain processing. And here's the coolest part. There's your listening to me. But then there's your other than conscious part that's also listening. And you know there are certain things and then your unconscious knows even more than you do whether they be those certain things or other certain things or other things or that are other things that are other things. Right. The cool part is knowing where we want you to go. That part of your brain, as we get your body into states of rest, is also going to begin to sort and categorize and group negative experiences. Because people say to me all the time, well shit man, my uncle molested me. Gotta be fuckin 50 plus times. Do we have to go through every single time he did it? And I go, yes, that would be horrible.
[38:19] B: No, when they do EMDR and they're like, alright, make a list of all your traumas.
[38:23] A: Yeah, watch it. Click, click, click, click. All right. You processing? Yeah. Is it better yet? Oh yeah, no, it's totally better. I'm not saying that it's better. No, yeah, I know. It's my favorite is prolonged exposure therapy.
[38:46] B: Oh no.
[38:48] A: Right. Where you just sit on the couch. Let's take those tissues. Let's really get you into the reliving of the worst of the worst of the worst and just release it. Snot coming out. Yeah, that's good. Yeah.
[39:03] B: No, right.
[39:04] A: We can't do quick exposure therapy. We got to do prolonged exposure therapy. Yeah. She goes, it's really fast. It only takes like six months. Really? You've got people in your office for six months doing the same thing. They haven't realized that after the first session I don't ever want to go back there again. Like they didn't get that.
[39:24] B: Right.
[39:25] A: Like no thanks. Right. So what we know is that we don't have to know all of the experiences because your unconscious does. And it's not always done in what we would consider a linear fashion. Okay, I need to go back to when I was 2 and now 6. And then there was the time at 7 and then there 11. Oh wait, I forgot the time at 9. No, it's not linear because your brain is not like a tree. The rest of your body works more like a tree and a root analogy. Right. So if you've got gangrene in your toe, we want to chop it off so it doesn't affect the rest of your body. And then you're fine. Your brain is rhizomatic. We don't want to do a lobotomy and take out a chunk because then it fucks the whole thing up. Because everything in the Brain is interconnected through multiplicity and lots of levels and layers. Right. And it's rhizomatic in the sense that there's constellation of things. So as you go to clear one, it actually does a constellation of clearing out a lot. Now we do more than one because it's easier to generalize. But when we do one, we deal with one particular moment experience beginning, middle, end at a time. Kind of like if I had a whole like thousands of ants that are coming into my house, I'd like to deal with it one at a time time. I don't want him to all rush and after a while I keep showing them that said ants like you were.
[40:55] B: Like talking like aunt, uncle.
[40:57] A: And I'm like, yes, right. You don't stomp on your ants, your uncles though, they're fine.
[41:05] B: I was really confused for.
[41:10] A: Right. So that's what we want to be doing as we get your body into the right state. So the first lever, silly lover, it's about slightly lowering the jaw. The cool thing about when you slightly lower your jaw, what it starts to do is it activates a nerve in our brain called the vagal nerve. Vagal nerve is a nerve that kind of meanders through the body, connects to the vital organs and as it gets activated, it begins to put the body in into more of a parasympathetic response. So the first lever is we slightly lower the jaw, but not like, ah, just a little bit. See you slightly lower your jaw, right. Second lever is you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Again, when you rest your tongue at the bottom of your your mouth, that starts to cause a satiated feeling in the body, starts to turn down. Internal dialogue. So we lower the jaw and we rest the tongue. The third lever is you breathe, but it's an intentional breath in a way that's different than how you normally breathe. So it'll be breathing in a way that's just a little bit slower, a little bit deeper and a little bit longer than how you automatically breathe. So go ahead and slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth and now begin to breathe in a way that's right, that's just a little bit slower, a little bit deeper, a little bit longer than how you automatically breathe. And as you begin to breathe in this way that's slightly slower, deeper, longer, what do you notice happening in your your body? Isn't that kind of interesting? It's crazy how that works. The next lever is the one that gets us into alpha. So again we get Tunneled vision. We don't always pay attention to space. So, for example, if I said, madison, what do you see in this room? You would look around and you would tell me all the different objects that you can see, whether it be little trinkets or pieces of art or desks or chair or carpet or what have you. You know what you would never tell me? Well, I'm noticing about how much space there is between you and me. I can even sense how much space there is from the back of my head to the wall. I notice how much space there is underneath the couch, too. You never talk about that because people disappear. Space because we don't see it. Although it's around us and in between us and all around everything, we disappear. Space. So when we start to notice more space, we bring our awareness out to our peripheral vision. So how it works is again, you're going to slightly lower your jaw. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You begin to breathe in a way that's right. That's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper. Notice that you can look across and see me. And as you stay looking at me, notice what happens when my fingers move out. So stay looking at me. What? I thought I was doing emdr.
[44:18] B: Like I'm falling.
[44:22] A: Right. Perfect. Right. So notice as you look at me what happens when my fingers are out here and you stay looking at me. But with your peripheral vision, you now see them wiggling. Right. When you see them wiggling, you can also notice that you can sense more of the space to the sides. You might even with your peripheral vision, see the side windows and doors. Right. You can sense the space between you and me and the space beyond me, the space that's behind you and underneath and up above. And again, as you're noticing. That's right, more of this space. How's your body feeling now? Isn't that cool? Right. And then I don't know if you've ever heard the phrase. Have you ever heard the phrase, I'm under a lot of stress? Yeah. So in order for somebody to be underneath something, under a blanket.
[45:15] B: Under.
[45:16] A: Yes. But where does the thing have to.
[45:17] B: Be on top of you?
[45:20] A: Yes. You know, most people go, what? They look at me like, seriously? And I go, yeah. In order to be underneath something, where does that thing need to be? Oh, right. See, it's pretty cool. Right? So when you get out from under it and you rise up above it, you're having more of a bird's eye view. A bird's eye view, meaning I see things down underneath and below me because I'm above and over it all. But not just a perch bird. A bird that's able to soar. So we want to add that component. So again, you slightly lower your jaw. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper. Notice that you can look across and see me. And you stay looking at me as my fingers. That's right. Move out here. Good job. And now you can see that wiggling. Right. It's not right. Good job. So you're gonna stay here with me. In addition, as this is going on, you're noticing how your body's feeling. You can sense more of the space. You can just for a moment, close your eyes, and you'll notice that with your eyes closed, you'll be able to sense even more of the space because you don't see the objects. That's right. And then what we want to do is with your imagination and maybe easier with eyes closed or open. Doesn't really matter, but. But we want you to imagine what it would be like to float up and out of your body. That as you do, you float well beyond the ceiling and well beyond the roof so that you go way up above it all, that you're in the sky like a bird having that bird's eye view, seeing everything underneath and below you. Because you're up above and over it all. You're free like a bird to fly and soar through the sky. So imagine what it would be like to soar and move and fly like a bird. Maybe big turns, curves, flying and moving all up above and over it all. And as you're doing this now again, check inside. How's your body feeling? I know. Isn't that cool? See, your body's staying in this relaxed state. And we're also light. Why do we want to be light?
[47:27] B: I mean, if you're going to be.
[47:28] A: Talking about heavier stuff, you want to be. I don't know. Yeah. Don't you think? I mean, wasn't the heart part already going through it?
[47:34] B: Yeah, we don't need to relive it.
[47:38] A: So isn't the easier part getting the good news in?
[47:42] B: Yeah.
[47:43] A: Right. And wouldn't it be cool to get the good news in in a way that's light and playful and silly and that's useful. Right. But see, what's going to happen is your brain has been listening again, and it knows which experiences, and it's going to narrow and pinpoint and bring a particular moment to your awareness that would be useful for us to unplug and clear. So as it travels back, it goes and brings a moment to your awareness. What's a particular experience that comes to mind most recently?
[48:19] B: Like, the whole experience with Bruce before I came to Salem.
[48:21] A: Like Bruce Hornsby? No, Bruce Daniel Bruce. I don't really know him. Yeah. Okay. So there's things that happen with Bruce.
[48:30] B: Oh, yeah.
[48:30] A: Oh, okay. We only want to think of a thing that happened with Bruce.
[48:33] B: Okay.
[48:34] A: Not all of them at once. They're like all the ants coming in. Oh, just one at a time. Yeah. So you got a particular experience.
[48:41] B: Yeah.
[48:41] A: The one particular experience that you're thinking about now, the feeling tones that come up are feelings of. What is it? Hurt, Anger. Oh, anxiety. Right. Oh, so would it be okay to get a call?
[48:51] B: Yeah.
[48:51] A: Like, not feel anxious about it anymore? Yeah. Oh, cool. All right, so let's do that. Okay. Okay, so how we do it again, you're gonna just tell me the facts, what happened in about a minute or less while being here with me, because I'm more fun than that. Okay. Right, good. You go. That happened. That happened. That happened. That happened. That happened. That was done. Okay. Second, because you're here with me, we also want to add things that happen later that have nothing to do with that, that were more enjoyable than that. At least a little. Mm. Right. So what's one thing? Anytime from when that stopped until. Heck, just the other day, that was more enjoyable than that.
[49:23] B: Okay.
[49:24] A: What's one thing?
[49:25] B: Going to the library.
[49:26] A: Going to the library. Way more enjoyable than that. Right. I love going to the library.
[49:29] B: I do too.
[49:29] A: Yeah. Right. So we got. Going to the library. Good. Something else. Oh, do you go to the one that's like on 70 that they were redoing?
[49:36] B: It's the, like, bigger one downtown.
[49:39] A: Oh, you go to the. Oh, that is a big one.
[49:40] B: I know. Yeah, that print puzzles.
[49:43] A: We have actually have puzzles at our house that we got from the library.
[49:46] B: It's great.
[49:47] A: It's awesome. I know.
[49:48] B: It's so cool. You need to return them for download though, so I can check.
[49:51] A: No, they're really. I think you probably could do this pretty easy.
[49:54] B: Oh, okay.
[49:55] A: You know, they're for my eight year old.
[49:56] B: I'm hoping I do, like, 2,000 piece puzzles.
[49:59] A: Yeah, this is 250, so.
[50:00] B: Oh, I'd be done in like an hour. Not even. Never mind.
[50:03] A: You can just wait. We got the frame. Okay, good. Because that's probably the best way to start. You Ever notice?
[50:10] B: Yeah. Oh, you have to sort them by edge pieces.
[50:13] A: Yes.
[50:14] B: And then you like sort them by edge. Yeah. And then you build up.
[50:18] A: Right. You always want to put a frame on something so then you know what to do in that.
[50:23] B: People that don't do that are barbaric. How do they.
[50:25] A: I don't know how they put the puzzle together. It's puzzling to me.
[50:31] B: That's great.
[50:32] A: So we got going to library, got doing a puzzle. Right. One other thing after that that was more enjoyable than that, talking to my family.
[50:39] B: Yeah, talking to your family.
[50:40] A: So we got talking to the family, got doing the puzzle. All those moments happen after that thing with Bruce. There's a part of your brain doesn't know any moment beyond Bruce. So we have good news. So when that one happened. Yeah, when it happened, you were where? Yeah. Where were you when that happened? With him?
[50:57] B: I was at La Quinta.
[50:58] A: On the La Quinta. Right. So you're at the La Quinta or the Quintona. Exactly. So you're there.
[51:08] B: Yeah.
[51:08] A: Is it daytime or night time?
[51:10] B: It's happened over time, like five days. But the beginning of it was day.
[51:14] A: So it's daytime. And you guys drove over though?
[51:17] B: No, he came over to my hotel.
[51:18] A: Oh, so you were in the hotel?
[51:20] B: Yeah, that's where I lived.
[51:21] A: Oh, that's where you lived. So you're living in La Quinta?
[51:24] B: Yeah.
[51:24] A: Right. Because they had good breakfast and high speed, wireless, decent WI fi. Okay. But you're there and Bruce knocks on the door. He said, come in.
[51:33] B: Yeah.
[51:33] A: And then you opened the door and he came in. Yeah. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[51:37] B: He asked if he could stay with me for a couple days. I said, yeah, that's fine.
[51:40] A: Right. He said, hey, can I hang?
[51:41] B: Yeah, sure.
[51:42] A: Yeah, of course.
[51:43] B: You have my drugs that I need.
[51:44] A: Good job.
[51:45] B: Dealers. Yeah, yeah, you can stay.
[51:47] A: Sure.
[51:47] B: And then he got upset because he. He thought that I stole money from him.
[51:53] A: Good job. Right. So he's like, where's my money?
[51:54] B: Which I didn't.
[51:55] A: Right. You're like, I don't know.
[51:57] B: I was asleep.
[51:58] A: That's right. Good. So you're sleeping. Right.
[52:00] B: And I woke up being pistol whipped.
[52:02] A: So you woke up to him smashing you on the head with a gun?
[52:06] B: Yeah.
[52:06] A: Okay. Really confused and that hurt. Like, what the fuck? Really?
[52:13] B: I was asleep.
[52:15] A: If you need to wake me up, there's a nicer way you could do that. Boom. Okay. I guess I'm awake now. Right, Good. Then what happened next?
[52:28] B: And then he beat me even more.
[52:30] A: Like with his Fist or the gun?
[52:31] B: Fist. Gun.
[52:32] A: Right. Good. Slap, kick, punch, whatever.
[52:34] B: A little bit of everything.
[52:35] A: Couldn't that hurt?
[52:35] B: Yeah.
[52:36] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[52:37] B: And then he threatened to kill me if I didn't get him money.
[52:40] A: Right. Good job, Good detail. Right.
[52:41] B: Yeah.
[52:42] A: And then so he said, you got to give me money. And then what happened?
[52:45] B: Then I tried to call some of my clients.
[52:47] A: Right. Good job. So you're like, hey, anybody interested in. Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[52:52] B: And then I was working. Like, working.
[52:55] A: Doing. Good job, good detail. Right.
[52:57] B: For five days.
[52:58] A: Was he still there? Yeah. In the room with them?
[53:00] B: Yeah, he.
[53:01] A: Well, that was weird for them.
[53:02] B: Yeah, it was a, like, double room.
[53:04] A: Oh, good. Okay. So he was in it.
[53:05] B: I told him the bathroom.
[53:07] A: Right.
[53:10] B: He's just sitting in the room while they're on the pullout couch.
[53:13] A: That's right. What are you doing? Nothing. I like to watch. Right, Good. And then what happened next? So different people came in. You got some money. Right. Good job. Right.
[53:23] B: I was continuing for, like, five days.
[53:24] A: Right. Good. Then what happened?
[53:25] B: Then my friend saw me, and she didn't recognize me because my face was so bad.
[53:29] A: Yeah. Good job for detail.
[53:30] B: So she told me, like, told me her number when he wasn't with me.
[53:34] A: Good job.
[53:34] B: So I can remember it. And I called her when he ran away after Annette, who's his girlfriend.
[53:39] A: Yes. Good job, good detail. So he ran to go get Annette. Yeah.
[53:41] B: Cause Annette and him were fighting in the car.
[53:43] A: Right. Good. Right.
[53:44] B: So they parked in Publix. He got out after her.
[53:48] A: Good job with you.
[53:49] B: So then I ran to Publix, called one of my clients to get me an Uber, and went to my friend's house.
[53:53] A: Good job, good detail.
[53:54] B: And then my friend told me that I needed to go to the hospital.
[53:57] A: And then you went to the hospital.
[53:59] B: Yeah.
[53:59] A: Right. And then that moment ended.
[54:00] B: Yeah.
[54:01] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like read or go to library or do a puzzle or talk to your family.
[54:06] B: Yeah.
[54:07] A: Right. Now, notice even in talking about even though we were, there was a little discomfort. Not because that was such a yucky moment, but because your brain is confusing the memory, thinking it's happening. It's less because you're here. And again, we never go backwards. Watch what happens when we go backwards.
[54:20] B: Okay.
[54:21] A: Right. So we got talking to your family. We got doing a puzzle. We got going to the library. We got reading. Right. Then you got out of the hospital. Then you're at the hospital. Then she said to go to the hospital. Hospital and then you got to her place, Right? And then you got out of the Uber. And then the Uber came and got you. And then you got the person to get you the Uber. And then you called her. And then you ran into Publix.
[54:36] B: Yeah.
[54:37] A: Right. And then he ran after her. Right? And then in between, there was lots of times that you were having to do stuff. Well, she had seen you. Right? And then there were lots of times that you were having to do stuff with different people. Right? And then you got a hold of different people. Right? And then he was there. Right? And then he had hit you multiple times. And then you woke up to the gun. And then he apparently thought that you stole money. And then he's like, hey, can I hang?
[55:00] B: Yeah.
[55:01] A: Right? And then he'd come over with his stuff. Mm. Right. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[55:05] B: Yeah.
[55:05] A: Right. And again, now, as we went backwards compared to forward, what'd you notice?
[55:09] B: Not as much discomfort.
[55:10] A: Isn't that weird?
[55:11] B: Yeah.
[55:12] A: Crazy, right?
[55:13] B: Yeah.
[55:14] A: Right? So you can remember him doing that with a gun? Finding. Right. You can remember it happening. You can remember putting your jeans on. Madison, stop putting on your jeans. Say, I am not putting on my jeans. Well, stop him from hitting you with a gun. Say, he's not hitting me with a gun. Well, stop him from punching you. Say, he's not punching me. Well, then you stop doing that. Say, I'm not doing that.
[55:32] B: I'm not doing that.
[55:32] A: Well, stop putting on your shirt. Say, I'm not putting on my shirt. Stop me from putting on my jeans. Say, you're not putting on your jeans. Well, then stop him from doing that. He's not doing that.
[55:41] B: Oh, well, right.
[55:43] A: You don't even have to stop him from doing that. It's not. You can't.
[55:47] B: It's already over.
[55:47] A: You don't have to. So then where is that experience in the past? No, there is no place called the past up there. Where is it? Oh, it no longer exists. Say that it no longer exists, which is what we want to get in. Because there's a part of your brain that goes. The past is like Timbuktu. It's a place that I can go to, but there's no place that you and I can go to right now to watch that happen to you. Come on. Even if we went to the La Quita, it's. We still can't watch that happen. Right? Right. So as we ran through backwards again, what do you notice now? I know. Isn't that weird?
[56:23] B: Yeah.
[56:23] A: Right? Him doing that, by the way, did that have anything to do with you?
[56:27] B: It made me feel like. Why? Didn't have anything to do with me?
[56:30] A: No. What did it make you?
[56:32] B: No, it just made me feel like I'm stupid for allowing him to come stay with me.
[56:37] A: Well, let's just check, first of all. Right. Because you can have regret about that. Right. But the regret only happens because now I can look back, knowing what I know now.
[56:48] B: Exactly.
[56:49] A: But let's check it out. If you had known when he said, hey, do you mind if I hang? That it was going to lead to all of that.
[56:57] B: Yeah.
[56:58] A: If you had known that before, would you have let him hang?
[57:03] B: No.
[57:03] A: Oh, right. Quiet. Isn't that weird? Like, you can't have regret. You can't have regret and remorse about something you didn't know was gonna happen. And that you, back then, when he asked to hang, didn't know that she was gonna get pistol whipped. Mm. Right. Because if she did know, she would say, no, you can't stay. I've got somebody coming over, like, in like three seconds or three minutes. So you gotta get out of here.
[57:28] B: Or you just hide in the bathroom.
[57:30] A: Well, that too. Right. So again, as we're looking at it, we know it had nothing to do with you and that you back then didn't know that it was gonna lead to all that. Right? Right. And as you're realizing it now, what do you notice happening with the feelings?
[57:52] B: It's not.
[57:54] A: Right. Isn't that weird?
[57:55] B: Yeah.
[57:55] A: Right. They're not there. Yeah. Right. And notice how it wasn't even that bad. Right. Weird. Right?
[58:02] B: Yeah.
[58:03] A: Like, normally when I think about, you know that I have a lot more. But you're not. No. Your brain is getting that. It's data about something that happened versus happening. Right. And it had nothing to do with you had everything to do with what was off in him. Yeah. Because that's what you want to do to somebody that's a client.
[58:23] B: Yeah.
[58:24] A: When you were purchasing stuff from him.
[58:26] B: I mean, I was spending a lot of money with him.
[58:27] A: Right. Well, this is how I treat my clients. God damn.
[58:33] B: I give you like, $4,000 a week.
[58:36] A: That's a lot of money. Ah, right.
[58:41] B: What did I do to deserve this?
[58:43] A: Right. Like weird.
[58:45] B: Yeah.
[58:46] A: Yeah. Huh. There you go. So as you're getting it, and again, realizing that it had nothing to do with you, now close your eyes and think back to the you just after it's over, letting her know that it no longer exists. Letting her know that him doing that had nothing to do with you letting her know that, you know that if she had known what it was going to lead to, she certainly would have let him stay. Right. Let the, you know about reading and going to the library. Let her know about doing the puzzles. Let her know so that she gets it right. And the earlier you. What do you notice happening to her face?
[59:22] B: Like in what way? Like she's just.
[59:26] A: Right. The earlier you notice what's happening to her? Is she looking so troubled?
[59:30] B: No.
[59:30] A: No. Isn't that cool? Right? She's not stuck there anymore. Yeah. So it's been cleared. Right. Because you can think about it now and try to feel that anxiety. Isn't that weird? Yeah, right. Different things or the kid car.
[59:56] B: Have you ever thought about going into sound effects?
[60:02] A: I don't know. There's lots of weird stuff in here. Maybe you ate too much TV as a kid. I don't know. I have realized something, though. What if I let my daughter watch an iPad first thing in the morning? She's a bear. If she watches TV first thing in the morning, she's not. Here's the difference, okay? The iPad has YouTube. Even if the TV does, there's constantly a dopamine head. New thing, new thing, new thing, new thing, new thing. Constant dopamine hit. Even if it's a game. New thing, new thing, new thing. So now you take that away.
[60:45] B: Rawr.
[60:46] A: Yeah, you got your dopamine going on.
[60:48] B: It's like taking an addict's drug away.
[60:51] A: Yeah, not good. But we don't let her use that anymore. No. Like you can go watch TV upstairs. You can't use the iPad. You're not fun afterwards. Right. So again, see, here's the cool part. Because you're here, your other than conscious is also going to bring another moment to mind.
[61:12] B: Okay?
[61:13] A: Right. What's another moment that comes to mind?
[61:18] B: Brent.
[61:20] A: Brent.
[61:20] B: Brent, like my ex boyfriend that I was with for two years.
[61:23] A: Man. You have something with bees. Brent, Bruce, Bobby, Billy, Ben. All right, so what's an experience that happened with Brent? Oh, man, you got one so good. Yeah. Right, right. So this one happened when? About. About how long ago now?
[61:52] B: Oh, man, this was like in. What year are we in now?
[61:58] A: 2021. I know.
[62:00] B: Like, this is like end of 2019.
[62:04] A: Beginning of 2020. Yeah. Good. So you're where and what happened?
[62:07] B: Yeah, we were robbing my clients.
[62:11] A: So you were where? Oh, oh, I was where at this particular.
[62:16] B: I was at. I was at the. What hotel was that on? Fowler and 30th. Wasn't the holiday Inn? Wasn't The. It was another.
[62:24] A: La Quinta would like that place. So you're at the La Quinta. Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened next? So it's daytime or nighttime?
[62:33] B: Yeah, nighttime.
[62:35] A: Nighttime. And you're where, in a hotel room?
[62:37] B: No, I'm in the staircase.
[62:39] A: So you're in the staircase.
[62:40] B: Right.
[62:40] A: And you're sitting or standing?
[62:41] B: Standing.
[62:42] A: Standing.
[62:42] B: Walking up the stairs.
[62:43] A: Right. Walking up the stairs. Right. Good.
[62:44] B: Because. Well, we were.
[62:46] A: I picked.
[62:47] B: I got a client. Like, I got him out, like, told him, wait by the emergency exit.
[62:51] A: So you say.
[62:53] B: Yeah. So what we were doing was we were robbing our clients.
[62:55] A: Okay.
[62:56] B: My clients?
[62:57] A: Yes, our client. I don't know. I wasn't doing anything with them.
[63:00] B: But I got the client from outside and took him up the emergency staircase.
[63:05] A: Good job. So he was following you up the stairs?
[63:07] B: Yes.
[63:07] A: Right. Good. Right.
[63:08] B: Was coming down the stage, and Brent.
[63:10] A: Was coming down the stairs. Right.
[63:11] B: Even though I told him not to come down the stairs.
[63:12] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[63:14] B: Then Brent was like, give me your.
[63:16] A: Money to the guy. And you're standing there. Right.
[63:18] B: And I'm like, dude, we discussed this.
[63:20] A: Right? Good job.
[63:21] B: But I couldn't say that. I just gave him that face of.
[63:24] A: Really?
[63:24] B: Okay. Then the guy that he's trying to rob pulled out a knife.
[63:28] A: Good job, good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[63:30] B: And then Brent becomes a.
[63:32] A: And because he didn't. He goes, oh, oh, no, no, you keep it. You. You go ahead. I did you. That was totally my. I was asking her for it, not you. Like, it's all. Okay. Right. So then what happened next?
[63:45] B: Well, he gave me the. How did he. He gave me money prior to all this. So I had the money.
[63:52] A: Right. Good job, good detail.
[63:54] B: And I don't remember. Like, it's a blur. But I just know that basically.
[63:59] A: So Brent's like, give me the money.
[64:00] B: Yeah.
[64:01] A: The guy's like, no.
[64:02] B: Yeah. Here's a knife.
[64:04] A: Right? I can give you a knife, but not money. No.
[64:08] B: And then we end up chasing, Like, I'm trying to get away from the guy. The guy's chasing me. And Brent at this point.
[64:14] A: Good job. Like, up the stairs or down the stairs.
[64:15] B: It was all over the hotel. It was like one of those, like, 90s cartoons.
[64:20] A: Nice. Awesome.
[64:23] B: Yeah. Then Brent, like, finally just, like, leaves and disappears. So then it's just me with this guy chasing me, so I had to go hide in the bathroom.
[64:30] A: So then you went and hid in the bathroom.
[64:31] B: Yeah, Some handicapped lady saved me, literally.
[64:34] A: So you ran into the Bathroom. This guy's kind of crazy.
[64:37] B: And some lady in a wheelchair to fend me over.
[64:39] A: That's right. So the guy came into the bathroom.
[64:42] B: He was trying to. But the lady in the wheelchair that worked the front desk at the.
[64:46] A: She's like, no, no, you don't get to go in there. Yeah, right.
[64:49] B: So then he left.
[64:50] A: And then the cops came. Yeah, Right.
[64:52] B: And I didn't get involved with the cops. But Bruce was also there with Brent.
[64:56] A: Right. Because they were a band.
[64:59] B: Yeah. No, we were living in Bruce's hotel room. Then I put Brent in prison.
[65:07] A: Oh. Just because he was.
[65:11] B: He was just doing too many drugs of my drugs.
[65:15] A: Well, because he wasn't doing anything. Oh, right. Like it's bullshit. I'm making all the money here to buy the stuff, and you're using it all.
[65:21] B: Yeah.
[65:22] A: Yeah.
[65:22] B: So I'm just gonna put you in prison, huh?
[65:25] A: Right. But when you think about that moment with the guy with a knife, what are you noticing now?
[65:29] B: It's not as bad.
[65:30] A: All right? You can remember all that happened. You can remember putting on your sandals. Stop putting on your sandals.
[65:35] B: I'm not putting on my sandals.
[65:37] A: We'll stop him from coming out with a knife. I can't stop him from chasing you. Say, he's not chasing.
[65:41] B: He's not chasing me.
[65:42] A: Right. See, he's not a Can't, but he's not. He's not. That's right. That's the key thing. He's not doing it right. I don't have to stop him from chasing. Hurry. Stop him from chasing you. He's not chasing me. Stop putting in your pants. I'm not putting on my pants. Well, stop it from happening. Go. It's not happening.
[66:03] B: It's not happening.
[66:04] A: Right, so then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[66:06] B: It no longer exists.
[66:07] A: And as you get it, what do you notice?
[66:10] B: Not any anxiety.
[66:11] A: Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So all sorts of things are beginning to clear now. We've got the thing moving, right? As we have the thing moving again, another moment will come to mind.
[66:26] B: The incident was Smooth. Not a B name. Like, it's just my first pim.
[66:32] A: Smooth. Smooth. His name was Smooth.
[66:44] B: I choose real winners.
[66:46] A: Yeah, we gotta get that picker changed somewhere along the way. Before you're done here, we gotta get that thing adjusted.
[66:54] B: No Smooths, no Bruces, no Brents, no Bees.
[66:58] A: No. Yeah. So this one happened with Smooth? Yeah, Way, way. Like, how old?
[67:06] B: 16.
[67:06] A: 16. Good job. Right? That's a good time to start.
[67:08] B: Yeah.
[67:09] A: Yeah. Right. So you're 16 you're wearing.
[67:11] B: I am in his trap house.
[67:13] A: So you're in his trap house where he's got fish. This is a bear cage. This is what we keep raccoons in. This is where Madison stays.
[67:26] B: It was like his crack house is where he cooked crack and kept us. Oh, trap house.
[67:31] A: Okay. Nice. Good job. So it's a house house.
[67:35] B: It's an apartment.
[67:36] A: Oh, it's an apartment.
[67:38] B: But we just.
[67:41] A: With multiple doors and rooms.
[67:42] B: Yeah.
[67:43] A: Huh. And he's got all of them.
[67:46] B: The whole apartment? Well, not the whole apartment.
[67:48] A: Right.
[67:48] B: Just a apartment.
[67:49] A: He's got an apartment.
[67:50] B: An apartment.
[67:51] A: Right.
[67:51] B: Like apartment A.
[67:53] A: And a really nice part of town. I bet. I mean, the carpet was probably really clean. I mean, he vacuumed, I bet all the time. Very, very, very particular about how he kept it. No. Yeah, it was really clean.
[68:06] B: Not at all.
[68:07] A: No. So weird, right? Imagine the guy who's like, you know, doing that, trafficking women and, you know, making crime crack. I would imagine that that person would be very much into clean.
[68:21] B: Not really.
[68:21] A: Not really at all. No. The bathroom toilet probably was really, really spic and span.
[68:27] B: A lot of like blood splatter.
[68:28] A: Yeah. You didn't want to actually go, like.
[68:30] B: Okay, what happened here?
[68:35] A: But I really have to go. Yeah, that. Okay. So you're there.
[68:39] B: Yeah.
[68:40] A: Right. And this particular experience, what happened?
[68:44] B: He gang raped me.
[68:46] A: Him and other people.
[68:48] B: Other people?
[68:48] A: Uh huh. So he. You're there, you're 16.
[68:51] B: Yeah, I'm there.
[68:53] A: Right. He said, hey, I've got this really cool place.
[68:56] B: He said, come work for me. And me being a naive 16 year old was like, oh, a job because I just ran away from home.
[69:02] A: You said work for you. Cool. Like, what do I do? Like, am I a cash register? Do I stock the shelves? Oh, it's a clothing store. Do I get. Do I get a discount on clothing? No, none of that.
[69:17] B: None of that.
[69:18] A: So I do. Come and work for me.
[69:20] B: Yeah.
[69:21] A: Okay.
[69:21] B: Yeah.
[69:22] A: Cool.
[69:23] B: Then we get in the car, Right?
[69:24] A: Then you get in the car. And I'm sure it was a really nice car.
[69:26] B: It was a Dodge Charger.
[69:27] A: Yeah. See? Nice. My favorite thing would be if it had spinner wheels.
[69:33] B: It probably did.
[69:34] A: Oh, so cool. And even better if it was purple.
[69:40] B: No, it was not black.
[69:41] A: Damn. Maybe it had an underlight. That would be cool too.
[69:47] B: You know, I don't. I don't think it fits.
[69:49] A: So he got in the car and then he drove you back to the place? Right. Good. And then what happened?
[69:53] B: Well, Shauna and then some other girl smoking crack in the Back seat was there.
[69:56] A: Yeah. So Shawna and this other girl who's smoking crack. Right.
[70:00] B: And I've never seen anyone smoke crack before. So I'm like, what is that?
[70:02] A: What is that? Okay, Right.
[70:05] B: She's having fun over there.
[70:08] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[70:09] B: So then when we get back to the place, Shawna shoots me up with Molly and like.
[70:14] A: Injected.
[70:14] B: Yeah, injected.
[70:15] A: Injected it. Hey, by the way, you haven't. Here you go.
[70:18] B: And I'm like, stuck on the wall.
[70:20] A: Just like, okay, right. Good job. And you're like, wait a minute. Molly is this same thing that they're using right now to deal with people with ptsd, but it's all about set and setting, and this is not the right setting for that. Did you know that?
[70:34] B: No.
[70:34] A: Yeah. So mdna, which is being used right now in clinical trials, stage 3 clinical trials with the FDA, to treat post traumatic stress in a clinical setting. So you give the person the MDNA and you have two therapists and they work with the person to clear out their traumas.
[70:51] B: Are you serious?
[70:51] A: R. I know, it's awesome. Yeah.
[70:57] B: They're probably having a great time.
[70:59] A: Well, clearly good stuff. Like the same thing that you go to raves on.
[71:06] B: Do they have like the, like, EDM lights and stuff at the, like, therapist office? Like, do they get like a rave setting?
[71:13] A: Well, maybe kind of stuff.
[71:19] B: Yeah, I think that could be a new technique. Maybe.
[71:24] A: Well, yeah. Right.
[71:26] B: Yeah.
[71:27] A: So you're there. They give you that. Right. Then what happened next?
[71:30] B: And then he's like, we're test you. I'm like, what do you mean test?
[71:32] A: We're going to test you. Okay. So. Right. So don't know what that means. What's five times five? It wasn't that kind of test.
[71:37] B: No.
[71:37] A: Okay, so we're going to test you in a kite.
[71:41] B: I'm like, I don't know.
[71:44] A: I didn't realize that the job interview had attached to it. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[71:52] B: Pretty much. And then he gang raped me.
[71:54] A: Well, then he did what? Well, then he was like, he and somebody else.
[71:58] B: Three other people.
[71:59] A: So three other people, they pulled off your clothes?
[72:02] B: Yeah.
[72:02] A: Right. And then they put stuff in different body parts. Right.
[72:06] B: Too much.
[72:06] A: And some of that was like, what?
[72:08] B: What the fuck?
[72:09] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[72:11] B: And then it stopped.
[72:12] A: And then they stopped. Which was better than when they were doing that. Yeah. Right. Good job. And then what happened next?
[72:16] B: And then I got high again.
[72:17] A: Well, yes, of course. Then probably got clothes on at some point. Right. Good job. Good detail. And then that moment ended.
[72:24] B: Yeah.
[72:24] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[72:26] B: Yeah.
[72:26] A: Like read or go to libraries or do puzzles. Right. Or even talk to the family. So we got doing puzzles, we got talking to family, got going to library. Right. And then you got clothes on. And then you'd gotten high, and then they'd stopped, and then they were doing that to your body. And then you. They said, well, we need to test you. And then she had given you that stuff, and then you got to his lovely place, and then you're in the charger, and then he's like, hey, why don't you come and work for me? You're like, cool. And then you had, like, ran away. Then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, I wanted.
[72:59] B: Not bad.
[72:59] A: Not bad. Not bad at all. You can remember it happening. You can remember putting your pants on.
[73:04] B: But I'm not putting on my pants.
[73:05] A: Well, then stop them from doing that.
[73:07] B: They aren't doing that.
[73:08] A: Well, so then where is it? It no longer exists. Right. Isn't that weird? Yeah. Now, here's another part. Because things happen to people's bodies all the time, and we tend to walk around thinking that I am my body. Mm. But what if you're not? Then what does that make me? I know this is where it's gonna get really weird. Are you ready for it?
[73:29] B: I don't know.
[73:31] A: See, we could say that you have a body. Your body's totally yours, but it isn't actually you. We know that because there's not a single cell within your body. Today, that's the same as it was. Your feet are longer than they were when you were two, yet you're still you. So you're not a body. Right. My mom lost the tip of her index finger. When they go to visit people now, they don't say, suzy, I'm so glad almost all of you could come over today.
[73:59] B: I need to say that to my.
[74:00] A: Grandma, because she loves her. That'd be awesome.
[74:03] B: Grandma.
[74:04] A: I'm so glad I get to see almost all of you. It's great, right? Right? She's all there, even if that part of her body's missing. So we have one. We're not it. We go, oh, well, if I'm not my body, it must be my thoughts. But here's the weird part. You're not even the thinker of your thoughts. Your brain is. And you're not your brain. You have one. Your brain is an organ, just like your heart is Just like your lungs and your kidneys, they're yours, not you. Weird. So now we go, okay, if I'm not my body and I'm not my thoughts, maybe I'm what I do. Except there's been a lot of things that you've done. This thing, that thing, that thing, this thing, this thing that when you stop doing. Did you stop existing?
[74:45] B: No.
[74:45] A: No. So you can't be what you do. Oh, maybe you're how you feel, except you feel different ways at different times, so you can't be a feeling. Now. It's really weird because if you're not what you do, or your thoughts or your body or your feelings. Right?
[75:00] B: Yeah.
[75:01] A: So here's the thing. Think of a time when you were outside in nature, okay? And you see something beautiful. Like, the moment you're looking at it, you're like, wow, what is it that you see?
[75:11] B: An Aspen tree.
[75:12] A: Yeah. And isn't there a moment that as you see that tree, you're filled with, like, a sense of, like, wow, peace, excitement. And people go, well, duh. Being there and seeing that gives you those feelings. Or we look at it from that other lens, we go, now what if being there and the experience of it actually drew your awareness in and down towards your center? Because at your center, you are peaceful and excited in the same way. My hands are freezing. We're outside by the campfire, and I thought, man, let me warm them up. And I go, holy shit, this fire is getting hotter. You go, no, it's not getting any hotter at all. You are becoming more aware of it as your hands get closer to those flames, though, right?
[75:48] B: Yeah.
[75:48] A: So we know that in your life, there have been multitudes of times where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Stress, upset, anger, angst, worry, pain, guilt, shame. But no matter where awareness is, been always at your center. You're peaceful and excited. And, you know, two of us are in here, right? You know, two of us are in here. How do you know it? You look around. Your senses bring in that kind of data, Intellect is that kind of data, Intellect we call light of knowledge at your center. It's actually a brighter light, light of wisdom. So now we've got knowledge and wisdom, right? And I work with lots of people who've gone through really fucked up, weird stuff with people, right. One girl told me, I think she was 6 at the time, her older brother, weird older brother, still playing with Matchbox cars. And what he would do sometimes, he'd drive them up her leg and park them in her vagina so you can imagine she had a lot of, like. But as we work together, it's gone. Like, all the discomfort, all the pain, the shame, the guilt, like, it's gone. And I asked her the question. I go, all that discomfort. I go, where was it? She goes, you. It's gone. I go, okay, cool. I go, but where was it? She goes, it's gone. Yeah, yeah, I know it's gone. Right? That's what we were intending to do, but where was it? And she goes, I don't know. I go, well, was it at the surface level? She's like, it wasn't an intellectual thing. I go, oh, it was hiding in your center. She's like, really? How could it survive in light where I'm peaceful and excited? I go, well, then where was it? She goes, oh, I know. It was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I said, well, what happened? She goes, the lights are touching, the shadows are gone. I said, well, that's pretty freaking cool. She goes, it is. And then we started talking about, like, that whole thing about body that you're not one. You have one. It's yours, not you. So if we think about that, we go, well, then who are you? Well, maybe who I am is. Is the light at the center. I don't know if. When you were a kid, like, you said prayers, Say prayers as a kid.
[77:47] B: Yeah.
[77:48] A: Fucking weird prayers.
[77:50] B: Prayers for bears, Big Bigfoot, ghost, like.
[77:53] A: All sorts of things, right? My mom would always end with the worst prayer, the most common one that people say. Now I lay me down to sleep.
[78:02] B: I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
[78:05] A: If I should die before I wake, I pray. Pray to the Lord my soul to take. And then she'd kiss me on the forehead, right? Kiss me on the forehead, walk to the door, turned the light off. Night, sweetie. Love you.
[78:18] B: You're sitting there like, am I gonna die?
[78:19] A: No. Shit, it was scary. I'd have horrible nightmares of two hands breaking through my window, ripping open my dead body, grabbing it from me. That's when I got older. I went, wait, maybe that's me. Not something I have. Maybe the light is me. And what if the light that is me can't be touched? Mm. What if who I am can't be touched or harmed in that way, right? If I go to the dentist and I'm really upset, and you go, why? You'll never believe what the dentist did to me. And you go, what did he do? Well, first he put me on one of these chairs, and as soon as I sat down, my head Went, my feet. You know, it's very uncomfortable to sit like this.
[79:03] B: It is.
[79:03] A: But then you're like, yeah, but you're at the dentist. That's what they do. Okay. Well, the next thing he did, he took this light and he kind of positioned it in such a way so, like, I'm blinded. I can't fucking see a goddamn thing. You're like, yeah, you're at the dentist. And then he took this cold metal instrument, shoved it right up inside of him. And you're like, oh, my goodness. And you're what? I thought, madison, my mouth. I'm at the dentist. But it's the same thing I said to the girl with her brother in the Matchbox Cars. I said, when you were little, he messed with your stuff. And she said, he did. And for a long time, it hurt my feelings and it screwed up my thinking. And then she looked at me and she went, you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body. It hurt my feelings, my thing. But he never touched me. I said, whoa. She said, yeah, because who I am can be touching that way. I said, well, that's pretty powerful, right? And see, I'll show you something that's really, really weird. You ready for something? Not that we haven't done any of that yet.
[80:09] B: Not at all. What are you talking about?
[80:11] A: But this is really interesting. So first I'll show you this because this is kind of neat. It is a ping pong ball that doesn't bounce. It doesn't bounce because it's got metal pieces on it.
[80:25] B: Okay.
[80:26] A: But what's really neat about it is if I take my fingers and I touch the metal pieces, it makes a noise. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Right? So if you took an index finger and touched it doesn't do a thing. Is that you or me does nothing. Right? But keep the index finger there. And now touch my finger over here. Keep it there. Right? Now, simplistically explained, it's like a light switch. When a light switch is off, there's an opening. When it's on, the circuit is connected, the energy flows. So I connect the circuit when we touch, and it's open, it's off. When we touch, the energy flow flows. Okay, that's kind of neat. Einstein smart dude said that who we are is energy plus matter equals the physical existence. And what became the second law of thermodynamics is that energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. So what if when people's bodies stop, they don't actually stop? What if the who you are isn't your body. And so therefore any of the stuff that happened to your body. There's not a cell within your body right now that's the same as when it happened. It's all been replaced millions of times, but you're still you. Heck, neuroscience crazily will say to us, if you and I came back a year from today, one year from today. 99.9999. Meaning almost all of the subatomic particles that make us up wouldn't be here. Isn't that weird? That is. Now, they don't go all at once, because that'd be like Star Trek, Right? Fucking crazy. But that's weird. So here's the next weird part. Take that hand, hold it like this. Look at that spot there.
[82:13] B: Okay.
[82:13] A: As you look at that spot there, don't do anything on purpose to move the hand. Just kind of keep it. Okay. There you go. 4. Look at that spot there. I can't look at that spot without my thumb turning in. Just stay there. Thumb. Right. We'll get there.
[83:01] B: Okay.
[83:02] A: I'm glad that there's a mouse on the COVID Yeah.
[83:12] B: Sunny would have had so much trouble with this.
[83:15] A: I'm having a really hard time having my hand. Right. Got it?
[83:20] B: I think so.
[83:21] A: Keep it right there. Good. Right, watch. Look at the spot. See my hand move close to your hand.
[83:27] B: Okay.
[83:27] A: As it moves closer and closer to your hand, before it ever touches your hand, notice that you're gonna feel the energy from my hand. Isn't that weird? Yeah, you can feel the energy from my hand right within your hand, which means, Madison, I'm actually coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with respect and love. Right? Isn't that interesting? Notice how there was a little twitch that you didn't do, but you noticed it happening? That's right. Those twitches are unconscious movements letting you know that your mind is responding to you. That's right. You can feel the energy. Notice how it's growing a little bit more. That's right. As you feel the energy, I want you to repeat these words after me. I have a nose.
[84:18] B: I have a nose.
[84:19] A: I have 10 fingers. I have two elbows. I have 10 toes. I'm not my nose. I'm not my fingers. I'm not my elbows. Not my elbows or my toes or my toes. I have a vagina. I'm not my vagina.
[84:33] B: I'm not my vagina.
[84:34] A: My vagina is mine.
[84:35] B: My vagina is Mine.
[84:36] A: But it isn't me.
[84:37] B: It isn't me.
[84:38] A: Yeah. So they mess with my stuff.
[84:39] B: You messed with my stuff.
[84:40] A: And it hurt my feelings.
[84:41] B: And it hurt my feelings.
[84:42] A: And screwed up my thinking.
[84:43] B: And screwed up my thinking.
[84:44] A: But they never touched who I really am.
[84:45] B: But they never touched who I really am.
[84:46] A: They never touched me.
[84:48] B: And they never touched me.
[84:49] A: They messed with my stuff.
[84:50] B: They messed with my stuff.
[84:51] A: But they never got me.
[84:52] B: But they never got me.
[84:52] A: Right. Take a deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. That hand can just drop down deeper down inside. More and more and more and more and more. All the way down into delight at your center. That calm and peaceful, easy, flowing energy. That's right. And then whenever you're ready, take a deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Right. And what are you noticing now?
[85:27] B: Relaxed.
[85:27] A: Yeah. So think about that moment with smooth, smooth jazz.
[85:39] B: There's not any ocean.
[85:41] A: Isn't that weird? Mm. Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[85:44] B: Mm.
[85:44] A: Right. Right. Things are changing for the better. And again, your unconscious is going to travel back through other experiences that have happened in your own history. And another moment is going to be brought to your awareness to clear. Right. This one happened when?
[86:06] B: Same time period, but with a different person.
[86:09] A: Not smooth.
[86:10] B: It was his buddy that tested me.
[86:13] A: Oh.
[86:14] B: And he, like, rented me out for the night.
[86:16] A: Oh, good. That same day. No.
[86:21] B: It'S a great day.
[86:22] A: No, really good day. Too.
[86:23] B: High or intoxicated, you really need.
[86:25] A: Well, it didn't really rent you out. Rented your body.
[86:27] B: Yeah.
[86:28] A: Right. You just came along with it because you were in it. I mean, but they were kind of renting your body.
[86:31] B: Like a skin suit.
[86:32] A: Yes, it is. Right. They were renting your body.
[86:35] B: Yeah.
[86:35] A: Right.
[86:36] B: And he took me.
[86:40] A: So he's like, hey, come with me. Yeah, Right, right. It's like you got to put it in the parking meter. All right, good.
[86:51] B: So I went with him, and then he took me to a.
[86:53] A: Like he took you to a swanky place? No, I mean, because you were already staying at a palace.
[86:59] B: I mean.
[86:59] A: Yeah, right. Sure. Yeah, sure.
[87:01] B: It was like the hood of Miami.
[87:03] A: Well, good. Yeah. So he took you to a lovely place.
[87:06] B: Great. Five Stars would recommend you go there when you go to Miami.
[87:10] A: He. He piggybacked you there. He actually drove you there?
[87:13] B: Yeah.
[87:14] A: Good. So he was in a car. Yeah, Right.
[87:16] B: No spinners, not purple.
[87:18] A: Damn. It's too bad.
[87:20] B: I know.
[87:21] A: So he took you to his place.
[87:23] B: It was sort of a condo with, like, at night time and it was dark.
[87:28] A: Right. And you knew exactly where you were.
[87:30] B: No clue.
[87:33] A: Right. Good. So you just followed him.
[87:36] B: Just followed him.
[87:37] A: Right, Good.
[87:37] B: And then there was like 10 guys.
[87:39] A: How much am I getting paid for this? Like, I didn't even negotiate.
[87:43] B: I didn't even know that, that like.
[87:44] A: I didn't even, like, I got a job and I have not actually gotten paid yet. And like, there's a lot of stuff that's happened already. And I, I like, is this what working it? Like, I was very. I got no money. Yeah. And like, I'm thinking, like, some of this stuff should cost more than others. Like, I mean, gosh, bullshit.
[88:03] B: Really is.
[88:04] A: That's right. I mean, like, you know, if you go to the massage place. Yeah. If you're just getting the sit in the chair, that's a different price. Well, I mean, that's a completely different story. I'm just thinking, going to the mall and you got the lean over thing, the guys working on your shoulders, that's a different price than like, if you go. And then it's a really different price if you're going in. That's right. So he brought you over.
[88:35] B: Yeah.
[88:36] A: And then there was a lot of nice people there that he wanted to introduce you to. Yeah. Right. So he brought you over to this like, thing and there were different people there. Yeah, Right.
[88:43] B: I was the only white female in hood of Miami with 10 other guys.
[88:48] A: Right. Good job. Right? Yeah. And so you went into the place, right? Yeah, Right. Good job.
[88:53] B: We went out, like, we were outside. They were all smoking, drinking, doing drugs.
[88:58] A: Of course.
[88:59] B: Of course.
[88:59] A: Right. And you're like, is this part of it?
[89:02] B: Yeah.
[89:02] A: Do I get any of that?
[89:04] B: Yeah. And then they were all fighting over.
[89:06] A: Who was gonna, like, who goes first?
[89:08] B: Yeah.
[89:09] A: I want thirds. Can I go last?
[89:16] B: What is going on?
[89:17] A: Right. Isn't that some guy who pulls the stitch? Oh, no, my straw. Damn. I got the last straw. Why do I always get the short end of stick?
[89:28] B: Yeah. I don't know.
[89:29] A: Right. So then they were like going, who's going first? Yeah. Who's on second? I don't know. Who's on third?
[89:34] B: Like, what is it? Like a whiteboard?
[89:36] A: That's right. That's right. You get this many minutes. So then what happened next?
[89:41] B: So then some guy was like, come here.
[89:43] A: And I was like, okay, you're like, me? Who, me?
[89:46] B: What am I doing? Like, I was highly intoxicated by.
[89:49] A: That's right. Of course. Right. Good job, good detail. And like, you're 16.
[89:52] B: Yeah.
[89:53] A: Right. So you knew a lot.
[89:54] B: Never had any hard drugs, didn't know anything. I'm just.
[89:58] A: Right. Good job. Good detail.
[89:59] B: Shoeless.
[90:00] A: Well, I mean, you're Floridian.
[90:05] B: What are shoes? And, yeah, the guy that was like, here, do you want some drugs? I was like, yeah, sure. So I followed him to the stairwell.
[90:12] A: Right. Good job.
[90:12] B: The next thing I know, gunshots.
[90:14] A: Oh, in the stairwells?
[90:16] B: Well, like, right where we were.
[90:17] A: Oh, good. Right.
[90:18] B: But we were like. Like, here's a circle, here's a stairwell.
[90:21] A: Right.
[90:22] B: So then he just threw me in the bushes and was like, wait, here with gunshots? And I was like, I don't know what's going on.
[90:27] A: Okay, well, I'll stay in the bushes.
[90:31] B: I just took a dirt nap.
[90:32] A: Right. Good job. The detail. Right. This sounds better than getting shot. Yeah. Yeah.
[90:38] B: And then the guy that took me there drove up with the guy that threw me in the bushes.
[90:42] A: Yes.
[90:42] B: And they said, get in the back. So we got back, sped off.
[90:45] A: So you got in the back with somebody else?
[90:47] B: No, it was. Well, there was the guy that drove me there.
[90:49] A: Yes.
[90:50] B: And then the guy that was in the stairwell.
[90:51] A: Yes.
[90:52] B: And then me in the backseat.
[90:53] A: Oh, good. So they were in the front seat. You're in the back seat. Right. Good job. Good detail.
[90:56] B: Then they took me to, like, some weird trailer home.
[90:58] A: Right. Well, I mean, really nice place.
[91:00] B: The creme de la creme of trail homes.
[91:02] A: That's right. Yes. Right. Good job. Cad. Linoleum on the ground. I mean, really pretty great granite countertop.
[91:09] B: No electricity.
[91:10] A: Well, why would there be electricity? It's Florida. I mean, you don't need ac. Right. And then what happened next?
[91:17] B: And then they all raped me, him.
[91:19] A: And the other guy.
[91:20] B: Yeah.
[91:20] A: Right. So they did stuff to your body.
[91:21] B: Yeah.
[91:22] A: Right.
[91:22] B: And then they took me back to.
[91:23] A: Smooth, and then they said, okay, Smooth, we're done.
[91:26] B: Yeah.
[91:26] A: Right. And then Smooth got paid, or you get paid up front? We have no idea. So you said, here's some more. Right. But then that moment ended.
[91:35] B: Yeah.
[91:36] A: Right. And then later on, you did something better, Right? Like put your jeans on or go read a book or go to library.
[91:42] B: Not that much fun.
[91:44] A: Way more fun than that.
[91:45] B: Yeah.
[91:47] A: Right. Right.
[91:49] B: Yeah.
[91:49] A: Right. So you can remember it happening and then doing that. Right? You can remember putting the band around your wrist. Well, stop putting the banner on your wrist. Not putting the banner on. Well, stop getting the really cool tattoo. See, I am not getting this really cool tattoo. Well, then stop them from doing that.
[92:07] B: They're not doing that.
[92:08] A: Well, then you stop doing the drugs. Say, I'm not doing the drugs. Well, then stop them from doing that. Say they're not doing that.
[92:12] B: They're not doing that.
[92:13] A: So then where is it? Say no longer exists.
[92:15] B: No longer exists.
[92:16] A: By the way, that happening. Did it have anything to do with you?
[92:19] B: No.
[92:20] A: Right. But again, all that stuff would have felt like it did. Right. But we didn't. It wouldn't have mattered. Them doing that stuff to your body wouldn't have mattered whether it was you or any other girl at that time in that same situation with them. That's what they would have done.
[92:38] B: Yeah.
[92:39] A: Right. So now close your eyes and picture that younger you. And let her know these four words. Ready? Here we go. It's. It's not. Not about me. Right? It's not.
[92:50] B: Say that it's not.
[92:52] A: It's not about me. That's right. So that she gets. It's not about me. Let her know that it's over, finished. That it no longer exists. That you're okay. Let her know that there's no part of her body. Now that's the same as any of that happened then. I don't know about reading, putting puzzles together. Definitely the frame first. That's right.
[93:14] B: Priorities.
[93:15] A: That's right. And what do you notice now?
[93:18] B: It's a lot lighter. And it's not like. Doesn't feel like it's me.
[93:21] A: Yeah, right.
[93:22] B: Does it feel like it's my fault?
[93:24] A: Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[93:25] B: It is.
[93:26] A: Yeah. Notice how that's different?
[93:27] B: It's a lot different.
[93:29] A: Yeah. Right. And this isn't me, I swear.
[93:35] B: We need to get you on like soundtracks.
[93:38] A: I should just have like a keyboard.
[93:42] B: A little bell.
[93:43] A: Right. Like with like sounds that we put on there. That would be fun.
[93:49] B: Ding dong Christmas present.
[93:52] A: Could be. Yeah. Well, then I'd have to learn how to do it.
[93:57] B: Just hire someone.
[93:58] A: A lot of police Academy. Like I heard the voices that did the. Well, at least she didn't get like killed. Yeah, yeah.
[94:10] B: I mean, that's a bonus.
[94:11] A: That's right. I mean, they were nice enough to throw you in the bushes.
[94:14] B: I mean. Yeah. Probably didn't want a dead white girl on their hands.
[94:23] A: Right.
[94:24] B: That wouldn't have looked good.
[94:25] A: No, but probably not. Yeah, right. So again, think about all that stuff. Think about getting picked up by Smooth. You want a good job. This is not a good interview. You gotta test it. This interview process is really difficult. I've never had these kinds of things done on an interview before.
[94:56] B: What interview is this?
[94:58] A: Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah. But as you think about it now, what are you noticing? Is there any hurt? Is there any anger? Is There any guilt? Is there any shame? Is there any disgust?
[95:12] B: No.
[95:13] A: Yeah.
[95:14] B: It's just sort of like it happened.
[95:15] A: Right. We want it to be read as data. I mean, we still don't like that it happened. Right. But given that it's not happening, then I've moved through it and completed, defeated. It no longer exists. Isn't that a good news thing?
[95:35] B: It's great.
[95:36] A: Yeah. Yeah. So all sorts of things are changing. Right. And notice how it's even easier even as you're going through difficult, yucky stuff to be here. Yeah. Right. Because your brain is getting it. And as it gets it, it makes even other ones become easier to get cleared. And again, it's gonna go back, slide down the slide.
[95:59] B: Because we're like, if we're a kid, if we're an adult, we might get stuck. Fuck.
[96:08] A: Yeah. Especially the one that does this thing.
[96:11] B: Oh, man. I might just fall off the top.
[96:13] A: Top of it, man. Right? Yeah. So again, as it travels back, what's another moment that comes to mind?
[96:19] B: My stepdad.
[96:20] A: Oh, good. That guy, right? Yeah. He's a holy man. Yeah. I like it when people come in with the jeans that have holes, go, oh, those are your church pants. Like, what they go. They're holy. Bottom feeder, Bottom feeder. Bottom feeder. But sometimes you gotta use bottom feeders. So particular time that happened with him.
[96:48] B: When we were at Disney, you might.
[96:49] A: Have been how old?
[96:51] B: 15, 14.
[96:52] A: All right, so you're. Yeah, 14, 15.
[96:54] B: Somewhere in that age, Right?
[96:55] A: You went to Disney.
[96:57] B: Yeah.
[96:57] A: And you're at the Magic Kingdom?
[96:59] B: No, we were at a hotel.
[97:01] A: You're at a hotel room at Disney?
[97:03] B: I feel like I'm always in hotel.
[97:04] A: Rooms and they've gotten much progressively better. And then we were in the Roadway Inn.
[97:12] B: Oh, off a bush. It's a real winner.
[97:19] A: Yeah.
[97:20] B: Have you ever been there?
[97:22] A: I had a guy crazy story. Okay. Somebody saw a YouTube video that I did, did a crowdfunding to get treatment for his ptsd.
[97:39] B: Okay.
[97:41] A: He lived in Texas. He got enough money to fly here.
[97:46] B: Okay.
[97:47] A: I volunteered to do treatment with him. And he got a hotel room at the Roadway Inn. And we video recorded the session of getting the trauma stuff cleared. That's the only time that I've been there and I didn't want to sit.
[98:07] B: Yeah.
[98:08] A: Like, I was like, do we have to do this here?
[98:13] B: Like, it's great, isn't it?
[98:15] A: No. The only thing that it was good about is it was close to Reeves.
[98:20] B: Yeah.
[98:21] A: Yeah. I'm gonna go look at fancy cars right now because this place makes me feel really cringy.
[98:30] B: Can't even take a shower because it's like.
[98:31] A: What is in the shower?
[98:33] B: I don't know what that stain is.
[98:36] A: I mean, that there's hair, but this.
[98:37] B: Is even worse than that. I don't want to use the soap either. Why is there a soap bar there?
[98:45] A: It's not even wrapped. Yeah. Yeah. Good place. Yeah. So you're at a hotel? At Disney. With him? Just him.
[98:55] B: With my siblings also.
[98:57] A: Oh, good. Him and the other siblings. Right. And you're in the hotel room.
[99:00] B: Yeah.
[99:00] A: Mom there?
[99:01] B: No, my. He told my mom, you stay at home. I'm gonna take the kids for vacation. You stay home.
[99:06] A: Can you get rest? I'm gonna take the kids.
[99:08] B: Yeah.
[99:09] A: Good. What a nice guy. Holy man. Real winner, right? Yeah.
[99:13] B: Always got to keep of appearances.
[99:15] A: That's right. You know? Yeah. So you're at the hotel room, and this one's daytime or nighttime?
[99:21] B: Nighttime.
[99:21] A: Nighttime. Right. Good. And so it's one room for all of you.
[99:25] B: No, it's like. You know how they're joining rooms?
[99:28] A: Right. Good job. So there's room that's got the littler kids.
[99:31] B: Yeah. And then the sound machine.
[99:33] A: And the sound machine. So they can't hear anything.
[99:35] B: Yeah.
[99:36] A: Right. Good job. And then you went into the other room.
[99:38] B: Yeah.
[99:38] A: With him.
[99:39] B: With him. Yeah. Because you used to switch. Bring dinner.
[99:41] A: Oh, bringing dinner. Right. Because you were hungry.
[99:43] B: Yeah.
[99:43] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[99:45] B: Well, I joked. I'm like, I would like a Jack and Coke just to see his response.
[99:48] A: Because I knew that, like, a detail. Right.
[99:50] B: I could get away with.
[99:52] A: Yes.
[99:52] B: So he left to go get dinner. I took a shower.
[99:56] A: Yes.
[99:57] B: He came back with Jack and Coke and dinner.
[99:59] A: Good job. Good detail.
[100:00] B: He tried to get. He tried to get me drunk. I just poured it down the drain.
[100:03] A: When he wasn't looking. Good job. Good detail.
[100:05] B: He got drunk.
[100:06] A: Yes. Right. And then what happened?
[100:07] B: And then he tried to. He, like, got on top of me while I was on the bed and tried to, like, unhook my bra.
[100:12] A: Good job. Good detailing.
[100:13] B: To give me a back rub.
[100:14] A: That's right. Because, I mean, you can't actually really get the whole back if there's a strap in the middle of it. I mean, it's hard to, like, go around it. It's much easier to just completely undo it. That's right.
[100:27] B: With the shirt off.
[100:28] A: Well, I mean, how can you give a back rub? Well, with a shirt on?
[100:32] B: I mean, I don't know.
[100:34] A: Right. So he did that, tried to undo it. Right. Good job. Right. And Then what happened next?
[100:39] B: He just.
[100:40] A: It.
[100:41] B: He was in his boxers to talk.
[100:43] A: To me and good job for detail.
[100:45] B: Then was like this. I don't know, it just was like, this is just weird. So I pushed him off.
[100:49] A: But. Right. And then what happened next?
[100:51] B: I like locked. I was like, I hear Jack, which is my brother.
[100:54] A: When you see Jordan, lock the door there. Gotta go.
[100:58] B: Squirrel.
[100:59] A: Right?
[100:59] B: Yeah.
[101:00] A: Look over there.
[101:03] B: Basically.
[101:05] A: And then that moment ended.
[101:06] B: Yeah.
[101:07] A: Right, Right. And again, as you're thinking about it now, what do you notice?
[101:11] B: It's in the past.
[101:13] A: It's not as bad.
[101:14] B: It's.
[101:15] A: Yeah. You can remember him doing that.
[101:16] B: Yeah.
[101:16] A: But you can remember putting on your sweater.
[101:18] B: Yeah.
[101:18] A: Or what is that? What is that a cardigan? It's a cardigan. I mean I have stayed at La Quinta, so this is a cardigan. I do fancy. I have access to those bigger words. So perfect. You can remember putting on your cardigan. You can remember him climbing on top of you and trying to take this. Right, Right. Well stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that. Will you stop putting on your cardigan?
[102:02] B: I'm not putting on my cardigan.
[102:03] A: Stop that from happening. Say it's not happening. Right. So then where is it?
[102:05] B: It's not there.
[102:06] A: It no longer exists. Right. And again, him doing that, did that have anything to do with you?
[102:10] B: No.
[102:11] A: No. Right. Did any of you think to do with your developing.
[102:17] B: No.
[102:18] A: No. What it have to do with him. Him being off.
[102:24] B: You lose screws.
[102:33] A: That's right.
[102:34] B: Yeah.
[102:35] A: Right. And again, as you're getting it, close your eyes, think back to the you and let her know. No over finished, no longer exists. Had nothing to do with me. Right. So that she gets it. What are you noticing now?
[102:55] B: More at ease. And I was like angry about the situation.
[102:58] A: Yeah. Cuz there was anger.
[103:00] B: Yeah.
[103:00] A: Oh, it was, it.
[103:03] B: It was the like. It was a lot of confusion, I think.
[103:12] A: Yeah. You know, 14 year old kid with stepdad having your drink and then doing.
[103:22] B: Who's a pastor?
[103:23] A: Well, come on. That's a wine.
[103:27] B: It's communion.
[103:28] A: It's the blood of Christ. And this is the body. You said you were hungry.
[103:44] B: No bread for you. What is that?
[103:47] A: The na.
[103:47] B: The naan.
[103:49] A: Naan. Yeah.
[103:49] B: That's Indian.
[103:50] A: That's right. Yeah.
[103:53] B: Manna mana. Communion. Great.
[104:04] A: Yeah. So what do you notice happening to the anger now?
[104:07] B: It's dissipating.
[104:08] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool? Right? Yeah. All sorts of things are beginning to lighten and lift. So just check. Right. Think back now about the first thing you Told me. Okay. What do you notice?
[104:22] B: It doesn't bother me.
[104:23] A: Right. Isn't that neat? Yeah, right. We got smooth, Bright and Bruce. Bruce, Right. It wasn't Springsteen because that would have been really cool. The Boss.
[104:42] B: Yeah, no, he tried to be meth head.
[104:45] A: Oh, meth head. Even better. That's good stuff to get into.
[104:49] B: Yeah, that's what I used.
[104:52] A: It's harsh.
[104:53] B: It's very harsh.
[104:54] A: Yeah. You know people who do that, like 10 years in, like they've aged 30 years.
[104:59] B: Yeah, it's crazy. How old are you?
[105:03] A: Yeah, yeah, Right?
[105:06] B: Yeah. Not good. Start seeing stuff that's not there.
[105:09] A: Well, you. Well, the problem is the delusions that happen out of nothing.
[105:14] B: Dude, the FBI was coming for me.
[105:17] A: Well, yeah, I'm secret agent.
[105:23] B: It's just a power outage. They're not actually shutting down the elevator.
[105:26] A: Right. They know I'm in here. Have you ever seen Steve Martin the Jerk? Oh my goodness. So he is. He starts off by saying, I grew up in a. As a poor black. And of course he's white. Right. And he's such a, like not bright guy that somebody's trying to kill him. And he thinks they're shooting at the cans. So he's standing next to like the soda machine. More cans. And then he runs into the gas station and there's like oil. More cans. They keep shooting at the cans. Yeah, no, no, dude, they're shooting at you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But notice how it's not troubling. No, no. And even. What's another thing with Bruce.
[106:23] B: Bruce.
[106:26] A: Right. Yeah, yeah. What's another thing with it that happened.
[106:32] B: Just like, just a whole, like he tried to kill me multiple times.
[106:38] A: Oh, good. Let's think of one time he tried.
[106:40] B: To do that when he choked me.
[106:42] A: Oh, you're where on the bed? Oh, well, that's a good place to do it. And it's not S and M. No, I didn't have cuffs on or a collar. No, no. Right. But he put his hands in.
[106:53] B: Uh huh.
[106:54] A: Right. And then you're like, really breathe. Because I know that's the fucking.
[107:04] B: Oh, okay. Stop breathing. I'll play dead, baby. That will end up.
[107:11] A: Right. Then what happened next? So he had his hands on your throat.
[107:14] B: Right.
[107:14] A: Then what happened?
[107:15] B: Then Annette was like, you're killing her.
[107:17] A: Right. Good. Hey. Right. He goes, oh, okay.
[107:24] B: So then he started hitting me to the already pistol whipped and black dot.
[107:28] A: Good. Well that needed to get hit a few more times, right? Yeah, right.
[107:33] B: Three months later, I still had like a dirt.
[107:35] A: Yeah, right. So he did that Right. And that's like, psst. Yeah.
[107:39] B: Like, stop trying to kill her.
[107:40] A: Right. Just beat her. Yeah, Right. Then what happened?
[107:45] B: Then he held me at gunpoint.
[107:50] A: Yeah, Right when you were where?
[107:52] B: In the hotel?
[107:53] A: In that room still?
[107:54] B: Yeah. This happened in, like, five days.
[107:56] A: What a up room.
[107:58] B: You don't want to go back to that.
[107:59] A: I am not going to. I was gonna stay at the liquor. We were gonna, you know, go to the La Quinta, but I am not staying in a La Quinta.
[108:07] B: Juju on them.
[108:08] A: Apparently any place that's got a door that you don't have to go through a hallway to get to scares me.
[108:16] B: Door that.
[108:17] A: Right. Most motels have doors that out.
[108:20] B: Oh, okay.
[108:21] A: Those places scare me.
[108:22] B: Okay.
[108:23] A: I don't want to go to one of those that have the air conditioners in the window. Yeah, yeah.
[108:30] B: Not. No. Have you ever cleaned the air filters off of one of those?
[108:34] A: Oh, my.
[108:41] B: That was a meth experience.
[108:42] A: Only during my spare time, in between sessions. Yeah.
[108:52] B: It would scare you even more if you cleaned up.
[108:54] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. My wife has stayed at hotels in her life. She took the kids one time. She said this afterwards. She goes, yeah, if you were with us, you wouldn't have stayed there. I go, why did you stay there? Then she's like, you're more of a prima donna than I am. I go, okay. Oh, I don't. I. Sure. I guess. But, like, yeah, I don't need the black light. Oh, God, look at all the stuff.
[109:25] B: I don't want to do. That's why you bring your own sheets. You bring, like, a travel size fabuloso. Travel size blue.
[109:32] A: I don't want to stay in a hotel room that I gotta, like, do.
[109:35] B: All of that stuff.
[109:37] A: I wipe shit off and stuff. But I want to, like, think, like, okay, I can get in the covers and under the. I don't.
[109:44] B: Don't look at the mattress.
[109:51] A: Oh, my.
[109:52] B: What does that state?
[109:54] A: Wow. Well, they were very active in here earlier.
[110:00] B: Don't shine a black light on that bed.
[110:03] A: Oh, my. So he's got a gun.
[110:07] B: Yeah.
[110:07] A: Like, where do you have it? Right here.
[110:09] B: Yeah.
[110:13] A: And then what happened?
[110:15] B: And then I was slightly freaking out. I'm like, bro, like, I didn't steal your money. Clearly, it's Annette trying to frame me.
[110:26] A: Like, good job, petito. Right.
[110:27] B: You know, what do you want me, like, what do I have to give you?
[110:32] A: Yes.
[110:33] B: So that you can stop freaking the fuck out.
[110:35] A: Right. Good. And then have an ex.
[110:36] B: And then he was like, well, you have to make money or else I'm gonna kill you.
[110:40] A: Oh, okay.
[110:41] B: So thus continued the saga of me making money for him.
[110:44] A: You are really good at making money for other people.
[110:46] B: I really am. Like, God, if I had half the money that I had, I'd be a millionaire.
[110:52] A: I mean, it's crazy.
[110:54] B: Like, I think about the amount of money I could have.
[110:57] A: It's crazy. Making money for. Not you. No, for them. Yeah. I mean, shouldn't the person that's doing all the work get, like, the higher percentage.
[111:06] B: Thank you.
[111:08] A: Like at least a 50. 50 split here.
[111:10] B: Something.
[111:11] A: And, like, you take care of, like, travel and room expenses and food, like.
[111:15] B: But I gotta take care of that, too, too. And the drugs. God. And I didn't buy cheap.
[111:25] A: Yeah, right. Crazy. So you can remember him doing that? Yeah. You can remember him hitting you and joking. You can remember putting on your jeans?
[111:37] B: Yeah, but I'm not putting on my jeans.
[111:39] A: Right, well, then stop him from doing that. But he.
[111:41] B: He's not doing that.
[111:42] A: So then where is it? Satan no longer exists.
[111:44] B: It no longer exists.
[111:45] A: That's right. And again, as you think of that, what do you notice?
[111:49] B: Like, it's not. Doesn't make me as anxious or as fearful.
[111:52] A: Yeah. Well, is it fearful at all? I try to be afraid of it.
[111:56] B: No, no.
[112:02] A: I just. I just think of like a six shooter.
[112:05] B: Okay.
[112:06] A: Right. Like that kind of gun he had, like, you know, like, with a. Yeah.
[112:09] B: It had like the extendo on it.
[112:11] A: Ooh, even better.
[112:12] B: Yeah.
[112:14] A: Clip on thing.
[112:15] B: Yeah.
[112:16] A: Nice.
[112:17] B: Yeah.
[112:19] A: Secret agent.
[112:21] B: That be so cool.
[112:23] A: Well, I'm a big man. If I carry a gun with my extendo. You got to see what I extend down there then. Right.
[112:35] B: Just overcompensating for something.
[112:38] A: Right, Exactly. Farqua, again. Ah. Seems to be over compensating. Yeah. Right. Ah. So again, as you're checking in, what do you notice for yourself?
[112:55] B: Calm. It doesn't bother me. It's not like.
[112:58] A: Yeah. And even as we think back. Back earlier, younger. You. Mm. What's a moment that comes to mind?
[113:10] B: When I was eight with my cousin.
[113:12] A: You're eight with your cousin? You're where?
[113:15] B: We're in, like, a play attic at my grandfather's house.
[113:18] A: Yeah. Good job. So you're like, upstairs in the attic. Would you like to come into the attic? Right. And it's you and your cousin. Your cousin.
[113:26] B: Yeah. Max.
[113:27] A: Oh, I thought it was going to be Ben. All right, so you're in the. You're up in the attic with Max.
[113:33] B: Uhhuh.
[113:33] A: That's right.
[113:34] B: Yeah.
[113:34] A: And you guys are playing house. Yeah, house. Right.
[113:37] B: Like any normal.
[113:38] A: Of course. Right. Good job. Let's play house. Okay, we'll play house. I'll be the mommy.
[113:43] B: Exactly.
[113:43] A: You be the daddy. Exactly. Right. So he's the daddy, you're the mommy. Right. Then what happened next?
[113:48] B: And then he's like.
[113:48] A: He pissle whip bacon.
[113:53] B: Then he took me into like this like. Because it was like an attic, but it was sectioned, so there was a bed in the other room.
[113:59] A: Nice. Good job. Well, you know what mommies and daddies do in this room, right? So he took you into that room. Yeah.
[114:03] B: And then locked the door because for some reason there's a padlock on the door.
[114:07] A: Oh. Even not just a lock lock. Like a locket. Like a padlock that you gotta.
[114:11] B: Like, like the slide one.
[114:13] A: Yeah. Nice.
[114:16] B: Like, now that I look back on that, why was there a padlock on the bed? That's weird.
[114:23] A: I don't want anybody to be in the attic. Right.
[114:25] B: Who was in there?
[114:26] A: Uh huh.
[114:28] B: Norma, what family secrets are there?
[114:37] A: Yeah. Yeah. Who is. Yeah. So you're in that room. Right. Then what happened?
[114:45] B: And then he was. He was. I don't even remember like how we got to this part, but like he was just.
[114:51] A: But you got on the bed.
[114:52] B: No, he pushed me in the closet.
[114:54] A: So he pushed me in the closet. Right?
[114:55] B: Yeah, because there was a closet in that room too.
[114:57] A: Good job.
[114:58] B: This is like a really big attic.
[115:00] A: Yes. So you got pushed in the closet.
[115:01] B: Yeah. And then he had a puppet out of his hand, was filling me up.
[115:03] A: With the puppet, and he said, Mr. Puppet, my tooth touch puppy me hot puppet. And that was weird. Some of it might have tickled, but it was weird.
[115:18] B: It was weird because it was a dog and it was.
[115:20] A: Oh, it was a dog. It's just weird, right? Have any peanut butter? Right. And then what happened next? So he's touching your body in the closet and then it just.
[115:35] B: I don't remember like anything in between it.
[115:37] A: Right.
[115:38] B: I just blacked out. And then I woke up and I went downstairs and continued to just.
[115:42] A: And then you left the attic.
[115:44] B: Yeah.
[115:44] A: Yeah. Then you're downstairs. Mm.
[115:47] B: Eating bread.
[115:48] A: Right. Maybe a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. So we got being downstairs eating bread. Naan. Non.
[115:58] B: I was so confident that it was naan.
[116:00] A: And then I was like, no, it's not naan. Right. And then he had been touching your body and then he threw you in the closet. And then you went in the room. Then he locked the. Well. Yeah. Then he had locked the door.
[116:13] B: Yeah.
[116:15] A: And then you were in the other room and then you were playing house, and then you guys had gone up to play. You kids go have fun. Okay, I will. Straight fun.
[116:26] B: Apparently, this is what mommy and daddies do.
[116:28] A: I guess. I don't know, because my mom and dad got divorced. The fuck I got. What the fuck do I know? Mommy, when you were. Did daddy used to play with puppets with you? What? How did you know about dad? Stach. No, no. Your father likes young women. Oh, okay.
[116:51] B: Young Russian women.
[116:52] A: Well, yes. He needs to have brides that aren't from year that are very, very dependent on him. Yeah, until they get independent, and then he doesn't want them anymore.
[117:02] B: Catch 22. Got to order more. Well, right, or the one gets old, and you don't want the old brides.
[117:10] A: You got with you.
[117:13] B: What are the wrinkles?
[117:15] A: All right, we got you here. I mean, this was your payment to get here.
[117:19] B: Toodaloo.
[117:20] A: That's right. Would you like some water? Yeah. So think about the thing with fuzzing. What do you notice now?
[117:33] B: It's not as intense.
[117:35] A: Yeah. You can remember him doing that, right? You can remember putting your cardigan on. Stop putting on your cardigan from touching lips. So then where is it? Say it doesn't exist.
[117:49] B: It doesn't exist.
[117:50] A: And again, him doing that, did that have anything to do with you? But it felt that way. Yeah. Right. So close your eyes and let her know it's over, finished. It no longer exists. That happening had nothing to do with me. Had everything to do with what was off in him. Right? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. It wasn't me. It was the puppet. Okay, sure. Mm. Right? Your hand wasn't in it. No, no, no. The puppet did it all by itself. Okay. Right.
[118:24] B: Yeah.
[118:24] A: Right. And again, what are you noticing now?
[118:28] B: Like, still at calm days.
[118:29] A: Yeah.
[118:30] B: As we're talking about more. It's not. It's getting easier.
[118:34] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[118:35] B: Yeah.
[118:35] A: Right. And see, there may be stuff that has nothing to do with sexual stuff, but other stuff that you got told or said or made to feel or that we also want to clear. Because here's the thing about any negative experience that we go through. They get stuck in the same way. They get stuck because part of the brain doesn't know it's over. And the meaning that gets attached makes me feel worse about me. Right. So there's been times around all of that where there's, like, some stuff where I didn't feel as good as. Or lovable or worthy or smart as. Or somehow I should have been more. And again, you already Told me.
[119:06] B: Sh.
[119:07] A: Don't look at the part. Right. Oh, you're on the phone. Oh, sweetheart. Why don't you just get off? I've been on the phone for a whole. Trying to get. No, no, no. We have people coming. We have people coming. Yeah. Oh, fuck the people. No, we have people coming.
[119:26] B: Oh, do we now?
[119:27] A: Right. Oh, you mean my stuff isn't important? No, you have to show off. Right. Wear your cardigan. Hello, people. I come from very hungry people. Yeah, right. What are you noticing now?
[119:47] B: It's not. It doesn't make me as angry. Like, it's not.
[119:51] A: Yeah. Yeah. Well, is there anger there?
[119:55] B: No.
[119:55] A: Huh. Isn't that weird? Yeah, it was.
[119:58] B: Yeah.
[119:58] A: Now it's not.
[119:59] B: It's like, why would. Why. But.
[120:01] A: Yeah, yeah. But even if you take that back, Right. Thinking about whatever incident happened with that advocate. Right. So you've been on the phone trying to get this thing handled. Yeah. Don't worry about.
[120:16] B: Doesn't matter if you can breathe or not.
[120:18] A: We're showing you off.
[120:21] B: I should have started having, like, an asthma attack right there.
[120:23] A: Right?
[120:26] B: It does matter.
[120:32] A: Put on your best wedding dress. No. Right, right, right. But see, we want to get those things cleared too.
[120:41] B: Okay?
[120:42] A: Right. Because there was different stuff that happened that even led you to run away. Mm. Right. Different experiences. Was stepdad, like when you were like, nine?
[120:55] B: Yeah, nine.
[120:56] A: That's when he. Nine. Yeah, that's what I thought you had said. He came to be with you all at nine?
[121:02] B: Yeah.
[121:02] A: Didn't they, like, run a school? Church thing?
[121:04] B: He runs a church at a school.
[121:09] A: Well, that. That.
[121:10] B: It's a nice trife.
[121:12] A: Cool about that. Is that you get lots of access to little children. I have a puppet. Would you like to see my puppet?
[121:24] B: Yeah.
[121:26] A: Watch. It can move. Oh, and it grows when you touch it. What? This is weird. Oh, no. This is part of your education. Okay.
[121:36] B: Sex in uncomfortable.
[121:41] A: But those kinds of messages. We want to get those things cleared too. Okay. So what's a moment that's coming to mind?
[121:49] B: Like, you have, like, my mom always being worried about how I looked or what I was wearing, or my dad always wondering, wanting me to work out so that I would look better.
[122:01] A: Yeah. So let's think of a time.
[122:03] B: Okay.
[122:03] A: Whether it be mom or dad.
[122:05] B: Okay. Okay.
[122:07] A: Got it. You might have been how old I.
[122:09] B: Was probably about, like 13.
[122:11] A: Thirteen, right. Good job. Right. And you're in the Going through puberty, which is always the most comfortable time of life.
[122:19] B: It was like, door, the explorer haircut, awesome. With glasses and braces.
[122:29] A: Oh, better. There's no acne.
[122:31] B: I didn't really have acne.
[122:32] A: Good, good.
[122:34] B: But I have, like, the school uniform going for me, too, to, like, just add to the awkwardness of it.
[122:38] A: Beautiful. Right? Oh. And then weird shit happening with my body. Yeah, right? Yeah. Cramps. What are those things? I never had those before. Heating pad. All sorts of weird shit. Right?
[122:51] B: Yeah.
[122:51] A: So you're where. What happened?
[122:54] B: I'm at my mom's house.
[122:55] A: You're at mom's house? Good job.
[122:56] B: She called me fat.
[122:58] A: And you're where, like, in the kitchen?
[123:00] B: I'm in my room.
[123:01] A: And I was like, so you're in the room with a pile of Oreos?
[123:06] B: No, I just, like, tried on a shirt and I was like, mom, can I wear this? Can I wear this outfit?
[123:09] A: Right. So you put the shirt on and she goes, you look fat. You look fat. Good job, good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[123:15] B: I'm like, alright, well, I'm never wearing that shirt again.
[123:18] A: Cool. Throw that one away.
[123:20] B: Yeah. So then I was like, what should I wear?
[123:22] A: Right. Good job. Well, anything that can cover up.
[123:24] B: Yeah.
[123:25] A: Right?
[123:26] B: Yeah.
[123:26] A: And then what happened next?
[123:28] B: That was it.
[123:29] A: Right. Well, that's what.
[123:30] B: But that was that message.
[123:31] A: But notice how it stopped at the worst spot. Mm. Right. What might have happened is you got clothes on and went somewhere else.
[123:37] B: I mean, I might have just gone naked to the store.
[123:41] A: Right. Oh, you think so?
[123:44] B: My beached whaleness is coming. There's a little girl one time that had it on the back of her legs. Wide, low tattoo.
[124:01] A: That's somebody owning it. That is somebody owning it.
[124:05] B: The best part was that she wasn't even, like, thick or wide at all. It was great.
[124:09] A: Even better.
[124:13] B: Pink, black.
[124:15] A: Oh, so perfect. Yeah. Awesome. You were doing some thinking if you put that on. Yep.
[124:27] B: Yeah. That was a great tattoo.
[124:32] A: So again, think about mom saying that. Right. And again, that you thought that mom saying that meant stuff about you. What do we know now about girls who are going through puberty?
[124:47] B: They gain weight, their weight fluctuates.
[124:49] A: Right. It's all awkward stuff.
[124:51] B: Mm.
[124:52] A: Right. That it wouldn't have mattered other's you or somebody else. Right. Were we learning anything about you? This is. Right. Notice how it feels like it is. But we weren't learning about you. We were learning about her. Mm. Right. Even if somebody says, that's a really pretty cardigan, and you go, oh, this old thing, that's when somebody gets. They're uncomfortable with the compliment because they think the compliment is about them. Mm. But the person who's giving the Compliment. The compliment isn't actually about you. It's about them. And if you say to them this old thing, what you're really telling them is you're a stupid fucking moron for thinking that this looks good. Because it's never about you. It's always about them. We don't actually learn about ourselves in interactions with other people. We always learn about them and their thoughts or their opinions about me, but I don't actually learn about me. Right. But again, back then, because it was your mom, like, mom could have said, oh, no, that doesn't look good on you.
[126:02] B: Mm. Okay.
[126:04] A: Right. Versus, oh, my goodness, you're fat. Fatty, fatty. Two by four, you can get through the door.
[126:11] B: Wide loaf.
[126:13] A: Right. I've got a great tattoo for you, sweetheart. More pushing for the cushion. I'm pushing for the right. I mean, so as we think about it now, right, Close your eyes, think back to that younger you and let her know that that moment is over, that it no longer exists, and that mom saying that it had everything to do with whatever was going on in mom. That. That you wasn't thinking, that it was a complaint or view on your body. It was you. But see, that was something about mom, not you at all. Let the youth know how you're becoming even more comfortable in you now. Right. So that she gets it. Right. And as you're getting it, what do you notice now?
[127:02] B: It doesn't have as much effect on you.
[127:04] A: Right. By the way, was it difficult to get, as you put it, clients?
[127:09] B: No.
[127:10] A: Oh, it wasn't hard, was it? No, not at all, was it? No. They weren't going, oh, you know, your mom said back, no.
[127:24] B: No.
[127:24] A: Right. Isn't that weird?
[127:26] B: Yeah. But they probably just wanted me for my body and not how I actually looked.
[127:32] A: They wanted you for your body? Right. How your body looked, I mean, I guess. Well, that's what they're going for.
[127:41] B: True.
[127:46] A: The thing that we know about life and people is that people have different preferences.
[127:50] B: Yeah.
[127:51] A: So not everybody thinks one thing is attractive. Everybody's got what we'll call a sexual template. A template is what you find appealing, erotic, desirable, arousing. Right. We hear the general terms. Or I'm a butt guy, I'm a boob guy, I like blondes, I like brunettes. But it can be a wide range of things that go on. Right. Templates fit in age categories.
[128:18] B: Yeah.
[128:19] A: You know, so there's all sorts of stuff. Right, right. It didn't, like, you know, prevent anything. The guy didn't come over and go, oh, yeah, Well, I would have, but. No, no. Right, right. Guy's like, okay, good. You're already done. Yeah, no, I'm fast. Got it. Just like that. Wow. All right, well, cool. No, I needed that beforehand, so. Right, yeah. Take them long. No, that's right. Right.
[129:02] B: Not at all.
[129:03] A: Not at all. No. Right. Cool. All right, good. Yeah.
[129:05] B: All right.
[129:06] A: Goodbye. Yep. See you. Thanks. Yeah.
[129:08] B: Want to get a discount like that? I paid for an hour.
[129:11] A: No, no, it's like going to the dentist. I mean, if you're going to get the cavity out and the guy said it's going to take three hours or the guy can get it out in 30 minutes, charge the same thing. Yeah, my fault.
[129:23] B: No, my fault at all.
[129:26] A: Clearly I did my job. Right. Right. Yeah. So even as you think back about the mom thing now, what do you notice?
[129:40] B: It's not as heavy.
[129:42] A: Yeah.
[129:42] B: It's not about me.
[129:43] A: Right. And kind of flip it around to something with dad.
[129:48] B: Okay.
[129:49] A: Right. What's the time? You might have been.
[129:52] B: My dad was always yelling at me because I didn't necessarily want to do sports. And so he wanted me to be fitter and healthier and I wanted to eat Snickers.
[130:03] A: Yeah. Well, so you might have been where, at his house?
[130:05] B: Yeah.
[130:06] A: Right.
[130:07] B: Yeah.
[130:08] A: Would it have been like after school or weekend after school?
[130:11] B: Because I was on the cross country, track, soccer and swimming team.
[130:14] A: Oh, okay.
[130:21] B: And I just decided not to go to any of those after school.
[130:25] A: Right.
[130:26] B: Because I already went to swimming that morning. At 4:00 in the morning before I went to school.
[130:30] A: Right. So it's like, I'm just not gonna go today.
[130:33] B: Yeah.
[130:33] A: And dad was mad, Right. Cause you're home, tired, exhausted. Right. I had a long day already. Started early before it was light out. Yeah, right. Did you swim early today, dad?
[130:48] B: Basically.
[130:48] A: Right. So he's like, patterson, come on.
[130:51] B: You gotta be dedicated to your sport.
[130:52] A: You gotta be dedicated to your sport. Right. Good job.
[130:54] B: Yeah.
[130:54] A: Right. Then when have ax.
[130:56] B: It was just.
[130:57] A: Or I don't have to do a monologue.
[131:00] B: Yeah. Just was a lot of yelling back and forth.
[131:02] A: So he's yelling at you and then you're like, no, I don't want to go as higher. I already went swimming. Yeah, right. Then what happened next?
[131:08] B: I was like, alright, fine, I'll go tomorrow. Or I'll be more. Whatever. Whatever makes you happy.
[131:13] A: Right. So notice again that you was feeling him being that way was about you not doing it. Right. Not doing it enough. But who was the one that was doing the activities? Me. Right, Right. We want you to do the activities because you enjoy the activity. Activities. In doing those activities, does it require a little effort and work? Yeah. Yes. But we want it to be fun, enjoyable. Right. Like, I played basketball as a kid and I would go out on my own and shoot hoops.
[131:45] B: Mm.
[131:47] A: Nobody went get out there and start shooting.
[131:49] B: Yeah.
[131:50] A: Nope. Do layups now. Nope. Do. Because that would make me probably not want to.
[131:54] B: Exactly.
[131:55] A: But I went and did it myself. Right. Right. So again, that whole demanding stuff with dad had it feel like I couldn't do. Right.
[132:06] B: Couldn't do anything. Right.
[132:07] A: Or I wasn't as good as dad wanted me to be. But again, that happening, did that have anything to do with you?
[132:13] B: No.
[132:14] A: Being good enough. Right. Had everything to do with what was off with dad. Right? Yeah. You didn't know that then?
[132:23] B: No.
[132:24] A: So again, you can remember dad doing that?
[132:25] B: Yeah.
[132:26] A: Right. You can remember putting on your sandals. Well, then stop that from yelling at you.
[132:30] B: He's not yelling at me.
[132:31] A: Yeah. So then where is it? Say no longer exists. Right. And again, close your eyes and think back to the you then letting her know, over, finished, no longer exists. Dad being that way had everything to do with what was often, dad, it's not about me. Let that equal you know that she's good enough for you. Let her know who she's becoming. Let her know about her love for books. Let her know putt puzzles. Let her know. Right. So that she gets it. And as that you's getting it, what do you notice now? Peace.
[133:11] B: And not like the resentment and that.
[133:13] A: Yeah.
[133:15] B: Anger. Like, what do I have to do?
[133:18] A: Because we're interested in you being good enough for you. Right? Yeah. Yeah. And when we think back, look at all of the things that you've gone through, move through and overcome. Right. Whether it be abuse, sexual stuff, violence, drugs, all sorts of things you're now on the other side of.
[133:43] B: I don't know how, but I am.
[133:46] A: Right. Well, I mean, it was that friend that you saw. Yeah, right. That got you to the hospital.
[133:57] B: Yeah.
[133:58] A: Right. That then started to change things. Because after the hospital, what happened?
[134:03] B: Well, I was in the hospital for two months, Right.
[134:06] A: A long time.
[134:07] B: A very long time. Because I had endocrinitis and septic embolism and heart infection and double lung infection.
[134:17] A: Right. Fucking bruise. Pranked.
[134:29] B: And he gave me a death threat in the hospital. Because Bruce did. Yeah.
[134:33] A: Oh, good. Because how did you do that?
[134:35] B: Because when she called, she said it was an abuse case or whatever.
[134:39] A: Yes.
[134:39] B: So that the police would come and interview me in the hospital.
[134:42] A: Good job.
[134:43] B: And at the time I was just like, sick. And I was like, I don't want to hear this crap. Like, whatever. But I guess it. Bruce was mad because I got away from him. And so he was thinking that I.
[134:53] A: Was calling the cops, which got it. Sort of was. Right.
[134:57] B: And so he threatened to kill me. So then I had.
[134:59] A: How did you find out?
[135:00] B: Through my phone.
[135:01] A: So he had texted you.
[135:03] B: Yeah.
[135:04] A: I'm gonna fucking kill you.
[135:05] B: And then it was a phone call.
[135:07] A: White girl.
[135:11] B: Snowflake.
[135:12] A: Snowflake. Better. I love it. So good.
[135:27] B: I didn't even tell you. But Smooth named me.
[135:29] A: Oh.
[135:29] B: He had fine white china, so I was the finest. White pigeon town.
[135:34] A: Nice, huh? He is smooth. He is smooth.
[135:45] B: I get great names. I don't know.
[135:51] A: Right? Yeah. So he had texted you.
[135:54] B: Yeah. And then I didn't answer his text. He's like, call me. You know, like, whatever.
[135:58] A: Right.
[135:59] B: Then I was like, I'm not gonna like. Because I was trying to get him to bring me drugs.
[136:02] A: Because of course. Right. It's like, you know, I don't want to feel this.
[136:05] B: Yeah. And then he was like, I heard that you snitched me to the cops. I'm gonna kill you.
[136:12] A: Huh? On the phone, he's telling me.
[136:13] B: Yeah. He's like, what hospital are you in? And I was like, none your business.
[136:17] A: Well, I'm gonna tell you so that. Well. And I'm in room. Yes. So you can come and you want to kill. Okay. So I'm at this hospital in this room, and the nurses are only here between the hours of. So the best time for you to come and kill me would be.
[136:32] B: Yeah. So I didn't tell him. I told him.
[136:34] A: Such a surprise. He should have.
[136:36] B: Yeah, I know.
[136:36] A: Well, will you give me the drugs before you kill me or.
[136:39] B: Yeah, like, can I?
[136:40] A: Because I don't really want them after if I'm already dead. But maybe I'd want them be.
[136:45] B: Well.
[136:47] A: Right. Good.
[136:48] B: So then I, like, put. Got put on an alias. Like they just removed my name from the.
[136:54] A: They put different hair on now. I had blonde hair. It's like Jennifer Gardner alias.
[137:01] B: Yeah. They just put me underneath like Madison, Jane Doe. Yeah. Basically. So that. And then if he called or like asking for me, they wouldn't tell him that I was there.
[137:11] A: Right.
[137:12] B: So then Detective it came. This whole police report came across Detective Gardner, who, ah, got it was with Misty at the sting operation during the Super Bowl.
[137:22] A: Yes.
[137:23] B: So she told Misty what was going on and called my room phone.
[137:26] A: Yes.
[137:27] B: And said, hey, can we.
[137:28] A: I'm not Bruce. Thank you.
[137:31] B: I'm shit Sherlock.
[137:37] A: Yeah.
[137:38] B: And that's when Misty came back into my life and decided to go.
[137:41] A: Because you met her through the Super Bowl.
[137:44] B: The Super Bowl.
[137:44] A: Did you get seats next to each other? Go Bucks. Oh, no, it wasn't that.
[137:51] B: No, I met her through jail.
[137:54] A: Oh, because you got arrested during the Super Bowl?
[137:56] B: No, that was like 2018.
[137:58] A: Oh, met her in jail in 2018. Yeah.
[138:00] B: And she tried. She was like wanting me to come to a program. Well, I was in drug offender probation court. Whatever I was just doing just to get out of a prison sentence.
[138:08] A: That's right. Yeah. Oh, I have to do this instead of, okay, I'm gonna do this.
[138:12] B: But I never did it. And then I just kept re offending.
[138:14] A: Well, good. Right.
[138:15] B: So I got more charges. But yeah, so she. I met her then and she just kept following me around. When there was a sting in 2018, she was there.
[138:23] A: Got it. Okay. So. And then you didn't actually get arrested during the Super Bowl?
[138:27] B: No, cuz I told them I was gonna go to Salah.
[138:30] A: Oh, okay.
[138:32] B: But I just left the detox as soon as they dropped me off.
[138:34] A: Nice. Right? Because I didn't want to detox because I would feel uncomfortable. Yeah, Right. So I left. Yeah. Right.
[138:42] B: And my dictionary book full of drugs was because I had a dictionary safe.
[138:47] A: You had a dictionary safe? Yeah.
[138:48] B: So it looked like a dictionary. And then if you open it up.
[138:51] A: Like you carried a dictionary around with you.
[138:55] B: That had my drugs in it.
[138:57] A: I've got my dictionary and my Bible so I can look up the words because I don't always understand the words. That's why I know Cardigan, because I looked at the images. Websters. Yes.
[139:15] B: How did you know.
[139:19] A: Merriam Webster was a big drug addict?
[139:23] B: When we started building safe in their books.
[139:25] A: Oh my goodness.
[139:26] B: Makes so much sense.
[139:27] A: So they'll let you keep the dictionary? Yeah.
[139:29] B: Cause they thought it was an actual dictionary.
[139:30] A: Did you not think it was weird that this girl carried the dictionary around with her? Like, yeah, she's got this can of soda that doesn't seem like it's a little heavy for soda. Oh, well, I get it.
[139:47] B: Then you're like, why are you reading the dictionary? Yes. Yes, I am.
[139:53] A: You don't read dictionaries? I thought everybody did.
[139:56] B: Trying to learn a wordy day in my addiction. What are you.
[139:58] A: That's right. So awesome. Yeah. Yeah.
[140:05] B: So I knew that I still had my dictionary with me and I was like, I'm gonna go get high instead.
[140:08] A: Of going to detox.
[140:09] B: Why would I Do that.
[140:10] A: Right?
[140:11] B: Yeah.
[140:11] A: Right.
[140:12] B: And then I met her again in the hospital.
[140:15] A: Ah, right. So you're in the hospital.
[140:16] B: Yeah.
[140:17] A: Gardner calls.
[140:18] B: Yeah. She's like, hey, we're gonna come interview. And I'm like, okay, cool. Didn't really care. I was feeling like crap. No one bring me drugs. Couldn't get anyone to bring me drugs.
[140:29] A: Right.
[140:30] B: Couldn't really leave the hospital because that's how sick I was.
[140:33] A: I mean, right? Because you would have if you could have. Damn it.
[140:37] B: Of course. Detoxing off heroin with, like, a lung and heart infection. Great combo.
[140:42] A: Yeah. Yeah. But you did detox. Yeah, Right. Isn't it better to be now than then?
[140:49] B: Oh, yeah.
[140:50] A: Yeah.
[140:51] B: All day.
[140:51] A: Right. See, I wonder what would happen when you close your eyes and think back to the you who was in the hospital not feeling good at all and let her know how much better you are now. Not only that you don't have those infections and that that's all been healed, but that you're clear, clean, free from that stuff, that you're actually getting your mind back, having access to words like cardigan.
[141:17] B: Is that gonna be the word of the day now?
[141:18] A: It's just fun, isn't it?
[141:20] B: Better than sweater. It's got a nice root to it. Makes you feel fancy.
[141:26] A: That's what I was saying. I know. Fancy, big words. That's so awesome.
[141:40] B: Little things.
[141:41] A: Who would have thought that you can clear all this stuff up? Laughing, right?
[141:48] B: What if they told me this years ago?
[141:49] A: Like. Like, very different than emdr.
[141:51] B: Oh, my gosh.
[141:52] A: Very different than EMDR ended up in.
[141:54] B: A turtle suit because of emdr.
[141:55] A: Gotta be like, we can't, like, make fun of or be silly. Trauma is really difficult and heavy. So we have to also be serious.
[142:05] B: Serious and heavy.
[142:09] A: And then give, like, looks like, oh, you poor thing. Yeah. Notice how I didn't do that ever, right? Even as you're telling me you're being pistol whipped, I'm like, okay, I'm not going, oh, my goodness. Right? Because here's the thing that I know it sucked to have been pistol whipped then, but what's not sucky is being here with me, getting that I'm no longer being pistol whipped.
[142:38] B: Great concept, right?
[142:39] A: Like, I did a video one time and I had this guy and he was talking about how his brother's best friend anally raped him. And, you know, he goes. And then he, you know, did that. And I go, we did what? I go, what happened next? And he paused for a second. He goes, he fucked me in the ass. And my Response right after it was good job. Now people not knowing, watching the video, they all went, this guy is telling you about being anally raped. Just got fucked in the ass. And you go, good job. But the good job was at a different level when he was telling me it. He was being here, not there. So the good job was in response to, as you told me about the yucky thing. You're here. Mm. Oh. That's why it's getting better. Right? Because as you get to be silly, playful, light, you're also here with me. That this is what's happening and that stuff isn't. So when we hold two things that are at the same time, the higher order always emerges. That's why that stuff isn't troubling. Isn't that cool?
[143:52] B: Brain's crazy.
[143:53] A: It is, right? Because you can think about the different stuff.
[143:57] B: Yeah. Bothering.
[143:59] A: Right? Right.
[144:05] B: Some dragon coke.
[144:11] A: So good. Yeah, Right, Right. Is that causing that?
[144:15] B: No.
[144:16] A: Right.
[144:16] B: Just thinking about his really weird hairstyle that he used to have.
[144:18] A: Oh, even better.
[144:20] B: He was balding on top, but he had long hair.
[144:22] A: Ooh, that's hot. That is hot. Uh huh. Like so you got the big dome coming, but pull it back that way.
[144:32] B: And it's like thinning and frizzy.
[144:34] A: Oh, even better. I know what my mom saw in you.
[144:40] B: I have no clue. Definitely not money.
[144:43] A: That.
[144:46] B: Maybe it's Maybelline. Like.
[144:56] A: Such a good thing. Yeah. Right. So just notice. What do you notice about yourself now?
[145:03] B: Not as anxious.
[145:04] A: Yeah. Lighter. Yeah. Well, try to feel anxious now.
[145:10] B: I can't.
[145:11] A: It's not there. Right. Even thinking about the La quinta.
[145:18] B: La quinta, Quinta, however you pronounce it. Whatever you can tell I don't know.
[145:25] A: Spanish, right? Yeah. Notice how they're different. Yeah. Cool. Well, we're on our way. Yeah. And you'll notice even more because how. How you're going to notice what we've done isn't just that. Hey, wait a minute. When I think about that stuff, it doesn't bother me. But how you're also going to notice it is in different situations where normally I'd be feeling a little more. And I'm not. That's kind of cool. Or it might go on, but it goes off really quick. Huh. Normally I would have been in this thing for a long time and I'm not. I'm not. You're going to be reading other people stuff is being more about them, not me. So not everything's gonna be taken personally or taken heart. Make sense? Yeah. And then we'll get back together again.
[146:14] B: Okay.
[146:15] A: You did great today. Thank you. Good job.
[146:19] B: Thank you.
[146:20] A: My pleasure.
