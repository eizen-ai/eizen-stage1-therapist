[00:01] A: All right, so today is the 22nd of August, and Marjorie, this is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. That recording certainly will be made available to you. And given what we do is transformative and life changing for you, it may be made available in teaching and training professionals and how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes, yes. Okay, perfect. So what would be useful for me to know, to understand what's been going on? I got the whole thing that there's been lots of loss recently, but what else would be useful for me to know? And in actuality, nobody would care about any stuff that has if it wasn't somehow negatively impacting now?
[00:49] B: I don't know. I mean, do you want to know all the negative stuff that's happened in my life?
[00:56] A: What I want to know is what would you like to have different for you? Like if we could actually change problematic ways that you feel or think or act or react, what would you want different for you? Right. So some people are more edgy and irritable. They're more quick and short tempered, they're agitated. They don't like reacting in that way. They would like that to settle down. Some people are nervous, tense, anxious, they get racy thoughts, they have all sorts of like jitteriness, they're uneasy. Discomfort with other people mind is going way too fast. When they go to lay down at night, it's like it's on.
[01:32] B: That's me. That's the one. That's what I need to have gone. Like change.
[01:37] A: Yeah. So tell me more about how that happens for you. What is it that's been. Yeah, that would be great because that's what I'm saying. We want to have your life now work way better than it has been.
[01:49] B: So for me, that has kind of always been a part of me. It's always just kind of been. In the early years of my life, it was kind of like always feeling embarrassed about everything and then being shy and reclusive, so to speak. Just kind of not wanting to be a part of. Because it just feels so strange, you know, to be a part of outside life, you know what I mean? Like deal with people, you know. It's like I always felt like I was different and strange and you know, not really knowing how. Like my reactions would always be weird, you know, like how so, like, like not really getting it, you know what I mean? Like not really getting it or not really fitting in all the time. Just not Knowing how to conversate and communicate, you know what I mean, with people, and just always feeling like the fifth wheel or something like that. And it was just. I don't know, I was a strange childhood for me.
[02:56] A: So if I'm following you with that, it felt to you like you didn't quite fit.
[03:03] B: Right.
[03:03] A: You didn't think the same way or react always the same way. You kind of felt somewhat like an outcast or not like you were a part of. Right.
[03:13] B: Like, I was always trying to figure out what to say and how to react and how to fit in. Like, I just always felt so disconnected and just nervous. Like, I just always had this really nervous energy about me or just deep sadness inside of me. Like, this deep, deep sadness has always been there and just like, kind of trying to make it not be so apparent and fit in to whatever situation I'm in. It's just kind of been the.
[03:52] A: So if I'm following you with that. Because I want to make sure that I'm getting it, I'm following you. That there's been long standing. You can think back years, decades, to a deeper sadness inside. Not necessarily. I don't know exactly what that might be about, but that's kind of been there. And then when you were interacting with others, there was a lot of internal stuff going on about, what can I say? How can I fit in? A lot of, like, analyzing how I'm gonna do whatever I'm gonna do. And then in doing that, it created some awkwardness in some of the interactions because there was a lot of internal stuff not wanting to say necessarily the wrong thing or wanting to say the right thing to fit in. That was going on. Okay. So I'm following you. Yeah. Okay, cool. So we would like that to be a lot quieter inside. Yeah. And maybe even get it so that you're not spending much time thinking about you at all.
[04:50] B: That would be great, you know, if I could just be normal. You know what I mean? I didn't even know what normal is. You know, Know, in trying to be a part of the world of, you know, helping people, I need to get myself helped first. But, you know, I don't know. I don't know. I get stuck sometimes, and a lot of times I get lost because I have so much going on in here, and I forget what's going on out here. So I tend to forget a lot of stuff. And you know what I mean? Like, you know, sometimes Bob gets, like. He'll have a. He'll lose his train of thought. I get that so much that it's scary, you know, it's very scary. And I think that that's a part of the whole process that's kind of been going on with the internal talking or whatever's been going on inside of me is just kind of make. And with everything else, like all of the deaths that have happened and you know, just my life in general, you know, like, you know, just like I've been, I've been raped and you know, I've been moved around a lot as a kid and you know, I mean, just a lot of stuff that's going on in my life and you know, just kind of trying to make it all fit into wherever it's supposed to be in life so that I'm okay to be a part of. You know what I mean? Like, it just always feels like I'm reaching to fit that idea of what. That what I feel like you expect me to be. Does that make sense?
[06:35] A: So you're trying to guess over here what I might be thinking, right? And then you're trying to match whatever you think I might be thinking of how you're thinking you should be. That's a lot of work. That hurt is a lot of work.
[06:52] B: I know, it's terrible.
[06:53] A: It's terrible.
[06:54] B: And then coupled with, you know, just these deep, deep sad feelings and.
[07:01] A: How do you know when to feel that?
[07:02] B: Huh?
[07:03] A: How do you know when to feel it?
[07:04] B: When to feel sad?
[07:06] A: Well, the deep sad.
[07:07] B: I don't know, I just get sad sometimes and then I just. Sometimes just cry more. So lately though, because I. Because what I did coming up was I learned how to separate myself from the emotions. I learned how to disengage and let that be that and then me be me over here and just not and just kind of just take myself to another place mentally. And so, I don't know, just kind of like not be there. You know what I mean? Like whenever there's a bad situation going on, I just kind of learn how to just take myself out of it and just kind of be over here. Almost like an out of body experience. And that's carried me through a lot. But now I guess it's kind of like I need to get back in there, you know what I mean? And be a part of and deal with whatever the situations are that, you know, make me feel sad or, you know, depressed or nervous or, you know, tense or whatever the emotion is and you know, get it up and get it out so that I don't have to feel that way at all. Is this making sense at all.
[08:24] A: Well, it's interesting because you did the same thing. The therapist would tell you what you need to get it up and get it out as if it's somehow trapped inside of you.
[08:34] B: Well, see, because I feel like it's. It's just a part of my past. It's a part of my history. It's a kind of a part of my lifeline. And that somehow, if I can just figure out.
[08:46] A: See, there it is again. No, it's perfect, right? You go, it's part of my past, it's part of my history, and I know it. And if I can just figure out. That's the whole essence of it. Trying to figure out how to not feel certain ways about stuff that's happened. Because what you did to survive it or move through it was to kind of leave it there and kind of be separate from it as you kind of put it. That out of body thing. Right?
[09:18] B: Yeah.
[09:19] A: And then you said something about, well, I kind of need to be in it now.
[09:22] B: Yeah. Because some. Because a lot of times. Because right now it's like I'm almost to the point of being emotionless. Like, nothing really affects me the way it should. Like when I ought to be sad about a situation, I get nothing. You know, when I ought to be really happy and enjoying something, I'm getting nothing. You know, and it's like I need to go back to the.
[09:48] A: When the sad thing is going on or when the happy thing is going on. Are you finding yourself feeling like you're in that out of body state? Because it's really hard to feel.
[09:57] B: Yeah.
[09:57] A: When you're not in you. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I got it. But because there's been lots of yucky stuff, it's been better to not be in you than feel it.
[10:07] B: Right.
[10:09] A: Okay. But then you. No, not at all. But then you've been realizing, well, I'm not feeling things. Like I'm thinking I probably should. So when I should be, like happy and feeling really great, I'm not. When something would make sense to be sad about, I'm not.
[10:27] B: Right.
[10:27] A: And that's weird.
[10:28] B: It is. It's very weird.
[10:31] A: Yeah, to me. Right. Okay. Okay. So we got a whole bunch of stuff that has happened that although it's over, it's still underneath the surface affecting you. I got that there were multiple moves that happened throughout your life, and I got that in order to deal with really difficult stuff, you were able to put it over there and kind of be like out of body as it was going on. Cool. Okay, so I'm following you with that, too. And I know what to do to get that thing to be adjusted. Okay, so then the other question goes back to. And it's weird because nobody asks it in this way, but how do you know? Because if you're not feeling happy or sad, how do you know when to feel the deep sad?
[11:17] B: It just comes.
[11:19] A: Where does it come from?
[11:20] B: It just comes from inside. And all of a sudden, I'm sad, and I want to just cry. And sometimes I will just cry and get it out. And you know how they say, well.
[11:30] A: Where might you be when it happens?
[11:32] B: I could be anywhere, you know, I could be just driving down the road. I could be just, you know, sitting in a chair. And then.
[11:39] A: Does it feel like it's coming up?
[11:40] B: Yeah.
[11:40] A: Oh, it does. And then you start to. Well up.
[11:43] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[11:44] A: And you're not even sure what you're sad about?
[11:46] B: Sometimes I'm not. And then sometimes I'm. I could be. Sometimes I'm really not sure because there's so much to be sad about. Like, am I sad about this or am I sad about that? Or am I, you know, is it everything all together? I don't know. It's just sad, you know, Sad, depressed, you know, Just. Don't.
[12:07] A: Just.
[12:08] B: Lately, it's just kind of been like that place where you just don't want to be. You know what I mean? Like, I just don't want to get up in the morning. I don't want to do this. Like, I'm at the place of just forcing myself and doing the minimal thing to. To. To. To just make it through the day, you know, and it's like. It's so difficult just getting up and, you know, doing the things that are necessary to get to just get to work, you know, get up, get a shower, take a. You know, get your baby ready, you know, eat some food, drink coffee, whatever, you know, it's all such a chore, you know? And, I mean, life is just like a chore, you know?
[12:55] A: I know.
[12:56] B: And then, you know, and then these. I don't know. And, like, with the job that I have now, it's what I've always wanted since I went into treatment and I came out and I've been doing all this stuff and doing all this research and trying to, you know, figure out how to get into this, you know. You know, addictions field and whatever, and I've never been able to break into it. And then all of a sudden, bam, here it is. And I should be ecstatic. And I should be, you know, just like able to just run and do and go and be and enjoy. And it's like, okay, I'm here now, but whatever. You know what I mean? It's. And I don't like it. I want to be happy in what I'm doing and I want to want more, I want to learn more and I want to. Want to grow more. You know what I mean? But right now it's like I'm just like, I'm tired. I'm tired and emotionally drained, I guess. And I'm emotionless, but I'm emotional. I mean, it's crazy. I don't get it. So I don't know.
[14:05] A: You're doing a great job so far of making a lot of sense.
[14:09] B: Yeah.
[14:09] A: Yeah, right. That's where it's been off is you have wanted to do what you're doing and you've been thinking, because now I finally am. I should be feeling great, happy, light, upbeat, easy going. And for me, I'm like forcing myself. I'm like tired. It's like a weight. It's hard to just get up and out and do the basics to get myself out the freaking door.
[14:46] B: Yep, that's it.
[14:48] A: Okay. Okay. And that stuff has been weighing very.
[14:53] B: Much, so I can't even. It's like when I'm talking to people it's like, I really don't want to hear your problems right now, you know, it's like I just, I really don't want to. I don't want to be here right now. I don't want to hear what you have to say. But I'm gonna do my best to make you, you know, help you get to where you need or want to be, you know?
[15:14] A: Okay.
[15:15] B: But it's like I'm being so fake, you know? So like I'm just being so fake and I just want to be okay. You know what I mean? I want somebody to be.
[15:27] A: So not only do you have all this going on and it's such a struggle for you to do it, you're also like down on yourself.
[15:35] B: Yeah, yeah.
[15:38] A: And I'm so not only is there so much weight and you're doing it, you're like frustrated at you for how you're doing it. Oh man. Alright, so we'd like that to lighten up. Yeah, yeah, yeah. To get the weight off you or at least you're out from under it all so that you can be a lot lighter and maybe a little easier on you.
[16:02] B: Yeah.
[16:03] A: And a little more easy going and that it doesn't take so much energy. Because that's the other part that's been going on. Right. The constant evaluating. Am I doing what I'm thinking they would be wanting me to be doing? There's a lot of, like, internal conversation.
[16:21] B: Right. Right. And then, you know what? I feel like it's so. I feel like it's gotten to. Because I used to be able to, like, pull it off really well and be, you know, like. But now it's like it's. It's noticeable. It's true.
[16:35] A: It's.
[16:36] B: It's like, you know, it's like when I'm talking with someone, it's like they can notice that something's wrong, not right. You know what I mean? With me, you know, instead of it being. Instead of. You know how when you talk and you are. You might be sad inside, but you're trying to speak with someone in a happy way, but it translates as sadness or bitterness or anger, and I'm not even real because. Okay, so say, for instance, when I go to my NA meetings.
[17:09] A: Yeah.
[17:10] B: And I share. Right. And I'm thinking, I'm sharing happy. I'm sharing good. I'm sharing whatever. And then when. When I'm done, it's like, I'm getting. It's gonna be okay, you know, You. It's. You know, and they're talking to me as if I just shared the worst story ever, you know? And it's like, it'll get better. You know, I'm like, what? It's not. That didn't translate as good to you? What. What did I say? You know? So it's like, I don't know where this is kind of leading to as far as all this baggage that I'm carrying or whatever it is.
[17:47] A: But you're not carrying it, by the way. Okay.
[17:50] B: Is it just following me?
[17:52] A: No, it's been having a hold of you. See, the idea of if I'm carrying it or if I'm holding it, and I could easily let it go. This has been a challenge to let go of. What if you're not carrying it? What if you're not holding it? What if instead it's had a hold of you and not because your brain is out to get you or want you to feel weighted and heavy and down, but because there's a glitch. Right. There's some errors and misfires happening in the way that your brain has been working. Okay. Yeah. And then with the. The recent, like, loss stuff, has that been more recent? Like, how.
[18:39] B: What, My mother passed away in may.
[18:42] A: This past.
[18:43] B: May 19th.
[18:45] A: Okay.
[18:46] B: My husband passed away April 18th, one day after my birthday day in 2016.
[18:53] A: Oh, boy. And that was a great birthday.
[18:59] B: I said, well, at least it wasn't on my birthday.
[19:04] A: Sorry. That like, sucky. That's why people have such hard times with holidays. Cuz people make it to the holiday and then they die. And I'm just like, I hate this holiday now. Right. All right, so we got that. Those two were recent. Yeah.
[19:21] B: And then my best friend, the only. Because I've always been such an introvert and I really talk to people. She was the only friend that I really could talk to and be with and, you know, kind of give all my stuff to. She died a year before my husband.
[19:38] A: Okay.
[19:38] B: In 2015. And then my son, my 23 year old son at the time was murdered in 2013, three days after his birthday.
[19:51] A: Holy cow.
[19:52] B: Yeah, no shit.
[19:54] A: While you've got a hell of a lot of weight on you. My goodness. All right.
[19:59] B: Yeah, a lot.
[20:02] A: Yeah. Not to mention all the other crap that happened earlier in life. Mm.
[20:06] B: Yeah. Not to mention it was a really bad marriage.
[20:09] A: Oh. And then it was.
[20:12] B: The last two years were great. You know, we reconnected because he was using. You know what I mean, and he was dealing with his demons and I was trying to get, you know, my life together and, you know, it was just horrible. But the last two years were good. You know, we traveled a lot and we, you know, he stopped using and we were gonna, you know, conquer the world. We were gonna just do great things. And then he got cancer. Yeah. So it was rough.
[20:42] A: Yeah. Yeah. And you were there for all that. Yeah. So we definitely want to lighten the load on all of that stuff because that's quite heavy.
[20:53] B: Yep.
[20:54] A: Yeah. Okay. Any other stuff.
[20:59] B: I mean, that you.
[21:01] A: Think would be useful for me to know, to understand how things have been and what you've been going through and.
[21:07] B: Well, all through my childhood, because my mom had drug issues and she dropped me off a lot to different relatives house as a small child. So I was raped and molested often.
[21:23] A: Okay.
[21:24] B: And.
[21:33] A: Well, that's why you develop that superpower.
[21:37] B: I'm taking myself out of this.
[21:39] A: That's how you develop the superpower. I don't need to be there for what's going on in my body. I'll be somewhere else. I'll come back when that's over. Do you know that that's what happens? Like that superpower is something that human beings can develop, but it's the same thing that happens with an Animal. Right. In a predator, prey chasing. Like rabbits being chased down by fox. There will be a moment when rabbit sees no exits and that rabbit gets the wisdom that death is inevitable. It's not going to get away. I'm getting tired. It's not within range to catch me yet, but there's no way for me to get away. And there will be a moment when that happens that the rabbit will stop and the body of the rabbit will be completely still. And it's moments before fox ever catches. The rabbit stops. It's completely still. In that moment, rabbit's brain takes rabbit away. So that rabbit doesn't need to be there to experience what's happening to the body. So for people. This is my experience with working with lots of people. If there have been multitudes of things, then, yeah, I might have been there for the first part of. But then I learned to go away and I have to be there for what was going on with my body.
[22:56] B: Yeah.
[22:57] A: Yeah. So that's certainly been a superpower.
[23:01] B: Yes, I guess.
[23:03] A: Well, I mean, better than being there for a while.
[23:05] B: Yeah.
[23:05] A: Right. We have to choose. Right. So we just want to get the impact that all that stuff has had going. And do you have any particular kind of like, beliefs around what happens when people die that provide any kind of comfort?
[23:22] B: Yeah, I mean, I feel like angels come get them and take them to heaven. Yeah, I feel like.
[23:31] A: Have you ever sensed them with you, like your best friend or son or husband, mom, or any of that?
[23:36] B: Yeah, I have. I have more so lately than in times past, but.
[23:43] A: Okay.
[23:43] B: Yeah, I think that with my mom, she might be more with me than the others have been.
[23:49] A: Okay. Yeah. So sometimes you get a sense of that. So I have some thoughts on that topic that I think will be useful and helpful. But before we go into that, any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know? Because with what you've told me so far, I'm getting really excited. I'm getting really excited because you're gonna make a really big difference getting me out from under all that stuff so that you're a heck of a lot lighter and easier on you. And then you get all the resources because you have to be an amazingly. A strong, powerful, resilient, resourceful woman to have gone through what you've gone through, gotten yourself off drugs and dealt with what you've dealt with, and actually have a heart to make a difference for others. So that's, like, amazing. And I'm way into doing anything that I can to. To get you to Be lighter and a lot easier.
[24:48] B: Good, good. Thank you. I'm glad you're excited. I'm excited too now. But as far as anything else is concerned, I don't think so. Just kind of, you know, that outsidey feeling that I've always had, I just kind of don't want that.
[25:11] A: Yeah. What I would say is that we want to get it inside so that you're not spending much if any time at all thinking about you.
[25:23] B: Yeah. Yes.
[25:24] A: Right. Or trying to figure out, you know what I mean? Like it's like that's what I'm understanding.
[25:29] B: Okay.
[25:30] A: Right. We want like you've been trying to match what you think might be going on over there and you're not even sure whether it is.
[25:37] B: Right.
[25:38] A: That's really hard to do.
[25:41] B: Develop some type of telepathy or something.
[25:43] A: Well, I mean, masterful mind reading, you gotta be. But that's really hard to always get it right. So that's where we want to get this thing shifted around. So that instead of being self conscious, you're not thinking much about you at all. That instead you're more outwardly focused. And that if interactions happen over there with other people, it's not learning anything about you identity. It's just learning about ways that they're thinking or feeling and maybe some thoughts and feelings they have about you, but not learning anything about you. Right. That's where we want that to get shifted. A lot of what you said you've been relating to the way that you felt. The embarrassment at times, the anxious feelings, the nervous, the self conscious stuff, you've been actually relating to it as if it's a part of you. Which is interesting because what if it's not actually a part of you? See, what happens with people frequently is we confuse our thoughts and our feelings and our behaviors as qualities, characteristics, attributes, traits, or even worse, identity. So if a woman comes in and she walks in the door and she says, hi, my name is Sally, I'm five foot two and I'm shy. If Sally is thinking about her shyness in the same way she relates to her height, can she change it?
[27:28] B: No.
[27:29] A: No. But is her shyness the same thing as her height?
[27:34] B: No.
[27:35] A: No. It is a way that she feels and it does affect how she thinks and acts, but it's not a part of who she is. Right, Got it.
[27:46] B: Yes, I get it.
[27:47] A: Yeah. So it's been problematic ways that you find yourself thinking and healing, but it's never been a part of you. Therefore we're not actually changing you, we're Just adjusting glitches and errors in the way your complicated brain works. Which would make sense even if life was bed of roses and milk and cookies. Complicated machines are prone to errors. Computers are. Car engines are all of the things. Even if we don't do anything wrong to them, they have errors.
[28:23] B: Yes.
[28:23] A: Yours got dropped and kicked and punched and rolled around. It's got some glitches in it, and that's what we want to be tuning up.
[28:32] B: Okay.
[28:34] A: So one other kind of lens, and then I'm going to lay out the understanding of the whole yucky stuff. Then I'm going to lay out some information around what we do with grief. And then we'll go through processes, that adjustable thing. But before we do that, we kind of want to have a frame so that we're thinking about it from the same lenses. And then we're going to know what to do about it. So the deal is we tend to look at the circumstances of life as being the culprit, the cause of my feelings. So it's that stuff that happened back then that makes me feel like this. It's thinking about that thing that makes me feel. When that person does that thing, I feel this way.
[29:15] B: Yeah.
[29:15] A: And through that lens, we've got one of two choices. Change it or avoid it. Which is how we try to deal with most stuff. In life, I work hard to change. If I can't change, I try to get away from it. But in life, there's some stuff I can't change, some things I can't or maybe even don't want to get away from, and some stuff I can't get to have not happened. So we got to do something else. That's where we're coming in. We're going to adjust the way that your brain has been reacting to the stuff and what I mean by that. It's a silly example, but when a lion approaches a zebra, we would all say the lion makes the zebra scared. Right? I don't disagree with that at all. But from a parallel alternative, different perspective, we go, wait, no, it's actually when the zebra itself senses, feels, sees, smells, or thinks that lion is approaching. It's the zebra's brain, not the lion, that's making the zebra alert and motivated and strong. We just call that scared. So it runs away. It's doing it in response to the lion coming. But it's what the zebra's brain is doing to the zebra. And I say that because that gives us a whole other dimension of power. That what's been causing you to Feel bad is something that your brain has been doing to you. And not because it wants you to feel like crap, but because of glitches and errors. See, even though you're a pretty bright gal, I think I'm a pretty bright guy. Most of our brain works more like the brain of an animal. And an animal doesn't have feelings because the brain of the animal is concerned about its mood or its self esteem or its self worth, or whether it deems itself lovable enough. It doesn't cause emotions because things aren't fair or just or right. It doesn't cause feelings because they didn't get what they deserved. It causes emotion for a completely different reason. The emotions are there to motivate the animal to do something, to get something, to stop, to solve a problem. That's the purpose of it. So when that rabbit sees the fox, Boom. Brain makes it experience fear. Not to have a bad day, but to run until he passed away. Squirrel's tail caught in the fire. Pain. But not because it wants the squirrel to ruminate. Hate itself for being so stupid and careless and dumb. Now embarrassed because he's marred around all the other squirrels simpler tail out of fire. It's that simple. So what if all the negative emotions we experience, hurt, anger, sadness, pain, grief, guilt, shame, angst, upset, worry, all those kinds of pains are also being caused by the part of our brain that works like an animal. And the purpose is the same thing to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. Here's where the error comes in. Our brain frequently will make us feel bad, sad, trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. It's why we feel crappy about the same kinds of things over and over and over and over and over again. Now the good news, really good news for us. Many of the things that we feel shitty about are in time periods that are already finished. So what if then the solution isn't to solve the problem, but it's to update the timing? Timing is what malfunctions. And here's why. Our human body, just like an animal, is always locked in now. It's the only place our body can be. The difference is, with that frontal cortex, we can have thoughts about things that are happening now or could happen in the future, or have happened in the past. Therefore, we will have emotions about things that are happening now. Or what about could happen in the future or the past. But the problem is we'll be always feeling them right now. So somebody's worrying about some awful thing that could or might happen. And if it were to happen, it'd be really bad. When will they be feeling all the distress of it?
[33:53] B: Right now.
[33:53] A: Yeah. And if they're remembering awful shit that they went through, when will they be feeling all the distress of it? That's right. Isn't that crazy? So. So the issue for us is timing. See, in positive or neutral experiences, our brain actually gets the difference between the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening. Somebody's telling you about a trip that they had to Georgia, and they went up to the mountains and they went hiking, and they got to see all sorts of natural creatures in the woods. And when they're describing to you their experience of being there, you know that they know the difference between the memory of it and the experience of it. The problem is when it's negative. And it doesn't matter whether it's a big one or a small one. And it doesn't matter if it's one that happened a long time ago when I was little, or recent. And it doesn't matter whether it happened one time or multiple times through many years. All those negative ones, the weird, painful, bad, sad, scary, awful, upsetting, horrific, catastrophic, traumatic. Our brain confuses the data about what happened, thinking it's the experience. That's why we have the emotional response. So the guy is telling us about being robbed 22 years ago when he was in Seattle. And he gets to the part where the gun is at his head and his face is all contorted and his voice is choked and his arms are trembling. We're nice people. We were kindly listening to what the hell is happening. And people will frequently say they're reliving it, but what's actually going on is a different thing. Emotional part of the brain is confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience. We know it's affecting him as he's talking to us because we see it, but it's also affecting him. Even when he's not talking about it, even when he's playing basketball with his buddies, it's just underneath the surface. But at a logical level, he knows that he's safe and with us. He knows that it's over, that he made it through, that there's no but. We're also learning that there's a part of his brain that never got updated. That part never got the good news. And that part is stuck, frozen on, always ongoing. Once that gets frozen, then our brain does a second thing, and it happens because of what we learned. When we were very young, impressionable children, all of us learn the same messages. We all learn because culture wants us to grow up to be good. So we learn that if you're a good boy and if you're a good girl, your life will be good and you'll get to live happily ever after. We learn that by being good. Some strange man once a year brings us presents. Mommy's happy with me when I'm being good. So we get all the messages that good things happen when I'm being good. But if good happens when I'm good, it also has to mean bad happens.
[37:22] B: When I'm being bad.
[37:23] A: That's right. And only happens when I'm being bad. So everybody thinks it's my fault, Right? Nobody's shocked when the 26 year old who got a promotion goes out with her girlfriends, meets this guy who was friends with her girlfriend's friend. He seemed to be great. He says, hey, I'll take you home. He does. He forces his way into an apartment and rapes her. Nobody's shocked when she blames herself for being stupid and careless and putting herself in that situation as if she had a sign that said, drug and rape me. Hi, I'm a drug and rape me. But because it was bad, it's my fault. So as a little kid, it all grows up. All the negative things have something to do with me. Maybe it had to do with that I wasn't lovable enough, or I wasn't good enough, or maybe I'm not smart enough or pretty enough or tall enough. Or maybe there was just something wrong with me. Or maybe like somehow I must have drawn that person to me. All of that gets layered into it and it gets stuck at that level. So I might know different inside. I don't feel different. It's all stuck on. It's my fault it was bad. It's my fault. Had something to do with me. AIDS to being self conscious, Right? Even just a simple thing, like not simple for little kids, but parents get divorced. Kids, eight parents get divorced. That kid doesn't really kind of grasp it and doesn't go, oh, well, you know, it's a mom and dad issue. No, if I was more lovable, they'd be together. If I really mattered, if he really cared, if I was worth it. At 10, when dad says, I'll take you to Disney and never shows, the kid doesn't go, oh, I know. My dad's got a drug problem, so he's probably on a drunken bender. He's missing out on hanging out with me. No. The kid goes, if I really mattered, if I was really worth it, if I was lovable enough.
[39:08] B: Right?
[39:09] A: Yeah. And that just perpetuates to when he starts dating the girl when he's 17 and she cheats on him. See, here we go again. Another way to reinforce how unlovable I really am. It's not true. It's all distortion, but it gets stuck. Make sense. So once we've got those two things on, you know what our brain is going to do? It's going to scan so sore looking for anything similar to anything that was painful. But it'll confuse similar as saying soldier dives on the ground when the firework explodes. Not because he doesn't know it's the 4th of July and that he's at a firework celebration. Heck, he lit it.
[39:47] B: Yeah.
[39:48] A: It's at a deeper level. His brain confused the sound with a grenade. The guy's making out with this girl, it's feeling really good. She touches it and finds. Tenses up and he goes, what's wrong with me? This woman's touching me in a way that should feel good. And I'm tense. Yeah. But is there anything that, you know, similar to Uncle Fred? Sure. Our brain confuses that all the time. And it could have something that had nothing to do with the problem, but it got lumped in it. This is my favorite example because I had a woman one time whose parents told her that they were getting a divorce when she was nine. When they sat her and her brother down for that serious conversation, she was eating Nilla wafers. Now she can't stand walking by those things in the grocery store and was very angry that her best friend put them in banana pudding.
[40:38] B: Wow.
[40:39] A: Of course we know, Marjorie, that the.
[40:42] B: Issue was not the Nilla wafer that.
[40:46] A: Isn'T the part that troubled her, but because it happened at the same time, Mind will map it together. Make sense?
[40:55] B: It does.
[40:56] A: So all of that stuff runs us consciously. We might be aware of some of it unconsciously. It's running us all the time. But all of it gets unplugged by doing one thing. And that is really what I just said, unplugging the memory. Because they're all based in distortion. If I take my hand and I slam it in the sand and I pick it up, it leaves an imprint. But the imprint is not the same thing as my hand. The meaning isn't what happened. She wasn't being bad. She was just getting taken home by somebody that she thought was nice. How different is a firework from a grenade. Right. So it's not about digging in, releasing, and getting bad feelings out. It's different. What if the solution is getting the good news in? See, there's information that you and I have at this stage that you didn't know back then that would be really useful to get that information. A. That a lot of those yucky experiences, they're done. They're over, and they've been over for a long time. We want to get that information in. We want to have that information in and let that, you know, how you turned out and some of the things that you've done in life that were way more enjoyable than those things because there's been more and what you're up to, doing and making a difference for others. Like that whole thing, we want that reversed so that all of that gets in. Does that make sense? Any questions about what I've just shared with you?
[42:39] B: No, no. No questions. It was enlightening and informative and helps me understand, you know, the different parameters of what I'm dealing with or whatever. I don't think I have any questions.
[42:55] A: Okay. So I'd like you to do this for me. I'd like you to think of a time when you were maybe outside side and in natural. Actually, I'm gonna turn a little dark, a little light on in here. We're having a storm, I think.
[43:13] B: Sounds like it.
[43:14] A: There we go. So I'd like you to think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something, and as you're looking at it, it's just beautiful. Yeah. What is it that you see?
[43:31] B: The beach.
[43:32] A: Yeah. And isn't there a moment that as you're looking out at the beach and seeing the water, that you're feeling a sense of peace and maybe even a little excitement all at the same time? And people would say to you that it is the seeing of the beach that in being there, gave you the feelings. But if we looked at it again from a slightly different lens, we could say that seeing it and being there just drew your awareness down in towards your center. Because at your center, you always are peaceful and excited. Kind of like if I'm at a campfire and I take my hands and I move them down towards the flames and I go, marjorie, the fire is getting hotter. You would say to me, no, it's not. You're just becoming much more aware of the heat. Not that fire didn't get any hotter. My hand just got closer. I became more aware of it. So we know then the same thing. That there have been a multitude of times where your awareness and even outside of your body, where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. The stressors, the upsets, the pains. But the way we can think of it is that no matter where your awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited. And, you know, two of us are here in this room. You know it because you can look and see it. That's what we call intellectual knowledge. Sometimes people call knowledge light. So we'll just call it light of knowledge. We could also say that at your center, it's a brighter light. Light of wisdom. So now we've got knowledge and wisdom. And I remember working with this one girl. She had had lots of different stuff going on. There was just a lot of heaviness and weight and just, like, forcing her way through it. Even though her heart was into stuff. It was lots of different things. But one of the things that had happened when she was really little is her older brother Matchbox car up. We're like, so lots of yuckiness with all that. But when we work together, gone. All the pain, all the shame, all the hurt, gone. So as she was sitting across from me, I asked her the question. I go, you know, all that.
[45:55] B: Ugh.
[45:55] A: I go, where was it? And she started smiling. And she goes, it's gone. I don't feel it. I know, I know. But the question was, where was it? And we started thinking, and I looked at it. I go, was it at a surface level? And she's like, no, it wasn't an intellectual thing. Oh, was it at your center? She's like, serious. How could that stuff survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited? Well, then, where was it? And she said, you know, it was all hiding in the shadows because all the distortion was in between the lights. I said, well, what happened? Well, they merged. They're not touching, which is cool. So then we started thinking and I started sharing with her about neuroscience. Because what neuroscience has taught us is that our brain has neuroplasticity, meaning the ability to ongoingly rewire itself, that we can change how memories got processed and stored in the brain. We can rewire things inside, which is really cool. Then we started talking about how neuroscience is actually determined that if you and I were to come back one year from today, that 99.9999% of the subatomic particles that are making you and I up right now would not be here. That all we are is changing that if we thought of the part of our Body that's solid. It's five decimal points. 00001% of our body is solid. The rest of us is made up of space, which is interesting. Why do we feel space solid? Well, if you've ever watched a ceiling fan, when it's off, you can see the space between the blades. But when it's high and you try to put your hand in, it feels like a solid object. We are made up of tiny subatomic particles that are vibrating at a really fast rate, which makes us feel solid. Then we started talking that, you know, you have a body, but you're not actually your body. That there's not a single cell today that's the same as it was when you were little. They've all been replaced millions of times, but you're still you. And I know that we're not our body because when my mom was 17, she lost the tip of her finger in a freak snow cone machine accident. But when she goes over to visit people, they don't say to her, susie, I'm so glad almost all of you could make it. They don't say that because she's all there.
[48:42] B: Yeah.
[48:43] A: Even if that part's missing.
[48:45] B: Yeah.
[48:46] A: Right. So we could walk around. We go, wait a minute. You know, you have a body, it's yours, but it isn't actually you. Then we go, wait a minute. You have thoughts and your thoughts. Typically we think of my thoughts as me. We don't do that with other body things. Right. If I've got an upset stomach and I'm gassy, I don't walk around saying I'm gas. But if I think something stupid, I might say I'm an idiot. Like I over identify me as my thoughts. But what if you're not your thoughts? What if you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? Your brain is. And your brain isn't either. It's an organ like all the other organs in your body. So then you're not your thoughts either. When we go, wait, maybe you're your feelings, except you're you regardless of how you're feeling. So then you can't be a feeling. We go, oh, maybe you're what you do, except there's lots of things that you've done. So then you can't be what you do. Which is weird because if you're not what you do, and if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not your feelings, and if you're not your body, then what are you? Weird question. Right? So let's Just say, for our purposes of what we're doing, that the who you really are is what you became aware of as you see the beach, that who you are is the light at the center. And the coolest part about light is that it's totally whole and complete. It's indestructible, and it can't be touched or hurt or harmed. And I say that because people always screw up identity, saying things like, I'm anxious or I'm shy or I'm depressed, that the way that they feel is who they are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm upset and you go, why? I go, well, you'll never believe what he did. You go, what did he do? Put me on that chair. Yeah. My head goes down. Yeah. Shines a light in my eye. Yeah. Takes a cold metal instrument, shoves it up inside of me. You go, in your what? Then I go, my mouth. Marjorie. I'm at the dentist, you know, because I've got one. I'm not one. But that's the same comment that I made to the woman with her brother, the matchbox. I said, when you were little, your brother, he really messed with your stuff. And she said, he sure did. And it totally screwed up my thinking and how I felt for a long time. And then she started to get that smile again. She goes, but you know what? He never actually touched me. He messed with my body. It hurt my feelings. It screwed up my thinking. But he never got me, because who I am can't be touched in that way. Wow. That is a powerful way to be thinking of things. And so where we're headed is all about lightening things up so that things begin to lift and lighten. Which leads us to another thought. Because if we're not our body, but we are the energy source inside, we call it a light. Religions like to call it soul and spirit, but you can call it that. We can call it light. So then we go, wait a minute. Einstein, who was a really brilliant guy, said a few things. First, he said, who we are. Physical existence is energy plus matter equals physical existence. And then what became the second law of thermal dynamics is energy cannot be destroyed. It can only transform. Which leads us to an interesting thought. Because if we did a science experiment with a young child, and we took a glass of ice and we put it out on our patio, and an hour goes by and we come back and the kid looks and he goes, somebody stole the ice and replaced it with water. We would giggle to ourselves and then educate the young child that Nobody stole the ice. It just melted. Moved from solid to liquid. But the H2O molecule that's made it up is identically the same. How we perceive it is different. And the kid goes, okay, I get that. We leave that glass of water now out on our patio, and a week goes by and the kid comes back and he goes, somebody stole the water. And of course we would giggle again to ourselves and say, nobody stole the water. He goes, well, what happened? Well, it evaporated. What does that mean? Well, it moved from liquid state into gas state. The H2O molecule that makes it up is identically the same. Our perception is what's changed. And the kid is now really confused and goes, but if I don't see it, how can I feel it? We go, well, you're in Florida. It's all around you. And then we put him for contrast in the desert of Arizona. You don't feel any of that here, do you? And we bring him back to Florida and we show him the rain cloud and we capture the water and we put it in the freezer, and he discovers it's all the same thing. So what if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop working. What if it's that their bodies stop and because they're no longer in need of their body, they exit? Doesn't mean that they're not here. We don't pick them up in the same way we were used to picking them up, like when they were in their body. But it doesn't mean that they're not here. There are so many examples of things that we don't sense with the five tactile senses we have, right? See, hear, taste, smell, feel. But we know that it's here. For example, we have cell phones. There are cell phone powers. I don't feel any of that. Do you?
[55:30] B: No.
[55:31] A: There are radio waves. You can go in your car and turn it on. It's not that they weren't there before you turn the knob on. And microwaves were all around before we put them in that small box. So there's so many things. If I blow the whistle and we don't hear any sound, but the dog is screaming, is the whistle not making a noise? So there are so many things that are out of our range, but it doesn't mean that it's not here.
[55:57] B: Right.
[55:58] A: So what happens frequently for people is it's the shock of having always known them in their body that when they're no longer in, blocks our access. To be experiencing the essence of who they are ongoing, which is what we're beginning to open up.
[56:26] B: Makes sense, right?
[56:28] A: And so all sorts of things are beginning to get primed and beginning to open for transformation to begin to happen. And what I know is that your unconscious knows even more than you on how to heal itself. It's been doing it your whole life. It's why it cuts. Healing. Their own bones heal on their own. Yes, we put them in a cast, but it's so we don't screw up our body's ability to heal it ongoingly. That's always happening. And that process accelerates when we rest. So what we're going to do now is a process that's all about causing your body to be you even more states of rest. And we use neuroscience brain based levers. And the first lever is you're going to slightly lower your jaw. It's not like ah, but it's just tiny little bit, maybe the width of an index finger. And when you slightly lower, lower your jaw, what that does is it begins to stimulate our vagal nerve and starts to move us into more of a parasympathetic response. So you slightly lower your jaw and then you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. And when you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, it begins to cause a satiated feeling in the body and also starts to turn down some of the internal dialogue. So you lower your jaw and you rest your tongue and now begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit deeper and a little bit slower than how you normally breathe. Just like that. And as you're breathing in that way that's a little, little bit slower and deeper. Just begin to check in. How's your body feeling now? What are you noticing?
[58:47] B: Good.
[58:48] A: Yeah, Hope so.
[59:00] B: Like this.
[59:02] A: So your body's beginning to feel more calm.
[59:06] B: Sorry? Yeah.
[59:08] A: What'd you just notice?
[59:09] B: I don't know. I don't know. I just got the strangest feeling.
[59:16] A: Oh, what was the strangest feeling?
[59:18] B: I don't know. It was just like all tingly.
[59:20] A: You got to feel all tingly. Yes. So strange.
[59:23] B: It was like a tickle.
[59:24] A: Almost like a tickle.
[59:26] B: Yeah, strange.
[59:28] A: Oh, right. But notice how it wasn't really loud up top? No, it was quieter in there, wasn't it?
[59:35] B: Yeah, it was good. It was like I was kind of drifting.
[59:37] A: You were, weren't you?
[59:38] B: And everything was getting blurry and I was going to sleep and then I got this just big tickle, like this booster.
[59:46] A: Strange.
[59:46] B: I don't know, maybe it's Got some sleep.
[59:48] A: Or maybe it's, you know, all about you. Lightning up. So what we want to do is we want to add the next lever, which is moving from states of focused vision to states of expanded awareness. What we know about anxieties, they happen in beta wavelengths and they happen when we get tunneled vision. So we want to be in a more alert, relaxed state, which is more alpha waves. Yeah. So you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper than normal. Just like that. As you're breathing in that way that's slower and deeper, notice how you can look across at me, right? And as you see me, notice as you look at me what happens as you allow your awareness to expand. So just notice what happens when you can also see me. But notice my fingers moving. Right. And then we get a sense of all the space towards the side walls, Right. Beginning to realize the space in between you and me and the space that's behind me, that there's space underneath the couch that you're seated on, that there's space up above your head towards the ceiling, and even space behind you towards the back wall and window and then even beyond the windows, way out in the parking lot and beyond and how much more space and room there is. That's right. And again, as you're doing all of that, just check how's your body feel. And then the last little piece is you're going to in a moment, close your eyes. So go ahead and with your eyes closed, imagine what it might be like to float way up and out of your body. Like above the ceiling and the rooftop so that you're up above in the sky. And from that way up above, birds eye view. Think of what it might be like to be like a bird. Able to soar, glide, fly, and move all around in all ways in all directions, making big wide turns and curves, big arching angles. Soaring, flying, gliding, moving all around in all ways in all directions, soaring, bringing awareness back down into your body. That's right. That's right. And then when you're ready, taking a deep breath in and exhale and open your eyes. That's right. Yeah. And what's happening now? What are you noticing? For you.
[63:44] B: Same thing. It's a lot clearer.
[63:48] A: Oh, it's a lot clearer.
[63:50] B: Yeah.
[63:50] A: And your body is more calm. Yeah, it is, isn't it? Yeah. And see, your unconscious has already begun making changes. What's really cool is knowing where we're Headed, which is a you who's light and clear and free, at peace with what has so that she's no longer haunted. She's associated in her own body when it makes sense, but also has the flexibility to move out if that's better based on the situation. So she's got the ability to do both the you that I'm seeing, more outwardly focused, so that she's not spending time thinking about herself. And therefore that weight has been lifted. She's out from under, and it's a lot easier for her to move and do the things that she's interested so that as she is, she's truly feeling good. And as she thinks back about having done it, she's really glad that she did. That's the you. That's what your brain has already begun organizing towards. Because just like with layering seeds in the soil, the work happens as soon as you layer the seeds, cover them up, and water that top level, Then there's nothing else that you need to do on its own. Change starts to happen. And first the change happens below the ground. You can't even fully see any of it happening. Yeah. And it's not until a lot has already changed before you ever see any of it sprout. That's right. Your brain is doing that within you now. All of that is happening. And so given that all of that is happening, we have the opportunity to free up resources and energy. Because anytime impressions landed that got stuck, energy is being used to deal with it ongoing. So as the experience is brought into the light and the effect is cleared, all the energy that was stuck will be released and used in your body for even more healing, maintenance, repair. Got it. Yeah. So all of that is going on. Your mind is responding. So as we're organizing towards that, you. The unconscious parts, Marjorie can just scan back through the negative things that have happened, and it's going to begin to categorize, and then it's going to begin to narrow, pinpoint, and bring a particular moment to mind that would be useful for us to clear. We're gonna do one moment. So as you're organizing, thinking about the you, light and clear and free and easygoing, having that much more ease in interacting with others, feeling the joy of what she's up to and doing, and the satisfaction of having done it, connecting to who matters to her, your unconscious is just going to travel back now through those experiences as it's got them categorized. It's going to narrow, pinpoint, and bring a particular moment to mind for us to clear that's right. And the one that just came to mind happened about how long ago? Like you were little then. Yeah. So let me explain to you how we clear it, because it's actually a simple process. One, you're gonna intend to emotionally be with me. That's right. The reason that you want to be here with me now is that this is what's happening.
[67:56] B: And.
[67:57] A: And that isn't. Two, we're working on the mutual goal that we're both invested and interested in. Three, I'm more fun than sucky stuff, so I want you and me. Second, when you tell it to me, it's going to just be facts in about a minute or less. So it'll go, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, then it was done. Three, if it happened a long time ago when you were little, there have been many experiences after it that were way more enjoyable than that experience. So what's one thing, anytime from when that happened until yesterday that was more enjoyable than that moment?
[68:38] B: Went to a restaurant, had dinner with family.
[68:40] A: Yeah. Having dinner with family was more fun than that. Good. Something else that you've done in life that was more enjoyable than that?
[68:45] B: Going swimming.
[68:47] A: Yeah. Going swimming was more enjoyable. One other thing, sometime recent that was more fun than that.
[68:57] B: Just driving around in my car.
[68:59] A: Yeah. Driving around in your car. Right. Getting the, you know, outside in nature. That's right, yeah. So all of those things are more enjoyable. There's an aspect of your brain that doesn't know about anything that happened later. So that we want to get that good news in. So when that particular moment happened, when it happened, you might have been where?
[69:24] B: I was at my aunt's house.
[69:26] A: So you're at your aunt's house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[69:29] B: It was daytime.
[69:30] A: Daytime. And you're where in the house?
[69:31] B: We were outside at first.
[69:33] A: Oh, say you're outside. Right. And you're playing. Right. And then what happened?
[69:37] B: Well, then my cousin wanted me to go to go somewhere with them.
[69:42] A: Right. So he said, hey, come with me.
[69:44] B: Right.
[69:44] A: And so you did?
[69:45] B: Yeah.
[69:45] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[69:48] B: We went to the graveyard.
[69:52] A: Yeah, good. So you went to the graveyard. Right. And then what happened?
[69:54] B: Yeah, we went to the graveyard. And then as we were walking back, we had to go through a forest like area.
[69:59] A: Yes. Right.
[70:01] B: Yeah. So then when we were walking through, he kind of forced me down on the ground.
[70:05] A: So he pushed you to the ground. Right. Then what happened next?
[70:07] B: Then he took my clothes off.
[70:12] A: Well, he took your clothes off. Right.
[70:13] B: Good.
[70:13] A: In the mind.
[70:14] B: And Then he started to try to penetrate me.
[70:18] A: So he tried to put his penis in your vagina? That was not working that well.
[70:21] B: No, because that was moving around.
[70:23] A: Good. And then what happened next?
[70:24] B: Then he. I think he hit me.
[70:27] A: Right, good. And that hurt. And then what happened next?
[70:29] B: Yep. Then he said, it's going to happen. He was angry. He said, it's gonna happen. You. You said, you want me to do it in the front or the back?
[70:40] A: Good job. Right, good. Then what happened next?
[70:42] B: I said the back.
[70:43] A: Right. Good. Now what happened then?
[70:45] B: Then he did it in the back.
[70:47] A: Right, Good. Not a little bit hurt. And then what happened next?
[70:51] B: Then he made me get up. And you started to walk home.
[70:54] A: Well, then he stopped.
[70:55] B: He stopped.
[70:56] A: Right. And that was better. Then you put your clothes back on.
[70:59] B: Right.
[70:59] A: And then you guys started walking back. Alright, good. And then what happened next?
[71:02] B: Gonna try to run from him.
[71:03] A: All right, good. Then what happened?
[71:04] B: Then you run after me.
[71:05] A: Right, good. Then what happened?
[71:06] B: And he just was angry and he kind of hit me some more.
[71:09] A: Right, good. Don't tell anybody.
[71:10] B: Don't tell anybody.
[71:11] A: Right, good. Know what happened next? Yep.
[71:12] B: And then we went back to the house.
[71:15] A: Right. And then that particular time ended. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[71:19] B: Yeah.
[71:20] A: Right. Let go, swami. Yeah, right. And you know, go out to dinner. Yeah, right. Maybe even driving around in your car. Right, good. See, notice as you're recalling it, you had that discomfort not because of how yucky that was, but because your brain was confusing the memory with the experience. It's already started to change because you were intending to be here with me. Second, we're gonna run it backwards, because when we go backwards with the memory, it literally unplugged, plugs the memory. It flattens out the neurons. It takes away the charge. So we're gonna run it backwards. So we got driving in the car and swimming and having dinner with family. And then before that, you're back at ants, and then he had hit you, and then you had ran.
[72:06] B: Yeah.
[72:06] A: Well, then he caught you, then you ran. And then you were guys were walking back, and then you would put your clothes back on, and then he'd stop. And then he had been doing it, and then he had said, front of the back, it's going to happen. And then he had hit you, and then you were squirming around and he was trying to put his penis in. Then he had you take off your clothes, and then you were in the wooded area. And then before that you were in the graveyard. And then before that, you guys had gone locked. And then before that, you were outside playing. Then before that, you've been dropped off there. And then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing.
[72:36] B: Yeah.
[72:37] A: Right. As we go through it backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it?
[72:44] B: I don't know. It was different.
[72:46] A: It was. Wasn't. Didn't have the same feeling.
[72:49] B: It was like a zipper.
[72:50] A: It was like a zipper.
[72:52] B: Zip it up, kind of.
[72:54] A: Maybe.
[72:54] B: I don't know.
[72:55] A: It didn't have the same feeling.
[72:56] B: It did not.
[72:57] A: Right. Because your brain is getting that. It's data.
[72:59] B: It's been like. I felt like we were moving backwards.
[73:02] A: Right, right, right. Because it's not happening.
[73:06] B: Right.
[73:06] A: Which is the other part that we want to get in. That it's not happening.
[73:10] B: Yeah.
[73:11] A: So a weird way that we do that. Kind of silly, too. Our brain doesn't respond to logic. It responds to patterns of association. Okay, so one pattern of association is really silly. Like, for example, your shoes. You can remember putting them on earlier today. You can remember where you were when you did it.
[73:34] B: Yeah, I think so.
[73:35] A: But if I said, do you remember putting your shoes on earlier today? And then said, marjorie, stop putting on your shoes? You'd look at me and go, I'm not putting on my shoes. Because you know that there's a difference between the memory of doing it and doing it. Right. So remember getting dressed, putting your shoes on. Marjorie, stop putting on your shoes. Say, I'm not putting on my shoes. Say that.
[73:56] B: I'm not putting on my shoes.
[73:56] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then you stop putting on your shirt. Say, I'm not putting on my shirt. Well, then stop your cousin from doing that. Say, he's not doing that. Well, then you stop putting on your pants.
[74:07] B: Well, I'm not putting on.
[74:08] A: Well, stop me from putting on my pants. Well, then stop him from doing that. Well, then stop him from hitting you. Well, then, where is that experience? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in.
[74:20] B: Right.
[74:21] A: And then the last aspect with it that you back then felt. Felt that some of that happening had something to do with you. Did it have anything to do with you?
[74:32] B: No.
[74:33] A: No. Had everything to do with stuff being off with him. Right, Right. Because you weren't thinking, you know, hey, I'm gonna go to this place with my cousin so that he can do that to me.
[74:45] B: Right? Right. No.
[74:49] A: So it had nothing to do. Do with. You had everything to do with stuff being off with him. Right. But you didn't know that back then. Right. So repeat these four words after me. Here we go. It's. It's not. Not about.
[75:01] B: About me.
[75:03] A: Right. So now close your eyes. Picture that earlier you let that earlier you know that it's over, finished, completed, defeated. It no longer exists. Let her know that that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with stuff being off when him.
[75:17] B: It's not about me.
[75:18] A: So that she gets it. Then let her know by driving in her car and going out to dinner. Let her know about swimming. Let her know so that she gets it. Right. And as she's getting all of that, what do you notice happening to the younger you?
[75:34] B: Smiling and freer.
[75:35] A: She is smiling and freer. That's right. And then you can open your eyes. Right? She's not troubled by that. Now isn't that a good news thing? Which is what we're getting in and therefore we're going to do another. Your unconscious is going to travel back. Why? Because as we get multitudes, it'll make it easier to generalize to the rest. We learn on one at a time and then our brain generalizes, but it makes it even easier to generalize when we do more than one. Like if I said to you orange, you don't know whether I'm thinking of the fruit or the color. If I said to you orange, apple, banana. You got that? I was thinking of the fruit. I don't have to list every fruit out there for you to pick up on the fruit. So. So again, your unconscious is going to travel back through things that have happened and it's going to bring another moment to mind. Clear.
[76:42] B: Right.
[76:43] A: And this one happened when this one happened?
[76:51] B: I don't know, maybe with my son dying.
[76:55] A: Well, that would be one that would be useful to get cleared. Yeah. Yeah. So here's the question that most people where conflict sometimes arises, would it be okay for you to be okay even though what happened was not okay? That's a weird question, right? But see, where conflict arises often, in particular when it somebody that so matters to me is that if I am okay now, then it somehow means what happened was okay. And what happened will never be okay. So how could I ever be okay? That's where conflict comes from. But you being okay right now, does that in any way, shape or form mean that what happened back then was okay?
[77:54] B: No.
[77:55] A: Right. See, you get to be okay even though that wasn't. Second, your son, are we thinking that he's wanting you to feel shitty every time you think of him? No, that's the second part. Right. Where people get it is like, if I'm still in pain. And it's a demonstration of how much that person means to me. Except. Except as we're looking at it, do you think that he, every time you think about him, is wanting you to feel awful?
[78:31] B: No.
[78:32] A: Right. He's actually wanting you, when you think of him, to feel love. An ongoing connection to the essence of who he is for you, which is so much more than just that moment, because that's what has happened. That moment has gotten blown up, and therefore it's been blocking access to all of the others. So we want to get right. There we go. Now it's becoming more okay to be okay. And we also realize that you being okay and not hurting in that way doesn't mean that you don't care. It's actually getting you to be more connected to who he is. Ongoing for you. So that moment when you found out about what happened, you were where. So you're in the front yard. Was it daytime or nighttime? Daytime. And you're like. You're raking. There we go. So you're raking. Right. And then, like, happened.
[79:33] B: And then I saw an ambulance come by.
[79:36] A: So an ambulance drove by. Right. Then what happened next?
[79:38] B: It went to the house where I knew he was or I knew he would be.
[79:41] A: Right, good. Right. And then what happened next?
[79:44] B: I just kind of started praying. I was like, I don't know what's going on, but.
[79:48] A: Right. But that was down the road.
[79:50] B: Yes, right down the road.
[79:51] A: Yeah. Good. And you started kind of like, I don't know then what happened next?
[79:57] B: And then they were down there for a little bit.
[80:00] A: Yes.
[80:00] B: And the friends, two of his, two people started walking down the road toward me.
[80:05] A: Towards you. Right. Good morning. What happened next?
[80:07] B: And they were people he knew would be down there?
[80:11] A: Yes.
[80:11] B: And so they told me, you need to come check on your son.
[80:14] A: Good job. Right. So they said, you need to come. Right. So you left the rake?
[80:16] B: Yeah, I left the rake. I ran down there.
[80:19] A: Yes. Good job. Good detail. And then what happened?
[80:22] B: Then when I got down there, they wouldn't let me in the house.
[80:24] A: Right, good. Right. So the police or ambulance people?
[80:27] B: Ambulance.
[80:28] A: And police, they said, you can't go in there. But my son, they said, you still can't go in there. Good. And then what happened next?
[80:36] B: Then there was just a lot of me trying to figure out if what's going on, and, you know.
[80:44] A: All right, so then you're, like, waiting. Yeah, Mine was doing all that. And then what Happened next.
[80:51] B: Then I asked someone to go down and get my pastor and my mom.
[80:55] A: Good job. Right, good. And so they did. And they came up.
[80:58] B: They came up and they just kind of stood there with me. Then they kept telling me he was dead.
[81:06] A: Who was?
[81:07] B: My son.
[81:07] A: No, who was telling you?
[81:10] B: People just that were around.
[81:12] A: Other friends of his. Other.
[81:15] B: Yeah, well, my pastor, who was with me.
[81:20] A: Yes.
[81:21] B: Like, I could never get them to say that he was dead.
[81:24] A: Yes.
[81:25] B: So I'm still trying to wonder, is he okay?
[81:27] A: Is he okay or not? And the pastor saying to you, she.
[81:30] B: Went and looked in the window.
[81:33] A: Good job, good detail. Right. So she had gone and looked in the window and then said, no, he's dead. Yeah.
[81:39] B: I was just screaming.
[81:41] A: Right, of course. Right. Then what happened? Yes. And then what happened?
[81:45] B: Then I just kind of stayed there. Stayed there until they brought him out.
[81:51] A: Yeah. Brought the body out.
[81:53] B: Yeah. And then put him in the ambulance and took him away.
[81:56] A: Yes. And then what happened next?
[81:58] B: And then I just kind of stood there for a while, and then I went somewhere. I don't know. I went with family somewhere.
[82:08] A: Right.
[82:08] B: Just process the whole.
[82:11] A: And then that particular moment ended.
[82:12] B: It ended.
[82:13] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more enjoyable, like, you know, getting this job.
[82:19] B: What?
[82:20] A: You know, the peer to peer thing.
[82:21] B: Oh, yeah, right. Doing that.
[82:25] A: Good. There were times that you're driving in the car.
[82:27] B: Yeah, right. Yeah. I was eating at the restaurant.
[82:29] A: Right, good. So we got driving in the car and eating the restaurant. We got getting this particular thing. Right. And then before that, you had gone to process.
[82:37] B: Right.
[82:37] A: And then the ambulance had taken the body, and the body was wheeled out, and then you guys were standing out. And then the pastor had told you, no, he's dead. And then had looked in the window. And then mom and the pastor came down, and then you had said, somebody go get them. And they were just standing out there trying to figure out. And they said, no, you can't come in. And then you had ran down there, and then two people told you, you need to come and check on your son. And then you had seen the ambulance go by, and then you were outside. Right. And then before that, you'd gone outside.
[83:03] B: Yeah, yeah.
[83:03] A: Right. And as we ran through it backwards again, compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[83:07] B: It was different. It was so much like a shh. You know what I mean? Like a shh.
[83:12] A: That's right.
[83:13] B: Like that.
[83:13] A: That's right. Cause you can remember all that happened.
[83:15] B: Right.
[83:16] A: But you can remember putting your shirt on today.
[83:17] B: Yes.
[83:18] A: Audrey, stop putting on your shirt. Well, Then stop that from happening.
[83:23] B: Stop happening?
[83:24] A: Yeah. So stop putting on your shoes. Well, then stop that from happening. So then where is it? See, it no longer exists. And then were you able to see the body later?
[83:34] B: Not until I got into the funeral home.
[83:37] A: To the funeral home. And when you did, notice how it didn't, like, seem the same?
[83:41] B: Mm.
[83:42] A: It's the weirdest thing. It was weird, right? Because it doesn't feel. Do you know why? Why? Because he wasn't in it anymore.
[83:50] B: Yeah, right, Right.
[83:52] A: The body started working. It's not that he's gone. It's that the body stopped working. See, the thing that I'd like you to consider is that your love for him right now is as strong as it's always ever been. Hasn't gone anywhere. You don't love him any less that he's no longer in his body. That hasn't gone anywhere. And he fully experiences it from you. The difference is that his love for you is also as strong as it's always ever been. You just haven't been fully experiencing it. And it's not because it's not here. It's because the shock of having known him in his body that now that he's no longer in it, is blocking access to it. Right. So we want to get that. That's right. You to have more access ongoing. So I'm going to show you something that I think is interesting and ne. So this we all have had to sing before because there are ping pong balls and everybody sing a ping pong ball. But this one works differently. It makes a noise when you put your finger on the metal. But what's really interesting is I can hold it and I can put my finger on the metal, and then you can take your finger and then not do anything at all. Which is weird. Right? But if you did that and then you took your other hand and touched my finger. Finger over here.
[85:38] B: Oh, that is so cool.
[85:40] A: Right?
[85:41] B: How does that work?
[85:42] A: So what's really wow, right. Is the essence of what it's doing is it's a circuit connector. So what do we know about a light switch? When a light switch is off, there's an empty space. When a light switch is on, the circuit connects and energy flows. So who are we? Energy. Energy plus matter equals existence. Right. That when I'm touching, I complete a circuit. That when we opened and there was a gap, but when we touched, it completed the circuit. That's right. So that energy doesn't go anywhere. It's still here.
[86:24] B: So then why didn't It. Do it when you did it. You didn't. I didn't. Because we're two separate energy sources.
[86:31] A: Because we didn't touch to complete the circuit.
[86:34] B: That is so weird.
[86:36] A: Right. So that's what we're saying is the essence of who he is for you is so much more than that moment. So, like, you know, your son, what's his name?
[86:47] B: Mike. Mike.
[86:48] A: And the essence of Mike, like, who is Mike for you?
[86:52] B: My baby.
[86:54] A: He's your baby. He's your son. And as you think of all the experiences through the years in being with Mike, what's those shared experiences?
[87:03] B: They've been good experience.
[87:05] A: Yeah. And the essence of those shared experiences, like, is there some kind of, like, thing that you and him have?
[87:15] B: Just, like. I don't know, like, when we talk, it's just we communicate really well. I don't know. I don't know what the thing would be.
[87:27] A: Well, there's more than one. There is. And as you're talking. Right.
[87:33] B: Yeah. His big, beautiful smile.
[87:36] A: That's right.
[87:36] B: Best smile ever.
[87:41] A: I remember working with somebody that they. Their son was a really good piano player. And so now, like, the essence of him is that whenever she's hearing, like, a piano, she's feeling his presence with her in those moments. Right. I wonder what it would be like for you as you're seeing somebody's big smile to be feeling him with you. Right. Oh, there we go. Now you're actually. That's right. Right. You're feeling more and more of that now. Right, right.
[88:19] B: And I could just see it. You know, it smiles, almost just slides up the whole room.
[88:24] A: That's right. Yeah.
[88:26] B: Yeah.
[88:28] A: Right. So we still don't like what happened. But as you're checking in, what are you noticing happening now?
[88:35] B: Body's feeling now, like, a lot less tension up there.
[88:39] A: There's a lot less tension up there. That's right. Yeah. We're beginning to lift the heaviness. So again, as we're organizing towards that, you, who's light and clear and out from under it all, whose mind is clear, who's free as she's interacting with others. Again, as we're organizing towards all that, your unconscious will just travel back through other experiences that have happened in your history and again will narrow, pinpoint, and bring another moment for us to clear. So what comes to mind now?
[89:27] B: A particular moment of, like, a situation that happened with my husband.
[89:35] A: Like a particular one? Yeah.
[89:38] B: Like, it was. He was angry, he'd been drinking.
[89:41] A: He was angry, he had been drinking. This was at night or day.
[89:44] B: This was like midday.
[89:47] A: Midday. Right. So he was angry. He'd been drinking. And you're like, inside or outside?
[89:51] B: Inside.
[89:51] A: They're inside, like kitchen, living room.
[89:54] B: Living room.
[89:55] A: You're in the living room. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[89:58] B: Then he was angry. He was screaming at me.
[90:02] A: Yes, he was screaming at me.
[90:04] B: And he kind of grabbed me and held me up against the wall. And he was just screaming.
[90:09] A: Screaming. Screaming. Right. And that was scary, you know, scary.
[90:14] B: Then. Oh, he took me into the bedroom.
[90:19] A: Right. And so you were off the wall and you'd gone in the bedroom. Right. And then what happened?
[90:24] B: And he was just continuous to scream. Just constantly screaming. And I just kind of shut down.
[90:30] A: Yes.
[90:31] B: I was trying to fight him and he wouldn't let me up. Had me pinned down.
[90:36] A: Like I wouldn't let me get up.
[90:38] B: Yeah.
[90:38] A: Good. And right now?
[90:39] B: Yeah, it was kind of choking me.
[90:41] A: Yeah, that's right.
[90:43] B: And so I just shut down. I stopped trying to fight because the more I fight, the worse it would get. So I just shut down.
[90:51] A: And then you stopped fighting. Right. And then what happened?
[90:58] B: We just laid there for hours.
[91:03] A: Well, then he stopped being violent.
[91:04] B: Yeah, he stopped being violent.
[91:05] A: He did, didn't he? Yeah. Huh? Yeah.
[91:07] B: Just laid there for hours.
[91:08] A: You stayed there for hours. And then that was over.
[91:10] B: That was over. You fell asleep.
[91:12] A: And then later on you did something more fun.
[91:14] B: Yeah.
[91:14] A: Like driving the car.
[91:16] B: Yeah.
[91:20] A: So going out to dinner with family and driving.
[91:23] B: Yeah.
[91:23] A: In the car. And then before that, you sneaking out and then him sleeping and then you guys laying there and then you stopping and then you fighting him. Fighting him, fighting him. And then him pinning you on the bed and then bringing you in the bed than having you against the wall and then screaming and yelling at you. And then he was in a bad mood and he was drinking, and then you were doing whatever you're doing.
[91:41] B: Yeah.
[91:41] A: Right. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was.
[91:48] B: Was different?
[91:49] A: You can remember him doing that?
[91:51] B: I can remember him doing that.
[91:52] A: You can. You can remember putting on your pants.
[91:54] B: Yeah.
[91:55] A: You know, your shorts, capris, whatever they're called.
[91:57] B: Yeah.
[91:58] A: Well, stop putting on your capris.
[92:00] B: I'm not putting him on.
[92:01] A: Well, then stop him from grabbing you in the throat.
[92:03] B: Well, he's not.
[92:04] A: Well, then stop him from pinning you on the bed.
[92:06] B: Well, he's not.
[92:06] A: Well, then you stop putting your shoes on.
[92:09] B: I'm not putting my shoes on.
[92:10] A: Will stop me from kissing my daughter.
[92:12] B: You're not kissing your daughter.
[92:13] A: Well, then stop him from doing that.
[92:15] B: He's not doing that.
[92:16] A: I said, then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[92:18] B: It no longer exists.
[92:19] A: That's right. And again, him doing that, did that have anything to do with you?
[92:24] B: No.
[92:25] A: No. But it felt like it.
[92:27] B: I did.
[92:28] A: Right. So now close your eyes and let that earlier, you know, that it's over, finished, no longer exists. That him acting that way and doing that had nothing to do with you and everything to do with something that was off with him in that moment. So that she gets it. That's right. That's right. Let her know that she's a. Okay. Oh, and then let her know about how resourceful she is. That as soon as she stopped, he stopped. Yeah. Yeah. Like she got him to stop by stopping. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Isn't that interesting?
[93:10] B: It is. Yep.
[93:14] A: Yeah. And what are you noticing now?
[93:21] B: I'm calm.
[93:23] A: You are calm?
[93:24] B: I am calm.
[93:25] A: Yeah. What else are you noticing for you?
[93:37] B: I don't know. I'm a little emotional right now, though. I'm a little bit.
[93:42] A: A little sad about.
[93:44] B: I don't know.
[93:45] A: Well, let's check. Got that feeling.
[93:47] B: Just thinking about that made me feel sad.
[93:51] A: Well, what's sad about that?
[93:52] B: I don't know. Sad that it's over. He's gone.
[93:58] A: Oh, so that experience isn't sad?
[94:01] B: I think it's just the fact that he's gone.
[94:04] A: Oh, so how did that. So, yeah, so let's go through that. Because that's the thing that came to mind with this. It's not that experience. Because you're not troubled by that experience now. Right.
[94:17] B: His death, Maybe that's what is troubling.
[94:19] A: Well, there's the aspect of it that's there.
[94:22] B: Yeah.
[94:24] A: I don't know.
[94:24] B: Maybe I miss him.
[94:25] A: I don't know. I don't know.
[94:30] B: What do you think?
[94:31] A: Well, again, it doesn't matter. So you don't have to know. But what just came to mind had everything to do. So where were you when it happened? Because you knew that he got cancer. He had gotten himself clean and sober. Last two years were great. You were traveling. You were doing different things. You guys were connecting in a whole different way than you had when you both had been using an end. In the end. And then he found out that he had cancer. Right, Right.
[94:57] B: Yeah.
[94:57] A: What kind of thing?
[94:59] B: He had a lot of cancer in his body. He had several different types of cancer, but mostly. Mostly in the liver.
[95:05] A: Okay. And that was in Wyoming that you found out. Right. So you're in Wyoming. Right. Traveling.
[95:10] B: We were living there.
[95:12] A: You were living in Wyoming. Okay. Right. Yeah.
[95:14] B: Yeah. Found out he had cancer. Then he had. He had this abruption and had to be rushed to the hospital. Emergency surgery.
[95:27] A: Yes.
[95:27] B: And then we had to leave Wyoming quickly, come back to Florida for support. We didn't have any family up there.
[95:34] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[95:35] B: And it was quick. We found out late December, early January, that he had cancer. And he passed on in April. Yeah, April 18th. So between that time and him passing, you know, it was hard to kind of process the whole time that we were together and, you know, see him go from being. Because when he found out, he was just like you. Nothing wrong with him. He was working just right.
[96:03] A: Yeah.
[96:03] B: Then all of a sudden, he's like two, you know, like £70 and, you know, passing on.
[96:12] A: Right. And you were there when that happened?
[96:14] B: Yes.
[96:15] A: Yeah. So, like, he's in the bed. Is he at hospice or at home? So he is at hospice and you're at hospice house. Okay. And then what happened?
[96:25] B: And then.
[96:26] A: So it's you and him. Is there anybody else there?
[96:29] B: Me.
[96:29] A: Him.
[96:29] B: His brother was there and. Yeah.
[96:34] A: Right.
[96:35] B: And he was just lying there. I was talking to him. We got this. Been a good night together. That last night that he was here, we had to spend a lot of good time together. I was able to just let him know that I've forgiven him for all of this stuff that we going through and, you know, talk to him and thank him for all the good times that we had and, you know, just rub him with oil. You know, rub his body. And then the next morning, you know, we held hands all through the night. Next morning, woke him up, he was still with us. And the nurse lady came in and said she needed to speak with me. The social worker needed to speak with me outside and, you know, about some information for his brother.
[97:28] A: Yes.
[97:29] B: And then when I came back in, he was gone.
[97:32] A: His body stopped. Right. Working.
[97:34] B: Right.
[97:35] A: Right. And then what happened?
[97:38] B: And then he felt the same again, did he? No.
[97:42] A: All right. Because in that moment, though, you didn't know that he wasn't in his body. No, it was just weird.
[97:47] B: Yeah, it was weird. Yeah.
[97:49] A: But now we're getting that his body just stopped working. Right. Not him.
[97:52] B: Not him.
[97:53] A: Right.
[97:54] B: So then also at the same time, I'm trying to, you know, figure out how should I feel in this moment, because he's gone. Like, I don't know. I'm not sad. I'm not happy. I'm not angry. I'm not feeling really anything.
[98:09] A: Right. You're numb.
[98:11] B: Right.
[98:14] A: Which is what happens as soon as you experience a shocking experience like that even if you knew it was coming. Right, right.
[98:23] B: Yeah. So.
[98:25] A: And then there was probably, like, wake funeral thing.
[98:28] B: Yes, Funeral. I mean, all the arrangements had to wait an extra week because family, his family, all over, you know, so making in those arrangements took a long time. You know, going through family history and making the obituary and talking to family and making arrangements and finding hotels and, you know, talking to people that I really didn't want to talk to and then trying to fill that time with, you know, just, you know, being in a place where I didn't really want to be for such a long time. But, you know, I got through it, you know, I don't know.
[99:10] A: Well, and then that was over.
[99:11] B: That was over.
[99:12] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun like driving, right?
[99:16] B: Yeah, yeah. And we did go out to dinner.
[99:19] A: Quite a bit and gone out to dinner. Right. And then before, you know, me even getting this role. Yes. Right. So we got that driving in the car.
[99:27] B: Yes.
[99:27] A: And then before that, we've got, like, the. Having the wake in the funeral and then getting all the arrangers together, calling all the family, doing the obituary. Then we've got you coming back in to the room, and he's not the same. And then you were out to the social worker. Then you had left, and then you'd gotten him up, and then you held hands through the night and you guys had had that interactive thing. And then you were there. And then before that, you know, he'd gone to hospice house. And then before that, you guys had been in Wyoming and he found out that he had cancer. And then before that, you're living there, doing whatever you're doing. Yes. Right. And again, running through it backwards compared to forward. What do you notice?
[100:02] B: I noticed that I'm back there to the place where before he had cancer. We're in Wyoming. We're living a good life. We're doing good things. You know, I remember us going to the mall, and I can remember those things that we did that were fun.
[100:16] A: You're having access to more of who he is and the experiences. See, the interesting thing about all of that for me always goes, if you can't. So you can't lose things that you've acquired. I went to Disney and I have seven kids. Anybody take it away. So you can't lose what you've already acquired. Can you lose things that you don't yet have?
[100:46] B: Yes.
[100:48] A: Can you lose something that you've never acquired? Can you lose what you don't yet have? No. So if you can't lose what You've acquired and you can't lose what you don't yet have, then where's loss? It's weird. What happens if it's when people's bodies stop working? Not them, but it's that their bodies stop working that gives us the sense of that loss.
[101:10] B: Right.
[101:11] A: But ongoingly, the essence of who he is is with you. In you now having access to more of the experience of doing things with him and realizing the transformation that happened with him as he got himself clean and sober. That's right. That's right. And giving him the freedom that it's okay.
[101:36] B: Yeah.
[101:37] A: Because, like, you're okay. Right, Right. Yeah.
[101:43] B: Yeah. That was a really good one because I actually experienced that when we went back and then I was there.
[101:52] A: That's right. Right. And you're having access to more of the experience of doing things with him. Right. And Wyoming is a very different place to live.
[102:03] B: It is beautiful.
[102:05] A: Oh, it's beautiful.
[102:05] B: Love it. Yes, yes. To drive up the mountains. We live in Casper.
[102:10] A: Nice. Yes.
[102:11] B: Beautiful place.
[102:12] A: Yeah.
[102:12] B: We lived in North Dakota before we lived in Wyoming.
[102:15] A: Wow. All right.
[102:17] B: We did some traveling now. We really did. We had a great time.
[102:21] A: Right, right. And as you're thinking about all that now, just check. What do you notice?
[102:27] B: I'm happy.
[102:27] A: You are. Right. Isn't that a good news? It is.
[102:31] B: Yeah. I'm smiling.
[102:32] A: You are. Yeah. Yeah. So things are beginning to lighten and lift.
[102:38] B: Yes.
[102:39] A: Right. Right. And we want to do another. Because we know that there's been lots of stuff that happened long time ago. Right. That we want unplugged. What's one of those other experiences early on.
[102:57] B: Would be a bad one?
[103:04] A: Maybe somebody doing something to your body that you didn't want them to do it.
[103:08] B: Yeah.
[103:08] A: Yeah. One of those.
[103:12] B: Let me see. Can I. Because this happens, so. Okay.
[103:17] A: There you go.
[103:18] B: So at my aunt's house.
[103:20] A: Yes. That was a fun place to go.
[103:22] B: Yeah, it was fun. I liked going over there.
[103:24] A: But not for those things, though.
[103:26] B: No. Because when it was bedtime, you know.
[103:31] A: Right. So you're at your aunt's house and it's bedtime. Right. Then what happened?
[103:34] B: Everybody's got a bedroom but me, so I sleep on the living room floor.
[103:39] A: Yes. Great job. Right. Yes.
[103:41] B: And then my cousin, he comes in.
[103:44] A: Same cousin. No, different. Right. Good job. Right.
[103:48] B: Comes in and he's laying down there with me. And then he's touching me.
[103:54] A: And then, like, touching your body.
[103:56] B: Yes.
[103:57] A: Touching your chest. Touching between your legs. Right. Some of that felt good. Some of it was weird.
[104:02] B: Yeah.
[104:03] A: Right.
[104:03] B: Goodness where something felt good.
[104:04] A: Right. Then what happened?
[104:06] B: Then he would just, you know, get on top of me.
[104:11] A: Yes.
[104:12] B: And try to penetrate me.
[104:15] A: Yes.
[104:15] B: I would always try to squeeze, of course.
[104:17] A: Right.
[104:17] B: Now, then, you know it would happen.
[104:22] A: Yes.
[104:23] B: And then.
[104:26] A: Well, you stop fighting.
[104:27] B: Yeah.
[104:27] A: Right.
[104:28] B: So it would be done fighting, and then I just let it happen.
[104:32] A: Well, you went away.
[104:33] B: Yeah, Right. That's what it was.
[104:35] A: You went away. Yeah. Right. So you didn't have to be there. By the way, stopping fighting has it get done faster.
[104:43] B: Mm. Yeah. Yeah.
[104:46] A: Right. You didn't know that. Right. But as we look at this thing clearly from where you stopped, he did what he did to the body, then he was done, then he stopped.
[104:56] B: Yeah.
[104:57] A: And then you're back.
[104:58] B: Right, Right.
[104:58] A: And then that was over.
[104:59] B: Yeah.
[104:59] A: And then later on, you did something more fun. Yeah, Right.
[105:02] B: Yes.
[105:03] A: Right. But what we've now begun to learn, because you can remember all that happening and him doing that.
[105:07] B: Yeah.
[105:07] A: Right. You can remember putting your shirt on.
[105:09] B: Yeah.
[105:09] A: Stop putting on your shirt. Well, then stop him from doing that.
[105:12] B: Well, he's not.
[105:13] A: Well, then stop it from happening.
[105:14] B: Well, it's not happening.
[105:15] A: So then where is it going? No longer exists.
[105:16] B: It no longer exists.
[105:17] A: That's right.
[105:18] B: That's right.
[105:19] A: That's what we're wanting to get. Right. But we also want to put the resource in because that you also mastered something in that moment, realizing the fastest way to get something to stop that she didn't like happening was to just stop fighting. Right. Because as we look at that, that is the same skill set that she used later on in life.
[105:45] B: But you know what? I stop, like, when I'm in. And I always. And I've wondered about this for so long. Like, I've always wondered why I hate being in competitive situations. I hate competition. And I always just say, forget it and stop.
[106:03] A: You were thinking that that was a competition, I guess.
[106:06] B: I don't know.
[106:07] A: Well, let's get that rewired.
[106:09] B: Yeah.
[106:10] A: Because here's the deal. First of all, we want to get in that you stopping wasn't about giving up. It was really about getting it to be done faster. And as we look at what happened, even in the situation we dealt with, with your husband, when you stopped, what happened?
[106:35] B: He stopped.
[106:36] A: That's right. That's right. So it became a powerful tool to get something that you weren't comfortable with to stop. Right. That you developed back then. So close your eyes, let that younger, you know, a. That it's over, finished, completed, defeated, that it no longer exists. Let her know that it happening enough to do with you and everything to do with him, that even if some of it felt good, it wasn't because you wanted it, but because body parts touched in certain ways are designed to feel good. So that she gets it, let her know how resourceful she is, that by stopping, it got done faster with the least amount of pain. Right. So that she gets it, that it's not about me, had nothing to do with me, and that it's over. And that she got it to stop. That's right. So that she gets it, let her know how that skill served her well later to get other things to stop so that she gets it. It. Right. And as that you, Marjorie's getting all of that back, then what do you notice happening to her face? That's right. She's smiling. That's right. That's right. And you can open your eyes. That's a good breath. And what's happening now?
[108:24] B: It's feeling lighter. Like I could feel it. I could feel a change, you know?
[108:33] A: Well, you're already feeling the change, aren't you?
[108:36] B: Yeah.
[108:36] A: Yeah. You feel lighter. Right. Because now when you're thinking about it, it doesn't have all the weight. Right. Notice how the weight is lifted and it's easier to move. Right. It'll be easier to get up and do things. Right. Because it's not so heavy.
[108:57] B: Right?
[108:58] A: Right. It's lighter already.
[109:00] B: Yes.
[109:01] A: Right. On the way to even lighter.
[109:03] B: Yes.
[109:04] A: Was there another one of those experience that happened later in life?
[109:09] B: Later in life. All right.
[109:20] A: I'd like you to try something for me. I'd like you to take your hand and just hold it out like this, right? And then I want you to look at that spot right there. And as you're looking at that spot right there, I'm going to take my hand from over here and I'm going to bring it towards your hand so that you can see my hand moving in. But you'll notice something, that before it ever touches your hand, that you'll feel my hand. Isn't that interesting? That you can feel it and notice how it feels very different here than way over there. And you can see it here, that you feel it, which means I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings. That's right. Because who you are can only be touched with love and respect. That's right. So repeat these words. I have a nose.
[110:18] B: I have a nose.
[110:19] A: I have two elbows.
[110:20] B: I have two elbows.
[110:21] A: Ten fingers. Ten fingers and ten toes. But I'M not my nose. I'm not my elbows. I'm not my elbow or my finger or my fingers or my toes.
[110:31] B: Or my toes.
[110:32] A: I have a vagina.
[110:33] B: I have a vagina.
[110:34] A: I'm not my vagina.
[110:36] B: I'm not my vagina.
[110:37] A: My vagina is mine.
[110:38] B: My vagina is mine.
[110:39] A: But it isn't me.
[110:40] B: But it isn't me.
[110:41] A: So they mess with my stuff.
[110:43] B: So they mess with my stuff.
[110:44] A: And it hurt my feelings.
[110:45] B: And it hurt my feelings.
[110:46] A: It screwed up my thinking.
[110:47] B: It screwed up my thinking.
[110:49] A: But you know what?
[110:50] B: But you know what?
[110:50] A: They never touched who I really am.
[110:53] B: They never touched you.
[110:53] A: I really they never count you me.
[110:55] B: They never got me.
[110:57] A: They messed with my stuff.
[110:58] B: They messed with my stuff.
[110:59] A: But they never got me.
[111:00] B: But they never got me.
[111:02] A: Because who I am because who I am can only be touched can only be touched with love and respect.
[111:07] B: With love and respect.
[111:08] A: So they messed with my stuff.
[111:09] B: Well, they messed with my stuff.
[111:11] A: But they never got me.
[111:13] B: But they never got me.
[111:14] A: That's right. Take a big deep breath in. Long exhale. This hand just drops down as you also drift deeper and deeper down inside. That's right. More and more. Healing up to deeper and deeper levels. Dropping in all the way down towards the center. Light, easy flowing energy becoming more and more peaceful and comfortable within you. Realizing that all the resources are there to deal with all that has that is or that might come your way. And that it's beginning to lighten up inside. Even more weight lifted. You're up for from under way up above it all more and more peaceful and clear and free to connect to the people and things that matter to you. And even that energy begins to pour down and in from the top all the way down. The ones that matter, their love inside of you where it's never not been, always been with you. Closer now than when they were in their body because their body's no longer in the way. Always with you. Haven't ever laughed that love. Love is ongoing and you'll be gaining more and more access to the moments, the experiences that you acquired and being with them as it's lighter and as you think about them, feel healing the love pouring all the way down and in and through. Connecting and lightening up. Fueling your passion to make a difference. That's right. All of that happening now inside you. That's right. Comfortable in your own skin and okay to be in you. Feeling. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. Pouring in, filling all the way Up. That's right. Lighter and clear. Strong, solid, resourceful. And even in. Easier on you.
[114:49] B: That's right.
[114:53] A: Feeling good about what you're up to, what you're doing. Satisfaction in having done what you're doing. Lightening. Up and up and up and up. And then when you're ready, big deep breath in. Then a long exhale. And then one more deep breath in. And you can open your eyes. Yeah. And what's happening now?
[115:55] B: This feel really. Lightning. Just feel like a lot less tin in my head.
[116:04] A: Yeah, I bet.
[116:06] B: Not stress.
[116:07] A: I bet.
[116:09] B: Yeah. It's like I can't feel every part.
[116:13] A: Of my body, you know?
[116:17] B: A lot less weight on me.
[116:18] A: Yeah, there is, isn't there a lot less weight on you?
[116:22] B: Yeah.
[116:23] A: Yeah.
[116:24] B: Like, my arms feel some light.
[116:27] A: They do, don't they?
[116:28] B: They really. Almost like they want to float.
[116:32] A: Yeah. Right. Isn't that a good news thing? So all sorts of things are getting lifted, enlightened and cleared for you. Right. Because as you think back now about the things that we've talked about, like what happened with cousin in the woods, when you think about what happened on the car, when you think about what happened with husband, when you think about having found out about your son, when you think about having been in hospice with us, when you think about all that stuff now, what are you noticing?
[117:09] B: It's nothing.
[117:10] A: Yeah.
[117:12] B: It's just words.
[117:13] A: Yeah. It's not doing the same thing to you.
[117:17] B: It's not.
[117:18] A: It's a back pool.
[117:19] B: That is. That's pretty awesome.
[117:23] A: Yeah.
[117:24] B: That's really awesome.
[117:25] A: Right? That's what you're noticing. That's really awesome, right?
[117:30] B: Yeah. Okay. Okay.
[117:36] A: And as those things are changed, they can't go back the other way. Because the. The phenomenon is I was troubled because my brain didn't know that it had stopped. So when my brain gets that it stopped, the troubling feelings go away. They're not there. I don't have them anymore. So that part transforms and changes. And just like Santa Claus, when you learn that he's not real, when you become aware that he's a fictitious character, can you ever go back to believing in him?
[118:22] B: No.
[118:23] A: Right, right. That also changes this whole thing where it's been about me. So now I want you to think about being in a situation that you might encounter where normally you'd be, like, having all sorts of concerns about, well, geez, I don't know whether I'm gonna say the right thing to this person. I kind of almost feel like I'm on that. That feeling that you get that kind of like, I'm kind of on the fringe, kind of on the outside. I don't really feel like I fit. I'm not really sure how to say stuff. I want you to get that feeling now. Got it? Yeah. Right. Now grab a hold of that feeling tone and let that feeling. Let that feeling tone guide you back. Let that feeling tone grow you earlier and younger towards an experience that you might not think, could relate or might. But the feeling tone is going to take you back to an earlier other and it's going to bring that moment to mind now. That's right. And what just came to mind?
[119:26] B: I don't know.
[119:28] A: Hi.
[119:35] B: We have a kid at school.
[119:37] A: Yeah, Right. There we are. And you're about how old and what might have happened? Probably 12. You're like 12, so middle school years. Right. And you're like in school or out of school?
[119:48] B: In school.
[119:49] A: In school. Right. And you're in a classroom or hallway.
[119:51] B: No, no, not the hallway.
[119:52] A: You're in a hallway.
[119:53] B: Right.
[119:53] A: In the room. Might happen then.
[119:55] B: You know, kids are in a group.
[119:58] A: Right.
[119:58] B: And I'm not.
[119:59] A: Right. So they're all together and then you are.
[120:02] B: I feel like, you know, like. I don't know, just feel all jittery, scared.
[120:11] A: Right. Good. Then what might happen next?
[120:13] B: Then I turn around and go the other direction so I don't have to.
[120:16] A: Walk the other direction. Right?
[120:18] B: Yeah.
[120:18] A: And then that particular thing ended.
[120:20] B: Yeah.
[120:20] A: Right.
[120:20] B: Yeah.
[120:22] A: And again, we want to get that in because you can remember all that happening and doing that. You remember putting on your capris. Yeah. Well, stop putting on your capris. Well, then stop turning around.
[120:32] B: Well, I'm not.
[120:33] A: Well, then stop them from standing in a group. Well, I'm not.
[120:35] B: They're not.
[120:36] A: Right. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[120:38] B: No longer exists.
[120:39] A: Again. Here's the weird thing. That you thought you not being a part of that. No. That there was something wrong with you. Is there anything wrong with you?
[120:50] B: No.
[120:53] A: Had nothing to do with you. Right. And there's interesting things. So the kid carries the tray in the cafeteria and he drops it and it splatters. And the cafeteria was once loud. Now it's quiet. Everybody turns, they all look, they're all singing. The kid is mortified, embarrassed, wants Harry Potter's invisibility cloak let me disappear and get out of here. He's feeling. They're all laughing at me. But are they? No, they're laughing at what? Laughing at what happened. Because would it have mattered whether it was that kid or any other kid? Having that experience.
[121:27] B: No.
[121:28] A: Isn't that what they would have done?
[121:30] B: That's what they would have done.
[121:31] A: Right. So it wouldn't have mattered if there was you or any other kid, not a part of that group. That's how they would have been. You had been thinking that it had something to do. There was something wrong with you.
[121:47] B: Yeah.
[121:47] A: Right. But as we're looking at it now, was there?
[121:50] B: No.
[121:50] A: Right. So now close your eyes and let that, you know, over. And that there's nothing wrong with me. Nothing to do with me. So that she gets it. Wouldn't it matter whether it's me or any other kid that was by myself? Right. So that she gets it. Right. Right. And then let her know that it's not so great to always be a part of certain groups. And would you really actually want your middle school years to be the best years of your.
[122:31] B: No.
[122:34] A: No. You wouldn't want that. You want it to continue to get better as life moves forward. Right, right, right. Yeah. And have her realize that it already has and is. Hi. And what's happening now? There we go. Yeah.
[123:01] B: There's free freedom.
[123:03] A: Freedom, right.
[123:04] B: Yeah. This like.
[123:05] A: I don't. I don't know.
[123:07] B: It's okay.
[123:08] A: It is.
[123:09] B: Yeah.
[123:10] A: Right. So you might be in a situation and there might be somebody, and you might not be sure. What. What do you notice? How are you feeling now?
[123:19] B: I feel okay. I feel like I'm okay. I feel like I don't have. I don't have to be worried about it.
[123:29] A: Well, you're not worried about it, aren't you?
[123:30] B: I'm not worried about it.
[123:31] A: Right.
[123:32] B: That's right.
[123:32] A: Notice how different that is.
[123:34] B: Yes.
[123:35] A: Yeah.
[123:35] B: I'm not worried about it.
[123:36] A: Right. Because you're just going to say whatever shows up to say.
[123:39] B: Yes.
[123:40] A: Right.
[123:40] B: Right.
[123:41] A: Because what we're learning is you have all the resources you need. It's already there. To deal with all the uncertainty. There's so much about your life that you've gone through that you didn't know how it was going to turn out. And you made it through it despite all the uncertainty. And there are moments when you were going through certain things you didn't know whether you're going to make it through it or not. You did. And you have. Not only that, you have a heart.
[124:12] B: Yes.
[124:12] A: To really help others. Right. Oh. And that you can really, like, you know, truly relate. That's right. To them. That's right. You can truly relate to them genuinely. Right. Which was the thing that you were really afraid of.
[124:29] B: Yeah.
[124:30] A: I'm just Kind of pretending. Right. But can't you genuinely relate? That's right. And, you know, genuinely relax. Isn't like, oh, my life is always wonderful and great. Sometimes I get sad. Right. Sometimes I get sad, and I'm not even sure why. Right. It's about that open authenticity. That's right. That you have the freedom to be because you don't have that kind of evaluation thing in the way anymore. Got it.
[125:04] B: That thing is gone. That thing's gone. And it's been there. It's like. It's been this big thing, like, right there.
[125:12] A: Right.
[125:13] B: It's really gone.
[125:15] A: Notice how it's not there now. Yeah. Right.
[125:16] B: It really is.
[125:17] A: Yeah.
[125:18] B: Wow.
[125:19] A: Isn't that cool?
[125:20] B: That is. That's amazing. That's amazing. Oh, my God. Yes.
[125:27] A: Yeah.
[125:28] B: It's been, like, this big thing.
[125:29] A: Yeah.
[125:31] B: Wow.
[125:32] A: And now it's not in the way.
[125:33] B: It is not.
[125:34] A: That's right.
[125:35] B: I love it.
[125:36] A: Thank you. Yeah. Absolutely.
[125:39] B: Thank you.
[125:41] A: Wow.
[125:41] B: Wow. Okay.
[125:44] A: Yeah. So what are you noticing for you now?
[125:47] B: I'm noticing I feel ready to move forward. I feel like I could do some things.
[125:55] A: Yeah.
[125:55] B: Yeah.
[125:56] A: With a lot more ease.
[125:58] B: Right.
[125:58] A: Because you're already doing things. So you never stopped doing things. Now it'll just happen with more ease. Right. And that you actually get to have the internal joy of it. Mm.
[126:12] B: Yes. Yes. That's gonna be amazing.
[126:17] A: Yeah.
[126:18] B: I can't wait to get out there and start dusting. I can't wait to go and start talking to people.
[126:24] A: I want to go talk to some people, Right? Yeah. Yeah.
[126:29] B: I'm getting ready. When I leave here, I'm gonna go talk to someone and I'm gonna see. Because I've been dreading this. Not dreading it, but just kind of in my head about it, about how the interaction is going to take place, you know, how they're gonna see me, what they're gonna think about me, whatever. But now I'm just like, I'm ready. I want.
[126:46] A: Are you even considering what they're gonna think about you?
[126:49] B: I don't know. No, I'm not. I'm not at all. I don't care. I just want to say that again. I don't care.
[126:54] A: Right. Right. Which has never been that way. It's not right. Because what's happened is you're more good inside with you, and therefore you're more outwardly focused. What got jammed in the wrong direction is that it's about me. It's not about you. It's not right. So you're gonna have a much easier time observing what's going on over there and understanding stuff about what's going on over there, and that's gonna be huge.
[127:28] B: Yes. Wow.
[127:32] A: Yeah. Cool. He did great work today.
[127:36] B: Thank you. You get, too.
[127:38] A: Yeah. Well, awesome. All right. So are we good for now? Yes, I think we are very good. Well, we will stop with that, then.
