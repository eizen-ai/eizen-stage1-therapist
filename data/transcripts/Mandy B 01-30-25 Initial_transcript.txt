[00:00] A: So today is the 30th of January, Mandy. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. This is our first meeting. The recording might be made available and teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:13] B: Yes, sir.
[00:14] A: Okay, so giving it a different understanding. Right. If I broke my foot when I was 11 and I told you about it right now, and I'm as emotional as when I first did it, you're going to look at me like I'm crazy. I just saw this guy walk all around the office, his foot's fine. Why is he upset? On the flip side, I start telling you about what my uncle did to me when I was 11, and I start to get emotional, and you go, well, of course, but why? Right?
[00:50] B: Right.
[00:51] A: Right. Why does the physical wound heal and the emotional wound doesn't? Even though we have the saying, time heals all wounds, and it's 40 years ago. Right. And that's where the error is. The reason that it hasn't healed yet is that it can't heal because the brain doesn't know it ended when it happened. It kind of slammed into the consciousness, and that impression is being experienced as happening, not data about something that happened. I'm still not gonna like that it happened. Right? Nobody goes, hey, you know, it'd be really cool. I'd love to feel great about being raped. Nobody says that, right? Because. But I'm not hurting over that having happened to me because it happened to me. I'm hurting because there's an aspect of my brain that froze it and doesn't know it ended. I survived it. I moved through it. I'm okay. That's a very different thing that we want to do with the brain versus let's amp it up, feel it more, really be emotional about it. Because what I want people to do, because the air, remember, it's this is, that isn't. But part of the brain is reading it as it is. That's why anytime I think about it, anytime I'm in a situation that's similar to it, anytime I'm reminded of it, anytime I'm in a. It causes the feelings, right? Right. Not because somehow my brain is out to get me. It's fucking with me. Just, you know, the part that beats my heart and breathes for me actually wants to work in ways that are best. But see, if there's a rabbit sitting inside and there's a fox outside the door, and the rabbit can see the fox, there is nothing we can tell the Rabbit to calm down, bunny, you're inside.
[02:49] B: Fox can't get you, right?
[02:51] A: You're safe. Yeah, Fox off. Right. And that's why sometimes it's more intense, because for an animal's survival, the sooner and the more intensely I respond to perceived threat, the faster or better chance I have to escape it. Right? The rabbit who heard the twig snap unexpectedly bolts and takes off. The one who heard the twig snap unexpectedly and thought it might be his friend George. Oh, fuck.
[03:27] B: Right?
[03:28] A: So that's why it's sometimes intense. So the first error, Mandy, is that there's an aspect of the brain that doesn't know certain awful experiences ended. Right? Second thing with any of the awful things we go through, whether they be things that I feel were my fault or things that, you know, the meanings that get attached to all awful experiences make me feel worse about me at an identity level. Like somehow it was my fault or I should have known better, I shouldn't have put myself in that situation, or I shouldn't have said that thing or, or, or. Right. So with all negative experiences, it feels like it means more about me. And that's because when we were little and impressionable, we were lied to by the adults in society. Little kids are lied to. They're told, life is good and when you're good, your life will be good, and then you get to live happily ever after. All things for little children teach the same messages. Good happens when you're being good. I give you hugs, kisses, candy, presents. Once a year, some dude you don't know drops gifts off. I mean, good things happen when you're good, which is great. Life is always good for everybody. But it isn't. And the error isn't that lie. It's that if that is true, then the opposite must be true too. If it's bad, it's my fault. If it's bad, it's because there's something wrong with me. It's bad. I must have done something wrong. Because bad things only happen when you're bad. Now you as an adult totally know that fucked up bad shit happens whether I've done anything bad or not, right? But where it gets stuck and at that deeper level. Because that's what got layered in first at the deepest. When I'm emotionalized, I'm not logical, right? Nobody is highly logical and rational and reasonable. When they're in a state of high emotion. When they're in a state of high emotion, they're in a state of low intelligence. Because the part of the brain that's taking over is the part that's most in common with simple beings like reptiles or animals. And their brains are motivated. You know, fight, flight, freeze, do something. Get something to stop. Solve problems like it's not logical. So if it's bad, and I learned when I was little that bad equals me bad, then of course I feel worse. So the kid's dad is gone, out of the picture. Left mom. Well, left him too. But two kids. Doesn't think to himself it's a dad issue. Feels like if I was more lovable, my dad would be around, right? If dad said, I'm gonna go to the baseball game and doesn't show up, the kid doesn't go, right. My dad's a drunken bender. Loser. Doesn't get to see me pitch the no hitter right now. That's not what it all feels like. It's about me. Make sense, Right? Same thing with, like, you know, the. The girl went out with a guy that she. One of her co workers introduced her to, was a friend of hers. She went out on a date. She liked him nice enough, but it wasn't any, like, chemistry thing. So, you know, he dropped her off at her apartment, she gave him a peck on the cheek, and there we go. He's like, I'm so sorry. I need to use the restroom. No, she's not thinking anything. She's not gonna be a jerk. Well, sure, go ahead and use the restroom. Whatever. She had no idea that when he came out, he was gonna force himself on her and rape her. It's fucking horrible. I mean, fucking horrible. Worse is what she starts telling us. Because she says things like, you know, I was being so stupid and careless. I never should have let him in. I should have known better.
[06:50] B: Yeah.
[06:50] A: No, we all go. Yeah. No, but you get it, that when it's stuck for her, it's all feeling that way. And that's because the second thing, bad happens when I'm bad. And that's why with those two things active, my brain is searching, scanning the environment, looking at all times for anything that's similar to what I went through. The problem with that is that similar gets read as identical. So the soldier is diving on the ground when the firework bursts in the air. Not because he didn't know he was at a fourth of July celebration. He's the guy that lit the firework. It's that the other part confused the sound with the grenade. Makes sense.
[07:43] B: Yeah, like a lot of those.
[07:44] A: Yeah, right?
[07:45] B: Yeah.
[07:46] A: The girl gets raped by the guy wearing a Taylor Swift shirt. Now Is not a good time to not be into Taylor Swift. She's everywhere. Of course, the issue when she was being raped was not the name on the T shirt, it was what he was doing to her. But they co occur. Yep. So they got merged. Right. So the brain continues to run all of that in us until we turn the lights on by getting in the good news that it ended. Because the part, Mandy, that's making us feel is the part that works like an animal. And it's only trying to get us to get it to our logical brain goes, it already stops. So it can't possibly be causing the guilt or the grief or the shame or the hurt or the pain because it wants me to get the moment to stop. I already know the moment stopped. It must be causing it because I should have done this, or it's because I'm more this way. Do you follow me? And that's what we want to get unplugged, right? And that's what we want to do. So how do you go about doing something like that? It's actually really, really simple. And it only requires one thing.
[09:03] B: What's that?
[09:04] A: Oh, you do want to know what it is. I do want to know.
[09:09] B: Like, what's that?
[09:10] A: Right. The one thing is you have the intention of being with me. The reason you want to be with me now is that this is what we're doing. I'm a happening guy. This is what's happening. And any of that past stuff is not right. Two, we're working on a goal which we haven't gotten to yet, but we're going to be working on an outcome. How do we want you to be when we're done? Because nobody would care about the fucked up shit that I went through in life if now is working the way that I wanted it to. Meaning if I was feeling and thinking and acting and reacting and doing the things in the way that I want to, I wouldn't care about any of that stuff. The reason we do is we get that at some level it's fucking up me in my relationships and how I interact with shit. Right? It might be that I'm, you know, more uncomfortable in groups or social situations. It might be that I know I should do this thing and I'm just not finding myself doing it, even though I know it'd be good for me to do. Or I'm doing these other things and I'm like, shit, I don't want to be doing these things. Or I'm reacting to things in ways that I don't want to react or I'm having nightmares, or I'm having night terrors or I'm having flash or I'm like all the different things that are going on that are kind of screwing up how I interact with my day to day world. That's really what we want to get better. Right. So for you, if we could be changing problematic ways that you've been feeling, thinking, act and reacting, what do we want our time to do for you? What do we actually want to get better? I mean one, certainly we want to get the impact that the prior stuff has had going, so it's not weighing on you. So any of the anger, hurt, self, blame, grief, guilt, like that, that's lifted and you get to be more at peace. So certainly that's already on the board. But what else do we want our time to do for you? How do you want to be when we're done?
[10:51] B: I want to be free.
[10:52] A: Yeah. Right.
[10:54] B: Yeah, I want to be free. I want to be like, you know, like I, I've done a lot of work, you know, to get where I am today. Like, you know, and I want to be able to enjoy and, and be free, just ultimately free of any of it. Like.
[11:09] A: Right. What would it be like? Just as a, you know, thought experiment, what would it be like for you to be free?
[11:19] B: To be free to me is just.
[11:23] A: Like, how would your body be feeling if you were free?
[11:26] B: Yeah.
[11:27] A: What would it be like up here being free?
[11:30] B: You know, a little bit of it. I've, I've already, I'm like, you know, I'm glad to be here and you know, and I, I did a lot of work on a lot of the stuff in rehab. I dug, I actually did what I was supposed to do. Like, I, I dug into it, you know, so free to me is good sleep I get at night, you know, you know, just the happiness of being able to show up, you know, for my kids.
[11:56] A: Yeah.
[11:57] B: You know, just being present, you know, and to be able to enjoy things in life. Even though like, like you said, there's certain things, there's certain things that my kids like to do that might not be like, you know, triggered, you know, there's certain things that trigger, you know, like certain things that they want to do in life that, you know, I, it's just, I just want to be able to enjoy life with them and not be chained down by all that.
[12:22] A: That's right. Yeah. You want to be free, at peace. Peace and present. Present so that your emotions are matching the current situation and not Being directed by what has or the worry about what might.
[12:40] B: My mind.
[12:40] A: Yeah, got it. We want you to be much more emotionally present. We want you to be much more at peace and comfortable in your own skin so it's easier for you to enjoy the things that matter to you.
[12:54] B: Yeah.
[12:55] A: We want the effect that the prior stuff has had recent or decades ago to be completely unplugged so it no longer runs. Any of that. Yeah, got it.
[13:07] B: Got it.
[13:08] A: That's where we're headed.
[13:09] B: That's where we're headed.
[13:09] A: Okay. And here's the coolest part. Just by considering it and conceiving of it, it's already on the way to it.
[13:17] B: I love that.
[13:18] A: Right. Because if I told you, get in your car and start driving three hours from now, I'm going to tell you where to go, you'd be like, I'll wait. Why would I start driving? And now, three hours from now, you're going to tell me where I could drive in the complete wrong direction.
[13:30] B: Right.
[13:31] A: Right. So once we know where we're going, your brain gets to organize. Then we want to do a process that puts your body in the right state to heal. And the process that we use brain levers that put body at states of rest. Why rest? Because that's what accelerates healing. Healing flus, cold surgery. We tell people to rest.
[13:50] B: I tell my daughter every time she has to stay home from school, you're going to stay in that bed and rest all day. No phone? No. You need rest to get better for the next day. I tell her that every day.
[13:59] A: Yeah. So that's what we want to do is we want to put your body into a state of rest. How we do that first lever is you slightly lower your jaw. So not like, ah, but just a little bit. When you slightly lower your jaw, it activates a cranial nerve called the vagus nerve. And the vagus nerve is one of the only brain nerves that connects to the vital organs in the body. It's really good at moving into parasympathetic, more of a rest state. So you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You begin to breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and then a little bit longer on the way out. And just notice what starts happening as you're breathing in. A little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer. How's your body starting to feel now? Like more tense or more calm. Isn't that cool?
[15:01] B: Yeah.
[15:01] A: The next lever is like moving from a narrowed vision, which is what happens when we're in stressed out mode to an expansive vision. So how it works is you continue to breathe in that way that's a little bit slower and deeper in, maybe even pausing at the top of the inhale, and then exhaling a little bit longer, maybe even pausing at the bottom. As you continue to do this, Mandy, you're going to look across and see my nose, right? You're going to see my fingers. You're going to stay looking at my nose as my fingers move out so that with the sides of your eyes, you pick up my fingers wiggling. Notice that as you're doing this, you become more aware of the space in the room. Right. The space between us and the space beyond me. The space under may be behind you to left or right and even above your head. And again, as you're noticing more space, how's your body starting to feel now? It is more calm. Isn't that cool? Yeah. And then the last little one. Have you ever said or maybe heard somebody use the phrase, I'm under a lot of stress? Right. But here's the literal interpretation that your brain hears in order to be underneath the stress. Where must the stress be? That's right. So we know the reversal is to get out from under and to rise up above it. Having another metaphor, what do we call a bird's eye view? What does that mean? I'm up there and I'm seeing. Everything is under, below. Right. So one more time, your jaw slightly lowers. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You breathe a little bit slower and deeper in, a little bit longer on the way out. As you breathe in this way, you see my nose, my fingers, they go out. You notice the space. You even realize how there's space in this room, but it goes beyond this room. Like literally all the way out to outer space and beyond. That's how much space there is. Okay. As you notice the space, just for a moment, close your eyes. And now with your eyes closed, imagine floating up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof, so that you rise way up above it all in the sky. Having this bird's eye view, you're able to see everything as being underneath, below you. Because you're above, you're over it. And like the bird, you're free to soar, fly, glide, move all around and in different directions and ways. Big, wide, arching turns and curves. You soar, fly, glide, above and over your foot. Free. That's right. Bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you, take a nice slow and deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Right. And again. In those short moments eyes were closed, what were you noticing within yourself?
[18:17] B: It was peace.
[18:18] A: It was peace. That's right. That's right. And so as your body's feeling more peace, the other part of your brain, which is your unconscious, which is the part that doesn't know certain things ended, knows which moments of those things would be useful for us to unplug today. Right. You don't even have to know it, because where we're headed is a you whose peaceful, clear, present and free to connect to the things that matter and experience more joy.
[18:54] B: Joy.
[18:54] A: Yeah. Lighter. Got it. That's where we're headed. So as you and I are organizing towards this, we're going to ask the other part of your brain, which is your unconscious, to travel back down the timeline of negative experiences that have happened in your own history. Brain, a moment, just one time. One thing that would be useful for us to unplug. Yeah. What experience comes to mind?
[19:24] B: God. So I guess a lot is the domestic inexperience.
[19:29] A: One.
[19:30] B: Just one.
[19:30] A: Okay. You got one?
[19:32] B: Yeah.
[19:32] A: I mean, you already had the one that came to mind, right? Yeah.
[19:34] B: The domestic relationship with my first child's father.
[19:38] A: So that. And we want to think of one thing that happened. You got an experience?
[19:42] B: Yeah, he busted me in the head with a brick.
[19:44] A: That would be useful. All right, so how we clear something really, really simple. Right. Intend to be with me. This is. That isn't working on the goal that we both want for you? I'm a little more fun than a sucky moment. You know, the bar's not set high, but I'm hoping, right?
[19:59] B: Yes.
[19:59] A: 2. When you tell it to me, we're going to go through just the facts. In a minute or less, it'll go, that happened, that happened.
[20:05] B: That happened.
[20:05] A: That happened. That happened. That was done. 3. That happened about how long ago now.
[20:11] B: My son was born, so. God, 20 years ago.
[20:15] A: 20 years ago. Right. So there have been lots of things you've done in between then and now that were more enjoyable than that.
[20:20] B: Yeah.
[20:20] A: What's one thing?
[20:21] B: The birth of my son. Yeah.
[20:22] A: Having your son. Right.
[20:23] B: Good.
[20:24] A: I'm good with something else.
[20:27] B: Yeah.
[20:29] A: I mean, successfully completing the program.
[20:32] B: Yes.
[20:32] A: Whether that be the one when you were in jail or, you know, Crossroads. Right.
[20:35] B: Yeah.
[20:36] A: Right. Something else that you've done that was fun in life in the past 20 years.
[20:39] B: Took my son to Disney.
[20:40] A: Yeah. Going to Disney with it. Right. All of those moments happen after that moment, there's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond it. So we actually have good news to get in.
[20:49] B: Okay.
[20:50] A: So then we just go through the moment when that one happened. You're where?
[20:53] B: Jackson, Mississippi.
[20:53] A: So you're in Jackson, Mississippi. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[20:56] B: Daytime.
[20:56] A: Daytime. And you're where? Like, in a house or an apartment? Outside. So you're on the street. Good job. Right. And, like, you're walking. You're just standing there.
[21:02] B: I was standing there.
[21:03] A: Right, Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[21:04] B: I called him a.
[21:05] A: So you. He was there, too. Yeah. And you're like, you. Yeah. Arguing back. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[21:11] B: He said, call me a. Again. I'm Bust your neck.
[21:13] A: Right. Good job. Right. So. And you said, right, Good. Right. And he's like, well, smack.
[21:19] B: And he bust. Behind the. He bust me in the head with the brick.
[21:21] A: Right. Did the brick break?
[21:23] B: It didn't. He didn't.
[21:25] A: No. So it whacked. You asked the question. You kind of went down. Right. And what happened next?
[21:28] B: He kind of happened and started beating.
[21:29] A: The ground, and he hit ID a bunch of times. Right, good. And then what happened next?
[21:32] B: With my face open.
[21:33] A: Right. How you doing right now, by the way?
[21:34] B: I'm okay.
[21:35] A: I know you're here. Hi.
[21:35] B: Yeah, I'm here. You're right.
[21:36] A: Good job. You're here.
[21:37] B: Right.
[21:38] A: This is Right. So then he split your break. Good. And then what happened next?
[21:41] B: He walked away.
[21:42] A: He got off you.
[21:43] B: Yeah.
[21:43] A: Which was better than when he was hitting you.
[21:44] B: Yeah.
[21:44] A: Right. And then he walked away.
[21:46] B: Then I was able to kind of subconsciously drive myself to my sisters.
[21:50] A: And then you got to your sisters. And then that was over.
[21:52] B: That was over.
[21:52] A: And then later on, you did something more fun, like have your son.
[21:55] B: Yeah.
[21:55] A: Or complete the programs or, you know, go to Disney, because it seems. Right. Good. Got it. So notice, as you were telling me about it, there was a little discomfort. Less. Because you're intending to be here. Here.
[22:04] B: Yeah.
[22:04] A: Right. But when we go backwards, this crazy thing, when you go backwards with a memory, it literally unplugs it and takes away the charge. Watch what happens. So you got going to Disney with your son. We got, you know, getting out, doing the programs. We got having your son. Right. And then you're at your sister's, and then you got to your sister's, and then he walked away. And then he got off of you, and then he was hitting you.
[22:22] B: Yeah.
[22:23] A: And then he had got on top of you and Then he whacked you with the brick, and he said. And then you called him bitch. He said, if you call me bitch again. And then you called him bitch. And then you guys were arguing, and then you went out to that area. And before that, you're doing whatever you're doing now again, watch. As I went backwards, right. Compared to forward, what'd you notice happened in the feelings? I know. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Right. Because for the first time, your brain is able to experience it as data.
[22:47] B: Okay.
[22:48] A: About something that happened, not happening. Third, emotional brain doesn't get logic, but it does get patterns of association. And the error always is that the memory and the experience are glued together so they live as if they're the same thing. But there are things that you can remember doing today that you know you're not doing right now. Like, for example, putting on your pants. They're on. So clearly you can remember where you were when you put them on this morning.
[23:15] B: Yeah, that's right.
[23:18] A: So if I said, you remember getting dressed, putting your pants on, and then I went, mandy, stop putting on your pants, you would look at me and go, I am not putting on my pants. Because what's clear is there's a difference between my memory of doing it and actually doing it. Got it. Just like putting on your glasses, you can remember doing it. Stop putting on your glasses. You'd be like, I'm not putting on my glasses. Right. If I said to you stop me from putting on my shirt, you would look at me and go, you're not putting on your shirt. Because again, it's the difference between memory and experience. So we want to do the same thing. You can remember that happening. Him saying, calling bitch. And you do it. And why can't you be. You can remember all that happening. You can remember putting your pants on. Mandy, stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants. We'll stop him from hitting you with a brick. Say, he's not hitting you. We'll stop him from pine. He's not doing that. We'll stop it from happening. It's not happening. So then where is that experience? Say it no longer exists. That's right. And again, as that starts to get in, what do you notice?
[24:20] B: Peace.
[24:21] A: Right now, you back then, thought some of him doing that had something to do with you.
[24:25] B: Me? Yeah.
[24:26] A: Right. But as we look at it clearly, we'll get to that. That's not uncommon. It's super, super common.
[24:36] B: Super common. Yeah.
[24:36] A: It is. Because of a. Of a process that's going on that the person doesn't know is going on unconsciously. It's all the world of intermittent reinforcer with psychological manipulation, coercion, power, influence, control. Like all of that is wrapped together. And I don't always know that that's going on as it's going on. So how come it's so hard to get away when awful shit happens? Because I'm trapped in a cage that I didn't know I was in.
[25:08] B: Okay.
[25:09] A: Right. I had a girl that I worked with, different like trafficking thing that I've ever experienced because she wasn't farmed out to other people. She didn't have to do. But the guy started grooming her when he's 35 years older. Started grooming her when she was 14. Right. And carried through. She's 32, just got out. How could. I couldn't. How come I couldn't get out earlier? Well, you weren't leaving a boyfriend, you were leaving a trafficker. It's a whole different story.
[25:37] B: Yeah.
[25:37] A: You didn't get to choose him as a boyfriend because he started when you were 14 and he was, you know, if he's 35 years older and she's 14, what is he then? 49.
[25:48] B: Right.
[25:51] A: Like, right. Not boyfriend. No, no. Right. Trafficking.
[25:57] B: Trafficking, yeah.
[25:58] A: That's why it's hard to get out unless you've got support. Unless you start exposing it into the light. Yeah, right. But we don't want to like, share. Hey, by the way. Right. Few short people get to know that information. Right. So what we want to get into the earlier you is that that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was screwed up with him. Do you follow me with that? Like, screwed up that even if somebody calls me a bitch, okay. So I'm justified in hitting them with a. Literally with a brick. A brick. It's not like metaphorical. Right.
[26:31] B: Ten sables in my head, I ended up my own cheek glued up like.
[26:34] A: Yeah, right. Yeah, got it. So that earlier you though, was feeling that if I had. That had something to do with me. But as we're looking at it, we know that it had nothing to do with you. It had everything to do with him not being well. So close your eyes. Picture the earlier you. Let her know that moment it's over, finished, completed, defeated. It no longer exists. Let her know that that happening to you had nothing to do with you had everything to do with what was up with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Let the you know that you made it through it that you survived it, that you're okay. Let her know about having your son. Let her know about doing her program and getting yourself clean. Let her know about taking her to Disney. Let her know so that she's getting it. Right. And as the you is getting it, what do you notice happening to her face? That's right. Isn't that cool?
[27:24] B: Yeah, Right.
[27:25] A: Notice how she's not stuck there anymore. Right. That's what I mean by updating the brain. So the first thing that happened is we unplugged the memory so your brain could experience it as information. Now, we got your intellect on board, which went. Right. That didn't have anything to do with me. But see, if my intellect is not on board, it doesn't matter what I tell myself if this is still running. Doesn't matter.
[27:56] B: Doesn't matter.
[27:57] A: If the box. Doesn't matter what we tell Bunny.
[28:00] B: Right.
[28:00] A: Not getting in. We have to unplug it. Then what, you know, integrates. Now she's no longer stuck there. Coolest part about it is that getting, like, let's say it's a linchpin, because I'll give it to you. In this metaphor, our brain is not set up like a tree. The rest of our body is. Meaning if I got gangrene in my pinky, we could cut it off. It wouldn't affect the rest.
[28:25] B: Right?
[28:26] A: Right. My brain is the opposite kind of plant in botany. So it would be things like the crab grasses in Florida or mint leaves or mushrooms. It's connected in a rhizomatic way, meaning there's not a single start and end point like the tree. The taproot gets ripped out. Tree's dead.
[28:46] B: Right.
[28:46] A: Rhizomes are connected through multiple layers of multiple links. So there's more than one way to get to one thing. Right. That's how our brain works. So what we just did is we took one experience, which is a linchpin. Right. That's not all of the experiences with him. But as that one starts to lighten up, it starts to spread light to other moments. Make sense?
[29:13] B: Yes.
[29:13] A: And what we're going to do is we're going to select several different experiences that will then create widespread change because it'll start to generalize in the same way. You might not know what I'm thinking about when I said orange. But if I said, like, is it the fruit? Is it the color? Right. But if I said orange, apple, banana, you go fruit. If I said orange, red, green, blue, you'd go cuff. Do I have to list Every one. For your brain. To get it.
[29:52] B: To get it.
[29:53] A: Yep. Got it. So in the same way, if somebody had a ton of molestation happen with an uncle, do I have to go through every time it happened? No, just one. Might make sense to go through a couple.
[30:03] B: Yeah.
[30:04] A: To a few. Because then it'll change the rest. Make sense.
[30:09] B: Yep.
[30:09] A: Yeah. So as you think about that time now, what do you notice? Isn't that cool? It doesn't have that thing anymore. Right. So again, slightly lower your jaw. Relax your tongue. Breathe a little bit slower and deeper in. Exhale a little bit longer. Notice more space. As you're noticing more space, go ahead and close your eyes. And notice that with your eyes closed, you don't see me anymore, but you actually see just the backs of your eyelids. Like when I see the backs of my eyelids. Different hues of colors. Sometimes brighter, sometimes darker. Go ahead and open your eyes. Notice once again you see me. Hi. And what's out in front of you. Isn't that cool? And you close your eyes again and you no longer see me, but you're actually just seeing the backs of your eyelids. And this is where the question gets weird, because without using your memory or your imagination, what do you actually see behind you? Because, Mandy, it might surprise you that what you actually see behind you is nothing.
[31:11] B: Nothing.
[31:11] A: That's right. You see nothing behind you. That's right. And I wonder what it would be like to be in nothing. In no thing. That's right. Just kind of floating, drifting in. Nothing. That's right. What's it like? Because I again, don't know whether you know that in nothing, everything exists as a potentiality. I mean, nothing exists, but it all exists as a potentiality. And nothing. The Buddhists like to call it the void. That's right. Take a deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. And again, that other part is going to travel back down the timeline of moments of sucky things that happen in. Bring another movie. Yeah. And what comes to mind?
[31:59] B: Oh, God, just the.
[32:02] A: You got one. Isn't that cool? That one happened how long ago? You're doing great. I'm proud of you. It's over. This one.
[32:11] B: I mean, this one happened. God, 2013.
[32:17] A: Yeah.
[32:19] B: My mom died and I was.
[32:21] A: So when that one happened, you're where?
[32:23] B: I was in Vermont.
[32:25] A: Okay. Do you have any particular beliefs around what happens when people die?
[32:31] B: Okay. I. I don't. I. I don't understand it. It's the truth. I've always said that it's an unexplainable emotion. To me, death is. It's really weird to experience, and I've experienced a lot of it. That's why it's just like, I. I don't like for someone to be here one moment and then just like, for your whole life, and then. Then, like, you know, poof, they're gone. And especially someone like my mother.
[32:56] A: And that's the part that it feels like they're gone. They're gone. Like they're gone.
[32:59] B: They're gone.
[32:59] A: What if they're not gone? Yeah, I know that's weird. What do you mean?
[33:03] B: It is weird? Because I. I do feel like that too. Like, you know that I know there's days that I definitely feel my mom's presence.
[33:09] A: Let me give you a thought on that. Because. Because it's not a religious thing, right? It's a. It's a different way to kind of think about it, but I think it'll make a lot of sense. So if we took a glass of ice and we put it out on the patio in Florida, and an hour goes by, kid comes by and looks and goes, hey, somebody stole your ice and replaced it with water, we would laugh to ourselves, but educate the child that nobody stole the ice. It melted, which means it went from a solid state to a liquid state. But the molecule that is making it up totally stayed the same. It's H2O. Is H2O. Kid looks at it, gets it, understands it. We leave it out there on for a week. Kid comes back, looks at it, it's now gone. There's no water in it. He's like, somebody stole the water, somebody drank it. But nobody drank it. Nobody stole it. It evaporated. He goes, what's that? Went from liquid state to gas state because, okay, but the molecule of H2O, totally the same how we pick it up completely changed again. And he goes, yeah, but if I don't see it, how can I feel it? I go, right, you live in Florida. It's all around you. And then we put him in the desert of Arizona. We go, you don't feel any of it here, do you? He goes, no. And we bring him back to Florida, we show him the rain cloud, and we capture the water, and he goes, oh, it's all the same thing. So the weird thing to think of is, what if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, it's that their body stop, right? And because they're no longer in need of it, they exited. We just don't pick them up in the same way we did. But it doesn't mean that they're not here. See, the thing we want to remember is that our five senses, which is how we experience the external world, are limited in scope. We have a headset on that only shows us what we need to know to survive. There's more going on than we can sense and feel, right? In this same way, intuitive sense and feel is a whole different thing. Sense and feel, essence of mom. Whole different thing, but tangible, touchable. See, hear, right? We know that I can blow a whistle. And for us, there's no sound. But the dog is going. It's making a noise. We just can't perceive it. Because our senses are limited. We know that we can turn the radio on in the vehicle. We can start listening to the radio. But the radio waves didn't just pop up there when the radio got turned on. They're here right now. I don't feel any of them, right? I can be sitting next to the guy who's got a kilo of coke on him. I don't know any of that. The dog, though, definitely knows. Do you follow me?
[35:43] B: I do.
[35:44] A: Because our senses are limited. And so Einstein, who was a freaking brilliant guy, and the only reason I say that is because everybody sends him, who's super smart, is called an Einstein. He said, who we are is energy plus matter, and that is what equals the physical existence. And then what became the second law of thermal dynamics? The energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. So when people's bodies stop, what if it's not that they stop? It's that their body stops, and because they're no longer in need of it, they exited. We don't pick them up in the same way we did, but it doesn't mean that they're not here.
[36:21] B: Right?
[36:21] A: And then I had a woman one time tell me, she says this in a really harsh voice. She goes, I just need to tell you a secret. Okay, that's kind of scary. First of all, I don't like people telling me secrets. She goes, my parents are in my closet. And she goes, no, no, no, no, no. The remains of my parents are in my closet. I go, no, no, no. That's not even what remains of your parents. That's what remains of their body, right? What remains of your parents is in the experiences that you acquired in being with them. And you can't actually lose those experiences. You might lose access to them, but you can't lose the experiences. But you can't also lose something that you never had. We never had the Future. So the weird thing goes, if I can't lose what I've acquired and I can't lose what I don't yet have, where's the loss? Maybe it's that the body stops and it's transforming my relationship. And then the last part that gets conflictual is my pain is the one thing that keeps them connected to me. My hurting is proof positive of how much they matter to me. And it's coming out of my love for them. Except they're not better off. Mom is not better off knowing that every time you think about her, you feel shitty and sad and hurting. Do you follow me? Yeah. She's not going. Hey, I hope Mandy really.
[37:43] B: Right.
[37:43] A: Right.
[37:44] B: No. Yeah.
[37:44] A: Right. Just like your love for your mom hasn't gone anywhere.
[37:48] B: Right.
[37:48] A: It hasn't left. Her love for you hasn't gone anywhere. It hasn't left. The only difference is she feels yours, you haven't been feeling hers. Only because the shock of knowing her the way you used to is blocking access to more of who she is. And that's what we want to get lifted, is we want you to be connecting to more of what matters to you.
[38:10] B: Right.
[38:11] A: Right. And feeling mom more with you. Right. And it's how you found out, because that thing happened. You're. You were where I was with Eric died. Yeah. Right. So that's the thing. So you're aware as this happens.
[38:26] B: Yeah, Right next to her.
[38:27] A: But where? What location?
[38:28] B: Oh, we were in New Hampshire.
[38:30] A: She were in New Hampshire. Right. And are you like at hospice or at the house?
[38:32] B: She was in the house. I brought her home.
[38:34] A: So she was at the house. Right. And she's laying like in a bed downstairs or up in her bed. Right. And like, is that in a bedroom or.
[38:41] B: Her bedroom?
[38:41] A: Yeah. So she's in the bedroom. She's laying in the bed. And it's you and who else is there?
[38:45] B: Just me.
[38:46] A: Just you. So you're there with Mom. Right? She's laying in the bed. Right.
[38:49] B: She was dying.
[38:49] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[38:52] B: She took her last breath.
[38:53] A: Right. So she stopped breathing. Yeah. Right. And you've heard that weirdness and then you probably touched the body.
[38:59] B: Yeah, I hugged her.
[39:00] A: Right. Be here. Hi. Right. And notice how when you were hugging her, then she didn't feel the same. That's cuz she wasn't in her body. That's right. So then you hugged her and then like, what happened next?
[39:13] B: We'll call the paramedics.
[39:14] A: Yeah, called the paramedics. They came. They knew that. Right. And then they Might have taken. She went to.
[39:19] B: Do not resist.
[39:20] A: Right. Good job of detail. Right.
[39:21] B: Yeah.
[39:21] A: Right.
[39:22] B: And then they took her.
[39:23] A: Right. And they took the body. And then there was probably a wake or funeral after.
[39:27] B: Oh, she really didn't want one. We just had immediate family still something.
[39:30] A: Like celebration of life.
[39:31] B: Yeah.
[39:33] A: And then that was over. Yeah. And then later on, you did something more fun, like, you know, successfully complete your program and take your time to Disney.
[39:40] B: Yeah, that's right.
[39:41] A: Have your son.
[39:42] B: Yeah, Right. No, he was already born.
[39:44] A: Oh, well, good. So we got going to Disney. Right. We got getting out of your program.
[39:48] B: Yeah.
[39:49] A: Right. And then there was like the, you know, family gathering. Celebration of life. Right. And then they take in the body, and then they got there, and then you had called, and then you would hug the body, and then mom had taken the last breath, and then you were there. And then you'd sent the other people out, and then they were there. And then before that, you had mom in the room. Then before that, you brought her back home. Then before that, she was wherever she was. And as we go backwards again compared to forward, what are you noticing? Notice how your brain is starting to read it as data. Right. When it reads it as data, we open up access, because there's the moment of loss. Right. Moment of that moment. And then there are all of the other moments that you experience in being with mom through all the years that you were with Mom. Which is there more of that one moment or all of the other moments? That's right. See, we want you to have access to more of the moments involved. That's what's starting to happen. Make sense?
[40:45] B: Yep.
[40:46] A: Right. So again, you can remember that happening. You can also remember putting on your pants. Well, Mandy, stop putting on your pants. I'm not putting on my pants. That's right. Stop me from putting on my pants, and I'm not putting on your pants. Right. Well, stop mom from taking her last breath. She's not taking her last breath. We'll stop that from happening. See, that is not happening. So where is that moment? See, that moment no longer exists. Can I remember? Yeah. I have a memory of it. Is the memory the same thing as the experience? No. I remember passing a yellow school bus. Does that mean I have a yellow school bus in my head? No. No. Got it.
[41:28] B: I got it.
[41:29] A: That's what's starting to happen. And we're going to open up more access to mom because I'm going to show you something. Everybody that I know has played ping pong at least once.
[41:36] B: Yeah.
[41:36] A: Ever played Ping pong. This one doesn't work though, because it's got metal pieces on it. But what's really cool about this one is that when you touch the metal pieces, it makes a noise. Right. So take that hand. Take your index finger. Touch. Notice how it does nothing. Take your other index finger. Touch mine. Over here.
[41:55] B: Oh, that's crazy.
[41:57] A: Now get spooky.
[41:59] B: That's crazy.
[42:00] A: Right?
[42:01] B: Right.
[42:01] A: So what is happening?
[42:03] B: Energy.
[42:04] A: It is. Who are we? What Einstein said energy plus matter. Energy is like a light switch. Right. A light switch, when it's off, has an opening. The energy is not able to flow.
[42:14] B: You have a tissue in here, right?
[42:15] A: Out there, Right. When the energy connects, when the circuit connects, the energy is able to flow. That's why the light turns. Turns on. That's when I'm connected, the energy flows. When there was an opening, the energy didn't flow. When we connected, the energy flow. Right.
[42:33] B: That's awesome.
[42:34] A: Right? Mom's love hasn't gone anywhere. You just haven't been feeling it. Because you thought it was wrapped up in her body. That when her body stopped working, then her love stopped. Right. But what are some of the things that you and mom do that you both like doing?
[42:51] B: Cooking and, you know, playing cards.
[42:54] A: Is there a favorite dish?
[42:56] B: Yeah, she. She made some really good spaghetti. She would. And rice.
[43:01] A: Yeah. So I wonder what it might be like the next time, you know, you're making spaghetti or rice to be feeling mom with you. Sure. That's right. Because you haven't been accessing it. Right. Because that you back then was thinking mom was gone when the body stopped. Stopped. Right. What are we beginning to understand now?
[43:20] B: She's not gone.
[43:21] A: That's right. That her love hasn't gone anywhere. Right. You just haven't been plugged into it. Got it. So close your eyes. Think back to that earlier you. When that happened. Let that earlier you know that that moment is over. That that experience no longer exists. That mom was never her body in the first. First place. That's right. Let the you know that you're okay. Let her know about, you know, completing your programming. Let her know about taking her son to Disney. Let her know. Right. So that she's getting it. Let her know that we're opening up more connections to who mom truly is for you. Which hasn't gone anywhere. That's right. And as the earlier you is getting it. What do you notice now?
[44:11] B: Peace.
[44:12] A: Yeah. And you can open your eyes. Isn't that a good news?
[44:18] B: It was a good day.
[44:20] A: Yeah. Right. And see, this is where we're headed in a multitude of different arenas, we're going to be healing different wounds. The wounds that come up are ones that you're unconscious. Right. The part that is the direct access to the control panel and is running things most of the time frame.
[44:41] B: Right.
[44:43] A: Because most of the things that go on are on autopilot. I don't have to think about it.
[44:47] B: In order to do it.
[44:48] A: Yeah, got it.
[44:49] B: Yeah.
[44:50] A: So that part of your brain is running certain programs in you. We're updating the program.
[44:55] B: Program.
[44:56] A: Right. So it works more in the way that you want it to naturally.
[45:01] B: I like that.
[45:02] A: Yeah.
[45:03] B: Yeah.
[45:03] A: Isn't that a good news thing?
[45:04] B: That is a good thing.
[45:05] A: Yeah. Right. So one last time, just as an integration, your jaw is slightly lowered. You relax your tongue. You breathe a little bit slower and deeper, exhaling a little bit longer, noticing more of the space all around you. Right. As you notice the space, you can close your eyes. And with your eyes closed, your awareness can gently drift down inside, down and in towards the light at your center, where there's an ongoing calm and peaceful, easy flowing energy. The light at the center is you. That light that is you can't get touched or hurt or harmed and is indestructible and whole and complete. Religions like to call it a soul, like a thing I have. But really the fingers and toes are the things you have. The light is you. That's right. Are connecting to more of what matters to you. That's right. Becoming more. Okay, because the last part is, we know now that Mom's no longer her. And there was a period of time when she was going through all of that. That she was. And so one last little point. Let that earlier, you know, One, that Mom was in her body. Two, that who mom is never left you. Three, that Mom's no longer hurting. That's right. Four, that mom is super excited about what you're doing now and the positive changes you're making in your life. That's right. So all this gets in. Yeah. And then as it all gets in, filters and begins to expand out in different ways. When you're ready, you can take a deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Cool. Cool. Yeah. So what are you noticing now?
[47:16] B: A lot more peace, A lot more calmness. Yeah.
[47:20] A: Isn't that interesting?
[47:21] B: Yeah.
[47:21] A: Yeah. And here's the last part. When those things transform, they can't go back the other way. When your brain gets that it's data, it can't go back to thinking it's happening just like, once you learn Santa's make believe, you can't believe in him anymore. You can pretend.
[47:44] B: I know, right?
[47:47] A: Yeah, we pretend, but I can't believe in it.
[47:50] B: Yeah, he's not there yet.
[47:51] A: And I was tired of Santa getting all the credit. Oh, isn't it great that Santa put the tree swing up in the tree with the reindeer and the elves? Yeah. No, it was dad at night with the flashlight in the ladder. Santa. Yeah, I get it. Yeah. Santa did it. Sure he did. Jolly Odell.
[48:08] B: I know that.
[48:12] A: Cool. So, any questions for me? No.
[48:16] B: That was good.
[48:17] A: Yeah. We're gonna get together, we're gonna have a longer chunk of time. When we get together the next time, we're gonna do more. Okay. But your job is to. In between now and then, pay attention to what you're noticing that's different and better for you. Okay. In terms of your reactions, in terms of how you're feeling, in terms of the. The stuff that's going on, just start to notice, even if it's subtle ways, how it's different and better. Got it?
[48:40] B: Got it.
[48:40] A: Cool beans.
[48:41] B: Cool beans.
[48:41] A: Come with me.
