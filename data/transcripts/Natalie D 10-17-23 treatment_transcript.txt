[00:01] A: You know what you're gonna be for Halloween?
[00:03] B: Yes.
[00:03] A: What are you gonna be?
[00:06] B: Oh, no, no. I don't know. I thought you were asking what my kids are gonna be for Halloween.
[00:11] A: Okay, well, yeah, sure. What are the kids gonna be?
[00:13] B: One is Cleopatra and one is a zombie cheerleader. And all I hear over all the whole weekend was trick or treat, smell my feet, and cheers around that same trick or treat, smell my feet over and over and over again. Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[00:29] A: Yeah.
[00:30] B: But she's nine, so she will do that. Yeah. All right. So today is the 17th of October. Natalie and Sam were making an audio recording of what we're doing. Given what we do is useful and valuable, that recording may be made available and teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:50] A: Yes.
[00:51] B: Okay, cool. So I. When you were in here the last time, you mentioned that there are a variety of different things that have been problematic. Certainly we've got that there had been problematic using. The whole loss of baby thing is also something that's been weighing on you. There's all sorts of ups and downs sometimes in how you feel. You also mentioned just now sleeping has been one of those things that I'm finding myself wanting to do more and more and more of. So that's also been problematic. And then there's a whole bunch of stuff that has happened, some of it way long time ago, some of it more recent, that although the experiences are over, having gone through them continues to have a little bit of a negative effect. Again, not that I ruminate or think about it all the time, but if I do or if something reminds me of it, there's still the ugh attached to it. So that's the big broad category of what I'm remembering in terms of what we talked about out of what I said, what did I miss? Or what else would be useful for me to know to understand?
[01:59] A: No, I think you pretty much nailed it.
[02:01] B: Okay, cool. So then I got it.
[02:03] A: Yeah.
[02:03] B: Okay. So then the first part goes like, well, what do we want to do for you? Like, how do we want you to be when we're done?
[02:11] A: Happy.
[02:12] B: Like all the time. Really weird.
[02:14] A: Well, I mean, yeah. At least being in a content mood.
[02:18] B: Okay, Content. I'll go with content happy. Okay. So we want you to be much more content, much more at peace, much more comfortable in your own skin. Cool. How else do we want you to be?
[02:33] A: Not wanting to, I guess, escape through sleeping.
[02:36] B: Okay. And if you Weren't wanting to escape through sleeping, how would you actually be?
[02:42] A: I don't know. Just dealing with things head on instead of trying to run.
[02:47] B: Okay, so we could say that we want you to have much more ease in dealing with the different things that might come your way.
[02:55] A: Right.
[02:56] B: Cool. What else? How else do we want you to be? You've done really good so far. I ask people that question, they're like.
[03:06] A: I just feel like the contentness would be really good.
[03:09] B: Yeah. So we want you to be much more content, much more at peace, much more comfortable in your own skin. We want you to have much more freedom and ease in dealing with situations as they come up. Right. We want the impact that the past experiences have had to be completely cleared and gone so they're no longer weighing on you. And those kind of reminders no longer cause disruption in you. Okay, cool. Anything else? Okay, so if we get all that done today, would we think today's session was useful?
[03:44] A: Yes.
[03:46] B: Well, then I'm on board.
[03:47] A: That's kind of a lot, but. Yeah.
[03:48] B: You think? Well, that's why we're here for three hours.
[03:50] A: Oh, okay.
[03:51] B: Right.
[03:52] A: Yeah, sure.
[03:54] B: Right. Which again, that being a lot. Three hours doesn't seem like long enough, does it?
[03:59] A: Not really.
[04:00] B: I know. It's so good. Right. But we're already on our way. Because in order to get somewhere, we first need to know where we're going. Right. Like, if I told you, get in the car and start driving three hours from now, I'm gonna tell you where to go, I wouldn't start driving. Right. See, first, we need to know where we're going. Second, we need to make sure that being here is okay with you. So if we think of the you who's content and at peace, who's much more comfortable in her own skin, who's much more outwardly focused, meaning she's not ruminating, thinking much about herself. The guilt, bad feeling, shame, anger, hurts over past, stuff like that's gone. The you that I'm seeing moving through, handling, dealing with difficulties that might show up with more freedom and ease. Right. If we think of this future you, that question isn't how it's gonna. That we get you here. It's would it be okay?
[04:56] A: Right.
[04:57] B: Right. So would it be okay?
[04:59] A: Yeah.
[05:00] B: Yeah. But. Oh, what's the but?
[05:03] A: I don't know.
[05:04] B: You don't know? I'm gonna. I'm gonna throw one out there, and you can tell me whether it lands okay. Sometimes the but is if I'm okay and no longer troubled or hurting, over stuff that did or feeling guilty over stuff that I did. Then somehow it excuses what happened. Somehow it means what I went through was okay or what I did was okay. And a lot of what happened to me, what I went through, and what I did was not okay. So how the hell can I feel.
[05:31] A: Okay what already happened?
[05:33] B: So it did.
[05:34] A: It's okay.
[05:36] B: Right?
[05:36] A: Or I'm okay from it happening.
[05:40] B: I'm not sure you fully are yet.
[05:41] A: Okay.
[05:43] B: Right. We don't want to excuse it, but you're being okay now. No longer hurting or troubled or pained or shamed or angry or sad or guilty or. Does that in any way, shape, or form mean what you went through was okay? No. Right.
[06:01] A: But it is.
[06:03] B: It doesn't mean that what you went through was okay.
[06:06] A: Okay.
[06:07] B: Does it? I mean, you get to be okay even though what happened wasn't right.
[06:13] A: I wasn't okay then.
[06:14] B: No.
[06:15] A: It didn't work then.
[06:16] B: No. And still not fully 100% okay now.
[06:20] A: Okay.
[06:20] B: Even though you've got distance from a lot of it.
[06:22] A: Yeah.
[06:23] B: Right. It's not in my face like it used to be.
[06:25] A: Right.
[06:25] B: So I've gotten distance from it. But you also recognize that there are some things that if I do think about it or if something reminds me of it, there's still, like, discomfort in me about it.
[06:37] A: Okay.
[06:38] B: We want that to be gone.
[06:40] A: Okay.
[06:40] B: Right. And again, if that stuff's gone, it doesn't mean what you went through was okay.
[06:45] A: Okay.
[06:46] B: Correct.
[06:47] A: Yes.
[06:48] B: Okay. Okay. So now let's check. Thinking of where we're headed again, the question isn't how it's gonna happen. It's would it be okay? Mm.
[07:01] A: Yeah.
[07:01] B: Is there any downside? Yeah. Oh. To being the way I described?
[07:06] A: The emotions that come with not being.
[07:09] B: Okay would be the downside.
[07:12] A: Yeah.
[07:13] B: What if you don't? So the downside of this is you're not having those emotions.
[07:17] A: Right.
[07:17] B: Oh.
[07:19] A: I mean, what?
[07:21] B: I know. Isn't that weird? That's right. That was really confusing to me too.
[07:26] A: Yeah.
[07:26] B: Right. Because there is no downside because you're not feeling those.
[07:30] A: Okay.
[07:31] B: Right. The downside would be being there still. I have all that stuff. Well, then I wouldn't actually be where we're having you.
[07:40] A: What do you mean? Why can't I be there without having all that stuff? Because I have.
[07:45] B: I'm not sure you have fully.
[07:48] A: Okay, well, I'm on my way there.
[07:50] B: You can be right. I think that there are still things that have happened that although they're over, they still underneath the surface effect.
[07:59] A: Yeah.
[08:00] B: Right. We Want to get pretty on situations. Correct. They're not all the time.
[08:06] A: Right.
[08:06] B: But there are certain cues and triggers inside you, externally, in your environment that trigger that discomfort, that response, not because you're choosing it, but because of programming that's running you. Right. So when I say, would it be okay to be free from all of that. Mm. Would it be okay to be much more emotionally present, Much more uptime?
[08:35] A: Yeah.
[08:36] B: Have more ease in dealing with the stressors that show up? Being much more content, at peace, and comfortable in you. Right. And I go, this is where we're headed. And then I ask the question, would it be okay to be here?
[08:53] A: Yes.
[08:54] B: Yes. And then I ask the second question. Is there any downside to being here?
[09:00] A: I don't know.
[09:01] B: You don't know, do you? No. But kind of think about it. If you're content and at peace and handling distress with more ease, is there a downside to that?
[09:11] A: No.
[09:12] B: Right. So now it's okay fully to get to where we're headed.
[09:18] A: Yeah.
[09:18] B: Yeah. And what I shared with you the last time was we tend to look through the lens that the circumstances or the situations or the things in life are the culprit of the feelings, whether it's the past or the current or the future. Right. When that person did that thing, I felt this way. When I did that, it made me feel this way. I'm thinking about this thing that could happen. Now I'm feeling like this. Right. We tend to look at those circumstances cause feelings. That lens is not wrong. It just gives us this much power. Because the two choices we have left is work hard to change it or try to get as far away from it as I can. Right. Which is how we deal with most. But we already know there's some stuff I can't change, other stuff I can't fully get away from. A whole bunch of bad stuff that's happened. I can't get it to have not happened.
[10:08] A: Right.
[10:09] B: So where I'm coming in, it's all about adjusting how the more automatic, emotional, preconscious part of your brain reacts and responds to stuff past, current, future, so that your brain automatically and preconsciously works more in the way that you want it to. Got it. As we talk about it, brains have errors because they're complicated machines. They get dropped, kicked, punched. They have malfunctioned. But even if they had nothing but great things happen, they still malfunction.
[10:47] A: Now, is it also true that our emotional makeup stops growing at the age that we started using drugs?
[11:00] B: Boy, that's a Loaded question. Is it true? It may stunt it, but I don't think it's true. I think.
[11:06] A: So we don't just, like, totally stop.
[11:08] B: No. I think our brain has a tremendous amount of what we call neuroplasticity, meaning it has the ability to rewire itself.
[11:16] A: Okay.
[11:16] B: And the brain is not set up like a metaphor that most people use in medical, where it comes from a root into a trunk, into limbs, branches and leaves, like tree, where it's all connected to one source. Our brain is rhizomatic. Rhizomatic is more like mushrooms or mint leaves or the weeds. There's not a single start, like, it doesn't grow from one source. So we had new sod laid, and my wife goes out and pulls out all the weeds, and I'm like, why? Because it's not like you're getting them at the root. No, no, I got that one at the root. Right. And then there's that other one that popped up over there. Yeah, same weeds. Yeah. Right. Different root sources because they pop up. That's more of our brain. So because it's all interconnected through multiple layers and links, our brain has the ability to rewire itself.
[12:15] A: Okay.
[12:15] B: It has the ability to update. So, yes, may I have delayed certain things, May I have put, like, a cover over stuff, May have had a way to deal with certain emotions by using that. Maybe stunted. Yeah. But brain has neuroplasticity. So it can update, it can rewire. It continuously is growing new stem cells that get converted into adult neurons. So that's an ongoing process. We used to never think of it that way. We used to think once our brain was set, done.
[12:47] A: Right.
[12:48] B: Right. That's where the saying came. You can't teach an old dog new tricks because it's set. But what we now know is that our brain is constantly rewiring itself. Every single experience we go through, on purpose or not, literally causes changes in the structure of our brain. Okay? So we have the ability to rewire, which is what we're doing. We're rewiring how certain information got coded in your brain that created certain programs in you that have become suboptimal. At one time, they may have served you, and for that one particular experience at that time, it served you. But it being stuck always on doesn't serve you as much now. Right? Like the guy who comes home from war, him being on edge all the time, that was useful because it was about keeping him alive. Him sitting in the park with his girlfriend and, you know, the little kid has One of those snaps and it freaks him out. Not so useful. Because his brain needs to update to where he is now, which was not back then.
[13:54] A: Okay.
[13:55] B: That's some of what we're going to be doing.
[13:57] A: Okay.
[13:58] B: Makes sense.
[13:58] A: Yes.
[13:59] B: So then as we look at it, we could say that it's not the stuff anymore that is the culprit. It's the effect that the stuff has had on my brain. I use this silly example that lion approaches zebra. We go, lion makes zebra scared. No, zebra's brain makes zebra scared. Yes, in response to lion. But it's zebra's brain. Got it. So what causes the dysregulation, the disruption?
[14:27] A: It's a survival instinct.
[14:28] B: It is, but not updated. Okay, Right. Because I'm different than I was when I was 4 or 7 or 13 or 22. Okay. Right. We want the brain to update. I still want to have the wisdom and knowledge because I become more wise and more aware. But I don't want it to be running me because then it's still faulty programming. Right. Like brain sometimes is a one time learner. So when it learns how to do something and puts it into automatic processing now, it always does it that way. Right. That's what we needed to do with that soldier. We need to update his brain so that the part that got stuck. Yeah. Realizes where he is now that he doesn't have the same kinds of threats. Because when trauma is active, my brain scans for it, looking for what's similar to it.
[15:25] A: Right.
[15:26] B: But similar gets merged as same.
[15:30] A: Okay.
[15:31] B: Right. We want similar to actually be read as different so I can see it more clearly. Right. The snap of the little thing that goes pop is not the same thing as a thing. We want his brain to totally distinguish the difference even though there is a similar sound. Right, got it.
[15:49] A: Yeah.
[15:51] B: That's the part that we want to get shifted inside of. You make sense. So when we look at it that what's been going on is there are errors in the way that your brain has been working. Working your brain now oftentimes in different ways makes you feel bad. First question, Natalie. Do you think your brain really wants you to feel bad?
[16:09] A: No.
[16:09] B: No, it doesn't want you to feel bad. Do you think it would want you to feel good?
[16:12] A: Right.
[16:13] B: Most people say yes, but no. That's the screwed up part.
[16:16] A: Yeah.
[16:17] B: Because what we.
[16:18] A: But I don't have the natural endorphins anymore.
[16:21] B: I don't know whether that's. I don't know whether that's fully true.
[16:24] A: Really. Okay. So I can develop My own serotonin.
[16:30] B: Yeah. Serotonin is about, well, being.
[16:31] A: Serotonin and endorphins are the same thing.
[16:34] B: A little bit different. Okay. Endorphins block pain.
[16:38] A: Okay. Okay.
[16:39] B: Right. Serotonin is about well, being.
[16:42] A: Okay.
[16:43] B: Right. And then there's dopamine, which is he.
[16:45] A: Right.
[16:46] B: I don't have any of that.
[16:48] A: Okay.
[16:49] B: And dopamine loves novelty and newness.
[16:52] A: Okay.
[16:52] B: Right. So why do I get so excited to work with somebody? Because I'm new.
[16:57] A: Okay.
[16:57] B: Right. Like we haven't done this thing before. We haven't danced this dance, so it gets really exciting.
[17:02] A: Okay.
[17:04] B: Right. Knowing what I know and knowing how to do it begins to shift things. So if we look at it that what your brain has been making you feel bad, but not because it's out to get you, but because they're error. And the biggest error is a timing error. Right. Because what we've learned is the emotional part of our brain that causes all of this disruption. Works most like the brain of an animal. Animals brains don't make them feel. Because the brain of the animal is concerned about its mood or its affect or its level of self worth or self esteem. Whether it feels good enough or lovable or smart enough or pretty enough or tall enough or likable. No, it causes emotions to motivate the animal to either do something, get something to stop to solve a problem. It's that simple. Which sounds crazy, but when the rabbit sees the fox, the brain makes it experience fear. Not because it wants rabbit to have a bad day, but to motivate it to run really fast, away. Squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire, pain. Not because it wants the squirrel to hate itself, feel like a stupid, dumb moron. Now it's embarrassed and marred. All the other squirrels are gonna laugh at me. No, simpler get the tail out of the fire. So the crazy part for us to even consider is that all the negative emotions we experience, hurt, sadness, anger, grief, guilt, shame, pain, hurts, frustrations, resentments, all that kind of stuff is being caused by the part of our brain that works like an animal. Same purpose, to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. Where the error shows up is that many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. That's why we feel bad about the same things over and over and over again. Right. Good news. Many of the things that we feel most bad about are in time periods that are already finished.
[19:08] A: Okay.
[19:09] B: And some of them are about time periods that haven't happened yet, Right? Right. So we don't actually need to solve the problem. What we need to do is update the timing. The error that happens most for human beings is a timing error. And it's because this other part of our brain, that frontal cortex, has access to time where the animal brain doesn't, right? You know, you're sitting here now, you can think about something you're going to go do later. You can remember something you did over the weekend. No other animal can do that. That's not a problem if the experience is positive or if it's neutral. Because positive and neutral experiences, Our brain also reads the data, memory and info about it, right? Knows that it's data, knows that it's a memory, right? Even if it's a joyful memory. Somebody tells us about the first time that they went to the Magic Kingdom and they got to ride Space Mountain and thunder Railro and they got to take their picture with, you know, Cinderella and they tell us about the experience and we know when they're telling us about it, that they know the difference between remembering being there and being there. It's really clear. But negative experiences, big ones, little ones, long time ago, when I was young child, just the other day, one time experience multiple experiences over years. Any negative experience, weird, bad, sad, awful, scary, upsetting, horrific, catastrophic, traumatic. Our brain confuses the data and the memory, the info about it, thinking it is it, and causes emotional disruption, right? This guy is telling us about how 17 years ago when he was in Tulsa, he got mugged, right? He gets to the part where the guy came up behind him and had guns in the back of his. We see him do this. All of a sudden his face has gone completely white, his voice is choked, his arms are trembling, he's shaking. We're kind people, we were nicely listening to what is happening with him, right? And people say he's reliving it, but what's really going on part of his brain, that more emotional part, is confusing the data, the memory, the info about what happened, thinking it's happening. That's why he's having that emotional reaction, which we totally know is affecting him when he talks to us because we see it all over him, right? But it was also affecting him even over the weekend when he was having a nice meal with his girlfriend. It was under the surface, logically, up here, even when he's talking to us, he knows that he's safe, that he survived, that there's no gun, he knows he's okay, right? There's a part of his brain, when that moment happened, that froze it, that got disintegrated from the rest of the nervous system. That part never got the good news. So where therapy tends to think that we buried it, locked it behind closed doors, put it in the closet, put it under the carpet, and that my job is to encourage it to get released and out. Like throwing up. I know throwing up. After doing it, you feel a little bit better. Problem. You get re triggered by the same stuff. So the opposite is what we want to do. It's a reconnaissance mission. Think about. There are certain aspects of the brain at certain periods of time in life that never got the good news. That I made it through it, that I survived it, that I'm okay, that it wasn't about me, that it wasn't my fault. We actually have really good news to get in to the part of the brain that never got updated make sense. It's gotten distance. I've understood it more. But at that level, there's a part of my brain that doesn't know it's over. That's the error. Because that animal brain doesn't have access to time. So it's always now. And when it got disintegrated from the nervous system, it got stuck as always. Now that's why it's vigilant looking for it. That's why it confuses similar as same. And anything that was going on at the same time gets merged into it. Okay, follow me with that. Even if what was going on at the same time had nothing to do with the problem, like the guy who was being molested by grandpa and you know, they were playing that song, and now he gets violently ill anytime that song comes on. And he had no idea that the girl he was dating, that's her favorite song. Right. And the co worker that he works with that he can't stand, he doesn't even recognize that he wore Old Spice. Just like Grandpa, right? Yeah, like all of those things. The issue, of course, back then wasn't the song and wasn't the Old Spice.
[24:46] A: Right.
[24:46] B: It was what grandpa was doing. But they all co occurred, so they got merged. That's the error.
[24:53] A: Okay.
[24:53] B: Right. That's why similar gets merged as same. We want to get that all separated so that I'm free, right? Yeah. And then the other part that goes on. Well, well, what do we learn when we're little? We're lied to. Did you know that, Sam? Lies? I lie to little children. You probably lied to your kid too. You know, the Biggest lie. We lie. Life is good.
[25:13] A: A frickin big lie.
[25:14] B: That is the biggest lie right there. Life is good luck. Second lie. If I'm good, good things happen to me.
[25:23] A: Right?
[25:24] B: Right. As she said, Santa, who doesn't even know me, brings presents to my house. Cause I'm good. Yeah, right. So the lie we tell kids is life is good. When you're good, good things happen to you.
[25:38] A: Yeah.
[25:38] B: And then we reinforce it all the TV shows, book stories, gifts, presents, stuff for kids. Tell them like good things happen when I'm good. Mommy gave me a big hug because I got an A because I'm good. Right. Mommy spanked my hiney because I drew on the wall. Because that's the reversal. Right? If life is good and good things happen because I am good, good. The reverse is true. Bad things only happen when I'm bad. I only got the spanking because I was drawing on the wall. But we also know bad things can happen to us without us doing anything wrong. Dad happened to trip over my toy and then he smashed it on the ground and I cried. And then he said, you're crying, I'm gonna keep. Right, right. The favorite one is the switches. Remember switches?
[26:31] A: Yeah.
[26:31] B: Right. We had to go pick it.
[26:33] A: Yeah.
[26:34] B: No, that one's not hard.
[26:37] A: Yeah, right.
[26:39] B: And then after getting the beating, you better smile. What? I get hit and I have to smile afterwards? Like what the. Ok, right, like all of that.
[26:54] A: Like going through boot camp.
[26:56] B: Yeah, but I at least sign up for boot camp. I didn't do anything to sign up for that. Yeah, right. Yeah, but that's the messaging that if it's bad, it's my fault. So that's why the little kid, when parents get divorced, blames themselves. If I hadn't left that toy and daddy hadn't gotten mad, then maybe daddy would still be here. And when dad was supposed to come to the little league game and doesn't show up, the kid doesn't go. Well, Dad's probably, you know, out at the bar with his buddies. That's more important. You know, he's got to watch the football game Saturday.
[27:30] A: Yeah.
[27:31] B: What's the deal? I'm a little league kid. No little league kid goes, if I was more important to dad, if I was worth it, if he truly cared about me, he would still be here. Right? So all those messages get installed that it had something to do with me, my lovability. That's why they're not here. Because when we're little, it is my world and everybody else lives in it. So of course, it's my fault.
[27:59] A: Right.
[28:00] B: Make sense. So with those things active, as I said, the brain is going to scan and search for anything that's similar. The problem is that similar gets confused as identical. That's the error. So my brain is never updated. It One, never got the good news that certain awful things are over. Two, it's blamed me for the awful thing. So we want to get that to be cleared up. Any questions about those pieces?
[28:31] A: No.
[28:36] B: Wow. Telling you it's not as bad as you think, but it is a pretty dark green.
[28:45] A: It looks like cilantro.
[28:48] B: It doesn't quite taste like cilantro. I thought it would be a faster way to take vitamins because it's supposed to be all inclusive. Probiotic, prebiotic, vitamin stuff. Yeah.
[29:05] A: Okay. You're making us want it. You're selling it as he gargles the water down.
[29:17] B: It's really good.
[29:18] A: Yeah, I'm sure.
[29:20] B: Maybe we should get it at the house.
[29:21] A: Hold your breath and chug it.
[29:28] B: Okay. So, that being said, now we want to go through some processes that are designed to get your body into the right states for healing. So the right states for healing are always states of rest. It's why colds, flu, surgery, we tell people to get rest because it allows the body to do the inside healing. We have some really cool, neuroscientifically proven brain levers that are designed to put the body into a state of rest. The first one's the silliest one. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. So I don't mean like, ah, I mean just a little bit.
[30:11] A: Oh, okay. You mean you want me to do it now? Oh, okay.
[30:16] B: See, I told you it's silly. So we slightly lower our jaw. When you slightly lower your jaw, what it does is it activates stimulating the vagal nerve, which is a nerve that meanders through the body, connecting to the vital organs. When it's stimulated and activated, it starts to put the body into parasympathetic response. So we slightly lower the jaw. Second lever is you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. When you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, it acts to turn down some of the internal dialogue and help satiate the body. The third lever is breathing. What we begin to do is we begin to breathe in a way that's just a little bit slower, a little bit deeper, and a little bit longer than how you automatically breathe. So go ahead and slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, and begin to breathe in a way That's a little bit slower, A little bit deeper. That's right, a little bit longer. You went really long. We don't even need to go that far. So slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue, breathe. That's right, a little bit slower and deeper so that when you exhale, it's just a little bit longer than the inhale. Right. And as you begin to breathe in this way, Natalie, just check inside. How's your body feeling now? Like more tense or more cold?
[31:59] A: I could take a nap.
[32:00] B: Oh, you could take a nap, which is not anything that you like to do, right? That's right. Good. Now, the fourth lever is also an interesting one, and I'm going to explain it in this way. When we're in waking states, we're in beta waves. So beta waves are great for conversation, they're great for communication, they're great for social interaction and engagement. They're great for things like concentration and focus, doing arithmetic. But when beta waves get elevated, meaning they run at a higher hertz, that's where all of the anxiety, anxiety, agitation, angst, irritation, frustration, all live. And what it causes our vision to do is it tunnels in. Right. So we want to begin to move our body down into alpha waves. Alpha waves are highly correlated with what athletes call being in the zone, what surfers would refer to as flow. So it's alert but relaxed. And what it's characterized by is an expanding of our awareness into our peripheral vision. So how it works is, again, you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You breathe in this way. That's a little bit slower, a little bit deeper, a little bit longer than how you automatically breathe. As you breathe in this slightly slower and deeper way, notice that you can look across and see me. You can see my nose. You can see my fingers. Stay looking at my nose. But as my fingers move out, notice with your peripheral vision that you can still see my fingers all the way out. Wiggling. Right. This means you're becoming more aware of the space towards the side windows and doors, the space between us, the space that's beyond me, the space behind you, the space underneath, and the space up above. And as you're noticing more and more of the space, just check inside. How's your body feeling now?
[34:19] A: Relax.
[34:19] B: Kind of interesting how that works, isn't it?
[34:21] A: Yeah.
[34:22] B: And see, space tends to be the thing that we disappear because we no longer. Because we don't typically see it. You know, if I were to ask you to tell me what you see in the room, you would not be describing space.
[34:37] A: Right.
[34:37] B: You would be describing all the objects or the trinkets are the different things that you see. But space is the thing that's in between us, that it's all around us, and it's well beyond the confines of this room. So the last little lever we want to utilize, and then we'll be repeating processes, because every time you do a process and you add to it, it deepens your mind's response. And we're really interested in organizing towards this future. So the last one is, have you ever said, or maybe heard somebody say, I'm under a lot of stress? Right. And in order to be underneath a lot of stress, where must the stress be? That's right. So we know that a solution is to get out from under it and to rise up above it, having what we like to call a bird's eye view, so that we see things down below underneath us.
[35:37] A: That's fear.
[35:38] B: What's fear?
[35:40] A: Rising. Facing. That's fear. Facing our stress. And rising above it is fear. Well, that's the acronym, anyway. Fear. Face everything and rise or Fuck everything and run.
[35:58] B: Wow, those are two that I have never heard before, and I've been at this a long time.
[36:02] A: Really.
[36:03] B: Face everything and rise or fuck everything and run. Huh? All right. That's pretty cool. I like that. Yeah. So we don't want to just rise to meet it. We want to rise up above it.
[36:19] A: Right.
[36:19] B: So that we see it underneath us. Because that's a bird's eye view. Right? Everything is underneath and below me. And the higher I go up, the more I see below and the smaller things become. Yeah, Right. So again, you're going to slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Begin to breathe in this way. That's right. That's a little bit slower and deeper so that your exhale becomes a little bit longer. You look across, you see me, my nose, my fingers. They move all the way out. You notice them wiggling. You're aware of space. Space in between and behind. Space to your left and to your right, space underneath, space behind, space above. As you're noticing the space, notice that it goes beyond the walls, literally all the way out in all directions. Space is unending. Even outer space. That's right. Now, just for a moment, close your eyes. And you'll notice that with your eyes closed. That's right. Or don't close your eyes.
[37:31] A: Okay.
[37:32] B: You don't have to.
[37:32] A: I was about to say. I don't know if I can do that one right.
[37:36] B: Because you don't want to trust me and close your eyes. So don't do that. But some people find it necessarily you.
[37:43] A: It's more me.
[37:44] B: I didn't think it was me at all. Okay.
[37:49] A: Good. I'm glad you feel that way.
[37:52] B: That would be you. I wouldn't trust Sam sitting on the couch next to me either. I'm not closing my eyes with that girl over there. Are you kidding me? I know it wasn't me.
[38:02] A: It's definitely neither one of you.
[38:04] B: It's just me. Right? Right. But every time you blink, did you know that you already have been closing your eyes and you've been blinking a lot since you've been in here?
[38:12] A: Right?
[38:13] B: Yeah.
[38:14] A: So I close my eyes every time I blink.
[38:16] B: You do every time you blink your eyes close. That's for like a split second, but they close.
[38:22] A: Yeah.
[38:22] B: Right. Just for a split second. Right, right. But you were having a problem closing your eyes. Not at all.
[38:29] A: No.
[38:29] B: No. Because every time you blink, they close. And there's been no problem with you doing that at all today.
[38:34] A: Right? Okay.
[38:36] B: That's right. Because it was not on purpose. See, the difference is, if I have to close my eyes when somebody asked me to close my eyes, then that might be a reminder. Right. Got it. And the only reason that I say that is because sometimes people find it easier to imagine what it might be like to float up and out of their body when they have their eyes closed. Right. Because all we want to do is have you have the experience of what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof. Not disassociate. Because we still want you here. We want it kind of like it's an imaginatory thing. Like, imagine what it would be like to float up and out so that you float up beyond the ceiling and beyond the roof so that you're way up above it all in the sky, having the bird's eye view of seeing everything as being underneath, below you, because you're above and over it all. But not just a perched bird. Think of a bird that's able to soar through the sky and see. There's one way to, like, be the bird versus seeing the bird. Because I'm still down below looking up and seeing the bird. We want to think of what it would be like to be the bird up above it all, so that from that perspective, I'm seeing everything below me, but I'm also free to soar through the sky. Like, I can move in any direction. I can Go in all ways. And sometimes it's directive because I'm flapping towards going somewhere, and sometimes I'm just riding the breeze. Right. Like, that's what we want to have the experience. Because then we've got the reversal of being up above, over and beyond it. All right. Even just thinking of it now, as I described it. Check inside. How's your body feeling? Good. Yeah? How so? What's good?
[40:23] A: Content, relaxed.
[40:27] B: Cool. So we got more and more content and relaxed. Yeah. And we want to do even more organizing. But I want to share something with you, because lots of times people have stuff happen to them. Right. So think of a time that you were outside in nature, and you see something that's just beautiful. Like, the moment you're looking at it, it, like, captures you for that moment. You're like, wow, what is it that you see?
[40:56] A: A sunset.
[40:57] B: Yeah. And isn't there a moment that when you're experiencing the sunset, you're feeling that sense of peace and awe and excitement? And people might tell you, Natalie, that being there and seeing the sunset is what's giving you those feelings. But if we looked at it from a different lens, we could say that being there, experiencing and seeing it simply drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because at your center, you always are peaceful and excited. Kind of like if I'm at the campfire and I'm cold, and so I bring my hands down towards the flames and I say, holy cow, this fire is getting hotter. Is the fire getting hotter?
[41:45] A: No, you're getting closer.
[41:46] B: I'm becoming more aware of it. Right. As my hands draw closer to the flame. So we know that in your life, in all the experiences, there have been many times where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Hurts and angers and griefs and guilt and shames and pains and sadness. But no matter where you're aware, awareness has been always at your center. You're peaceful and excited. And, you know, three of us are in here. How do you know it? You look around. Your senses bring in data. Your intellect organizes it. We tend to refer to that as knowledge. Sometimes people call knowledge light. We'll just call it light of knowledge at your center. Let's just say that's a brighter light. Light of wisdom. So now we've got light of knowledge. We've got light of wisdom. And. Right. I work with lots of people who've had all sorts of yucky, awful stuff happen to them. And I remember this one girl, older brother, I think she was like six or seven at the Time. Older brother was like six years older than her. He used to take Matchbox cars, drive them up her leg and park them in her. So there was just a lot of ugh around all of it. But as we worked together, we cleared it all out. Gone. All the discomfort, the anger, it's gone. And so I asked her the question. I go, you know, all of that discomfort, I go, where was it? And she goes, it's gone. You'll feel it. I said, I know. Isn't that cool? She said, yeah. I said, but my question for you was, where was it? And the two of us started thinking. I go, was it at the surface? She's like, well, no, it wasn't in an intellectual thing. I go, oh, well, then maybe it was at your center. And she's like, dude, really? How could that stuff survive in light? Or I'm peaceful and excited. And I went, well, then where was it? She goes, oh, it was hiding in the shadows between those lights. I said, well, what happened? She says, the shadows are gone. The lights have joined. And I said, whoa, that is cool. And then we started talking about how people over identify their bodies as themselves. Right? Like, people tend to think of my body as me. Like, I am it. But what if you are not your body?
[44:01] A: Right? It's your soul.
[44:03] B: It's your soul or it's me.
[44:04] A: You have your soul and then you.
[44:06] B: Have your body, right?
[44:07] A: Your spirit and you have your body.
[44:09] B: Or maybe we don't think of the other one as a your. Oh, okay, right. So I'll explain what I mean by that as I go through this. Right? Okay. So you have a body. Your body's yours, but your body isn't actually you, right? Right. My mom lost the tip of her finger in a snow cone machine accident. When she visits people now, they don't say to her, susie, I'm glad almost all of you could make it. They don't say that to her. Why? Because all of her is there. Even if the part of her body is missing. Right? There's no single cell within your body that's the same as it was. They've all been replaced alone. Your feet are longer than they were when you were three. Yet despite all of it, you're still you. So you totally have a body, 100% yours, but it isn't actually you. Huh? Then people go, okay, well, if I'm not my body, I must be my thought. But what if you're not your thoughts? What if you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? What if your Brain is the thinker of your thoughts. And what if you have a brain? It's yours, but it's not you. Just like you have a heart and a liver and a lung, they're totally yours. They're not you, so you're not even a thought. You're not your thoughts, you're not your body. Oh, you must be how you feel. But you feel different ways at different times and you're still you, right? So you can't possibly be a feeling. Oh, well, then clearly I must be what I do. Maybe. Except you do things, lots of different things. And you stop doing one thing and you did something else. You didn't stop existing. So the weirdest question of all goes, if you're not what you do, and if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not your feelings, and if you're not your body, then what are you? And you said it earlier. My soul, my spirit. Because we tend to think of that as something I have, right? I was a little kid when my mom and I used to say the prayer, now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I awake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. And then she'd kiss me on the forehead and walk to the door, say, goodnight, sweetie, turn the lights off, leave and shut the door. And I'm laying there thinking about my death. Why? Why that one at the end? You couldn't say that one first? No, we gotta say that one at the end. All the time. Have nightmares of two hands breaking through my window, ripping my dead body, grabbing it from me. Scary. But later in life, I started to think of, instead of it being something I have, my soul, like my nose, my fingers, my toes. Why don't I think of it as me? That the light at the center, that light is you. And the light at the center, that's you. It can't be touched or hurt or harmed. It only experiences love that it allows in is totally whole and complete. And I say that because you'll never guess. People come in to see me and they screw up identity all the time. Can you imagine? People come in and they tell me they're anxious, they're depressed, they're shy, they think the way they feel is who they are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm upset, and you go, why are you so upset? I go, natalie, I don't believe what he did. What'd he do? Well, first he put me in a chair and immediately my head goes down. And my feet go up. It's very uncomfortable. You're like, okay, you're at the dentist. Well, then he takes in this light, positions it, like, right in my eyes. I'm blinded. I can't see a darn thing. Yeah, you're at the dentist. Well, then he took this cold metal instrument and shoved it inside of me. And you're like, holy Gh. And you're what? I said my mouth. I'm at the dentist.
[47:59] A: Okay.
[48:01] B: But it's the same thing that I said to the girl with her older brother. I said, when you were little, he really messed with your stuff. And she looked at me and she goes, he did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings. And then she started to smile and she said, but you know what? He never touched me. He hurt my body. It screwed up my thinking and feeling, but he never got me. And I said, whoa, that's pretty powerful. And so again, just like slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue. Begin to breathe in this way. That's a little bit slower and deeper. Notice that you can allow awareness to expand so that you sense more of the space in the room. Space between you and me and you and Sam. The space behind you, up above your head, underneath the couch. Notice how much more space there is than there are objects. Because no matter where you are, there's always more space. Even you are made up much of space. That if we thought about the part of our body that's solid, we have to go out five decimal points.00001% of our body is solid. The rest of us is space. That if we came back one year from today. 99.9999% of all the subatomic particles that are making the three of us up wouldn't be here. They all don't leave it once at Star Trek. Right? So you have a body. It's totally yours, but it isn't actually you. Right? And as you're beginning to recognize and realize that whether you close your eyes or not, imagine what it would be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof so that you're way up above it all in the sky, having the bird's eye view of seeing it all as being under and below you because you're over it. Free to be becoming even more of who you truly are. Beginning to lighten up on the inside. That's right. On your way to becoming more and more content, calm and comfortable in your own skin. That's Right. And as all of this is going on now, bring your awareness back down and into your body so that you re associate inside you. Now take a big deep breath in and then exhale. That's right. And again, just checking inside. How's your body feeling now? Good.
[51:01] A: I'm comfortable.
[51:02] B: You are?
[51:03] A: Yeah.
[51:04] B: Comfortable? Yeah, that's right. And as you're comfortable, we're going to start making requests not to you, but to your unconscious. Because your unconscious is a warehouse of everything you've ever gone through. The good, the bad, the ugly. Right. That part of your brain knows what moments, what experiences, at what times, left imprints, created impressions, created programming that has it been optimal for you. So it knows which moments would be useful for us to unplug and clear out the effect. Secondarily, that part of your brain has total access to the control panels. So it also knows what buttons to press and in which order, what knobs to turn and how far, which levers to shift and switches to flip to rewire and reorganize. Organize your brain so that optimizes to work more in the way that you want. Many of the experiences, you may think because you've done therapy, oh, no, I've processed that. I'm good with that one. I don't like to think about it, but I'm good with that one. We know a memory still has a charge. Not by how often I think about it, but if I do or if something reminds me of it, it still does it to me. We want all of that uncharged. We want all of that cleared. So before we actually clear something, I'm going to tell you how it's done because it's really, really simple. You ever notice when somebody starts telling you about something that was troubling, they stopped being with you and it's as if they're back there again. So the first thing, how we clear something, is for you to have the intention of being here with us. Right. The reason that you want to be here with us is that this totally is what's happening and that stuff isn't. Two, we're working on a mutual goal that we're all interested in and wanting to get to. Three, I'm hoping, hoping, hoping that I can be just a little bit more fun than a sucky moment.
[53:15] A: Okay?
[53:15] B: Okay, Good. So the one thing you want to intend to be here with me. Two, because many moments happen not just yesterday, but earlier in life, there have been things you've done later that were more enjoyable than a yucky one. So if a yucky one happened when I was 3 or 7 or 9 or 12 or 22. There have been things that I did later in life that were more enjoyable. But remember, there's a part of the brain when the moment happened that was bad, froze. It disintegrated. So that part doesn't know any of life beyond. So we also have some good news to get in. I remember working with somebody who had been raped, and the moment was just as it was happening, and then it stopped. She had no more memory of it. Well, something happened. She's like, I don't know, something must have happened. She goes, yeah, I don't know. I don't remember. Well, do you have his penis still inside? No. Right. So something happened. It's not there. I'm like, check, look. No, no, not there. No. Really? No, Check. Yeah, no, it's not there. Right. But it froze at that worst spot. Because when we go through troubling moments, they tend to freeze at the worst part of it. And then the brain doesn't know anything beyond it. So we also have good news to get in. Make sense. So one more time, you're gonna slightly lower your jaw, right? Resting your tongue, breathing in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper. Right. As you breathe in this slightly slower and deeper way, expand awareness to notice more space just with your peripheral vision. Right. Because we want to open up the aperture so that we notice more. Even when I'm going to do a training with a group of people so that I don't get spooked or anxious, I also want to be in peripheral vision so that as I see you, I can see Sam and I can see the lamp and I can see the painting up above. Right. I can see the side doors and I notice what's behind me. That's right.
[55:30] A: So you can see the lamp in the painting above?
[55:33] B: I can. While I'm looking at you. Okay, Right. And I'm not like numbed out. Right. I'm still being able to be engaged. But what it does is it causes my physiology to be much more settled. Right. We're going to request that, that other than conscious part of your brain, travel back through the timeline in your own history of negative experiences. It's going to begin to sort and category rising group, and then it's going to narrow down, pinpoint, and bring a moment to mind for us to clear. Right. It doesn't have to be chronological and it doesn't have to be the worst of the worst because we also want to show your mind that we know what we're doing in terms of how to heal wounds. Okay, Got it.
[56:28] A: Yeah.
[56:28] B: So again, we're organizing towards this future you that we're all interested in. That other than conscious part travels back down that timeline through your own history. Younger, earlier, will bring a moment to your awareness for us to clear.
[56:47] A: Okay.
[56:48] B: What moment comes to mind?
[56:51] A: The most recent is my sister's death.
[56:53] B: Ah. Okay. And when you think about that, the feelings are feelings of what?
[57:01] A: Hurt, anger.
[57:08] B: And sadness. About how long ago did that happen?
[57:11] A: March.
[57:12] B: March.
[57:13] A: But I just found out about it.
[57:15] B: Uh huh. When did you just find out about it?
[57:18] A: I want to say two weeks.
[57:22] B: So that's really close from now. How did you find out? Did somebody tell you?
[57:28] A: Yes.
[57:30] B: Okay. And that's how you found out. And do you have anything that provides any comfort around loss, sleep, any particular beliefs around death and dying that provide comfort?
[57:48] A: Comfort like that? They go to heaven.
[57:51] B: I don't. Well, they can be my guardian angel, I guess.
[57:54] A: Can I use the restroom real quick?
[57:56] B: You can. Okay. Do you know where it is?
[57:59] A: Yes.
[57:59] B: Okay.
[58:00] A: Thank you.
[58:00] B: You're welcome. Do what you got now. I turned it back on.
[58:04] A: Okay.
[58:04] B: Okay. So. Yes. Any kind of like beliefs or views that provide any comfort. Heaven guardian angel.
[58:15] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the. In the red, the or it's called a cardinal. I know.
[58:22] B: What'd you say it was?
[58:23] A: It's a red bird. The little red bird. I don't know exactly what they're called, but I was told that the little red birds, whenever you see them, it's someone from the other side of life coming and like just saying hello to you, letting you know that they're there. The sharky. Arnie, you h.
[58:45] B: What do you think of that?
[58:46] A: I like that.
[58:47] B: Yeah.
[58:47] A: Yeah.
[58:48] B: It's a nice thought, isn't it? Yeah.
[58:50] A: Yeah.
[58:50] B: Okay. Yeah. I have some thoughts around loss.
[58:54] A: Okay.
[58:55] B: And death and dying that probably are unusual, but I think will be useful. Okay. I. I tend to think of my grandmother as an osprey.
[59:04] A: Really? Okay.
[59:06] B: Because when my grandmother passed away, which was in January, I saw an osprey. And then I see ospreys all the time now, and they stay closer to me than a normal osprey would stay.
[59:20] A: Okay.
[59:21] B: Whether that's anything or not, I always say, hi, Grandma. So the deal with grief and loss is that the same typical deal with trauma, it tends to be the moment, worst moment or moment of finding out that gets stuck for me.
[59:41] A: Well, the big thing too, with the drug of choice that I was using, death comes with it. Like it's part. I've encountered a lot of death since I was a drug addict. And now I'm obviously becoming a non drug addict.
[60:02] B: Yeah.
[60:02] A: But death is just a big part of it. It's something that comes with it.
[60:07] B: Yeah, well, comes with life.
[60:09] A: Yeah. Too.
[60:12] B: None of us get out of here alive.
[60:15] A: Right, Right, Exactly. Yeah.
[60:18] B: Right. So we want to have some.
[60:20] A: There's only two days that we all are. It's in edibles. We gotta pay taxes and we gotta die. That's two things that we have to do in life.
[60:35] B: Yeah. You can't get out of it.
[60:37] A: Right. No way.
[60:40] B: Yeah. It's what scares people about hypnosis because they call it an induction. You know what an induction is?
[60:47] A: No.
[60:47] B: What else do we induce labor. Right. What does that mean?
[60:52] A: That means you're gonna have the baby.
[60:53] B: You can't get out of it. Right, Exactly. So in the world of hypnosis, they call it a hypnotic induction.
[61:02] A: Geez.
[61:02] B: Don't do that.
[61:03] A: Yeah, okay.
[61:05] B: That's a scary thought. So the deal with loss, right. Like it tends to be the moment that gets stuck that blocks access to who the person is for me. So I'll give you an example. I worked with a gentleman. He was married for 42 years. His wife got ALS. So there was a gradual decline. It had been three years after she had passed away and he was already remarried. Right. But every time he thought about that wife, pain and grief stricken. Because every time he thought about her, the moment that kept coming first was him kissing her cold forehead as her body was wheeled to the hers. And with that moment there, it was blocking access to who she is. Friend. Right. But that moment compared to all of the other moments that he experienced with her through 42 years of marriage. Right. Which is there more of more years together. Right. The problem is that if he's got to remember her and it's got to go through that first, it kind of clouds any of the joyful times.
[62:12] A: That's why they say time.
[62:15] B: Time provides distance.
[62:17] A: Right.
[62:18] B: Distance makes it less intense.
[62:20] A: One of the advocates used, I think I. I'm assuming she heard it from you. But something about whenever we look at a picture, if we look at it like this, we can't really see it. And then if we in time with time, which are things I must earn, you go and you start to see the bigger part of it as you have time. But of course, whenever it first happens, it's right here. So you can't really see properly anyway.
[62:50] B: Yeah, right. It's too much in my face. Right, Right. So if we did a science experiment, right? Where we took a glass of ice and we put it out on the patio, and an hour goes by, right? Kid comes out and says, somebody stole the ice. They replaced it with water. We would giggle inside. But then educate that young child and say, nobody stole the ice. What happened is the ice went through a physical transformation from solid to liquid. The molecule, however, that makes up the water. Now, H2O is the same molecule that made up the ice. H2O is H2O. How we pick it up, how we see it, completely different. Kid goes, oh, yeah, no, I understand. We then leave that glass of water out on the patio. Week goes by, kid comes back, goes, somebody drank it. Somebody stole it. The water's not there. It's gone. We say, no, no, nobody stole it. Nobody drank it.
[63:50] A: Evaporated.
[63:51] B: Yes. Which means it went from liquid to gas. The H2O molecule, that makes it up identically the same how we pick it up, how we experience it, completely different. Kids are really confused because he goes, if I don't see it, how can I feel it? And we go, oh, right. Well, you're in Florida. It's all around you. And then we put him in the desert of Arizona. Excuse me. And we say, you don't feel it at all anymore, right? And we put him back in Florida. See, don't you feel it? And we show him the rain cloud, and we capture the water and we put it in the freezer, and he discovers it's all the same thing. So what if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, right? It's that their bodies stop. And because they're no longer in need of it, they exited. We don't pick them up in the same way we did, but it doesn't mean that they're not here. Right? Where do we represent? Heaven, right? Far above the stars and sky, Right? What if it's not so far away, right? You can go out into the car, you can turn the radio on, and all of a sudden music is playing. But weren't the radio waves there before? You turn the radio on. They're here right now in this room. Do you and I feel them? No, no. I blow a whistle, makes no sound for us. But the dog is going. Is it not making any noise or is it out of our range? One of the things we want to realize as human beings is that our range, our sensory perception is limited in its scope. Our five senses are limited in what we can pick up. I can walk next to the Guy who's got a pound of marijuana and I don't smell any of it, the dog does. Right. So we know that our senses are limited in what we can perceive. So what if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, it's that their bodies stop. And because they're no longer in need of it, they exited. We just don't pick them up in the same way we did. But it doesn't mean that they're not still here. And what happens, it tends to be the shock of having always known them the way I did that blocks my access to experiencing who they are for me in an ongoing way. Just like I could ask you, do you love your sister any less now? No. Right. Your love hasn't changed. It's not any less now that she's found in her body, she fully gets it. Her love for you is also as strong as it's always been. You haven't been fully feeling it, not because it's not here, but because shock of having known her in her body, now that she's not in it, blocks access to the sense of who she is. And by the way, is she actually. Was she ever. Her body.
[67:04] A: Right. No.
[67:05] B: Right. I had a woman tell me that her parents are in her closet. I'm like, your parents are in your closet? She goes, I mean, like, what remains of my parents? The remains of my parents are in my closet? I said, no, your parents are not in your closet. They're not even in the remains. Because who your parents are for you is in all the experiences that you acquired in being with them.
[67:30] A: Okay.
[67:31] B: And once you've acquired an experience, can you lose it?
[67:35] A: No.
[67:35] B: No. Nobody can take away my first time to. Dizzy. Can you lose an experience that you haven't acquired?
[67:44] A: No.
[67:45] B: Right. Can you lose something that you don't yet have?
[67:48] A: No.
[67:48] B: So that's a weird question, because if you can't lose it, you have a. And you can't lose what you don't yet have, then where's the loss? Maybe it's when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, it's that their bodies stop. Right. Einstein. Really smart dude. Yeah, right. He says two things that are really important for the conversation. One, who we are human beings. The existence is energy plus matter equals this physical. But what became the second law of thermal dynamics? Energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms kind of interesting.
[68:27] A: Into ashes.
[68:28] B: No, that's the body. That's the matter. The matter goes to ashes.
[68:32] A: Okay.
[68:33] B: Right. We could spread it out and then it could grow stuff. Right. But the energy transforms. We don't pick it up in the same way, but it doesn't mean that it's not here. Right. And what we want to have access for you is access of more of who she is for you. Because where she's never left is here. Or any other person that you've lost along the way that you've had love and affinity for. Got it. I'm gonna show you one thing that I think is fun. That's this. It's a ping pong ball. But you can't bounce it because it's got metal pieces in it. But this is really cool because when you put your fingers on. On it, it makes a noise. Now take that finger touch. Doesn't do anything that weird. Now watch. I'm going to do this. You're going to take that finger touch. Not just the finger. One finger. Good. Right. You're going to take that finger touch my finger. Very interesting. Now go to sand. Take your finger, put it there. Finger.
[69:34] A: Okay.
[69:35] B: On there.
[69:36] A: Okay. Oh, I got negative energy.
[69:41] B: You're pressing to. It's not a button. It just set it there. Watch. Okay.
[69:48] A: This is creepy.
[69:50] B: Yeah.
[69:50] A: That's weird.
[69:52] B: Well, it's not that weird.
[69:54] A: Yes, it is.
[69:54] B: It's science.
[69:55] A: It's you.
[69:56] B: It's not.
[69:57] A: It is.
[69:58] B: Do you know how long do you have the static? No. Do you know how a light switch works?
[70:01] A: Yeah. You flip it on and off.
[70:03] B: Yes, you do flip it on and off. Right. And when it's off, it's an empty open sea. And when it's on, it's a connected circle of energy is able to flow.
[70:14] A: Okay.
[70:15] B: So when I was connected, the energy flows. When we had the opening, the energy didn't flow. When we connected, the energy flowed and then the energy flowed all the way through.
[70:28] A: Okay.
[70:29] B: Isn't that interesting?
[70:30] A: Yeah.
[70:31] B: So who you are is energy.
[70:32] A: Okay.
[70:33] B: Plus matter equals physical existence. And energy does not get destroyed. It transforms. Okay, Got it. So we want to have access. Right. So there's the moment of how you found out. Right?
[70:48] A: Yeah.
[70:49] B: Right. So we want to go through that moment even though that happened not that long ago. Right. While being here with us. Because this is. And that isn't. What's something you've done after that moment that was more enjoyable than that moment?
[71:06] A: I went to court.
[71:07] B: You went to court? That was more fun.
[71:08] A: I found out in the courthouse.
[71:10] B: No, that's where you were when you found out. Oh, then you went into court after that. But something else later. Recent.
[71:17] A: I went to hunt saters.
[71:18] B: Yeah. Going to hunt a farms. That was more fun than that.
[71:20] A: Yeah.
[71:21] B: Right. One other thing.
[71:25] A: I don't know my knack yesterday.
[71:27] B: Yeah. Taking a nap. Right. So we gotta take a nap. We go to hunt farms. We got actually going into court. Leaving court.
[71:32] A: Yeah. I was going. Well, I was waiting to go in.
[71:35] B: Right. But then you left.
[71:36] A: Yeah.
[71:37] B: Was probably better than when you were in there. Right, right. And even better than when you got the call.
[71:41] A: Yeah.
[71:41] B: Right. Good. Got it. So there's things that you've done later. So when that moment happened, you're, like in the car or you're standing outside of the courthouse, or you're actually in the courthouse. So you're in the courthouse. Good. And it's daytime or after morning? Afternoon. Afternoon. Right. And you're with whom?
[71:57] A: Savannah.
[71:59] B: So you're with Savannah. Right. Good. Right. And then what happened?
[72:02] A: And then I seen someone that was a mutual friend between us.
[72:07] B: Right. So you saw a mutual friend between you and Savannah or you and your sister? Good job. So you saw that person in the corner courthouse.
[72:13] A: And I just thought it was weird, but I was like, savannah, can I speak to this person?
[72:17] B: Right. So you said, hey, can I speak? Right. Good job. Right. So you walked over there.
[72:22] A: Yeah.
[72:22] B: Said, hey.
[72:23] A: Yeah.
[72:23] B: Right. And then she said.
[72:24] A: And he.
[72:24] B: Or he said, did you know your sister passed? Right. Did you know your sister passed? Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[72:30] A: And then, of course, I didn't know.
[72:32] B: You said, no. Right.
[72:34] A: As soon as I went back to Savannah, Savannah was so, like, obstructed. Spoke to a man that she didn't understand.
[72:41] B: Right. Good job. Good details. So she was like, what the heck was that all about?
[72:44] A: Yeah. So it kind of caught me off guard too, you know, because, like, now I'm in trouble. And.
[72:50] B: Well, then what happened next?
[72:51] A: And then we went to court.
[72:52] B: Right.
[72:53] A: And then when we had court.
[72:54] B: Right.
[72:55] A: And then we left the courthouse. And then she told me that it was wrong, that I shouldn't have done it.
[73:01] B: Right. Good job.
[73:02] A: Went to explain, but I just felt like it didn't matter.
[73:06] B: Right. Good job. And then what happened next?
[73:08] A: Then I took a shower and cried for a little while.
[73:10] B: Right. And then that moment was over.
[73:12] A: Yeah.
[73:12] B: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to hence theater Farms. Right, right. Or take a nap. Right, Right. So notice even as you were recalling it, there was some of the discomfort.
[73:22] A: Yeah.
[73:23] B: A little bit less because you were intending to be here.
[73:25] A: Yeah.
[73:25] B: Right. So what's really crazy about a memory is we never go backwards we only go forward. But when you go backwards with a memory, it literally unplugs the memory. It takes away the charge. So we want to go backwards. Right. So we go backwards. So we got taken a nap.
[73:40] A: Yeah.
[73:41] B: We got going to Hunsinger Farms. Right. And then you were crying in the shower. Then you went to take a shower. Then you got back.
[73:45] A: Yeah.
[73:46] B: And then she's like, hey, you shouldn't have gone and talked to that guy. And then you guys left court.
[73:49] A: Yeah.
[73:49] B: And then you're in court and then you went into court. And then she's like, what are you doing talking to that guy? And then you would walk back and then he'd said, did you know that your sister died? And then you went over to talk to him. They're like, hey, can I go talk to him? Then you're like, why is this guy here? That's weird. Right. Then you guys have gone into court, and then before that you've gotten ready and driven.
[74:05] A: Right?
[74:05] B: Right. And as I go backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it crappy to go backwards or forwards compared to you telling it to me Forward. When I went backwards emotionally, how was it? Same. More or less?
[74:25] A: I don't know.
[74:27] B: Oh, you don't?
[74:28] A: I don't.
[74:29] B: Huh. Well, check.
[74:30] A: Okay.
[74:31] B: As I went backwards, I don't like it.
[74:34] A: I don't like going backwards. You can just keep going forward.
[74:39] B: I don't have any idea what you're talking about.
[74:41] A: Going back to talking.
[74:42] B: I'm not talking about that.
[74:43] A: Okay, then what are we talking about?
[74:45] B: So did I not take a memory reverse? Did you tell it to me from the beginning towards the end? Did I not tell you it back from the end towards the beginning? Right. Uh huh. And when I went backwards compared to when you told it to me forward emotionally, how was it the same? Identical.
[75:05] A: No, there was a little bit more emotion.
[75:09] B: As you told it to me or as I went backwards?
[75:11] A: No, I think it was the same. It was the same.
[75:14] B: Weird. How so?
[75:17] A: I felt the same. Whenever you got to that one certain part, the rest of it was just kind of still going.
[75:22] B: Uh huh. Well, you can remember him telling you that?
[75:25] A: Yeah.
[75:25] B: Right. You can remember putting on your socks?
[75:27] A: Yeah.
[75:28] B: Right. If I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your socks on, and then I went, natalie, stop putting on your socks. You might say to me, I'm not putting on my socks. Okay, well, are you? Not right now, no. But you can remember doing it?
[75:43] A: Yeah.
[75:43] B: And there's a difference between you remembering doing it and you actually doing it.
[75:47] A: Right?
[75:47] B: Right. So the error for all grief stuff or all trauma stuff is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening are glued together.
[75:57] A: Okay.
[75:58] B: We want to get your brain to read that. It's data. Right?
[76:03] A: Right.
[76:04] B: So I'm having a hard time checking in with really was it the same? Because I'm not so sure it was the same when I went in reverse compared to when you told it to me forward. Even if I went back to before it ever happened. Because you can tell it to me forward. You can go, well, we went to the courthouse. I saw the guy. I went over to the guy. The guy told me, hey, did you know that your sister was dead? Right. Then I went to Savannah. She's like, what the hell? Are you talking to the guy? Then I went into court. Right. Then I did the whole court thing. Then we left court, and Savannah's like, you're not supposed to talk to the guy yet, but. And then I went home. Then I took a shower, and then I started crying.
[76:39] A: Right.
[76:39] B: Then I finally got out of the shower. And then later on, I went to Uncertain forms.
[76:42] A: Right.
[76:42] B: Right. And then after that, I took a nap.
[76:44] A: Right.
[76:45] B: Right. So you can tell it to me forward. Right. And there's a little bit of stuff that goes on with that. But then when you go backwards. Right. Because your brain only has stuff attached to it. Not because buck bad yucky things happened, but because it doesn't know that it's over.
[77:01] A: Okay.
[77:02] B: When your brain is able to read something as information, the feeling tones go away. For this one, it's a little bit different because there's still going to be some sadness because it's sister. And I'm not fully complete with that. There are other. I don't think it has anything to do with you not being there.
[77:23] A: Really.
[77:23] B: Like you should have been.
[77:24] A: Not being able to say bye.
[77:26] B: Yeah. I don't think it has anything to do with that.
[77:28] A: Okay.
[77:28] B: People tend to think of this whole thing that I needed to have closure.
[77:30] A: The closure. Yeah.
[77:31] B: Yeah. Closure's amazing. Therapist.
[77:34] A: Okay. So it's not a necessity.
[77:36] B: No. But what are you closing? I don't know our relationship well. But your relationship is ongoing because your love hasn't stopped. Okay. See, that's the thing you want to start to consider now is that your relationship is actually ongoing because your love hasn't stopped.
[77:54] A: Okay.
[77:55] B: Right. Your love for her is not any less than it was.
[77:58] A: Okay.
[77:58] B: Her love for you is not any less than it was. Right. I don't have future experiences. That doesn't mean that I Don't have all the memories of the times that I did. And who she is for me, of course, is in the moment of having the experiences of being with each other. Right, Right. Which there's a lot more good ones than that one moment of that guy telling you that. Right, Right. When we really think of it, like in the timeline of stuff. Right. There's the moment of him telling you, and then there's all the other moments through the years that you got to spend with your sister through all the different times. Right. Which is there more of more times. Right. And we just want you to have access to that because that starts to open the door of who she is for you. Right. So if I go backwards, it's simply I took a nap and I went to unseen forms. And then before that, I had gotten out of the shower. Then I was crying. Then I went in the shower. Right. Then we got back, and then she's. I tried. Then she's like, you shouldn't have gone and talked to the guy. Then we got out of court. Then I was in court. Then I went into court, and then she's like, what do you do? And then I. You know, the guy had. I walked back, and then the guy told me. Then I walked over there, and then I saw. And then before that, we went to court. Before that, I got ready. Right. As it goes backwards, notice how there's a little bit of a different thing with it. And then if I say to you. Because the difference is that the memory and the experience are going glued, we want to have your brain read that. It's data. It's memory. We still don't like that it happened. Right. We probably won't ever let that happen. Right?
[79:18] A: Right.
[79:18] B: That's not what we're shooting for. Right. We just want to, like, unplug it so it's not stuck. Just like you can remember putting your socks on. You know you did it. But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting those socks on. Natalie, stop putting on your socks, you'd be like, I'm not putting on my socks. Because you're crystal clear. Clear. There's a huge difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually doing it. Okay, got it.
[79:41] A: Got it.
[79:42] B: So remember getting dressed, putting your socks. Natalie, stop putting on your socks. Say, I'm not putting on my socks.
[79:46] A: I'm not putting on my socks.
[79:47] B: Well, stop me from putting on my shoes. Say, you're not putting on your shoes.
[79:50] A: Right. Say that you're not putting on your shirt.
[79:52] B: Well, then you stop Putting on your shirt. Say, I'm not putting on my shirt. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. We'll stop him from telling you that. Say he's not telling me that.
[80:00] A: Right.
[80:01] B: Say that he's not telling me. Well, then stop that from happening. Say it's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Which is what we want to get into. The part of your brain that doesn't know that that's data.
[80:12] A: Okay.
[80:13] B: Right. As that starts to get in, what do you notice happening to the feelings?
[80:17] A: They're easing.
[80:18] B: They are easing, aren't they? And see, this isn't even the big one. The big one is another one.
[80:22] A: Okay.
[80:23] B: Isn't it?
[80:24] A: Yeah.
[80:24] B: The one that you found somebody that's a bigger one.
[80:27] A: Yeah.
[80:27] B: Right. For you, Even though this one sucks. Right. That one you were actually there.
[80:32] A: Yeah.
[80:32] B: Right. So that's the one we actually want to clear. Because then you'll actually get what we're doing and then it changes. But you want to be here.
[80:38] A: Okay.
[80:38] B: Here with me, because I'm fine. How long ago did that one happen?
[80:42] A: About a year and a half ago.
[80:43] B: Okay. With that guy. That was a year and a half ago. And things that you've done later. I know Huns Eater Farms, but something else, you know, that was fun. Did you spend any jail time?
[80:55] A: Oh, yeah.
[80:56] B: Getting out of jail.
[80:57] A: Yeah.
[80:57] B: After that, way more fun. Right? Getting out of jail, way more fun. Good. One other thing that you've done in life, anytime.
[81:05] A: Moving from assessment.
[81:06] B: Yeah. Moving from assessment down to residential. Way better, right?
[81:09] A: Yeah.
[81:09] B: Yeah. So we got going to residential, we got getting out of jail, we got going to hens, theater, farms. All of those moments happen after that. There's a part of your brain that doesn't have any access to any moment beyond that. That. So we have good news to get in. Got it. When that moment happened, a year and a half ago, when it happened, you're where?
[81:26] A: At the trailer we lived on.
[81:28] B: So you're at the trailer. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[81:30] A: Nighttime.
[81:30] B: Nighttime. And you were wearing the trailer?
[81:33] A: I was coming home.
[81:34] B: So you came home. Right. And you'd open the trailer door.
[81:36] A: And I found the letter in our bed.
[81:38] B: Right. And then you found a letter. So you come in, you went up to the bed, and then you found a letter. Was it in, like, an envelope?
[81:44] A: No, it was just laying the bed.
[81:45] B: It was just like that piece of paper. Lined. Paper was lined?
[81:49] A: Yeah.
[81:50] B: Was he in the lines?
[81:50] A: And it said, you win.
[81:52] B: And it said, you win. Right. Good. And then what Happened next.
[81:55] A: And go look in the shed.
[81:56] B: Said, you win. Go look in the shed. Okay, good. Right. And then what happened next? And be here. Hi. Notice how you're going there?
[82:01] A: Sorry.
[82:01] B: I know. No, not sorry. Watch. Be here. Hi. Come back here. Hi. Hi. Hi. Right. See, this is the really cool part, because the more that you intend to be here, the more your brain gets to get that it's data. Got it. We want your brain to read that it's data. Right. Because we want you here. You know why we want you here?
[82:19] A: Because I don't want to feel this?
[82:21] B: No, because this is. And that isn't. You're not feeling bad because that happened even though that was really sucky.
[82:27] A: Right.
[82:27] B: You're feeling bad right now because your brain doesn't know that that's not happening. This is. That isn't. You know it totally. I know you're sitting here. You can tell that you're sitting here. Right. So this is. And that isn't. Got it. But part of your brain doesn't know that that isn't. So we have. We really want to get that good news. Notice how you're coming back here. Hi. Isn't it better here?
[82:47] A: Yeah.
[82:47] B: Yeah. I like it better when you're here, too. Right? Yeah, absolutely. See, my job in the whole thing is when I notice, because I'm paying attention, that you're going there is to do whatever I need to do to get you back here.
[83:00] A: Okay.
[83:01] B: Got it. That's where we're aligned. Thank you. Interested in doing this thing together? That's right. That's right. So he said, you win. Go check the shed.
[83:10] A: Yeah.
[83:11] B: I'm not going to fucking shed.
[83:12] A: Oh, yeah, I was. I went straight to the shed.
[83:14] B: Well, of course you did, but you're. I don't want to go to the shed. Yeah, right. That's what I'd be thinking. I got to go to the goddamn shed. Right. Then you went to the shed. Right. And it's dark out. So did you have like a phone light?
[83:25] A: No, the shed had lights in it.
[83:26] B: Shed had lights. So you went in the shed, you turned the lights on.
[83:29] A: No, the lights were already on.
[83:30] B: They're already on. Right. And you walked in the shed. Right.
[83:32] A: Doors open like that much.
[83:33] B: So the door was open a little. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[83:35] A: So I said his name.
[83:37] B: Right.
[83:37] A: And he didn't answer me.
[83:38] B: Right. Good job. Good detail.
[83:39] A: Opened up the door.
[83:40] B: Right. Good job.
[83:41] A: And he was hanging.
[83:42] B: And then he was hanging. Right. And that was scary and freaky. Right. And then what happened?
[83:46] A: Next I was on my knees.
[83:48] B: Of course. Right. And then what happened next? Be here. Hi. Notice how you're there for a second.
[83:51] A: Yeah.
[83:51] B: You're good back here now.
[83:52] A: Right.
[83:52] B: Good job. You're too neighbor's house. Right.
[83:55] A: Because my cell phone wasn't working.
[83:57] B: Right.
[83:57] A: So I used their cell phone.
[83:58] B: So you went over. Right. Like the 911. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[84:02] A: They came.
[84:03] B: Yes.
[84:04] A: And then I started getting high.
[84:06] B: Well, of course. Right.
[84:08] A: And then it took like.
[84:09] B: Well, like they were on their way. And then you got high.
[84:11] A: And once they got there, they came.
[84:13] B: So they came and then they left?
[84:15] A: No.
[84:15] B: Oh, while they were still there.
[84:16] A: They were waiting on the coordinator.
[84:18] B: Oh, good job. So you're like, hey, I'm gonna go and take care of this. The thing over in the kitchen over there.
[84:23] A: I was in the bathroom.
[84:24] B: Yeah. I really gotta go. Right. Good job. Good detail. Right, Right. Good job, Good detail. Right. And then what happened next? And then the coroner came.
[84:36] A: Almost three hours.
[84:37] B: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right.
[84:39] A: And I wanted them to take him down.
[84:40] B: Right. Good job, Good detail. Right.
[84:42] A: They wouldn't take him down.
[84:43] B: Right. Until that person came. Right. Good. And what happened next?
[84:46] A: And then I told him that I wanted to see him before they left.
[84:49] B: Good job, Good detail.
[84:50] A: So before they put him in the bag.
[84:52] B: Right. But he actually wasn't in his body anymore. But you didn't know that then.
[84:55] A: No.
[84:56] B: Right. But even if you touched the body, he didn't feel quite the same, did he?
[84:59] A: No.
[84:59] B: He wasn't in there anymore. I know. Well, not just was he blue, he wasn't in it.
[85:04] A: Yeah.
[85:04] B: Right. That wasn't him. That was his body. You just didn't know that then.
[85:07] A: Right.
[85:08] B: Got it.
[85:08] A: Yeah.
[85:09] B: Right. So that didn't feel the same. And he was blue. Right. And then they took the body.
[85:13] A: Yeah. Right.
[85:13] B: And then what happened next?
[85:14] A: And then I continued to get hurt.
[85:15] B: Well, yeah, of course. Right. And then what happened next?
[85:18] A: And then I eventually passed out.
[85:20] B: Right.
[85:20] A: And woke up to the police.
[85:22] B: Right. Knocking on the door.
[85:23] A: Yeah. The neighbors. Baker acted me.
[85:25] B: All right. Good job. Right.
[85:26] A: Yeah.
[85:26] B: And then you went to the hospital.
[85:27] A: Yeah.
[85:28] B: And then that moment ended.
[85:29] A: Yeah.
[85:29] B: And eventually got out. Right, Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[85:33] A: Yeah.
[85:33] B: Right.
[85:34] A: Yeah.
[85:34] B: Like move from residential to assess it. Right. Move from assessment to residential.
[85:38] A: Right, Right. Yeah.
[85:39] B: Good. On cedar farms. Right. Get out of jail. Right. Good. Now, notice again, as you were telling me about it, all that discomfort, again, not because that was so sucky, but because your brain was confusing the memory as you were Intending to be here. Your brain was beginning to unplug it. So it gets that it's data. We still don't like that it happened. We never will. That was sucky.
[85:59] A: Yeah.
[86:00] B: Right. And sucky. No, but sucky. Right. So now we want to get it wiped even more clear. Right. So we go backwards. Right. So we got going to hunt stater farms. We got moving from assessment to residential. I did that. Right, Right. Before that we got getting out of jail. Right. And then you got out of the hospital. Then you're in the hospital and then the police took you to the hospital. Right. And then you've woken up. Right. And then you finally passed out and then you were getting high. Right. And then they taken the body and then you touched the body and saw the face and didn't look the same. And then you're like waiting, Right. And then you'd gotten high and then they had gotten there and then you had called 911 and then you went over to the neighbor's house and then you had left and then you had seen the body and then you had walked in and then you had yelled in and then you had saw the door crack and then you'd walk to the shed.
[86:47] A: Right?
[86:48] B: Right. And then you had seen the. No. Right. And then you had gone into the trailer and then before that you've gone back and then before that you were doing. Doing whatever you're doing.
[86:57] A: Yeah.
[86:57] B: Right. And as we go backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was was alright. Notice how it's getting a little bit less. Isn't that weird?
[87:05] A: Yeah.
[87:06] B: Right. Because your brain is beginning to read it as data. Right? You can remember that happening. You can remember seeing the note. Right. You can remember putting your pants on. Natalie, stop putting in your pants.
[87:16] A: I didn't put on.
[87:17] B: No, you did. They're gone. Don't tell me that you didn't because I'm clearly t and they are totally on right now. But stop putting on your pants. See, I'm not putting on my pants. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt.
[87:30] A: You're not putting on your shirt.
[87:31] B: Right. Well then stop Sam from putting on her jeans.
[87:32] A: She's not putting on her jeans.
[87:34] B: Right, well then stop him from writing the note. He's not writing the note. Well then you stop putting your hair in a pony. Say I'm not putting my hair. Well, stop me from putting on my watch.
[87:43] A: You're not putting on.
[87:43] B: We'll stop him from doing that. See, he's not doing that. Say that. Well then stop that from happening. Say it's not happening.
[87:49] A: It's not happening.
[87:49] B: So then where does it say no longer exists? Bingo. Which is what we want to get in to the part of your brain. Now, notice how there's another part to that that's kind of feeling like it's my fault because of what he wrote. Right? So would it be okay to get that going?
[88:04] A: Okay.
[88:05] B: It would be.
[88:06] A: Yeah.
[88:06] B: Yeah. Right. Because you've been thinking that him doing that had everything to do with you, right? Did it?
[88:13] A: I don't know.
[88:14] B: You don't know? But think of. I'll give you a couple examples, right? Think of a kid, right? Who is carrying a train to the cafeteria. Trips and falls, right? All of a sudden, shit splatters everywhere. You know, spaghetti. So it's like all over the place, right? It was loud in the cafeteria. Now it's quiet. They all turn. They all look. They see the kids sprawled on the floor, and they all start laughing, right? Mercilessly making fun of them. Loser. Idiot. Can't tell, right? The kid wants Harry Potter's invisibility clothes. Put it on. Let me get the hell out of here. Right?
[88:43] A: Right.
[88:43] B: He's feeling. They're all laughing at me. But are they?
[88:48] A: No.
[88:48] B: No. Would it have mattered whether it was that kid or any other kid in the school?
[88:52] A: No.
[88:52] B: Isn't that what they would have done?
[88:54] A: Yes.
[88:54] B: Right? Kid comes home, he's got three Ds and two Fs on his report card. Mom has fourth grader, right? She said, you wait until your father comes home. Dad comes home. Dad sees mom, dad sees grades. Dad is even more enraged, right? Walks to the kid's room. As he's doing it, he's unbuckling his belt, taking it off. Slams open the door, grabs the kid by the back of his neck, yanks his pants down, puts him over the bed and just starts whacking on him. Right? The kid is totally feeling like I'm getting hit because I got poor grades.
[89:31] A: Right.
[89:32] B: But is he?
[89:33] A: No.
[89:34] B: No. Right. Had to do with whatever the hell was going on in dad, right? Right. Cause isn't there more than one way to handle poor grades?
[89:45] A: Very much so.
[89:46] B: Right. That you, when reading the note, thought that him doing that had everything to do with you, did it?
[89:55] A: No.
[89:56] B: No. Had to do with what was going on in him. Right. You also didn't know back then how not well, he was.
[90:08] A: Right.
[90:09] B: Got it. Because it wasn't just stuff that was going on between the two of you. It was all sorts of other stuff. And a lot of stuff that led. Got It. Right, but see, back then that you thought in reading that him doing that had everything to do with me.
[90:25] A: Right?
[90:26] B: Right. I didn't even get to feel good about winning. Bullshit. Normally if I win in a game, I could feel good. It's bullshit. I don't get to feel good at all. That is not one way to win. Right. It's that whole thing about like suicide when somebody goes, God, I was unsuccessful at that. Like. Right. So again, that happening, did it have anything to do with you or did it have to do with whatever was going on in him?
[90:55] A: What was going on in him?
[90:56] B: Yeah. But you didn't know that then. Right? So we want that news to get into the earlier you. So how it's going to work, whether you do it or not is I want you to close your eyes. I won't watch. And I want you to picture the earlier you. I want you to let her know that that moment is over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists. Let her know that him doing that had everything to do with what was going on with him. It's not about me. So repeat these four words. Ready? Here we go. It's. It's not about me. Right? One more.
[91:29] A: It's not about me.
[91:31] B: Right. One more time. It's not about me.
[91:32] A: It's not about me.
[91:33] B: That's right. It's not about me. Right. Because that yearly or you doesn't know that him doing that had nothing to do with you. Everything to do with what was going on with him.
[91:42] A: Right.
[91:42] B: And how screwed up things were that he would even write that shows how stuff was screwed up in him.
[91:49] A: Right.
[91:50] B: Make sense?
[91:51] A: Yes.
[91:51] B: You didn't know that then. So close your eyes. Picture that earlier you let the earlier you know.
[91:57] A: Okay. It's not about me.
[91:59] B: Right. That it's over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists.
[92:02] A: It's over, defeated, completed.
[92:06] B: Right. That it no longer exists. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about getting clean. Let her know about getting out of jail. Let her know. Know about going from assessment to residential. Letting her know about going to Huns theater farms. Letting her know so that she gets it.
[92:21] A: Okay.
[92:21] B: And as she gets it, what do you notice happening to her face? Yay. There you go.
[92:30] A: Thank you.
[92:32] B: Right, right. Notice what's happening in your body now. Right? Because she's not stuck there.
[92:39] A: Right.
[92:40] B: We still don't like that it happened. We never will. Right? So the deal with all the yucky stuff that we've gone through, we still don't like that it happened.
[92:48] A: Right.
[92:49] B: Right. But I'm not troubled because it happened. I'm troubled ongoingly because my brain doesn't know that it stopped, that it's over, that I made it through it. There was a part of your brain that was ongoingly seeing the note and seeing the body that you also didn't know when you touched the body that he wasn't in it anymore.
[93:16] A: Right.
[93:17] B: Right. Now we're getting better information, too. And that he's not hurting. Right, right. Got it. And when somebody's not hurting, they're also not wanting you to hurt.
[93:32] A: Okay.
[93:32] B: Right. Have you ever noticed, like, if somebody's angry and you tell them whatever it is that they're angry about, that they shouldn't be angry at it? You know what happens? They get angry at you. What the hell? Like, I'm trying to help them out, telling them it's not that big of a deal. Now they're mad at me. Right. We're angry here. Right. Like. Right. So when somebody is no longer hurting, they're also not interested in others around them hurting.
[93:55] A: Okay.
[93:56] B: Make sense?
[93:57] A: Yes.
[93:58] B: So this is what's starting to happen. Things are starting to change inside. So again, we want to begin to lighten the load because there's been a pretty heavy weight that you've been carrying around for a long, long, long time. We want you to be more at peace. And see, we're aligning towards mutual goals that we totally want for you. I'm so interested in it. Got it. And you're also interested in the same thing. So again, real simple. You just start to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower. So that when you breathe in, it kind of breathes into your belly and then up to your chest and then out from your chest and down. So it even moves down into your pelvic floor area. Because that kind is slower. That's right. Deeper breath. Notice what's happening in your body. Right. Isn't that a cool thing, how your body also settles and now your unconscious, knowing that it knows that we know what we're doing, can travel back and bring one of those early yucky moments. Right. Ones that I don't want to so that we can get you. You to be free.
[95:16] A: Okay.
[95:17] B: Right. Because it's way more fun to be here.
[95:18] A: Right?
[95:19] B: That's right. No, my job is to keep you here.
[95:23] A: Right?
[95:23] B: That's right. So what's a moment that comes to mind now? Oh, yeah, that one. That would be a good one. Damn it.
[95:34] A: Okay, so.
[95:35] B: So that one happened. You might have been how old I was 6. Oh, we don't want to think of all of those. That would be way too much. Okay, Right. If I had to deal with a whole group of ants coming into my house, I want to deal with one at a time.
[95:49] A: Yeah.
[95:51] B: All right, so we think of one time that it did.
[95:53] A: Yeah.
[95:54] B: Even though it happened more than once. Right. Good. So that one time that it happened, you might have been how old? Don't make it up.
[96:01] A: Eight.
[96:01] B: Eight. Good. And you might have been where?
[96:03] A: In my bed.
[96:04] B: So in your bed. Good. Daytime or nighttime?
[96:06] A: Nighttime.
[96:06] B: Nighttime. And you're like, under the sheets. Right. Good. So you're in your bed under the sheets. Right. And then what happened? Next door open. Right. And then dad walked in. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[96:17] A: He got in the bed with.
[96:18] B: So he got in bed with you? Right. Good. And that was weird. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[96:23] A: And then he proceeded to take my clothes off.
[96:27] B: So then he pulled your clothes off. Right. Good. And that was weird.
[96:30] A: Yeah.
[96:30] B: Right. Then what happened next?
[96:32] A: And then he started with molesting me.
[96:36] B: So he did what? He touched your body. He put his finger between your legs. Right. Did he put his finger in your vagina? Right. All that was weird. Some of it might have felt good, but it was all weird. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[96:45] A: And then you started using his penis.
[96:47] B: Right. Then he put his penis in your vagina. Right. And that was weird. Maybe in your mouth. Right. And that was all weird. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[96:54] A: And then it would be over.
[96:56] B: And then he stopped. Right. And then he got out of bed. Right. And then he left. And then it was way better Right. When he left. Well, it would have been better than when he was doing it.
[97:06] A: Right?
[97:07] B: Right. Even if it was sucky afterwards, it was still better than when he was doing it. Right. Good. And then that moment was over. And then the next day you went and did whatever you did.
[97:15] A: Right?
[97:15] B: Right. And then later on, unless I had bruises. Right.
[97:18] A: Then I wouldn't go to school.
[97:19] B: Right. But you still did whatever you did.
[97:20] A: Yeah.
[97:21] B: Right. Got it. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[97:25] A: Yeah.
[97:26] B: Like a Dutch. Yeah.
[97:27] A: Yeah.
[97:27] B: Right. Or, you know, go from assessment to residential.
[97:31] A: Yeah.
[97:31] B: Right. Or go to huns, theater farms, even take a nap.
[97:34] A: Yeah.
[97:34] B: Right. Now, again, notice how you're staying here. Right. Notice how that's even better. Right. Because your brain is getting it more.
[97:42] A: Right.
[97:42] B: Right. Because it's never been troubling you about the stuff that happened because it happened.
[97:46] A: Right.
[97:46] B: It just hasn't known that it Stopped.
[97:48] A: Yeah.
[97:49] B: Right. So now we go backwards. Right. So, yeah, taking a nap on the Huns hater farms. Going from, you know, assessment to residential. Right. And then getting out of jail. Right. Then you're off doing whatever you're doing. And then he had left. Well, then you woke up. And then before that he had left. Right. And then he had stopped. And then he had his penis and your vagina, maybe in your mouth. And he'd had his hands all over your body, fingers and stuff. And then he had taken your clothes off. And then he got in bed and then he came into your room. Right. And then before that you'd gone to bed.
[98:17] A: Right.
[98:17] B: And then before that you were doing whatever you're doing. And again, as we go backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it?
[98:23] A: All right.
[98:23] B: Right. Notice how it's getting less. You can remember him doing that. You remember touching stuff, putting stuff. You can remember all that happening. Right. You can remember, you know, putting your socks on.
[98:32] A: Yeah.
[98:33] B: Natalie, stop putting on your socks.
[98:35] A: I'm not putting on my socks.
[98:36] B: That's right. Well then stop getting that tattoo. Well then stop me from kissing my daughter. Say you're not kissing her daughter.
[98:43] A: I'm not kissing my daughter?
[98:44] B: No, I'm not kissing my daughter.
[98:45] A: Oh, you're not kissing.
[98:46] B: Right. Am I? No, no. I did this morning.
[98:48] A: Okay.
[98:48] B: Right. No, actually I didn't. She kissed me on the cheek because she put lipstick on my nine year old. Great. Awesome.
[98:53] A: Oh, wow.
[98:53] B: Well, she was wearing a pretty dress, so. Dad, if I'm wearing a pretty dress, I have to put makeup on at 9. Sure you do, sweetheart. Yeah, of course. I didn't know that you were putting makeup on. That's why we were a little late getting to school this morning. Oh, good job. It got a little bit. Right. But you can remember dad doing that, right? You can remember putting your pants on. I'm not putting on my pants.
[99:16] A: No.
[99:17] B: Right. Well, stop me from putting on my cool sneaks.
[99:20] A: You're not putting on your sneaks.
[99:21] B: Well, then stop dad from doing that.
[99:23] A: He's not doing it.
[99:23] B: Yeah, so then where is it? Say it doesn't exist. Doesn't exist again, dad, doing that. Did that have anything to do with you?
[99:31] A: No.
[99:31] B: No. Would it matter whether it was you or some other girl born to that dad at that time? Isn't that what he would have done? Yeah, right. Because dad wasn't well. But you didn't know that back then. Had nothing to do with you. And even if some of it felt good, it had nothing to do with me. Wanting it.
[99:45] A: Right.
[99:45] B: Like, people get all confused because body parts sometimes feel good when they're touched in certain ways, but it's nothing to do with, like, me wanting it. It's everything to do with that body part touched in a certain way is designed to feel good. That's the purpose. Right. Nothing to do with me wanting it.
[99:58] A: Right.
[99:59] B: Right. But you didn't know any of that back then.
[100:01] A: No.
[100:01] B: Right. We want to get that good news in.
[100:03] A: Yes.
[100:04] B: Right. So again, you can close your eyes and picture the younger you. You can let the younger you know, over, finished, completed, defeated, no longer exist.
[100:11] A: Over, finished, completed, defeated, no longer.
[100:14] B: Good job. You can let her know that that happening had nothing to do with you.
[100:18] A: It had nothing to do with me.
[100:20] B: Had everything to do with what was off with dad. It's not about me.
[100:22] A: It had to be what was off with dad. Not about me.
[100:26] B: So that she gets it. That's right. Let her know that you're okay.
[100:30] A: Okay.
[100:31] B: Let her know about getting out of jail and going from assessment to residential, going to Hunsinger. Let her know so that she gets it, that you're okay. And as that all gets in, what do you notice happening to the earlier?
[100:46] A: You feeling better?
[100:48] B: You are, Right? Right. And now what we also want to get in is show you something. Because although he was dad, there was love and affinity at times because he was dad, but then there was physical stuff that happened to body. By the way, there's no part right now that's the same as it was then. Right? Right. So there's not a single aspect.
[101:04] A: The reasoning as a child was that I reminded him of Mom.
[101:08] B: No. Well, that's great.
[101:09] A: I was a lot like mom at.
[101:11] B: Seven, but mom left eight.
[101:12] A: Yeah.
[101:13] B: Six, nine.
[101:16] A: Yeah.
[101:17] B: Right. My daughter is nine. And there's nothing about my daughter at nine.
[101:23] A: Yeah.
[101:24] B: That reminds me of my wife. Does she have some of the characteristics of my wife? Yes. But my wife is six foot and my daughter's like four foot.
[101:36] A: Right. Your wife's really six foot. How tall are you?
[101:40] B: She's taller than me. I'm 5 11. She would say she's 6 1. So, yeah, she's taller than me.
[101:48] A: Okay.
[101:48] B: Yeah.
[101:50] A: Wow. Okay. And then she puts the heels on.
[101:53] B: Oh, yeah, that's right. The good news is I've got these big hands, so our reach is the same.
[101:59] A: Oh, okay. So she don't like basketball. Yeah, that's right.
[102:08] B: Yeah. Right.
[102:09] A: Okay.
[102:10] B: So what I want to show you, once you take your hand like that. Good. Look at that spot right there. Okay, good. Now I'M going to move closer. I'm going to take my hand. I'm going to move it towards your hand. I'm not going to touch your hand, but you're going to see it moving closer. As my hand gets a little bit closer to your hand, you're going to get. That's right. You're going to notice a little bit of warmth. Right. You can kind of feel the energy from my hand. Yeah, that's right. Close to your hand, but not touching your hand.
[102:35] A: Right.
[102:35] B: Right. See, this is me coming closer. Closer to touching who you really are. Okay. Because who you are can only be touched with respect. That's right. And the love that you allow in.
[102:50] A: Okay.
[102:51] B: Right. Isn't that interesting?
[102:53] A: Yeah.
[102:54] B: Right. Cool. You can feel that, right? Yeah. So now watch. Repeat this after me. You can let that down. I have a nose. I have 10 fingers. I have two elbows. I have 10 toes. I'm not my elbows. I'm not my fingers. I'm not my toes. I'm not my nose. I have a vagina. I'm not my vagina. My vagina is mine.
[103:24] A: My vagina is mine.
[103:25] B: But it isn't actually me.
[103:26] A: But it's not actually me.
[103:27] B: Right. So he messed with my stuff.
[103:29] A: Right.
[103:30] B: He messed with my stuff. Stuff. And it hurt my feelings.
[103:33] A: Right.
[103:33] B: And it screwed up my thinking.
[103:34] A: Right?
[103:35] B: Right. But he never touched who I really am.
[103:38] A: Right.
[103:38] B: Right. Say that. He never touched who I really am.
[103:40] A: He never touched who I really am.
[103:42] B: He never got me.
[103:43] A: He never got me.
[103:44] B: He messed with my stuff.
[103:45] A: He messed with my stuff.
[103:46] B: But he never touched me.
[103:48] A: But he never touched me.
[103:48] B: Not in that way.
[103:49] A: Not in that way.
[103:50] B: Right. Because who I am can only be touched with respect and the love that I allow in.
[103:58] A: And the love that I allow in.
[103:59] B: That's right. So we mess with my stuff.
[104:01] A: He messed with my stuff.
[104:02] B: But he never got me.
[104:03] A: But he never got me.
[104:04] B: That's right.
[104:04] A: Okay.
[104:05] B: Yeah. And just kind of check that out for a moment. Take a deep breath in. And a long exhale. And one more deep breath in. Right. And just kind of check inside. What you noticing?
[104:27] A: Um, contentness.
[104:29] B: Oh, right. We like that feeling. Contentedness. Right? Right. Think about that stuff and try to feel like it was your fault.
[104:39] A: Okay. Okay.
[104:43] B: What are you noticing?
[104:45] A: Um, anxiety.
[104:48] B: What about.
[104:49] A: What about feeling like it was my fault?
[104:52] B: Was it your fault?
[104:53] A: No.
[104:54] B: Oh, well, check. Try to feel like it was.
[104:56] A: I can't.
[104:57] B: Oh, that's right, Natalie, you can't, can you?
[105:03] A: No.
[105:04] B: That's right. Notice how that's different.
[105:07] A: Yes.
[105:07] B: And notice how that's different than it's ever been. Yes, right, right. Because up until now, even though I knew it wasn't, it still felt a little bit like it was. Try to think about, you know, going to court and him being prosecuted.
[105:23] A: No, that was horrible. I think that was horrible. Than the actual abuse.
[105:28] B: Uh huh. Oh, well, let's get that cleared.
[105:31] A: Oh, God.
[105:34] B: Hey, going through the trial was so horrible. Right. You were how old when that happened?
[105:39] A: I was 10.
[105:40] B: 10. Right. And you're where like think of that part that kind of like pops to mind. That's like the courtroom. So you're in the courtroom on the stand. Right. And he's there. Right. So he's like with the defense attorney. And you're on the stand and you're having to. You did the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help me. Right. Not supposed to. What is it?
[105:58] A: Yeah, the right one.
[105:59] B: Yeah. And the Bible, right? Is that how we do it?
[106:01] A: Yeah. No, they just raised the Right.
[106:03] B: Just raised. You don't have to put it on the Bible anymore. Thought we're in the South. Everything had to do with the Bible. No. Okay, so just this right as this means something. I'm not gonna lie. That's what we're saying, right?
[106:15] A: Right.
[106:15] B: Okay, good. But we don't. Do we still say, so help me God. No, we don't say. We do say that.
[106:22] A: Well, they say it. And you just hold your hand up.
[106:24] B: And then you say yes, I tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help me God.
[106:27] A: Whatever they say, however it goes.
[106:29] B: I don't know how it goes either. Sorry, it's not my experience. Yeah, right. So you did all that. Right. And then the prosecutor was asking you questions.
[106:37] A: Well. And the caseworker, like the caseworker was next to me.
[106:41] B: So the caseworker was sitting next to you.
[106:42] A: Yeah.
[106:43] B: Right.
[106:44] A: Well, she was standing.
[106:45] B: Standing. Right. So she was standing. And like, then you had like answer these questions about what he did. Yeah, right. And see him as you're answering the question. We would have really liked at that time to know what the fucking peripheral vision thing. Thing was going to do.
[106:57] A: Yeah.
[106:58] B: Because then I could have been in that state.
[107:00] A: Yeah.
[107:00] B: Instead of this state. Right, right. Good. So you said all the stuff. Right. And then what happened next?
[107:06] A: And then I was dismissed.
[107:09] B: Right. Good job.
[107:09] A: And it was for the jury to decide.
[107:12] B: Right, good. Then what happened next?
[107:13] A: I don't really know.
[107:14] B: Right. Because you weren't there.
[107:16] A: Went to prison.
[107:17] B: Well, something happened.
[107:18] A: I went back to the foster home that I was at Right.
[107:21] B: So you went back to the foster home. Right. And then later on you did something more fun.
[107:25] A: Yeah.
[107:25] B: Like go to Hunter Farms.
[107:27] A: Went to RJ Gators.
[107:29] B: RJ Gators.
[107:30] A: Oh, right.
[107:31] B: But RJ Cater. That was more fun than that too, wasn't it? Good job.
[107:35] A: And I got pied in the face. Cuz it was my adoption.
[107:39] B: You got pied in the face? Yeah.
[107:44] A: It was horrible.
[107:45] B: I bet. Yeah. I don't think that would have been a fun experience. I don't want to get pied in the face either. Well, then my kids had this little game where you put like a little whipped cream thing.
[107:52] A: And that's what it was. The whipped cream and the coffee thing, Whatever you put the coffee in to make the coffee in the morning is what it is called.
[108:02] B: Yeah.
[108:02] A: The little filters. Yeah.
[108:03] B: Okay.
[108:03] A: The filters. Yeah. You put the whipped cream in the filters, huh?
[108:07] B: Yeah. That's how we go about making. That's fine.
[108:11] A: That's how we pie each other in things.
[108:15] B: Right. Which was still more fun than being on the stand.
[108:17] A: Yeah.
[108:18] B: Right, Right. So we got, you know, our J. Gater's pie in the face. Right. And then you had left. Right. And then you were dismissed. And then you had answered the questions with the caseworker standing next to you. And then you had to go up there. Then before that, you'd gone to the court.
[108:32] A: Right.
[108:32] B: And then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing.
[108:34] A: Yeah.
[108:34] B: Right. And again, as we go backwards compared to forward, what do you notice?
[108:37] A: It feels better.
[108:38] B: Right. You can remember it all happening. You can remember putting your socks on.
[108:41] A: Yeah.
[108:41] B: Natalie, stop putting.
[108:42] A: Stop putting on myself.
[108:43] B: That's right. Well then stop sitting in the courthouse.
[108:44] A: I'm not sitting in the courthouse.
[108:46] B: Right. Well then stop that from happening. It's not happening. Right. So where is it? Say it no longer exists. That's right. Good job. It's gone.
[108:54] A: Yeah.
[108:54] B: Right? It's data.
[108:56] A: Yeah.
[108:56] B: See, all we want is your brain to read awful moments as data.
[109:00] A: Okay?
[109:00] B: That doesn't make the awful moment any less of an awful moment. But it doesn't have the awful moment exist now.
[109:06] A: Right.
[109:07] B: That's the difference.
[109:09] A: Okay.
[109:09] B: God, I still don't like that it happened.
[109:10] A: Yeah.
[109:11] B: We're not gonna go, hey, top three experiences of my life.
[109:13] A: Yeah.
[109:14] B: One, finding the note. Two, being in the courtroom.
[109:16] A: Right.
[109:16] B: Life is not like we're not gone. Right. There's so many other experiences that were way better than those. So we're not going for top three experiences of my life. Right, but we want your brain to read what Happened as data and to see it clearly for what it was. Right. And as you're beginning to see it clearly for what it was, check inside. How's your body feeling now?
[109:39] A: Good. It didn't really happen to me or.
[109:46] B: It happened to me, not it happened to you.
[109:49] A: Something.
[109:49] B: They're experiences that did happen.
[109:52] A: Okay.
[109:52] B: The difference is your brain is for the first time reading them as data about stuff that happened, not happening. Got it. That's the part that we really want to get in. Right. Because as it starts to read it as data, notice, think about it and try to feel bad. No, Right, right. Oh, and by the way, that was really cool. Not only did you think about it and look for it, your body took a nice big deep breath in and a nice long exhale at the same time. So not only did you answer the question, so did your body. Isn't that cool? Absolutely. Right. So things are changing. So now we want to clear up stuff that you felt bad about. About.
[110:50] A: Okay.
[110:51] B: Because there has been things that you wish you hadn't done that you did. Right? Right. Yeah. So what's one of those moments that comes to mind?
[111:02] A: Our abortions.
[111:03] B: Ah, okay. We have more than one.
[111:06] A: Yeah.
[111:07] B: Okay.
[111:07] A: I have three.
[111:08] B: Three. All three. Okay. So one happened when you might have been how old?
[111:16] A: The first one was 21.
[111:18] B: Right. So you're 21. Right. You're where?
[111:21] A: And Brandon.
[111:22] B: Right? Brandon until he is like two and little kids too.
[111:27] A: Yeah.
[111:28] B: Right. So you're in Brandon. You got a two year old. Right. And then what happened? So you found out that you were pregnant?
[111:33] A: I was pregnant again. And I went to the clinic.
[111:38] B: Yeah.
[111:38] A: And they did the sonogram. And then they give me me pills. And then they gave me pills to go home with.
[111:44] B: That's right. Did you have a conversation with whomever you were with?
[111:47] A: The. The father?
[111:48] B: Yeah.
[111:49] A: Yeah. He paid for it.
[111:50] B: Right. So he's like, I don't want a kid.
[111:51] A: Yeah, right. No, Till. Yeah, it was.
[111:54] B: No, he's like, I'm done. One Good. Done.
[111:56] A: Yeah.
[111:56] B: Yeah.
[111:57] A: And so I told him that he had to obviously take care of her.
[112:00] B: Right.
[112:01] A: While I was going.
[112:02] B: Good job, good detail. Right? Yes.
[112:03] A: Yeah. And then he drove me there.
[112:06] B: Yes.
[112:07] A: We got all the medication and stuff like that. And then I went home and self medicated and took the pills.
[112:14] B: Right.
[112:14] A: And passed the baby in the toilet.
[112:17] B: Right. Or not the baby.
[112:19] A: Right.
[112:20] B: At least whatever was. Yeah. It wasn't really a baby.
[112:24] A: Right.
[112:24] B: It was whatever was right there that could have formed you. But isn't.
[112:28] A: Right.
[112:29] B: Right. And then that Was over.
[112:30] A: Right.
[112:31] B: And then later on, you did something more fun. Yeah. Right.
[112:33] A: Like got to play with my daughter again.
[112:37] B: You did, right? Did you see pumpkins?
[112:39] A: I wasn't laying in the bed.
[112:40] B: You weren't, were you? No. So playing with your daughter was more fun, seeing pumpkins?
[112:44] A: Yeah.
[112:44] B: Right. Did you go on a hayride when you were at Hunt's Hager Farms?
[112:48] A: No, we didn't. The haywire was for the children. We don't go on them and follow the little kids around there. All the little kids look at us like, what are you doing? This is our.
[113:01] B: Do they have apple cider?
[113:03] A: O. I don't like apple cider.
[113:05] B: How about apple cinnamon donuts?
[113:08] A: No. Apple Chris funnel cake? Yeah. And I had funnel cake.
[113:12] B: Well, that's better.
[113:13] A: Yeah.
[113:13] B: Right. See, the thing about being up north, where I grew up, we would always go to the different apple orchards. They're all kind of, like, around each other. And then they would have apple cider, which was really fresh, which was really good. The same way time. I liked apple cider because it was, like, super fresh. And then they'd have these, like, apple cinnamon donuts. Just, like, hot now. Like Krispy Kreme, but, like, better than Krispy Kreme.
[113:34] A: That's crazy.
[113:35] B: They're really good.
[113:36] A: Yeah.
[113:36] B: And it was nice and cold. So you'd also get, like, a little cup of cocoa with it.
[113:40] A: Yeah.
[113:41] B: Hot apple cider with it, like. Yeah. It was always good like that. Yeah. Yeah. And again, you can remember that that happened. Right. You can remember putting your socks on.
[113:49] A: Yeah.
[113:49] B: Stop putting on those socks. Okay, I'll not put on my socks. Right, Right. Well, then stop doing that. Say, I'm not doing that.
[113:56] A: I'm not doing that.
[113:56] B: Right. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[113:58] A: It no longer exists.
[113:59] B: Right. And again, we're not. That whole thing happened. Right. The part of that that's troubling you or that has been troubling you about that happening. What about it's troubling.
[114:13] A: That I chose to not have my child? That I made a decision?
[114:20] B: Was it just you?
[114:22] A: Well, I mean, ultimately, yes, it's my decision. It's my body. If I didn't have.
[114:29] B: Not anymore.
[114:30] A: Well, whatever it is, we're getting rid of that.
[114:32] B: My opinion is I got it, but we're getting rid of that.
[114:34] A: It doesn't matter what those people say or do. If I'm gonna have an abortion, I'm gonna have an abortion. They can't. Can't do or say nothing about it. And those clinics don't care what those people say. They care about the money that you're going to give them for this.
[114:49] B: I don't know. Law's changing.
[114:50] A: Okay. I'm trying to tell you. When I went there, there was people standing outside.
[114:55] B: That was a while ago. I know, but now we got a whole different law.
[114:58] A: Okay, well, the last one that I had was. Let's see, I'm 33, so. 27.
[115:08] B: Long time ago. Six years ago. You gals used to have rights, right? Yeah. Not anymore. Trying to get rid of them.
[115:14] A: Has that really been passed?
[115:16] B: Oh, yeah.
[115:16] A: Really?
[115:17] B: Yeah. We got rid of Roe vs. Raid, the Dobbs decision, get that gone now, leave it to the States and crazy staser going like you have like a week and a half to determine whether you want to or not. No, it's not that much. Six weeks I think is what they sent them. That's still crazy. I know, right? Who knows what happens after the election? They may change it back, but.
[115:38] A: Yeah, I didn't know it was.
[115:40] B: We're also going to get rid of gay rights as well. No. And then we're going to get rid of birth control. So there are. There's a whole faction that's all about that. It's a crazy thing, huh?
[115:54] A: You can't get rid of gay rights and you definitely can't get rid of birth control because not only does birth control prevent you from getting pregnant, it also helps a lot of women, like regularly. Cuz there's a lot that. Yeah.
[116:09] B: Yes. But us white men don't want to have you. All gals have rights anymore.
[116:13] A: White men. Did you really just say that?
[116:16] B: Yeah. Who else is in Congress?
[116:18] A: Okay, well, that's true.
[116:20] B: Old white men.
[116:23] A: Okay, so now what are you drinking?
[116:29] B: Smoothie. Yeah.
[116:30] A: You got enough greens for the day? We're going to let you know that.
[116:35] B: That'S just banana protein powder and almond milk and a little bit of almond butter. What makes it green? This is not green.
[116:46] A: What is that?
[116:47] B: It's brown. Army green. Maybe the chocolate powder and a little vanilla. Okay, that's fine. Yeah. Isn't that a crazy situation though?
[116:59] A: Yes, it really is.
[117:01] B: It is.
[117:01] A: That's crazy.
[117:02] B: I know. Yeah.
[117:04] A: I didn't even know this. See, we don't watch TV really, so.
[117:08] B: That is so much better.
[117:09] A: I know. Yeah. And when we do, it's like Netflix or something like that, so we don't see the news or anything, which I guess is kind of a good thing. But then again it's not because we don't know what's going On.
[117:24] B: Yeah, well, it's been a. A very polarizing kind of topic, and lots of people just, like you are not in favor of that aspect.
[117:33] A: Yeah, I don't feel that that's. No, I mean, I understand, like, making it a certain age limit, obviously, so the girls aren't going without their parents to get abortions. You know, at least they'll have a support system. System or something like that for them.
[117:48] B: But I agree with you. I think women.
[117:51] A: But yeah, it's our body. Like, if we don't want to go through that again. Really. Okay, well, I mean, if your wife was to come to you and tell you, honey, I'm pregnant, like, right now, today, and she decided that she didn't want to keep it, you would be okay. No, you wouldn't support.
[118:13] B: Of course I'm gonna support her. Okay.
[118:16] A: Even if you didn't want it, even if you wanted to have the baby and she didn't, you would still support her.
[118:22] B: Of course.
[118:23] A: Okay.
[118:24] B: I think it's ultimately up to her.
[118:26] A: Right.
[118:27] B: But that's my opinion. And that's your opinion. But that doesn't mean. That's a lot of other people's opinions.
[118:33] A: Yeah. And that's horrible.
[118:36] B: That's horrible. Okay. Right. Well, we live in a kind of a weird, weird political culture.
[118:47] A: Right.
[118:47] B: Right now where we've got extremisms on both sides of the. Of the aisle. So we could. We could use a little moderate rational.
[118:56] A: Right.
[118:57] B: Thoughts on things.
[118:58] A: Yeah. That's why they should put a woman in it. I really believe that. I really believe a woman in it.
[119:05] B: Was the Supreme Court with the last two nominees saying it's settled law, and then they change it. So it wasn't really settled law, but they changed it. But if, I guess if the Congress or Senate, something switches during the election, then they can actually put something in that makes it the rule of the land again. And the Supreme Court can't do anything about that. So we'll see what happens.
[119:28] A: Okay.
[119:31] B: All right.
[119:32] A: That was a great session. Thank you.
[119:36] B: Yeah. But again. So you felt bad that you did it.
[119:40] A: Right.
[119:41] B: Okay.
[119:42] A: Yeah. Like, I shouldn't have decided what my blessings were. You know, I should have just accepted them.
[119:51] B: Yes. But at that time that that was going on, you were also actively using.
[119:58] A: Well, I had started using again. And like I said, Talia was a toddler and things, and you would start using. Me and him weren't. Yeah. And me and him weren't like. I mean, he would come to stay the night, and then by the time morning was here, he Was gone. So it wasn't like we were like together.
[120:16] B: Right.
[120:17] A: And here I already have this child and I'm kind of struggling and I'm doing drugs again and.
[120:23] B: Right.
[120:23] A: I couldn't imagine bringing a child.
[120:26] B: Got it. So. So what you did, in a selfless way.
[120:29] A: Yeah. But I should.
[120:32] B: Was best for that baby.
[120:34] A: Right.
[120:35] B: Which was not being born to a body that wasn't able.
[120:40] A: Cuz I didn't even consider it with Talia. Like nothing. I didn't.
[120:43] B: Of course not.
[120:44] A: And it was. I was scared already that there was going to be something wrong. And then I breastfed for six months and I didn't use them either.
[120:53] B: Yeah.
[120:54] A: As soon as she came off though, I was right back at it. Smoking cigarettes and using drugs.
[121:00] B: Yeah. Right, right, right. So that wouldn't have been best for that fetus.
[121:05] A: Right.
[121:06] B: Got it. That's out of your love.
[121:09] A: Right? Yeah. At least that's how I looked at it.
[121:13] B: Well, no, check it out right now.
[121:15] A: Yeah.
[121:15] B: Because now you're seeing it clearly.
[121:17] A: Yeah.
[121:17] B: Right. So as you get it that it was out of your love for that fetus that you did that because you weren't in the right healthy state.
[121:26] A: Right.
[121:27] B: And your body wasn't in the right healthy state.
[121:29] A: Right, Right.
[121:31] B: We still might not like that. I did it. Right. But the doing it was really for what would have been best for that makes sense.
[121:43] A: Yes.
[121:44] B: And as you get it, what do you notice now?
[121:47] A: I'm feeling less anxiety.
[121:49] B: You are, aren't you? Isn't that a good thing?
[121:51] A: Yes.
[121:52] B: You're awesome.
[121:55] A: Thank you.
[121:56] B: Yeah. Yeah. Because we do want you to be at peace with what has happened. Right. People aren't better off now feeling guilty about before. Nobody does better. I use the silly example of the guy trying to kick the game winning field goal. He missed one at halftime.
[122:20] A: Right.
[122:21] B: We don't want him feeling guilty. How about the one he missed at halftime?
[122:24] A: Okay.
[122:25] B: Kind of ruminating. Yeah. If I hadn't missed one halftime, would he need to kick this one? No. We don't want that going on at all.
[122:31] A: Okay.
[122:31] B: Right. We want the guy present.
[122:34] A: Right.
[122:34] B: Focused on what he's doing.
[122:36] A: Right.
[122:36] B: And actually feeling good.
[122:37] A: Yeah.
[122:38] B: Right.
[122:38] A: He's gonna make it.
[122:39] B: Right? Right. Because that's gonna give him a much better shot at making it.
[122:43] A: Right.
[122:44] B: Then thinking, oh, he probably missed this one too.
[122:47] A: Right.
[122:47] B: Like that is not the.
[122:49] A: Yeah.
[122:49] B: That's not the way we want to go about it.
[122:51] A: Right.
[122:52] B: Yeah. Makes sense.
[122:53] A: Okay. Yeah.
[122:54] B: So we want you to be more at peace. So again, go ahead and slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, breathing in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper.
[123:09] A: Okay.
[123:10] B: Right. Notice how you can allow your awareness to expand and notice more space. Right. And just check inside your body. What are you noticing in your body now?
[123:28] A: Less anxiety.
[123:29] B: Yeah. What are you noticing? Do you have much anxiety?
[123:36] A: No, not really.
[123:37] B: Oh, no, not really.
[123:38] A: Relaxation.
[123:39] B: Oh, you're feeling more relaxed. Right. And you wouldn't want to be more okay in you, would you?
[123:45] A: No.
[123:46] B: No.
[123:47] A: Good.
[123:48] B: Totally. I don't need to get any better than this.
[123:51] A: No, not really.
[123:54] B: This is as good as it gets.
[123:55] A: Right.
[123:56] B: Or not.
[123:57] A: No. Because if it gets any gooder, it might go to sleep.
[124:00] B: No. Which would be okay.
[124:02] A: No.
[124:02] B: For you to rest.
[124:03] A: You can't go to sleep right now.
[124:04] B: Why?
[124:05] A: Because I won't sleep tonight.
[124:07] B: You wouldn't go to sleep right now anyway.
[124:09] A: Right?
[124:09] B: Right. See, you couldn't possibly fall asleep now.
[124:14] A: Okay. You don't think so?
[124:17] B: No. Because I'm talking to you.
[124:19] A: Okay.
[124:19] B: It's really hard to fall asleep when somebody's talking to you. Am I really that boring?
[124:25] A: No, it has nothing to do with that.
[124:30] B: I know it has nothing to do with that, Sam. She's really that boring?
[124:34] A: No, not at all.
[124:37] B: Right. You don't want to get the Uber ride, mad.
[124:39] A: Oh, this is not an Uber. This is first class.
[124:44] B: Oh, nice. That's right. Yeah. There you go.
[124:46] A: Yeah. It's Uber xl. Yeah.
[124:49] B: Uber xl. Right, Right. Do you sit in the back, though?
[124:52] A: Oh, no.
[124:52] B: Just to get the ride. Yeah.
[124:53] A: Yeah.
[124:54] B: You go ahead and take me.
[124:58] A: I used to do that to a friend, though. Yes. I used to always sit in the back seat, and every time I got in their car, they're like, what are you doing? I'm like, nothing. Enjoying.
[125:11] B: I'm good.
[125:13] A: Good Back here.
[125:14] B: That's right. Yeah. Yeah.
[125:19] A: Okay.
[125:20] B: Yeah. So what do you notice? Think about the stuff with dad. Right. Think about finding the ex. Think about sis. Right. Right. What do you notice as you're thinking about those moments now? Again? Not that you always think about them, but notice that when you did, there was discomfort.
[125:44] A: Right.
[125:44] B: As you think about those moments now and try to feel the discomfort.
[125:49] A: Right.
[125:50] B: Is it there?
[125:51] A: Not as much.
[125:52] B: There's a little.
[125:53] A: Well, yeah. There's gonna always be.
[125:55] B: Is there?
[125:55] A: Yeah.
[125:56] B: How do you know?
[125:57] A: Because that's how it's been for years.
[125:59] B: Right. But we didn't do this.
[126:01] A: Right.
[126:01] B: So what about that stuff happening?
[126:03] A: So now I know how to talk myself through whenever I start having anxiety.
[126:07] B: Attacks, I'm gonna Try to have you feel bad about it now.
[126:10] A: Why?
[126:11] B: Why? Because how do I know whether what I'm doing works?
[126:16] A: I don't know. It's your job.
[126:18] B: Yeah, but how do I know whether what I do works?
[126:22] A: Cause you've done it with a lot of people.
[126:24] B: That might be how I knew it worked with them, but how I know it actually works with me? Yes.
[126:31] A: Oh, because I'm telling you it worked.
[126:33] B: Well, not just that.
[126:34] A: Okay.
[126:35] B: That it changes now. So you told me I'm always going to have bad feelings about it because I always did.
[126:43] A: Yeah.
[126:44] B: I'm asking you on purpose to try to get those same bad feelings you used to always have and see if you can.
[126:50] A: No.
[126:50] B: Oh. Oh. They're not there.
[126:54] A: No.
[126:54] B: Oh, you mean this thing that you always had that you think you're always going to have, you actually don't have now?
[126:59] A: Right.
[126:59] B: Oh, which you've never not had.
[127:02] A: No.
[127:03] B: I mean, yes, I know. It's really hard to follow.
[127:07] A: Yeah.
[127:07] B: All the double knots.
[127:08] A: Just a little.
[127:10] B: I'm not saying that it's really hard to follow.
[127:15] A: Sure.
[127:16] B: Right. But see, that's the part that I want you to realize. Why do we do this work? Not so that later you have a tool that you can use. Right. I don't want you to get into a situation where it triggers again and then I've got to do a tool. I want to change something so that even when you encounter the situation that normally would trigger doesn't run that program in you.
[127:42] A: Okay.
[127:43] B: Got it. Because you have enough to worry about in terms of recovery and, you know, rehabilitating and improving your life.
[127:52] A: Right?
[127:52] B: Right. Those are the things I want you to focus on. Not well, if I get triggered, what do I have to do when I am? I'd rather have it that the same stuff that normally presses the buttons in you still goes off. The buttons still get pressed, but it doesn't run anything in you because they've all been unplugged. That's why I keep having you check. When you think about that moment, even though we don't like it, that it happened with the axe, try to feel like it was your fault.
[128:25] A: Right. Okay.
[128:30] B: And as you think about it, what do you notice?
[128:32] A: It's not there.
[128:33] B: Right. That's the. Right. It's so good because you went and checked again. Notice even when you go to remember it, it's not located in the same spot. Like, as you go look for it, you don't see it in the same spot it used to be, do you?
[128:48] A: No.
[128:48] B: Isn't that cool.
[128:49] A: Yeah.
[128:50] B: That's also another indication that we've changed the coding in your brain.
[128:56] A: Okay.
[128:57] B: It's not located in the same spot. That's what we're doing. We're rewiring how your brain has experiences, memory coded. Before, it was coded as happening. Now it's being coded as data about something that happened. It was still an undesirable thing that happened. Like, if I could wave the magic wand, there's a whole bunch of content that I waved the magic wand on to get that it never happened. Right. But we can't do that. We don't have that magic wand to erase. Or that. A magic eraser thing. That's pretty cool. Got one of those. But we don't need to. Because you're never troubled because I went through it. I'm never troubled now because it happened then.
[129:53] A: Right.
[129:54] B: I'm only troubled because emotionally my brain didn't know it was over. Now your emotional brain is reading it as information about stuff you went through as it's information about stuff you went through. It doesn't have the same charge. Now, I can think about it. I still don't like that it happened, but it's not churning up physiological or emotional in me. Okay, Got it.
[130:27] A: Got it.
[130:27] B: Okay, so there's one last one.
[130:29] A: Okay.
[130:30] B: That has to do with that.
[130:32] A: What?
[130:32] B: You know, the little girl.
[130:34] A: Okay. What?
[130:36] B: Losing her, that probably would be okay. Damn it. I thought I was gonna get out of here without.
[130:44] A: So the feds kicked in the door.
[130:47] B: Right. This happened.
[130:48] A: This happened almost six years ago.
[130:52] B: Yeah. Your wares?
[130:54] A: My trailer.
[130:55] B: At the trailer. Same one that the other thing happened in.
[130:57] A: No, no, no.
[130:58] B: Thank goodness. You moved out of that one.
[130:59] A: No.
[131:00] B: I wouldn't stand there either.
[131:00] A: I had my own.
[131:01] B: Okay, good.
[131:02] A: I had my own at this time.
[131:03] B: Yeah.
[131:03] A: That I was renting. And my baby daddy had one, too, but he. His was next to mine.
[131:10] B: Got it.
[131:11] A: So we didn't really stay together.
[131:12] B: Right.
[131:14] A: And they kicked in the door, and.
[131:16] B: They drugged me out, and they kicked in the door. And she was there. Or she was at Dayton.
[131:20] A: I just dropped her off at school.
[131:22] B: So you just dropped her off at school. Right. And then you'd gone back.
[131:25] A: Yeah, And I laid back down.
[131:26] B: And you laid back down. Right. Because you like sleep.
[131:28] A: Yeah.
[131:29] B: Right.
[131:30] A: And then. And they kicked in the door.
[131:32] B: When they kicked in the door, you're like, what the.
[131:34] A: Yeah.
[131:34] B: Right.
[131:35] A: Yeah.
[131:36] B: And then they pulled you.
[131:37] A: Yep.
[131:37] B: Out.
[131:38] A: And they drove me out.
[131:40] B: Put you in the dirt.
[131:41] A: Well, they tore apart both of the trailers.
[131:43] B: Right. His and yours. Was he there, too? Right. Good job. So he was on the ground, and you're on the ground, kind of like looking.
[131:49] A: All he's doing is apologizing.
[131:51] B: He's saying to you, sorry, sorry, sorry. All right, good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[131:55] A: They brought out money, guns and drugs.
[131:58] B: Okay. Right. Out of yours and his. Yeah. Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. Damn it. They just kept it in one place and that would have been fine. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[132:09] A: And then they proceeded to arrest both of us.
[132:12] B: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right.
[132:13] A: But he took all those charges. He took all that.
[132:18] B: So they arrested you?
[132:20] A: No.
[132:20] B: They did. He said, no, they're all mine. It's all my stuff. None of it's hers. She didn't know anything about it. Not hers. So then what happened?
[132:27] A: So then they took him.
[132:29] B: Right.
[132:29] A: And then they proceeded to tell me that they were going to take my daughter from school.
[132:33] B: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next? You're like, well, that sucks.
[132:37] A: Well, yeah.
[132:38] B: I had to dust myself off from the dirt.
[132:40] A: Yeah.
[132:41] B: Oh, yeah.
[132:41] A: I was. It didn't. I didn't care about the dirt. I care about my child.
[132:45] B: Of course. Right. See, now you're screaming and crying. No, don't do that.
[132:47] A: Yeah, Right.
[132:48] B: Good. And then what happened next?
[132:50] A: And then, I don't know, I started using drugs.
[132:56] B: So then they left. And then you were using and my.
[132:59] A: House was tore apart.
[133:00] B: Right.
[133:01] A: And I called my sister and my sister came.
[133:03] B: Right. Good job at detail. Right.
[133:04] A: Yeah. Started getting high.
[133:06] B: Right.
[133:08] A: And that was downward spiral from there.
[133:10] B: Right. And then all sorts of other stuff happened. Right. And then eventually you got arrested and went to jail. Right. And then you met somebody through Salem.
[133:19] A: Yeah.
[133:19] B: Right. And then you got out of jail.
[133:20] A: Because I got arrested for prostitution.
[133:22] B: Right. Yeah. Because that's a fast way to make money, not a fun way.
[133:27] A: Right. Well, I was working in a stroke Club.
[133:29] B: Club. Yeah.
[133:30] A: And that's where it started, of course. Doing dances and stuff in the private rooms.
[133:35] B: Right. That aren't really that private.
[133:38] A: Right, Right.
[133:44] B: Okay.
[133:45] A: Yeah.
[133:45] B: And there's probably yuckiness around that.
[133:47] A: Yeah.
[133:47] B: Stuff.
[133:48] A: Yeah.
[133:48] B: Too. Because my experience with working with lots of women, there are certain people that it's a little bit easier to do it with and other people that is really not right.
[133:58] A: But once you say. And once you already started and you have that name, you don't get that option anymore.
[134:05] B: Right.
[134:05] A: As much like, who are you to say no now? No.
[134:10] B: Right.
[134:11] A: Doesn't happen that way.
[134:12] B: I kind of have to, you know.
[134:14] A: Either that or get the shit knocked out of you.
[134:17] B: Yeah.
[134:18] A: So yeah.
[134:20] B: Right. But then you, then you went to jail.
[134:23] A: Yeah.
[134:23] B: Right. Then you met somebody for Salem. Right. And then you actually chose.
[134:28] A: Yeah.
[134:29] B: Really? One of yes.
[134:30] A: And yeah, kinda. Cuz I was an outpatient at first. Like I did my, I did my time for my charge, right. And then I got out, but I felt like I still needed help, obviously. Cuz jail, when you're in jail and you get released from jail, it's just.
[134:46] B: Kind of like, see you down by.
[134:48] A: Yeah. We don't give a shit about you, where you're going, what you're doing, you know, but we're done with you. So when that happens, you know, what do you do? You resort to the things that you know and you do the things that are your most comfortable, you know. And so I was doing outpatient and of course I failed a drug test. Then it was like, okay, now make their choice, do time or let us help you. So yeah, here I am.
[135:21] B: Yeah. So have you done a genogram yet?
[135:25] A: Yes.
[135:26] B: With Christine?
[135:26] A: Kind of. Kind of, yes. No, not really. Like we started it, but that's as far as we got. Was me and my brothers and sisters and my baby.
[135:39] B: Okay. Yeah. Because like the family that you were born in to didn't give you lots of choice.
[135:47] A: Right.
[135:48] B: They might have been controlled choices that kind of felt like it was choice, but it wasn't really choice.
[135:54] A: Okay.
[135:55] B: Do you follow me with that?
[135:56] A: A little bit? Yeah.
[135:57] B: So what I mean by that, if I have a child and I want them to wear an outfit, I pick two outfits that I'm good with them wearing and I say, which outfit would you like to wear? So that they feel that they get to choose. Okay, but who really chose?
[136:11] A: You did.
[136:11] B: Right. But they feel like they chose.
[136:13] A: Yeah.
[136:14] B: So based on the environment that you were born into, with that dad and that mom. Right. And then that mom leaving and then that dad doing what he did, and then you going into foster care, adoption. Right. And then leading to all. Like those aren't choices. You follow me with that? Like those aren't like, I mean there's only. There are so few options that are available. So yes, I may have chosen door number one, but I literally only had door number one, door number two, door number three to choose from. And they're already set up of it. This way, this way, this way.
[136:48] A: Right.
[136:49] B: Follow me with that.
[136:50] A: Yes.
[136:50] B: So there was a lot of stuff that wasn't choice. Right, right. As you get into this, you still might not think, well, sure, here's the choice do jail time or let people help me. Well, that. That's a no brainer. I'm not that stupid. Okay. I'll go ahead and let people help me. But then there's the choice that you've started making, which is even when I get front confronted, even when it's uncomfortable for me, I'm staying.
[137:18] A: Yeah.
[137:19] B: Right. So the first thing that you're doing, Natalie, is you're choosing you. Your mental well being, your recovery, you're choosing you and you're choosing now to be a co creator in having a distinctly different life than the one you've had. Right, Got it. This is where true choice starts to come in. Right now I'm in a program, so there are certain things within the program, but this is a leading me to a distinctly different life than the one that I've had. Because, you know, you've had ups and downs. You've gone from times where I was clean to times where I was using to times where I was clean, the times where I was using. Right. So however you got yourself to here and then saw this as an opportunity and then are continuing to choose because as you put it, it's optional.
[138:23] A: Right.
[138:24] B: There may be consequences.
[138:25] A: Right. There's always consequences.
[138:28] B: Right. That I don't want to necessarily have, but I'm still choosing that even if I'm uncomfortable, I'm choosing to stay. I'm choosing to do this.
[138:36] A: Yes.
[138:37] B: Right. Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. So you can remember them coming in.
[138:49] A: Yeah.
[138:50] B: Breaking the door down, throwing you down. Him taking all the charges.
[138:53] A: Yeah.
[138:54] B: Right. Them taking the kid and you, you can remember all that happening?
[138:58] A: Yeah.
[138:58] B: Right. You can remember putting your socks on.
[139:00] A: Yeah, I'm not putting my socks on.
[139:02] B: Right, well then stop them from breaking the door down.
[139:04] A: Yeah. They're not breaking the door.
[139:05] B: Well then stop them from taking your kid.
[139:07] A: They're not taking my kids.
[139:08] B: Right. So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists. Right. And what are you in the process of doing?

[139:16] B: Fixing.
[139:18] A: Fixing. Hopefully having some part in our life again.
[139:21] B: Fixing.
[139:22] A: Oh, you. I mean me.
[139:24] B: You are. That's right.
[139:26] A: Yeah.
[139:27] B: You're in the process of doing the things to take care of you.
[139:31] A: Yeah.
[139:31] B: Because if we do the things that. That take care of me, then it presents the opportunity.
[139:35] A: Yeah.
[139:37] B: Right.
[139:38] A: Okay.
[139:39] B: Got it.
[139:40] A: Got it.
[139:41] B: Which will be better ongoingly for her. Right, Right.
[139:47] A: They probably would have shot and killed me if she would have been in the house. That's what I think about too.
[139:53] B: Yeah.
[139:54] A: Yeah. Like I'm thankful that they didn't yeah. Because if they would have came in with my guns and my baby was in there, and it would have killed me.
[140:02] B: Right.
[140:02] A: Because I would have. I would have tried to fight.
[140:05] B: Right, Right. And who knows what could have might have happened if time had gone on with what.
[140:13] A: Right. And living like that with her.
[140:15] B: Huh? Right.
[140:21] A: True.
[140:21] B: Yeah. Right. And who is she with now?
[140:29] A: I'm not really sure. Honestly. No, I can't get a hold of my adopted mom, which is where she was last.
[140:37] B: Okay. So she went to the place that you had been at after stuff with dad.
[140:45] A: Mm.
[140:46] B: Okay.
[140:47] A: Yeah.
[140:49] B: There's some relatedness. Yes, sir.
[140:51] A: Yeah. I did that on purpose. I begged him. Because the foster kids. The foster care system is so crazy now. Like, it's so overpopulated and kids aren't getting the treatment that they need, and they're being separated and they're being sent out of state to different states because there's nowhere for them to go here. And I just. Before I got adopted, I went through the jumping around different, you know, group homes and stuff like that, and I just didn't. I mean, she was already gonna be messed up enough from being taken from me, and whatever she'd seen before, she was taken from me. So I didn't want. I at least wanted something kind of familiar or something, you know? Cause these weird people are just coming to her, to her school and telling her she's not going home to Mommy. She's coming with them.
[141:50] B: Yeah. That's troubling.
[141:51] A: Who knows where she's going and what's happening, so. Yeah.
[141:56] B: Well, good job. Yeah.
[141:59] A: At least I did something right.
[142:00] B: Well, that's all you're caring.
[142:02] A: Yeah.
[142:03] B: Yeah. You did great today.
[142:05] A: Thank you.
[142:06] B: Can you imagine? Three hours went by.
[142:09] A: That was great. It was three hours.
