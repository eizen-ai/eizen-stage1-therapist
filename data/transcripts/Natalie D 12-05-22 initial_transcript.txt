[00:00] A: So today is the 5th of December, Natalie. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is valuable, useful, transformative, it might be made available in teaching and training other professionals and how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:16] B: Yes, sir.
[00:17] A: Cool. So first, I'm really interested in getting an update on how our last session left you.
[00:22] B: Good.
[00:22] A: Our last session, we did a whole bunch of stuff to clear a lot of stuff up. So when you think about that, it's been really good.
[00:29] B: Honestly, I haven't had any real, like, emotional points. I still sometimes stop and think, of course, about some things, but I've gotten to where, like, I started writing letters. So I'll just write a letter if I need to.
[00:49] A: And write a letter to what? To whom?
[00:51] B: To whoever I'm thinking about. To whoever I'm sad about.
[00:55] A: Okay.
[00:55] B: Majority of the time, it's my daughter.
[00:58] A: Okay.
[00:58] B: But.
[00:59] A: Yeah, because you're not around her.
[01:01] B: Right.
[01:01] A: Right now.
[01:02] B: Yeah.
[01:02] A: Right. But you're doing the things.
[01:04] B: Right.
[01:05] A: To get you better.
[01:06] B: Yeah.
[01:07] A: Right.
[01:07] B: Yeah.
[01:08] A: Not just for you.
[01:09] B: Yeah.
[01:09] A: But for her.
[01:10] B: Yeah.
[01:11] A: Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[01:13] B: Yeah. Yes.
[01:15] A: Yeah, that would make sense. Because, like, I miss her, and that's really just me, like, loving her.
[01:21] B: Mm. And then with the holidays, it kind of makes it harder a little bit, you know, because some of the other girls, like, one gets to have Zoom with their kid. One gets to have their kids come visit them. The other one talks to them on the phone, you know, so I get a little. Sometimes, like, I get in my feelings about it, and I'm like, you know, I wish I could talk to mine or see mine or something like that, but it's life. So I take a deep breath, I write a letter, or I'll go in the shower and cry for a little bit, and then I'm good.
[01:56] A: I'll come out and throw fisticles with them.
[01:59] B: Yeah. No, Right.
[02:01] A: So you've learned some ways that work for you to move through the sadness. And the sadness is in wishing I might have what they had or they're being able to do.
[02:14] B: Right. Which isn't. It's not. And it's not their fault, so it's not like I can get upset with them.
[02:24] A: You shouldn't be around your kid either, then.
[02:27] B: Yeah, exactly.
[02:28] A: So I can feel good.
[02:30] B: Right. That's not fair.
[02:33] A: Yeah. Yeah. Right. And that whole notion of. I think we learn when we're little that life one is supposed to be Fair. And two, we need to be an upset if it isn't fair. But in all actuality, life does not start off fair. Life does not end fair.
[02:53] B: Right.
[02:54] A: How the hell is it supposed to be fair? In the middle?
[02:56] B: Right.
[02:57] A: On either end. It's not. Right. So the thing that we want to recognize for ourselves is it doesn't have to be fair in order for me to move through things and be okay. Right. Is this ideal that I'm not able to see her? No, it's not ideal. But the thing that is ideal is that I'm actually doing things to have me be a better version of me, which is better for me and her, because I'm not just playing the short term game. I'm playing the big picture.
[03:34] B: Mm.
[03:36] A: Hi.
[03:36] B: Yes. And I can't get kicked out of this program.
[03:40] A: You're not allowed to?
[03:41] B: I. No, it can't happen because then that's more time. I'm not gonna be able to see her or talk to her.
[03:48] A: Oh, right. Well, are you fearful of that?
[03:53] B: Sometimes. Whenever I get angry, yeah. It's like sometimes I just wake up in a funk. Like, I don't want to be here, I don't want to do this, I don't want to talk to you type stuff.
[04:08] A: Yeah.
[04:08] B: So. Yeah. I don't know.
[04:12] A: What do you do with that?
[04:15] B: I try to take a shower and, like, restart my day or sometimes I'm. Just leave me alone. Don't talk to me until I'm ready to talk to you. I don't know.
[04:28] A: Oh, you mean you do things to.
[04:31] B: Manage it better, I guess, by just sitting and quiet or.
[04:36] A: Well, no, you went. You know what? I don't like the state that I woke up in. I'm gonna go take a shower to try to change my state.
[04:42] B: Yeah.
[04:43] A: Right. Sometimes I just need to, like, have some space.
[04:47] B: Yeah.
[04:48] A: And not feel like you're up in my junk.
[04:51] B: Yeah.
[04:52] A: And then I'll come around.
[04:53] B: Right.
[04:54] A: Right.
[04:55] B: Yeah.
[04:56] A: Right. And the good thing is, like, I'm doing those things sometimes I might communicate.
[05:00] B: Hey.
[05:00] A: Like, I'm kind of in a funk today.
[05:02] B: Yeah.
[05:02] A: So that definitely means get up with my stuff.
[05:04] B: Yeah. Definitely not.
[05:07] A: Right. I don't let you want to get me. I'm already in a funky mood. It's pretty easy to get me to be.
[05:14] B: Exactly.
[05:16] A: Yeah. Yeah. So the sadness mostly comes up about missing her. Mm. Okay. Okay. What do you notice when you think about the other stuff, like what happened?
[05:30] B: It's. It doesn't affect me as much. Like, I don't sit in it. Okay. I. My sister and James. I feel like I get visited every now and then by them just to say hi through the birds. Yeah. I feel like whenever there's a bird around, it's them.
[05:51] A: Just that's how it is for me with my grandma.
[05:53] B: Yeah.
[05:54] A: Anytime I see an osprey.
[05:56] B: Yeah.
[05:57] A: I'm like, hi, grandmother.
[05:58] B: Yeah. That's how I feel.
[06:00] A: Because ospreys tend to be closer to me than they ever were before.
[06:04] B: Right. Yeah.
[06:07] A: You see them, My mom says in Osprey, I go, hey, I didn't pick it.
[06:12] B: Yep, you can't sometimes. And I was thinking about it whenever I. Whenever it's my time to go, I would like to come back reincarnated as a bird. I would love to be a bird.
[06:26] A: To be able to fly, to be.
[06:27] B: Able to fly, to just see the world, to just. I mean, I don't know, I just feel like they're free spirited, to constantly.
[06:37] A: Look down on people, but not necessarily.
[06:40] B: Because I can be on the ground and look up at people as well. So. Yeah. Yeah.
[06:49] A: Cool. Yeah. So. So you get visited by them and when you do, it's not so sad.
[06:56] B: Right.
[06:57] A: Isn't that cool?
[06:58] B: Yeah.
[06:58] A: Yeah. That's how we want that to be.
[07:00] B: Right.
[07:01] A: Because we want you to have access to more of who they are, more for you than the moment.
[07:05] B: Okay.
[07:06] A: Right. Because it's the moment that tends to get stuck that I have to then traverse through to actually experience that. The moment becomes a moment. Now I have access to more of them. I still don't like the moment, but never will.
[07:19] B: Yeah.
[07:19] A: Right. But the moment is not the defining thing about them anymore.
[07:25] B: Okay.
[07:26] A: Does that make sense? Follow me with that. It's a thing in a long line of a lot of things.
[07:31] B: Right?
[07:32] A: The good, the bad, the ugly kind of stuff.
[07:36] B: Yes.
[07:37] A: Yeah. Okay. Well, that's cool. What else have you noticed? I don't know.
[07:44] B: That's about it. Just that they're not as intense and they come in like happy sprints.
[07:56] A: Huh. Isn't that cool?
[07:59] B: Yeah.
[08:00] A: Yeah. They're not tied to just sadness.
[08:03] B: Yeah.
[08:03] A: Isn't that cool?
[08:05] B: Yeah. Cause at first, like with my sister, I felt. Because I was in jail when it happened.
[08:10] A: Yeah.
[08:11] B: And I felt like I should have been there or like I should have went to the funeral or the wake or something like that. I should have been a part of something. But then again, I think about it, like, what if I would have been there? What if it had something to do with the dope that she did? You know, I could be dead too. Like.
[08:35] A: Yeah. Yeah. When we think of outcomes, we only kind of pigeon our hole into one or two outcomes. We never, like, add all the other outcomes of what could have happened if.
[08:47] B: Yeah.
[08:47] A: And when we do, it kind of goes, oh, why?
[08:50] B: Yeah, I mean, for a reason. And then I got put in the program, and I feel like the reason why, because I wasn't gonna go into the program. I was just gonna do my jail time.
[09:03] A: You're gonna do jail time?
[09:05] B: Yeah. I didn't wanna go to the program. I didn't want to have to deal with all this stuff, like. And go through.
[09:11] A: You wouldn't want to get this stuff done.
[09:13] B: Yeah. No. I was just like, let me do my time. Leave me alone.
[09:17] A: Right. Because that stuff won't bother me after I'm done doing time. Because it's not anything that do in time. So I'm sure it won't negatively affect my life when I get out.
[09:25] B: Yeah, something like that.
[09:28] A: Right?
[09:30] B: Yeah.
[09:30] A: Yeah.
[09:31] B: And then I had a couple of people pleading with me, like, you know, I'm getting too old for this stuff. Getting too old to keep going in and out of jail. I'm getting too old to not have my daughter. And she's getting older and I'm missing a lot of it. And it's like whenever I'm using, I don't really think about it. Like, I hadn't realized I had been. We're going on almost five years, you know, I thought it had been two years.
[09:55] A: Yeah.
[09:56] B: It's like, where's the other three years? Where'd they go?
[10:00] A: Right.
[10:00] B: I don't know.
[10:03] A: Right.
[10:03] B: And a pipe or a needle. And that's just. That's crazy.
[10:10] A: Yeah. That I lost. And that's the commodity. Right. That we becomes more valuable the older we get is time. Right. When people are younger, we spend time. Like, we've got a lot of it. Right. People spend time to save money.
[10:33] B: Right.
[10:34] A: When people get older, they spend money to save time. Because time is a more valuable commodity. I only get a certain amount of it.
[10:49] B: Okay.
[10:51] A: Yeah. Yeah. So it was about time. Yeah, yeah. That you got into a program.
[10:58] B: Yeah.
[10:59] A: Right.
[10:59] B: Yeah. Because I've already been in two other ones, and obviously they didn't do anything.
[11:03] A: Where were you before? What did you do?
[11:05] B: When I was a juvenile, I was put in a level four program for a year and a half called the Ark.
[11:12] A: Okay.
[11:13] B: Through Manatee Glenn's.
[11:14] A: Okay.
[11:15] B: And then I went to First Step before I came to Salah, and I was in their residential program. But we had three different people OD on the Campus. I'm like, so drugs are right here with me. Like, this is just crazy to me. It was crazy to me. So I left. Packed up my stuff, and I left. And then they put a warrant out.
[11:38] A: And then, of course, what program? One at First. First Step. Were you in Crossroads? Crossroads, okay.
[11:44] B: Yeah.
[11:46] A: Yeah. I used to go do a talk at First Step. Did you like my.
[11:51] B: They suck so bad. They call themselves rehabilitation. They call themselves detox. They call themselves helping us. But how is it that people are having sex on the side of the building?
[12:04] A: People are not allowed to do it in your room.
[12:06] B: People are ODing in their room.
[12:11] A: Well, that's okay. You need privacy. You don't want to show everybody else that they're gonna want some too. It's bull job.
[12:18] B: That's just crazy to me, though. It's crazy. How are we supposed to be getting better with. And no one's supervising? Like, where's the staff? Oh, they're in their cubicle on their phone, hanging out. Yeah, whatever. It's up to us if we really wanted it.
[12:36] A: First Step in. And something else merged.
[12:39] B: Yeah, I forget what else.
[12:42] A: I think the Sarasota Memorial Hospital really.
[12:45] B: Merged, maybe doing the detox.
[12:49] A: Something merged at First Step with somebody else. But my buddy Bob Piper used to be their director, and so he would do a talk for the residents and their families on addictions and his model of dealing with addictions.
[13:02] B: There's four different programs in there, though.
[13:05] A: No, he would do them all.
[13:06] B: Yeah. Oh, okay. And they're all coed.
[13:10] A: Right. And then I would come in and do a talk after it, because he talked about, like, you know, the thing that's underneath the four quadrants, and what gets people is trauma. If we don't get that better, then. Yeah, good luck with the other stuff.
[13:23] B: Yeah.
[13:23] A: Right, right. So isn't it interesting that you're not stuck with the hurt?
[13:29] B: Right.
[13:30] A: And that when it comes in you, lots of thoughts of, like, other joyful moments.
[13:35] B: Thank you.
[13:36] A: Isn't that cool? Good job.
[13:38] B: Yeah.
[13:38] A: You're welcome. Yeah. So what else kind of shows up in terms of, like, how it's been for you there, processing, dealing with stuff? What do you notice? Do you notice feeling a little more, like, at ease? Yeah.
[13:53] B: Yeah.
[13:53] A: A little more comfortable in you.
[13:55] B: Yeah.
[13:56] A: A little less negative. Critically.
[13:58] B: Yeah. And not so anxious or wanting to leave.
[14:04] A: That's better, right?
[14:05] B: Yeah.
[14:06] A: Yeah.
[14:06] B: Because in the beginning, it's like, oh, my God, come on. Like, when is this time gonna go by? I started volunteering this weekend. I'm at Bayside Church.
[14:17] A: So cool.
[14:17] B: Yeah.
[14:18] A: You open the door.
[14:19] B: I open the door and I'm gonna be doing the cafe.
[14:21] A: Escort the little old ladies to the.
[14:24] B: No, I don't want to escort them nowhere. I just greet them, smile, hello, how are you? Come on in. Yes, or have a good day.
[14:34] A: The Lord will see you in a moment.
[14:35] B: Yes, yes. Or have a good day. Yeah, yeah.
[14:41] A: Nice.
[14:41] B: Yeah.
[14:42] A: Well, that's cool.
[14:43] B: I'm not really big on the religion.
[14:44] A: That's why you got the warrior shirt.
[14:46] B: No, this is from the Source shirt.
[14:48] A: Different church.
[14:49] B: Yeah, this is the church that we go to every week. Week. Got it with the program.
[14:54] A: Okay.
[14:55] B: And then the Bayside is where I volunteer.
[14:57] A: Oh, right.
[14:58] B: So because I volunteer, I have to also go to one of their services when I volunteer. So like yesterday. Yeah, today's Monday. Yeah, yesterday I went to Bayside and the Source.
[15:13] A: You're doubling down.
[15:14] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I was like, this is kind of, you know, it's cool, honestly. Cuz I got something different from both things.
[15:23] A: Who was the. The pastor Bayside who did the message I take yesterday?
[15:27] B: Randy.
[15:28] A: Okay.
[15:28] B: Is his name. And then the one at the source is Joanne. Pastor Joanne and Ralph.
[15:40] A: Okay, nice.
[15:42] B: Yeah.
[15:44] A: Well, cool. Yeah.
[15:45] B: Because in the beginning I was like, I'm not going to church. Don't talk to me about it. It ain't happening. I don't want your Bible. I don't want to hear about your Bible stories.
[15:55] A: But now you're okay with it?
[15:57] B: Yeah, I'm getting there. Something's gotta give, right?
[16:00] A: I don't know. Yeah, you might see it as an opportunity.
[16:05] B: Yeah, that's true.
[16:07] A: Who knows? I mean, was it something that, like, you grew up with when you were a little kid?
[16:12] B: Yeah, I grew up as Joel Witness.
[16:14] A: Oh. So really intense.
[16:15] B: Yeah.
[16:16] A: Yeah. You guys got it easy. Celebrating my birthday. Dammit.
[16:22] B: Yep. Nothing. No holidays.
[16:25] A: Poke for me.
[16:26] B: No, that's not happening.
[16:29] A: This is the hard one. Where's all the cool stuff that people get?
[16:32] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[16:35] A: Okay.
[16:36] B: She was my foster mom.
[16:39] A: Oh, right. So that was like after nine, that one.
[16:45] B: Yeah.
[16:46] A: After stuff with dad. And that part was done that you went with the. Okay. She was a Jehovah Witness. Did you have to actually go to people's houses?
[16:53] B: And they did that on the weekends.
[16:56] A: Did you have to go with them?
[16:57] B: I went a couple of times, but I was like, I would rather be grounded than go knock on people's door because what if it's a friend from school and I'm knocking on their door? That's how I would look at it. Like no, it's okay.
[17:12] A: You know, it's already hard enough to be in school at this age alone.
[17:15] B: Yeah. And then going to three. We were going to three sermons a week because you got the Watchtower on Sundays. You got Bible study on Tuesday or Wednesdays. And then you got the Theocratic ministry on Thursdays.
[17:29] A: Yeah.
[17:30] B: And the Theocratic ministry, you have to study and learn and get to know it. And once you've passed a certain level of testing, then you can be baptized.
[17:40] A: Holy cow. That's intense.
[17:44] B: Yeah, it's all right. That's why I got married at 16, though, to get out of the house.
[17:52] A: Get out of the house?
[17:53] B: Yeah, yeah, get out of the house. And I didn't want to have sex before marriage.
[17:58] A: Well, good.
[18:00] B: But I was already waited until after.
[18:02] A: Maybe it's okay if I'm gonna get married, right?
[18:08] B: Yeah. Or something like that. I guess. Yeah.
[18:11] A: Well, that's cool. Yeah. So then it's been kind of different, but comforting. Back to having a better connection with God.
[18:25] B: Yeah, yeah, Yeah, a little bit. I say my prayers at night, just not this carrying. What do you mean there's not a scary prayer?
[18:36] A: Oh, my goodness. There's a scary prayer.
[18:38] B: What's the scary prayer?
[18:39] A: Now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake.
[18:46] B: Come on, take my soul.
[18:48] A: Or I pray to the Lord my soul to take. Yeah, that is a scary prayer.
[18:55] B: Yes, it is.
[18:56] A: Nobody should have to say that one, right? But we get taught horrible nightmares.
[19:01] B: We learned that that's like pledging.
[19:02] A: Two hands ripping open my dead body, grabbing it from me.
[19:07] B: That's like.
[19:12] A: That is not a good prayer.
[19:14] B: That's like the Pledge Allegiance, though. You learn the prayers, you learn the Pledge of Allegiance.
[19:21] A: Yeah, okay. With the pledge, that one didn't seem so scary.
[19:25] B: Yeah, that's true.
[19:31] A: That one was a scary one. Still gets me. Okay, so volunteering. What's next? Where are you? What plan?
[19:42] B: We start the mock interviews this week, and we're supposed to do two mock interviews and then start working. So hopefully by the time Christmas. Well, it might not be by Christmas, but after Christmas. So, like the new year, I'll be working, which will be really good, so I can get out of the house. Tired of sitting in the house. Like, we sat an assessment for two months now. I've been here almost four months.
[20:11] A: Like, you don't go outside.
[20:13] B: I mean, we can, but to do what?
[20:17] A: Walk around?
[20:18] B: Yeah, we do that with exercise in the morning.
[20:22] A: Go sit outside and read a book.
[20:24] B: No, I'M lazy.
[20:28] A: Lazy to step outside to read the.
[20:30] B: Book, or lazy to read the book in general? Yeah. I fall asleep when I start reading.
[20:36] A: Only if it's boring, I don't know. Or it's too.
[20:40] B: Something happens. Like, I can only get, like, five or ten minutes in, and then I'm out.
[20:46] A: What kind of book are you reading?
[20:48] B: Any of them. The NA Book.
[20:50] A: Oh, God.
[20:51] B: They had this book from the book club.
[20:53] A: Like, you gotta read, like, a quick, like, thriller.
[20:57] B: Yeah.
[20:58] A: It's like, every three pages, you're in a new chapter.
[21:01] B: Okay.
[21:01] A: That kind of book.
[21:02] B: Okay.
[21:03] A: Like, works better for reading and not, like, falling asleep. You're reading, like, textbooks. Yeah, they're, like, really, like, thick and dense. I'm so tired now.
[21:18] B: Yes.
[21:19] A: You were wide awake just a couple minutes. I know. I'm so tired.
[21:23] B: Yes.
[21:24] A: Yeah. That's because you're not reading books that are books for fun. You're reading books for information.
[21:31] B: Okay.
[21:31] A: If you read a book for information, it's boring. Many of them. If you read a book for fun.
[21:37] B: We'Re supposed to start reading where the Crawdads Sing.
[21:40] A: Okay.
[21:42] B: Next.
[21:42] A: That's an interesting book.
[21:43] B: Yeah. I thought that. I want to see the movie.
[21:47] A: Yeah. You're like, I'm just gonna watch the movie.
[21:49] B: Right.
[21:49] A: You all read the book, I'll watch the movie. You all come back to me when you're done and we'll talk about it.
[21:54] B: Right. But no, that's not how it goes. We gotta read the book first, and then we're allowed to watch and that.
[21:59] A: Book will be fine. But again, that book adds some interesting stuff to it, you know, because it is. But it's not necessarily hugely fast.
[22:09] B: Right.
[22:10] A: Like, some of the books. There's a Peterson guy, I don't know. What's his name? I can't think of his name. Anyway, he's, like, the author of a lot of books with other people, and his books go by, like, every four pages. You're. And they're big print, and you're into a new chapter and you're into the next chapter, and it just kind of.
[22:33] B: Okay.
[22:35] A: James Patterson. That's his name.
[22:37] B: Yes.
[22:37] A: His style of books go really fast.
[22:41] B: Okay.
[22:42] A: And there's a ton of people that write books like his books, but those books tend to go by fast. So any other stuff going on? Any challenges with people? Any.
[22:55] B: No, not really.
[22:59] A: How often are you finding yourself needing to state change by either having time because you woke up on the grumpy side of the bed, or going in.
[23:07] B: Oh, at least once a week?
[23:09] A: Okay. Okay.
[23:12] B: Yeah. They also changed my medications, though.
[23:16] A: Oh, when did they do that?
[23:18] B: A couple of weeks ago. They just tapered me down a little bit because they feel like since I was falling asleep during critical thinking, that I am sleepy from my medications. Whereas critical thinking is at 9:15 in the morning. We get up at 7 in the morning. So how is it from 7 to 9? It's I'm not falling asleep, but because I'm sitting down and I'm reading this book.
[23:46] A: Because you're doing an activity from 7 to 9 that's more enjoyable for you?
[23:50] B: Nothing. Just staring at each other from seven to nine? Pretty much.
[23:54] A: You don't go to the gym.
[23:55] B: Oh, yeah, we do. We go to the gym from 8:30 to 9, right? Yeah.
[24:01] A: She might get up, you might have a cup of coffee. Yeah, I go do your business, have some cereal and go to the gym.
[24:09] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:11] A: And then you're doing an activity that's somewhat boring.
[24:14] B: Yeah.
[24:14] A: Reading a book.
[24:16] B: Yeah. I just don't feel that it's my medication now.
[24:21] A: Hello. What?
[24:22] B: Yeah. And that's how it goes.
[24:24] A: Yeah. It's kind of like when my mom took me to the Met. The Metropolitan Museum of Science, I guess, is what it's called when I was a kid in New York and she really wanted to see it. We were going to New York to go to the Phantom of the Opera, which I wanted to see. And while we were in that museum, you know, I'm like 17 years old. This is like the most boring, worst thing you could be doing that. Like, she's looking at these paintings by people that I don't care about and don't know anything about. And they don't look great and like, whatever. I don't. And we're getting to these benches in the middle, and I'm, like, laying on the benches.
[25:02] B: Yeah.
[25:03] A: Oh, we gotta move to the next. So hard. Gotta be that kid.
[25:08] B: Yeah.
[25:09] A: And then she's like, all right, we're gonna go to this because it was something I wanted to do.
[25:14] B: Okay.
[25:14] A: It has more to do with that attention world. People with a little bit of attention deficit stuff. It's not a deficit. It's that they have a hard time staying attentive to things that they feel are boring.
[25:25] B: Okay.
[25:26] A: They're fine staying attending to things that they like and sometimes even more than other people.
[25:31] B: Okay.
[25:31] A: I mean, they can eat it and drink it and sleep it and consume it and be consumed by it, but when it's something that they don't like as much, I'd rather Gnaw my arm off than read this chapter for the 17th time. Because I can't.
[25:51] B: Right. That's exactly how it goes. And then they're like, natalie, are you awake? Well, obviously I'm not awake, so why do you ask me the same question a hundred times? That annoys the crap out of me too. Like, just leave me be, please.
[26:07] A: We're gonna need you to stand up and read.
[26:10] B: Right? Stand up, walk around the table.
[26:13] A: Just read. Walking.
[26:17] B: So we know that you're awake.
[26:19] A: Right? Yeah. That'll keep you awake because you're walking.
[26:23] B: Yeah.
[26:24] A: See, you have found the cure for insomnia for you.
[26:28] B: Okay.
[26:29] A: If you ever have a hard time at night falling asleep, go pick up the book.
[26:33] B: Right.
[26:34] A: And start reading.
[26:35] B: Yeah. And then I go to sleep.
[26:37] A: Got it. So if you ever have a problem. Where's that book? I need that. Where do we leave that book? I need that book now.
[26:46] B: Yeah, yeah.
[26:47] A: That's what you do.
[26:48] B: Yes.
[26:49] A: Yeah. Cool.
[26:50] B: Yeah.
[26:50] A: So you got that as a solution?
[26:52] B: Yeah, yeah.
[26:53] A: So. So other than like the coming up holidays, like, do you know what you all do for Christmas?
[27:02] B: No, But I'm assuming we're gonna open up the presents and eat a big dinner.
[27:07] A: Okay.
[27:08] B: Yeah.
[27:09] A: Some of the other women will have family pieces there. Some of them will be able to save their children. Some will be able to.
[27:16] B: They go on past with their families.
[27:19] A: Okay.
[27:20] B: Yeah. Which they said that they were gonna try to get in touch with my adopted mom and see how that's gonna go.
[27:29] A: The woman who's the Jehovah Witness. That one. Oh, cool.
[27:32] B: Yeah, yeah.
[27:33] A: The ones that actually reached out.
[27:35] B: Yeah.
[27:36] A: When something wasn't going. Right.
[27:38] B: Right.
[27:38] A: You reached out to them.
[27:40] B: Right.
[27:40] A: And they got you help.
[27:42] B: Right.
[27:42] A: How cool is that?
[27:43] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But now I can't get a hold of her, which I find weird. Like, she went through all this stuff to write this letter to the judge to make sure the judge knows, you know, what I'm doing or what I'm going through.
[28:00] A: Yeah.
[28:00] B: And now I can't get a hold of her. I can't find her.
[28:04] A: Huh.
[28:05] B: So they have to do. They're talking about going on Facebook. I'm writing her on Facebook and see.
[28:11] A: Cuz she's on Facebook.
[28:12] B: Get in touch with her.
[28:15] A: Okay. Is she a safe contact?
[28:19] B: They can't do that unless they get in touch with her.
[28:22] A: Safe contact? Yeah, she's in no contact right now because we don't know where she is.
[28:27] B: Yeah, I have no safe contacts right now.
[28:30] A: No safe contacts. Okay. Do you have a mentor?
[28:32] B: Yes.
[28:33] A: Who's your mentor?
[28:33] B: I just got a mentor. She used to be in the program. Her name is Kimberly.
[28:37] A: Kimberly. I like Kimberly.
[28:39] B: Yeah.
[28:39] A: Tell her you see me.
[28:41] B: Okay.
[28:41] A: She's great. She's the nail lady.
[28:43] B: Yes, yes, yes.
[28:46] A: And always has a different color.
[28:47] B: Yeah. She's got green hair, right?
[28:49] A: Green hair, right.
[28:49] B: Yeah.
[28:50] A: She goes between different fairies. So she's Tinkerbell now.
[28:54] B: Yeah. I got fairy hair in my hair.
[28:55] A: Do you really have the strand of it?
[28:57] B: That's cool. Yeah. We go and see the fairies.
[29:03] A: Where's that?
[29:04] B: It's called fairy hair. That's what it's called.
[29:07] A: It is fairy hair.
[29:08] B: Yeah.
[29:09] A: Yeah. My kids have had streaks of it in.
[29:12] B: Yeah. Yeah. I can't get it out, so I gotta wait until I see her again to get it taken out because you gotta use pliers. How'd your kids get theirs out?
[29:25] A: I have no idea.
[29:26] B: Okay.
[29:26] A: They're girls, but I wasn't paying attention.
[29:29] B: You're just like, yeah, that's cool.
[29:32] A: I don't know. I don't know how it got in there. I don't know how it got out.
[29:36] B: Okay.
[29:37] A: It was pretty neat when it was in there.
[29:38] B: Yeah.
[29:38] A: I don't know how they got it out.
[29:41] B: Okay.
[29:42] A: Those aren't the things that I paid much attention to.
[29:44] B: Right. Okay.
[29:46] A: I don't have to paint nails either, which is better for me.
[29:51] B: I would assume so.
[29:54] A: Yeah. Yeah. So that'll be Christmas, then New Year's, and then it just.
[30:00] B: And then hopefully I'll be working.
[30:01] A: Yeah.
[30:01] B: And then I'll phase up and I plan on being in ELP by February.
[30:07] A: That's the goal.
[30:08] B: That's my goal.
[30:09] A: Yeah.
[30:11] B: So then I can be out of there by my birthday?
[30:14] A: Out of.
[30:15] B: I would say that.
[30:17] A: Okay. When's your birthday?
[30:18] B: June 22nd.
[30:20] A: Okay. How long will that have given you in programming?
[30:27] B: July 1st makes a year.
[30:28] A: Okay. So just under a year, then. Okay.
[30:34] B: That also includes assessment, though. I got to assessment July 1st.
[30:39] A: Yeah.
[30:39] B: I got to residential August 23rd.
[30:44] A: Okay.
[30:46] B: So they might tack on some more time, but I'm hoping not. There's one resident that's there right now, and she says as long as you don't lose any points and phase up when you're supposed to, you can do the program in nine months.
[31:02] A: Who told you that?
[31:03] B: Melissa.
[31:05] A: Melissa is the one that's going to try to get it done in eight months and 30 days.
[31:09] B: Yes. Yes, she is.
[31:12] A: And not a moment or a second longer than that.
[31:16] B: Right, Exactly. That's what she's doing right now. And she's. I Mean, she's setting the example.
[31:23] A: Yes.
[31:24] B: Yes.
[31:25] A: If your goal is to get done with the programming as quickly as you can.
[31:29] B: Right.
[31:30] A: But why would that be the goal?
[31:32] B: I don't know.
[31:33] A: I don't know either.
[31:34] B: I just.
[31:35] A: I mean, I get it that people want to get back out into their life.
[31:37] B: Yes. And start living in the real world.
[31:40] A: But I would say that, like, you also want to make sure that you've got yourself centered and grounded so that you can go out into the real world and do. Okay. It's not useful to go through programming and then go out and still go through the same stuff.
[31:57] B: Well, that's why you're supposed to pay attention to everything they're teaching you while you're in the program.
[32:02] A: Yeah, but some of it takes, like, not everything pops at once for everybody. Sometimes it takes a period of time before something clicks.
[32:11] B: Okay.
[32:12] A: And I think that we want to have people begin to experience certain things while they still have the support.
[32:20] B: Well, that too. I said something the other day because there was a movie that I wanted to watch. I forget what the name of it is. A documentary or something like that. And it's about this girl, and she's in a trafficking situation and, like, what happened to her and stuff like that. Stuff like that. Well, we're not allowed to watch it because it could be triggering to somebody. So tell me how. We're in a traffic sex trafficking program. That's what we're in the program for. But while we're in here, we're not in any type of situations or learning how to cope with that type of stuff while we're in the program. So what happens whenever we get released from the program and all of a sudden we're faced with a situation and, oh, I don't know what to do because I wasn't allowed to have any part of this. You know what I'm saying? What's gonna happen? We're gonna fall back into our old ways and do things that we were doing before? No.
[33:23] A: That'S one possibility.
[33:25] B: Well, just I got really aggravated.
[33:28] A: Right. Because it doesn't feel like we're gonna learn.
[33:30] B: Like, we're working on the things that really need to be working on. Like, I need to learn how to live without doing dates. I need to learn how to live without doing drugs. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, that was the life that I was living. I was tricking. I was doing drugs. I was. You know, I was in a trafficking situation for probably, like, six months to a year. But I got myself out of that. And he's dead now, so that ain't.
[33:54] A: Not because I killed him. I'm not. I'm not confessing to murder. Don't. Is that record. No, he died of natural causes.
[34:03] B: He died in a gang shooting.
[34:05] A: And I was not there. I heard about it. He was in a whole nother town.
[34:09] B: He was in Orlando. So I had nothing to do with that. But I'm just saying, like, there's some of us that I understand, you know, Maybe they came right out of their trafficking situation. They're terrified. They don't want nothing to do it, man. Oh, my God, you know, life's gonna come to an end type thing. Which, don't get me wrong, I was a little nervous because I had never been. Well, I.
[34:33] A: And I'm really scared.
[34:34] B: It's not that I had never been in a situation.
[34:36] A: I've never been in a room with a guy alone. It's crazy.
[34:39] B: But without it being a transaction, like, it had been some years for me, you know? And I'm like, so I'm gonna go sit in a room with this guy.
[34:47] A: For a couple hours with the door closed, and nobody knows what we're doing.
[34:51] B: And I'm like. My natural thought is transaction. You know what I mean? And then it's like, Sam brought me and we've met and now we're here.
[35:03] A: Yeah.
[35:03] B: It's nice. Yeah.
[35:05] A: Right, right. That's also teaching you.
[35:08] B: Yeah.
[35:08] A: How to not have just transactional relationships.
[35:11] B: Yeah.
[35:13] A: Right. Because I'm worth more than just that.
[35:16] B: Yeah.
[35:17] A: Right. That's what we want inside here. Totally.
[35:21] B: Yeah.
[35:22] A: Right, Right. So that. That's the part where what I'm doing is I'm learning how to have a different life.
[35:28] B: Yeah.
[35:28] A: Moving forward. That we want to be distinctly different from the one I had.
[35:34] B: Yeah.
[35:36] A: Right. So. Yeah. How do I go out and work and not use.
[35:42] B: Right.
[35:43] A: How do I. If I want to even date, date? Because I've had fucked up world about how it is with men.
[35:49] B: Yeah.
[35:50] A: What if, like, as I'm dating somebody, then it comes to having, like, what do I do with the sex thing now? Because, like, that's all been a weird thing.
[35:57] B: Yeah.
[35:59] A: Yeah. There's those things to start to kind of move through. There's some relationship stuff. I know We've talked to a friend of mine who. She's got her PhD with me in sexology, and hopefully she'll be able to come and do it. Presentation talk kind of thing with. With you all because.
[36:16] B: What do you mean? Your friend Christine.
[36:18] A: No. Oh, I've got Christine actually took courses from her. So the person who got her Ph.D. at the same time as me, Dr. Day Sheridan, she's up in Tampa and.
[36:28] B: She'S gonna come to Salem.
[36:29] A: Clinical sexologist. Hopefully she'll come and do a. Do a talk. She did it before. We kind of want to think about can she do something like that in an ongoing way over, you know.
[36:40] B: Yeah, that sounds awesome.
[36:41] A: Yeah. Because it's a female perspective. Different than talking to a guy about stuff. But again, there's a lot of this stuff that for you. Because relationships ran in the wrong direction. That. How do I get that to run in the right direction?
[36:58] B: Right, right. And I feel like those are the things that we need to learn. Those are the things that we should be working on, not the stuff that we are working on.
[37:09] A: Yeah. But there's a timing as to when to work on certain things. And I would say that for some people. So if trauma stuff hasn't been resolved and you don't know what to do about it, then you're fearful of it activating for people. Right. Like, so I've been recently talking with people who run prison about doing trauma treatment for inmates in women's prisons. Because I think there's a lot of the same kind of stuff that has.
[37:46] B: Happened and they more so than, you know, honestly.
[37:50] A: Right.
[37:51] B: Yeah.
[37:51] A: They don't do. They are very cautious about doing anything with trauma because they don't want to put the person in a re. Traumatized state and then out of the general public.
[38:04] B: Yeah, okay.
[38:06] A: Right.
[38:06] B: Yeah.
[38:07] A: Because that's not going to be good for them or. Right. So. But if there's a way like what we did, it changes that. And then you go out and you're like, yeah, no, that stuff doesn't have the same thing that it did. Then that's going to be. Because you've got it all wrapped up in one. You're not like opening the wound and then sending them out there, hoping they come back the next time.
[38:32] B: Right.
[38:33] A: Because that's a traditional mode of therapy. And that notion of I buried it, so I got to get it out versus what we do is get the good news in and unplug it.
[38:41] B: Okay.
[38:42] A: So, yeah, that was the idea of like, you know, doing something because again, as you put it, we've got a learning is one of those things that I want to ongoingly do because I've been in relationship that's been running backwards.
[39:02] B: Yeah, right.
[39:04] A: That it was because of some sort of compensation. I'm getting it. I'll allow you to do this Thing or I'll do this thing for you.
[39:14] B: Yeah. Because of what I needed.
[39:17] A: Right. Versus. And we also know that within that, and we may have talked about this, there were certain people that it was easier to do that with and other people that was like, oh, God, just figure out how to fucking do it and you're done yet kind of thing.
[39:31] B: Right.
[39:31] A: I mean, that's just, just.
[39:33] B: That was where, honestly, my. My disassociation came in handy.
[39:37] A: Very handy. Right.
[39:38] B: I was happy.
[39:39] A: Yeah. Right. Well, I don't have to be there for this one. That's great.
[39:43] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[39:46] A: All right. I come back when this one's over. All right. I'm good.
[39:48] B: Yeah.
[39:49] A: All right, I'm back. Good. It's over. Awesome. Thank you very much.
[39:52] B: Yeah. Yeah. That's what it was like sometimes, though.
[39:56] A: Right, Right, Right. So for you, around any of that world and any of that stuff, is there any bad feelings, like, any regrets, remorses, angers, guilt, shames, any discuss. Any kind of stuff around that content, that time where there's yuckiness for you?
[40:18] B: The disgust part, I guess, would be how many partners I've had because, like, I took pride.
[40:23] A: Were they really partners? Well, I mean, penetration with different people that I. That were serviced.
[40:31] B: Yeah. Right.
[40:33] A: I mean, would we feel bad about the person who did the oil changes and they've done like a thousand oil changes on cars? No, no, no.
[40:42] B: Okay.
[40:44] A: Right. Because it wasn't that they had that many love partners.
[40:49] B: Okay.
[40:51] A: There's a very different thing that makes sense. Yes.
[40:56] B: Okay.
[40:57] A: But that guy had a different tool set. Right. And doing oil changes. Right. Got a different tool set.
[41:02] B: Yeah.
[41:03] A: But we're not like, troubled by that. Oh, my goodness. Can you imagine how many oil changes I've done in my lifetime?
[41:07] B: Yeah.
[41:09] A: Right.
[41:09] B: Okay.
[41:10] A: So it's not that I had that many different love relationships or that I was just like, doing it with anybody just because there were transactions that were happening. There were things that. It was a. For lack of better words, a business dealing.
[41:26] B: Right.
[41:26] A: Makes it transactional.
[41:27] B: And that's how I started looking at it. So getting into an actual relationship with someone I couldn't do because I'm like, I can't be in a relationship with you and have sex with you. And it's. It's because I love you, you know, type thing, I couldn't bring myself.
[41:45] A: I can do all these things with that person. I can't do those things with you. Right. But it's because I love you. Wait, no. How come I'm getting this right into the stick?
[41:55] B: Yes. But that's how I felt. I couldn't do it.
[41:59] A: Yeah, yeah. So as you check in with that now, what do you notice now that you're away from that? Not doing it?
[42:08] B: I don't know that it's a part of me, but it doesn't have to define me.
[42:13] A: What if it's not a part of you?
[42:15] B: That lifestyle.
[42:17] A: Right. Was something that you did. So I'm going to give you a way of thinking about that that's a little bit unusual, but I think will be useful. Right. So oftentimes, us human beings, we confuse thoughts, feelings, behaviors, actions with attributes, qualities, characteristics, traits, identity. So frequently we think a way that we feel, think, or act is part of who I am. Like it's part of me. Like my arm is part of me. Right. But if a woman walked in to our office and said, hi, my name is Susie, I'm five two, I'm shy. If Susie is thinking about her shyness in the same way that she relates to her height, can she change it?
[43:18] B: No.
[43:18] A: No. But is her shyness the same thing as her height?
[43:21] B: No.
[43:22] A: Right. It affects how she feels, how she acts, she thinks, but it's not part of who she is. One of them is changeable. So we tend to walk around going, well, I am what I do. Yet if you're not doing it anymore, does that mean it's who you are? No. Was it a role that you played at that time? Right. Like when I worked at an arcade, it was a role that I played at that time. And when I was at bellman at a hotel, it was a role that I played at that time. It's not who I am. I don't walk around going, well, I'm a bellman. Right. Even though it was something I did.
[44:06] B: Yeah.
[44:08] A: Makes sense. So where that gets confused is when we think of something that I am, we make it that it's unchangeable.
[44:18] B: Okay.
[44:20] A: Right. But that wasn't ever part of who you are. It was something that you were doing, but it wasn't who you are. Make sense. So it never was a part of you, even though it was an activity that you did, it was a role that you played. It was a job that you had.
[44:45] B: Okay.
[44:46] A: Make sense?
[44:47] B: Yes.
[44:48] A: Not who you are. So it's not a part of you.
[44:51] B: Okay.
[44:52] A: Like your nose.
[44:53] B: Okay.
[44:54] A: Right.
[44:55] B: Yeah.
[44:55] A: Right. So knowing that it's not a part of you, it was just something that you did. It's not who you are. You're so much more than that. Make sense?
[45:07] B: Yes.
[45:08] A: And so really, as we look towards what you're wanting for you and your life is the word that you put it. I had that many partners when I'm getting compensated for it, and it's transactional. They're not partners.
[45:22] B: Okay.
[45:24] A: Make sense.
[45:25] B: Yeah.
[45:26] A: If it's somebody that seeked me out, that I was seeking them out. And the only thing that we were getting from each other was interaction, companionship, and we liked each other. And because we were liking each other, we thought it might be fun to be intimate with each other. That's a whole different thing.
[45:43] B: Okay.
[45:44] A: It's caught it.
[45:45] B: Got it.
[45:45] A: Yeah. Right, Right. And we wouldn't be troubled. I mean, we actually would want somebody who's done that many oil changes to do our oil change. Because we know they know how to do it.
[46:01] B: Yeah.
[46:02] A: Right. And they're well experienced because they've worked on a lot of different cars.
[46:05] B: Right?
[46:05] A: That's right.
[46:06] B: Yes.
[46:07] A: And they know that not all cars are the same.
[46:09] B: Right.
[46:09] A: Although they all have, like, oil.
[46:11] B: Yeah.
[46:11] A: Right. But they're not all, like, designed the same.
[46:13] B: Yeah.
[46:14] A: Where you have to go for it may not be exactly the same exact spot, probably within range, but, like. Right, got it.
[46:21] B: Got it.
[46:22] A: Right, Right. And we want you to be in the state of. Because for women, it always is the best that for a guy. Because a woman doesn't need a man. A woman needs a man about as much as a fish needs a bicycle, which is not at all. Right?
[46:39] B: Right.
[46:40] A: Not at all. Fish don't need bicycles. Right. So a woman doesn't need a man to take care of her. She can get her own groceries. She can do her own work. She can drive to where she needs to go. She doesn't need a man.
[46:51] B: Well, I need a man for one day, and that's to have children. But these days, woman doesn't even need.
[46:56] A: A man for that. And woman certainly doesn't need man for orgasm.
[47:01] B: Right?
[47:02] A: Right. Penis wasn't designed much better. Penis wasn't even designed for her pleasure. It was designed to make baby.
[47:09] B: Right?
[47:09] A: Right.
[47:09] B: Right.
[47:10] A: So a woman doesn't need man.
[47:11] B: Right.
[47:12] A: But as a woman, it feels good to be taken care of by her man. Right. So a woman doesn't need a man. So therefore, it's always on her terms.
[47:25] B: Okay.
[47:26] A: She's the one that gets to decide where and when and how often and how much.
[47:31] B: Right.
[47:32] A: She's the one that decides. She's the regulator. The question for her is never, oh, do I get to be with that guy? It's always, am I gonna allow that guy to hang out with me. Because if a guy is interested in me at first, the guy is interested in my outsides, because that's primary for guy. Right. You could tell a guy you gave me a list of all the things that you want, and I reached out and met every single thing on your list. And he's still gonna go, yeah, but what does she look like a gal will go, well, you know, sure, I'll meet him. Got all the things on my list. Sure, I'll meet him. Because for her, it's not primary number one what he looks like. There's other factors that also are contribution for him if it doesn't fit that one. Yeah, got it. So women are the ones that determine. They're the ones that have the keys.
[48:24] B: Okay.
[48:27] A: Right. So that's how we want you to be much more empowered.
[48:33] B: Okay.
[48:34] A: Makes sense.
[48:35] B: Yes.
[48:36] A: And we want it to be always on your terms, not just because he wants to. Okay. And I know I care about him, so I'll let him. Not that.
[48:48] B: Okay.
[48:49] A: It's got to be on your terms. That's the. That's the way it goes. Because she's the one he guy tends to be the never know. Always. Yes. That's just how it works for guys, right? You wake the guy up at 3:00 in the morning, he's got to be to work at 6. You're like, I'm really horny. Do you want him? Yeah, of course. You don't have to get the words out. Yeah, I'm in.
[49:10] B: Sure.
[49:11] A: Right now. Yep. Okay. Can't do that with her. Get it away from me. Ew. Ew. Ugh. What's wrong with you? Yeah, fine. Just go finish already. Like, I don't want to, but. Right. Like, yes.
[49:27] B: That's how it goes.
[49:29] A: Right. So that's why we've got to have it that she's got the keys.
[49:33] B: Yes.
[49:34] A: Right. The woman female panther doesn't run after the male even when she wants them, even when she's in heat. She lets him know, I'm approachable. Don't come near me if I'm not. But then you need to work to get me, buddy, because I'm worth it. Right. That's how we want all women to be feeling inside. That they're worth it, that they've got the goods. Right? Right.
[49:58] B: Okay.
[49:59] A: Does that make sense?
[50:00] B: Yes, that makes a lot of sense.
[50:02] A: And that's part of as we look at, like, re educating and rewiring. Right. How things have been coded. So now as you're getting that it was never who I was. It was just something that I was doing, and I was doing it back then just to survive.
[50:23] B: Yeah.
[50:24] A: Right. And maybe the survival had to do with doing whatever I needed to do to get the substance done, not be sick. Right.
[50:32] B: Yeah.
[50:33] A: Because that's the up part about that substance.
[50:35] B: Yeah.
[50:35] A: Is it tricks us.
[50:36] B: And that's what they don't tell you whenever you start using it.
[50:40] A: Yeah.
[50:40] B: They leave that part out until the day comes. And then you're like, so what's wrong with me?
[50:46] A: Yeah. Why am I sick? Oh, you're actually dying. Right.
[50:50] B: It's like, oh, you're dope sick.
[50:52] A: Right. It's saying, get more.
[50:54] B: Yeah.
[50:55] A: Right. That's the problem. Yeah.
[50:57] B: Sickness.
[50:58] A: So we're glad we got away from it.
[51:00] B: Yeah. I'm so glad I don't ever have to feel that way again.
[51:03] A: Right, right, right. And that's why we want to create. Notice how you had been thinking that was a part of you. Well, if that's never been a part of you. We want to create, how do we want you to be moving forward? So that doesn't even show up. Right. Like, I had another person say to me one time, and I'd never heard this before, they go, yeah. You know, we were at a convenience store, and this guy kind of like, whispered to me, you know, can I spend some money with you? And her response was, I don't do that kind of stuff no more. Not the right response.
[51:44] B: Right. Not at all. I would have slapped the dog shit out.
[51:47] A: Right. Because now, like, she was. Why I say that is she was doing the thing where she was identifying herself.
[51:54] B: Right.
[51:55] A: As the. Of the behavior that is me. Right. If that goes to somebody that. That's never happened. And the person says, can I spend some money with you? Be like, does that mean. I don't even know what that. What is he talking about? Spend money with me? Like, it wouldn't even show up as, like. That's such a weird comment.
[52:14] B: Right.
[52:16] A: Makes sense.
[52:17] B: Yes.
[52:18] A: That's how we would want that person to be. So we want you to be empowered that it's on your terms. Right. That you see things more clearly. Right. And notice what happened to that feeling of disgust.
[52:35] B: Yeah.
[52:36] A: Isn't that cool? Right, Right. Because we weren't looking at it clearly because we were thinking of it. Oh, it's a sexual partner. Well, not really. Something someone that got serviced. Right. Like oil changes.
[52:52] B: Yeah. Just get them over with.
[52:57] A: Yeah. Well. Right. And different cars will come in.
[53:01] B: Yes.
[53:02] A: They ought to change.
[53:03] B: Yes.
[53:04] A: This one needs a new filter.
[53:05] B: Can put that in.
[53:09] A: Windshield wipers with that.
[53:10] B: Right? Yeah. Yes.
[53:14] A: Right, Right. Yeah. Yeah. So cool. So as you're checking inside you, what.
[53:18] B: Do you notice that I feel better? Yeah. It's more of a comical thing instead of disgusted.
[53:30] A: Right? Yeah. Yeah. And it's something that we get to be glad that we're no longer doing.
[53:37] B: Yes, that's right. Thankful for it.
[53:40] A: Yeah. Right. And that's where, like, you saw something even though people were, you know, putting in your ear, hey, this would be useful for you. You should probably do this. No way, man. I'll learn just from being in jail.
[53:54] B: Yeah.
[53:55] A: I did the last time. Not really, but I will this time. Third time's a charm. Fifth. I don't know. Right. Yeah. I'll get it. Right. But then you chose you.
[54:03] B: Yeah. Even if someone incarcerated 11 times, it's like I keep getting incarcerated, lucky number 11. And then whenever I get let out, it just go right back to the same thing.
[54:15] A: Right, right. That's the stuff that we're interested in changing so that you've got the new parameter around you that supports the. This new way of being. Yeah, right. That's a part of programming is. That's a part of, like, having a mentor, somebody who's made it through to the other side.
[54:46] B: Okay. Got it.
[54:51] A: Yeah. Because it's guideposts. If I've never been there before, it's nice to have some guideposts along the way to whether I know I'm going in the right direction or not.
[55:03] B: Yeah, that's true.
[55:05] A: Right. Like, if somebody's already been through it and they can be like a guidepost along, that's helpful for me.
[55:11] B: Right?
[55:11] A: Yeah.
[55:12] B: Okay.
[55:13] A: That's why I like Google Maps. Because if I haven't been there, then it tells me where to go. Once I've been there, I can. I know how to get there again.
[55:22] B: That makes sense.
[55:23] A: Yeah. Yeah. You're doing great. Huh? Did you ask for anything for Christmas? Did they ask you to ask for things for Christmas?
[55:31] B: Yeah, I asked for a hoodie.
[55:32] A: A hoodie?
[55:33] B: Yeah.
[55:33] A: Okay.
[55:35] B: A hoodie. And some makeup.
[55:37] A: Makeup is key. I learned that this is blush, and this stuff here is masculine mascara.
[55:47] B: Yeah.
[55:48] A: And this is eyeshadow.
[55:50] B: Yeah.
[55:51] A: And this is eyeliner.
[55:53] B: Yeah.
[55:54] A: But how come some people put the line here.
[55:57] B: I don't know my line there. And I put my shadow there.
[56:03] A: So the eyeline I thought was here. No, some people put it on top.
[56:08] B: I put my eyeshadow on, and then I put my eyeliner on, then my mascara because it makes my eyes look more they pop. Yeah.
[56:18] A: When my 13 year old puts the stuff on mascara, I go, you just made your eyes pop. Because they pop. It's pretty cool.
[56:29] B: Yeah. She puts on the blush and the eyeliner and everything else.
[56:33] A: I don't know if she does all that stuff. I don't think she does. But I do think she does the mascara oven. Yeah, she's 13. The nine year old on the other hand, she does it all and sometimes right before she goes to bed, we're like, you know, you're going to need to wash your face again. Like.
[56:54] B: It'S the lovely part of having girls.
[56:56] A: It is the lovely part of having girls.
[56:58] B: Yeah.
[56:59] A: And one of them being the one that like does everything that you ask and the other one being the one that goes, yeah. Trying to get my one daughter out with me this morning so I could get her to school so I could come back for a team meeting that I had here. She's like, oh, dad. Yeah, no, I'll help you in the morning. Okay, cool. Like, could you get your backpack together? That'd be really helpful. Now I'm reading. I said, but you told me that you were gonna help me. Yeah, but that was only if you were gonna do this thing. Okay, cool. I like doing it all myself.
[57:35] B: Reading first thing in the morning.
[57:37] A: Yeah, she's been. Yeah, that's not always. She was. She had the radio on before that.
[57:44] B: Oh, okay.
[57:44] A: I think it was just like she had a couple minutes. So she's gonna read. Like you could put your backpack together.
[57:49] B: Yeah, no, you gotta do that because you had to sign the papers.
[57:56] A: You have to put the backpack together. You have to make my lunch. You have to do my water bottle. You have to.
[58:01] B: Well, where's mom?
[58:04] A: She's. She doesn't come into the kitchen yet.
[58:10] B: Okay.
[58:12] A: She then takes second shift.
[58:15] B: Yeah.
[58:15] A: Which is. Then the older one goes to school a little bit later than the younger one. So then the older one, she gets the older one stuff.
[58:22] B: Yeah.
[58:23] A: Together and her food and that.
[58:26] B: Oh boy.
[58:28] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[58:30] B: So you get to take first shift. That's awesome.
[58:32] A: I got first shift. Only because I think my wife knows that I handle the little one better than she does.
[58:39] B: Oh, okay. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah, that's awesome that she knows that.
[58:46] A: That's good.
[58:47] B: Yeah.
[58:48] A: Cuz it's not good the other way around. Who knows? I might start taking both of them to school.
[58:55] B: Oh, Lord, then you're really gonna have a problem.
[58:58] A: I know.
[58:59] B: Yeah. Yeah. Because I think school is like an hour and a half time difference or something to start and let out.
[59:07] A: Yeah, they're not fun.
[59:09] B: Yeah. I remember those days.
[59:14] A: Yeah. So you're doing great. I'm really proud of you.
[59:17] B: Thank you.
[59:18] A: I'm glad that you're noticing those positive changes.
[59:20] B: Thank you.
[59:21] A: And this will continue to feed forward.
[59:22] B: Okay.
[59:23] A: Yeah.
[59:24] B: Yeah.
[59:24] A: You did awesome today.
[59:25] B: All right.
[59:25] A: Even without Sam.
[59:26] B: I know she didn't come today.
[59:30] A: I heard.
