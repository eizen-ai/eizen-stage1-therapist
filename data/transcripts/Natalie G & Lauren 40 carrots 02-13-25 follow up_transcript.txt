[00:00] A: All right, so Today is the 13th. Wow. 13th of February. Tomorrow is Valentine's Day. All right, so, Natalie, Lauren, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you both know that given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals, and I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:20] B: Yes.
[00:21] A: Okay, cool. So first, how did our session leave you? When you think about the different experiences that we went through, what do you notice when you think about those things now?
[00:32] B: Okay. I. I feel better. I still had a nightmare. I had one nightmare and I.
[00:43] A: Just one. Just one night. Cool.
[00:46] B: And I had my son. He always likes to, like. Like, jump on my back and grab me from behind.
[00:57] A: Yeah.
[00:57] B: And then always. I. Bothers me.
[01:00] A: Okay.
[01:01] B: A lot. It kind of brings me back.
[01:03] A: We'd like to get that to stop bothering you.
[01:05] B: Yes, it still does.
[01:08] A: We didn't do anything with that, did we?
[01:10] B: I don't know. It's.
[01:11] A: Well, this is the first time that I'm hearing that your son likes to jump on your back and it bothers you.
[01:16] B: Well, it reminds me.
[01:17] A: So I don't think we did anything.
[01:19] B: Well, it reminds me of when I was, like, being choked.
[01:23] A: Sure.
[01:24] B: When I thought I was gonna lose my life.
[01:26] A: Yeah.
[01:26] B: So when he does that, it's. I don't think it's as bad as what it was. So it's been left, but it's still pretty bad. Like, I still can't. Like, I just, like. No, I have to tell him to get off, but I can't do that.
[01:38] A: Sure.
[01:40] B: But I've noticed, like. Like when he jumps on me and stuff like that, it's not as bad. It's more mostly when he gets, like. Puts his arms, like, around my neck.
[01:49] A: And you weren't expecting it.
[01:51] B: Yeah. Or even when I am expecting it.
[01:53] A: Okay.
[01:53] B: Like, it's just. I can't do it.
[01:55] A: Okay.
[01:59] B: But I. There's been a lot of talk with them about the case and stuff lately, and I. I mean, I feel. I think, better than what I did. I didn't. I can.
[02:14] A: So let's check. Right. Like, think about the experiences that we talked about. So the first thing to check in with is when you think about. Because we went in reverse. I don't know whether you know that or not, but we went in reverse order of what I would normally think something would go where we dealt with the worst of the worst of the worst first. Because you were coming in to deal with that. Except we weren't really Coming in to deal with that, that was a side thing we're coming to get now to work better. And we know that we go through lots of experiences in life that, even prior to that, that were troubling moments right along the way that we've had lots of times. What brain organically brings to awareness is something that's already further away. Because the further something is away in an embodied sense, the less intense I feel it kind of like nobody's afraid of spiders when they see them as really small and really far away. Right. The only people are scared. See them close and big. Right. And if you saw a spider this big and this close, you'd be freaked out, too. So there's that. So I'm really curious. So there's that experience, the one that had happened that led him to go to jail and you to run to the neighbors. When you think about that experience now, what do you notice?
[03:27] B: It doesn't really bother me anymore.
[03:29] A: It doesn't have the same feeling. Thomas. That's really different than it was. We still don't like that he did it.
[03:34] B: No.
[03:34] A: Or that we experienced it. But it doesn't have all that stuff that it did.
[03:39] B: No. I think that really, the only thing that's really, like, staying with me is a choking thing, because that's when I felt like I was gonna lose my life. That's the biggest thing. The rest of it doesn't really feel as heavy, I guess. Like, it doesn't feel.
[03:52] A: It doesn't feel as heavy, does it?
[03:54] B: No.
[03:55] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[03:56] B: Yeah.
[03:56] A: What about the thing with the guy with the gun and the pull the trigger and the.
[04:00] B: It doesn't bother me as much.
[04:02] A: Isn't that weird?
[04:02] B: Yeah.
[04:05] A: Because that was a pretty scary one, too. Right? Right. Yeah. It doesn't have the same feeling tone.
[04:13] B: No.
[04:14] A: Okay. So that's really cool. Yeah. And you've noticed that even though what happens with your son when he does that, expectedly or unexpectedly, it has some discomfort, but it's less than it used to.
[04:27] B: Yes.
[04:28] A: Cool. Okay. What else have you noticed, Natalie? New and different for you? What else? Like, different better. How has it been with the bed and quote, unquote?
[04:43] B: That doesn't bother me anymore at all.
[04:46] A: Right.
[04:46] B: So that's, like, really is a relief. Like, that doesn't bother me at all. Like, I don't have that problem anymore.
[04:52] A: Good.
[04:52] B: So that's good.
[04:53] A: Yeah.
[04:58] B: Yeah. I mean, I feel like I don't have, like. I haven't really had any, like, triggers or anything like that, except for my on my son, like.
[05:06] A: Yeah, that part.
[05:06] B: Like, on me. And I only had one nightmare, which I felt like it was my son. My son was having a nightmare. He was screaming in his sleep. And I think it triggered something for me because then I had a nightmare.
[05:19] A: Okay.
[05:21] B: But that was the only one that I.
[05:23] A: And how long ago was that?
[05:29] B: I. Do you remember, like a month ago? I don't know.
[05:35] A: So not often. Isn't that cool?
[05:39] B: Yes.
[05:40] A: Yeah. And how about the intensity when you had it? Did it get as high? Did it last as long or did it not go as high? Was it less in terms of its duration? Yeah. When the feeling troubled.
[05:54] B: It was. To me, it was bad. It was a bad nightmare.
[05:58] A: Yeah. So there's bad and good. If we're gonna just do one or the other. Right. And then there's variations. I think it was bad.
[06:06] B: Like, I. I felt like I was even, like, touching my neck.
[06:09] A: Because you were.
[06:11] B: Yes, because isn't that cool? Yeah.
[06:13] A: You were actually touching your neck?
[06:15] B: Well, when I woke up. Yes.
[06:16] A: Right. You were touching your neck knowing. Wait a minute, he didn't do that.
[06:19] B: Yes.
[06:20] A: Do you get that?
[06:21] B: I. I didn't realize that until now. Yes.
[06:24] A: That that wasn't happening. That's why you're checking your neck. Isn't that cool?
[06:29] B: Yes.
[06:29] A: Right. And that also cues it in. That's why you haven't been having it.
[06:34] B: That makes sense.
[06:35] A: Right. Because you got. Wait a minute. That's not happening. And remember, why do we stay haunted by the stuff that has. Is that the brain doesn't know that it ended, that it's not happening, that I actually did survive it and make it through it. Those are the things that we want integrated inside of you.
[06:56] B: Okay.
[06:57] A: Yeah. Okay, cool. What else have you noticed? What about the negative, critical thoughts? The more down on you. The, like, how has that been?
[07:11] B: I just have so much going on. I feel like it's kind of taken in place. There's just so much more going on.
[07:17] A: And what does that mean?
[07:18] B: I just been. Well, we have to get out of our house because it's complicated. It's owned by his parents or his grandmother and great grandmother, and they are kicking us out.
[07:34] A: Okay.
[07:35] B: So that's been really stressful, I bet. And trying to find a place. And then they're not really giving us more time. They're just. I. It's just been really stressful and very hard.
[07:48] A: Yeah. And so you learned that they wanted to evict you and they didn't give you a lot of time to get out.
[07:54] B: Well, I mean, they gave us more than I thought they would.
[07:57] A: Oh, okay.
[07:58] B: But they're just being very strict on it, and we're running out of time. He'll be up by the end of the month. And I think I'm gonna find a house today. Hoping.
[08:08] A: Okay.
[08:08] B: Fingers crossed. But it's just been really stressful because that's all. It's been taken up most of my time trying to find a house, looking at houses, and then not really, you know, finding anything. And then I just found out today that there's going to be a trial in June.
[08:26] A: Okay.
[08:26] B: When I thought it was going to be at the end of this year or even next year. Sooner than I thought. I know it's still a little ways, but. So that's all of that just kind of is. It's a lot at once.
[08:42] A: Yeah. And notice where it all is in my head, like, right here. Oh, yeah, right. I mean, literally, you're like. It's all at, like, once. And you're answering. Right. What happens if we take it and we move it down there?
[08:55] B: I feel better.
[08:56] A: Right. Like, if you. Right. Isn't that interesting?
[08:59] B: Yes.
[08:59] A: So that's just an example of how does our brain code information in a visual way. You didn't consciously go like this, but as you were describing, your body did this. So your unconscious is communicating, letting us know where it's located for you. Which, of course, if it's right here, it's really. If we move it down below and put it out a little bit further and you're kind of having a vantage point of seeing it down there. Notice just inside, what happens to the feelings? What do you notice?
[09:39] B: I still don't feel like it's there yet.
[09:41] A: But what happens if it was like, we move it and it just goes down there.
[09:44] B: I think we feel better. I would feel, like, relief. Not as stressed. I would feel like it's just, like, it's not all up here. I feel like it just. I felt like my mind would be clearer.
[09:56] A: That's right. That's right. Because when we get overwhelmed and jumbled, it's all, like, up in this area. If we shift the vantage point and I'm above it and I'm able to see it down below and I have distance from it. I'm able to see the space in between it. I'm also able to reorganize it. Right. Because it might be in certain groupings that I have it, Chunks of information. But I might want to sequence it. Like, I might think, oh, this is first, and then this is Second. This is third. But as I get into. I'm like, well, no, actually, I needed to do this. And then. Does that make sense? I can do that better when I've got a up above and I'm seeing it down below. So we want to get that reversal in you. So that with the stuff that's been so much, we get more space from it and we get up above it a little bit. Does that make sense?
[10:48] B: Yes.
[10:48] A: So that you can see the bigger picture along with the. What's my next action step? So kind of like both being able to zoom out. Zoom in.
[10:57] B: Okay.
[10:58] A: Does that make sense? Like, zoom in is okay. This is the task I need to do. But I can't always know the task until I zoom out and see how does it begin to fit together? Does that make sense? Okay, cool. So that's been a lot. And they've been pretty strict on, no, you're gonna have to get out when we told you to get out.
[11:14] B: Yes. I'm hoping they will give me a little bit more time. Like a week. I don't know if they will.
[11:20] A: Okay.
[11:23] B: Yeah. It's just a big mess.
[11:24] A: Have you been able to get any support or financial stuff or housing assistance or any of that kind of stuff? Yes. Okay.
[11:31] B: Yes. It was just. The problem was just finding a house because they go so quickly.
[11:36] A: I see.
[11:37] B: And I just. I don't know. It's just been really stressful, I think, okay, this is the house. And then something, you know, they go with somebody else or. It's just. I've had some really bad luck with the house.
[11:51] A: Okay. Okay. So you've been in action. You've been taking the steps that there are for you to do. It just hasn't happened yet. And now we're getting closer and closer to their deadline, and so there's a little more angst with it.
[12:04] B: I know every day it gets closer, the worse I get.
[12:09] A: We'd like that to be different.
[12:10] B: Yes.
[12:11] A: Yeah. So again, you feel more ease in space.
[12:15] B: Yes.
[12:16] A: Between it. Okay, cool. All right. What else would be useful for me to know?
[12:26] B: I don't know. I mean, I know there's, like, the trials coming up. That's another huge thing.
[12:31] A: Yeah.
[12:31] B: Kind of really on my mind.
[12:33] A: That's in June.
[12:34] B: It is in June. But it's just learning about it being in June is kind of a lot, too. I just.
[12:42] A: How so?
[12:44] B: I am scared to testify. Like, terrified.
[12:47] A: Okay.
[12:48] B: I mean, I know how the lawyer was with me during deposition, and I just don't know if I can handle it.
[12:54] A: Huh.
[12:55] B: And it scares me.
[12:56] A: Okay. Would you want to be in a position that you can.
[12:59] B: Yes.
[13:00] A: Handle it really well?
[13:01] B: Yes. That would be awesome.
[13:03] A: Okay. We could do something with that, too. Right. Because we want you to be clear. Right. And more centered and grounded in you, so that that stuff that they might do goes by you and it doesn't have any stick. Right.
[13:20] B: Yes.
[13:21] A: Yeah. I've done lots of work with people who have to go testify, and they've got a lot of anxiety. Testify against their trafficker, other kinds of things like that. So we can definitely do things to get you set up so that you're clear and present. Right. And. And more. Okay. In you as you're doing it.
[13:49] B: Okay. That sounds good.
[13:50] A: Cool. I know.
[13:51] B: I feel like I tend to, like, when. Like, moments like that, like when it's stressful, I feel like I go somewhere else. Like, my mind is just not very clear. And that's what I kind of worry about, too, is that I don't. It's just that when I get really stressed or just nervous, I kind of. Like, I'm not, like, in the moment. I don't know how to explain it.
[14:15] A: You're in your head.
[14:16] B: Yes.
[14:16] A: A lot with this, or you're out of your body.
[14:19] B: Yes.
[14:20] A: Two really useful.
[14:21] B: It happened to me during the divorce, which was bad, but the divorce lawyer, she asked me a question, and I just kind of, like, went somewhere else.
[14:31] A: Yeah.
[14:32] B: And. And then I answered the question without even processing it and answered it wrong. So that was really. Really.
[14:40] A: That happened when?
[14:42] B: That was. When was it? Of course, last year.
[14:45] A: So well, before we met.
[14:46] B: Yes.
[14:47] A: Okay. All right. That would make sense. You're all discombobulated.
[14:52] B: Something like that.
[14:53] A: Okay.
[14:54] B: I can't remember.
[14:54] A: So. So the interesting thing that we want to consider. Right. Is when all of that stuff is active, it sends me out without me going out on purpose. So the superpower is the ability to dissociate and be here, not there, when there's an uncomfortable thing. Right. You or your brain or your unlearned. How to take you out so that you didn't have to be there fully for what was happening in the body and then would bring you back when there was something for you to actually do.
[15:31] B: Yes.
[15:32] A: And that's a really adaptive feature. Right. And it can be useful in so many different ways. Like in an exercise class, where your body gets to exercise and you get to go, you know, do something else for a little while and then.
[15:44] B: Yes.
[15:45] A: Like, so. So what we want it to be is more intentional and on purpose.
[15:51] B: Okay.
[15:51] A: Because what you've recognized is that it sends me or has sent me, not when I've decided it.
[15:58] B: Yeah.
[15:59] A: So based on what had happened, like through the divorce, knowing that I'm gonna have to. Have I concerned that it might happen again?
[16:07] B: Yes.
[16:07] A: And I don't want that to happen because then I'm not present.
[16:10] B: Especially when it's talking about sensitive stuff.
[16:13] A: Yeah.
[16:14] B: You know, or like what we're going to be talking about and trial, and I just.
[16:20] A: Right. But check it out. The stuff that's. The sensitive stuff that you're going to be talking about in trial isn't so sensitive anymore to you.
[16:30] B: I don't know. I'm.
[16:31] A: I talked about it, but I mean, just check it out. Well, think about it. Remember it. Remember what he did. The different. How many times he had to freaking pee.
[16:39] B: I. A lot.
[16:41] A: I mean, the guy just had to go pee all the time. All right, time out. Got to go pee now. Come back and beat that. Right. Like, I mean, as you think about that now, what do you notice?
[16:50] B: It doesn't bother me as much.
[16:53] A: What about it bothers you? Just check.
[16:56] B: I think the only thing is the choking, really.
[16:58] A: Okay, so we're not done with that part.
[17:01] B: Yes. The rest of it kind of feels like it's just like a story, kind of like a past. It's just like it happened and it's over. It doesn't affect me like it did before.
[17:16] A: Right.
[17:16] B: But the choking, it's still kind of with me.
[17:19] A: Okay.
[17:19] B: I wouldn't say as much, but it is still there.
[17:21] A: So we're just not done with that. Right. I mean, in the world of change work, it's not. I've either changed or I haven't changed.
[17:30] B: I just think that's the worst part for me because I thought I was gonna die.
[17:33] A: That's the worst part for me. Right. So here's the cool part. What do we know?
[17:38] B: Well, that I'm here.
[17:39] A: You didn't die. So what do we want to get into the part that doesn't know that. That.
[17:45] B: That I made it.
[17:46] A: That I. Yeah. Right. So that's the sticky part. Right. What's sticky is that there's an aspect that creates that discomfort. So think of it in a different way to say it. Think of it that there's a part of you that causes that discomfort when you're either startled or even if you know, and somebody's around this area. Right. And unfortunately, you got a boy that's like a monkey, and you're at the jungle gym and you're Getting climbed all over. Right. Like, if I didn't have a boy that was like a monkey, maybe I wouldn't have this concern. But, like. Got it. So that's where. So then what's been off is the part of you that's causing the discomfort. Right. What do you think that part's highest positive intention is for you? Like, why would it be doing it? Like it's got a positive beneficial thing or it wouldn't do it. Even if it's an error, even if it's not working. Right. Like there's an intention behind it to do something beneficial for you. So what do you think that part's highest positive intention is for you?
[18:52] B: I don't know.
[18:55] A: What would. How would it benefit to get and have a discomfort there? What does it want to make sure doesn't happen?
[19:06] B: I just. I don't know. I feel like I'm going back there again. Like I'm thinking about it.
[19:15] A: Well, then be here. Hi. This is more fun than that.
[19:19] B: Oh, yes.
[19:20] A: Right, right. That's all you got to do. Notice how much easier it is to come back here now. Notice how, by the way, and this is really, really cool. And I don't know whether you realize this. You just recognized I was going back there and you brought yourself back. Do you get how different that is? A lot quicker and you couldn't do it before.
[19:44] B: True.
[19:45] A: Make sense?
[19:46] B: Yes.
[19:47] A: So all we want to do, the part doesn't know that you survived. It's causing the discomfort, not because that was such an awful moment, but because it doesn't know it's over. And it's trying to get you to get that moment to stop. That's the purpose of the emotion. That's the purpose of the discomfort. Right. It doesn't make logical sense because you know it's your boy.
[20:08] B: Yes.
[20:08] A: Do you follow me with that? So you're like. But it's not yet your body remember when those things stay active, it confuses anything that's structurally similar and maps it as identical. Okay, so you're not responding to your kid treating you like a jungle gym. Your brain is responding to that. Similar to what? Oh, no. And it's. And then it's like, I gotta stop. Don't touch me, but I love you, but don't touch me. Right. Like there's that kind of thing. And I don't want to damage you by but don't like kind of thing. Right. So all we want to do is get that part educated so that it knows what we all know, that it's over. You survived it, you're okay. That there's nothing there. And it's already starting to get it because it's less than it was.
[20:58] B: Yeah.
[20:59] A: It's just not fully in.
[21:01] B: Okay.
[21:01] A: Does that make sense?
[21:02] B: Yes.
[21:03] A: So then if we think of a you where you're completely free from the effect that that's had, so your brain in no way, shape or form confuses your son's playfulness with what happened then. Okay, got it. Like that's where I'm seeing you.
[21:17] B: Yes.
[21:18] A: Right. The question isn't how it's going to happen, it's would it be okay with you?
[21:21] B: Yes.
[21:22] A: Yeah. And notice how with it, okay, we've got the green light. We're already on the way. Then all we do is we go. Let's put our body in a state of rest. Why? Because that'll accelerate healing. That's where you slightly lower your tongue and you relax the back of your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper. And I don't know if I talked to you guys about this one, but this one's really fun. Do we ever talk about the physiological sigh? You know what that. Have you ever heard of that? I don't think so. So have you heard the physiological side? Do you know what it is?
[21:53] B: I think about, like our stress response. So maybe not specific to what you're addressing.
[21:57] A: So there's a thing that your body naturally does when you're hysterically crying. So if you've ever been with somebody and they're really crying and they're really, really upset, their body does that deep breath in and then a quick breath in and then a longer exhale. That's called the physiological sigh. And what we learned is if you do that four times, when you're in any amount of distress, your heart's beating quicker, whatever. If you do the physiological sigh four times, it will all of a sudden immediately settle the body down. And then about 20 seconds later, the heart rate comes down. Because it's a natural way to down regulate the nervous system. So try it. You breathe in. I'll show you how it's done. You breathe in and then at the top and then a long exhale and you do it again. And then two more times and then one more. And just notice. What do you notice happening in the body right now? How's the body starting to feel relaxed. Isn't that kind of cool? Isn't that crazy?
[23:20] B: There's so many good, like bilateral stimulation, tapping and. That's great.
[23:25] A: Yeah.
[23:25] B: New one for me.
[23:26] A: Yeah, there's so many different things that just by shifting your breathing, which is the basic physiological maneuver that we skip all the time because it's too simple, right. I got to do these complicated things like the breath is key because the breath is the thing that happens unconsciously all the time that I can consciously do. Right. So I never have to think about breathing or how I'm breathing. But I can choose my breath, I can regulate my breathing. And when I down regulate in here, it does stuff to quiet up here. That makes sense. So those are really useful things that are tools to utilize. Like I've given it to my daughter on the basketball court when she's nervous. I just do a few of those and then she settles right back down. And it's kind of an interesting thing to see happen. So again, with your jaw slightly lowered and you relax your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper and you exhale a little bit longer. And notice how already you're noticing more space. Right? It's already going in line. Because as soon as you started, the jaw went down and you started breathing before I even started saying it. Which means your unconscious is already knowing how to do this. Right. It's supporting you and wanting to know what you know. There's just a part of your brain that doesn't know certain things ended, you survived, you're okay. That we have really, really good news to get into that part of the brain that doesn't fully know it. Because it's not troubling you now because that was such an awful, troubling thing, which I know sounds crazy, but it's troubling you now because part. Part of the brain, that aspect doesn't fully know what we know. Got it?
[25:22] B: Yes.
[25:22] A: So you can remember where you were, the location when it happened. Right. And where was it? Was it on the bed? Under the bed? Side of the bed? This side of what on the bed? On the bed. Right. And like you were facing which direction.
[25:40] B: I was facing up.
[25:41] A: You were right. And he was on top of you or behind you.
[25:46] B: He was like. I think it was beside me.
[25:48] A: He was.
[25:49] B: He was like his arm was underneath me.
[25:51] A: And that's right. And you can remember that. And as you're remembering that now, check in your body, notice how there's a little discomfort. Right. Get curious about those sensations, not the situation now, just the sensations. And literally use the sound of curiosity. Go right. I wonder how they're changing. Right. And what do you notice with what's happening to those sensations now? You don't know well, how are they changing different than they were? Even if it's subtle, even if it's not in the way you want it to, Just begin to notice the sensations. Not the situation, just the sensations.
[26:32] B: Okay.
[26:33] A: Because remember, the thing that sends us down the track is that frozen moment. And I'm never aware consciously of these feelings changing. As we bring our awareness to the sensations and we are changing the relationship with the sensation by just noticing how they're changing, we're taking the still image and making it move. When it starts moving, the brain begins to realize it's not stuck, frozen, not happening. Makes sense.
[27:05] B: Yeah.
[27:05] A: So what are you noticing now?
[27:09] B: I feel like I. My mind is kind of going through it, but it's like. It's not like what you're saying. It's not stopped at that one moment, it's just kind of going through.
[27:17] A: Notice how. Let's finish the thing. Because it finished way better than it started. Because the problem with that problem is that where your brain froze, it was at the worst spot.
[27:27] B: Yes.
[27:33] A: That'S the problem. Like, froze it at the worst moment of it, and then that one got stuck on a replay loop.
[27:39] B: Yes.
[27:40] A: Makes sense. So how do we know it finished? Eventually, he let go and you were breathing.
[27:45] B: Yes.
[27:45] A: Eventually you got out of that house.
[27:47] B: Yes.
[27:48] A: Right. Then he got arrested and went to jail.
[27:50] B: Yes.
[27:50] A: Right. And then later on, you did something fun. I. I think you went to, like, Legoland or something cool like that. Right, right. Yeah. And that's what we want to get in. Because that part doesn't know the rest of the story. Because that's really the issue with the problem, is that it doesn't end well. But the ending was arbitrary. Your brain could have froze it anywhere along the. But it froze it at the wrong spot.
[28:14] B: Yes.
[28:15] A: Because we got a much better ending.
[28:17] B: Yes.
[28:18] A: Than that one.
[28:19] B: Yes.
[28:19] A: Right. So again, so he did that. He had his arm. Right. And then eventually you were feeling like, I'm not breathing, maybe going. And then eventually you woke back up.
[28:30] B: Yes.
[28:31] A: Right. And then you got out.
[28:33] B: Yes.
[28:34] A: Yeah. And then that was over.
[28:36] B: Yes.
[28:36] A: And then later on, you did something more fun.
[28:38] B: Yes.
[28:38] A: I go to Legoland.
[28:39] B: Yes.
[28:39] A: Right. Right. And then we can go backwards. We go to Legoland. Right. We've got. You're out. You came to. He finally let go. He was choking you out. He'd come around you. He's back on the bed. And then we got a little piece of. But if we go backwards to that, what do you start noticing?
[28:56] B: Well, when we go backwards, it doesn't feel as heavy like as he does.
[29:00] A: Isn't it cool?
[29:02] B: Yes.
[29:03] A: That's another indication of how your brain is reading it now as information. Art is not so heavy. You can remember him doing that. You can remember putting your jeans on today?
[29:15] B: Yes.
[29:15] A: Natalie, stop putting on your jeans. I am not putting.
[29:18] B: I'm not putting my jeans on.
[29:19] A: Well then stop him from doing that.
[29:21] B: I'm not.
[29:21] A: Well, stop him from putting his arm around your neck.
[29:23] B: His arm is not around me.
[29:24] A: Well, then stop that from happening.
[29:25] B: It's not happening.
[29:26] A: So then where is it? Say it doesn't exist.
[29:28] B: It doesn't exist.
[29:29] A: Right? Right. Isn't that all right? See? Isn't that cool? Notice how it's getting in. Right. Close your eyes. Think back to that. You, who was really scared that she was going to die in that moment because things are going dark. Let her know what happened. Let her know that he let go. Let her know that you woke up. Let her know that you got away. Let her know that he went to jail. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about going to Legoland. Let her know. Right.
[29:50] B: He let go.
[29:51] A: That's right. So that she begins to get it right. What happens is she realizes that it's not happening. That earlier you realizes it's not happening. Now what do you start to notice happening with her as she's realizing it's not happening?
[30:07] B: I can. I can picture him with his arm around me.
[30:13] A: Yeah.
[30:14] B: But now I'm starting to picture like his arm letting go.
[30:19] A: Right. Which was the better part, wasn't it?
[30:21] B: Yes.
[30:22] A: Uhhuh. Right. If we're going to pick a part to remember, let's remember the part where he let go. Cuz that was better than.
[30:28] B: That's not a. That's not part that I was going to.
[30:31] A: I know.
[30:31] B: Constantly.
[30:32] A: We kept stopping at the worst part of the story.
[30:35] B: It never. It's just like you said, it was on a loop.
[30:38] A: It was on a loop.
[30:39] B: Went any further than that.
[30:40] A: Right. Isn't that cool? Notice what's happening now as you're realizing.
[30:45] B: Yes.
[30:46] A: Right. That you let go.
[30:47] B: Actually, like see it.
[30:48] A: You can, can't you?
[30:49] B: His arm letting go.
[30:51] A: That's right. And then you felt like you could take a breath.
[30:54] B: Yes.
[30:55] A: Right. And then you're breathing. Right. And then you had the wherewithal to get away. Right. Like you got away. It's so cool. It is. And notice how they're not tears of sadness.
[31:11] B: No. It's just kind of relief.
[31:14] A: Notice how it's relief. Right?
[31:16] B: Yes.
[31:16] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[31:19] B: It was kind of like the thing, like last time with the bed thing. Like, he was in my bed, and now he's like, he was no longer in my bed.
[31:25] A: Right.
[31:26] B: That's kind of the same feeling I just had. Just like, I could literally see his arm moving away. Done. And that's the first time I ever felt that, ever.
[31:36] A: Isn't that cool?
[31:37] B: Yes.
[31:38] A: Yeah. Because the story's ending changed. That was just a shitty moment. It's kind of crazy. That was just a shitty moment. On the way to Legoland. Right? Ninjago area. That place is crazy. Get in that little cart thingy. Try. I'm not very good at it. I'm better at the other one, the ghost one, where you're in the tomb thing. Tomb Raider 1. I'm better at that one. That one was not good at. Yeah. So just check it out again.
[32:17] B: Okay.
[32:18] A: What do you notice now? Think about that? Remember that happening?
[32:21] B: Okay.
[32:22] A: Remember that? He did it. We didn't like it when he was doing it. But the part that. That you didn't know is that he let go.
[32:30] B: Yes. Now I can. Now I feel that now. I'm not stuck at that. He's, you know, still doing that now. I'm seeing it through. I. I can see where he. He let go.
[32:42] A: He did let go.
[32:42] B: Yes.
[32:43] A: And then you got away. Yes, that's right. And ended it, by the way. All of it, all the violence, you ended it.
[32:51] B: Yes.
[32:51] A: Isn't that cool? Yes, that's right. You ended it.
[32:55] B: Yes.
[32:57] A: You did that, right? You got away. You ended it.
[33:01] B: Yes.
[33:01] A: Right. Isn't that good? Not just for you, but for my kids. Yeah. Right. Really good for them. Yeah. Yeah. You want to start to feel really good about that.
[33:13] B: Yes.
[33:13] A: Yeah. So, again, think about that. Think about your boy, you know? I mean, you are a jungle gym.
[33:19] B: Yes.
[33:20] A: And he might, like, climb up on.
[33:22] B: You at the moment. I'm feeling better.
[33:25] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[33:26] B: It's not like. I mean, I'm not picturing him on me, but I'm not.
[33:29] A: Well, just think about it for a moment. Think about, like, you know, he climbs, and sometimes you still might not want him on you, but it won't be doing that, because I don't always want my kid climbing on me either. But it's not because of that.
[33:40] B: Yeah.
[33:42] A: Like, sometimes I'm doing something else. Like, okay, this is a little distracting.
[33:48] B: I mean, it feels a lot better. Like, I'm seeing. I'm not getting stuck anymore.
[33:52] A: You're not. I know, right?
[33:54] B: It's like, I Can go completely through it now.
[33:57] A: I notice how him playing with you is different than that.
[34:01] B: Yes.
[34:01] A: That they're not the same thing. Right. Even if he's got his hands up here or climbed up on. Right. Just check it out for a moment. Think about your boy.
[34:11] B: Okay.
[34:12] A: Right. Climb up behind you and grab you. Right.
[34:14] B: It's kind of getting to me a little bit.
[34:16] A: That's what we want to have it get to you here, not there.
[34:20] B: Okay.
[34:20] A: Right. So again, notice the sensations. Where are you noticing them? In your body.
[34:24] B: Yeah. I feel like I'm getting stuck at it again.
[34:30] A: The situation.
[34:32] B: Yeah. When you were doing that, it just kind of.
[34:33] A: Right. So now.
[34:35] B: But I. I do feel like I was. It did bring me back, but I feel like I. I got right out of it. I wasn't stuck.
[34:44] A: No. You know, I didn't think you were. That's why I want you to go to the sensations. So do the same thing. Think about him like climbing up over you and he's got his arm and it's kind of like around that. Right. And feel some of the feelings.
[34:56] B: Where do you feel like actually like.
[34:58] A: Just think you can do it or you can as you're thinking about it and me making the. Where do you feel the discomfort in your body right now? Because that's the little trigger. Notice how you're feeling it here. Right. Just notice those sensations. Right. And as you're noticing the sensations, do with the physiological side. Go one more and notice what you're noticing about how the sensations in your shoulders are changing.
[35:32] B: It's not there.
[35:33] A: Well, they went away.
[35:34] B: Yes.
[35:34] A: Isn't that weird? So do the same thing. Think about him.
[35:38] B: Okay.
[35:38] A: No, it might be one of those moments where you're doing whatever and he like jumps. Right. Now he's got like his arm like around you. Right. And it's like pulling your shoulder and then he's trying to grab the other. Right. And you know, feel the feelings. Got the discomfort?
[35:51] B: No.
[35:52] A: Oh, you're not feeling it now. Isn't that weird?
[35:55] B: It's really crazy how that works. But yes. I. I don't feel it.
[35:59] A: You don't, do you? Right.
[36:00] B: No.
[36:01] A: Because your brain is not confusing similar as identical. They're not the same thing. No. Right. And it was just confusing. It only because it didn't know that thing ended. Isn't that the craziest thing to think? It is like, really that I'm not troubled because of how bad it was. I'm troubled because my brain doesn't know the bad thing ended. But I totally Know the bad thing ended. Oh, right. There's a part of me that didn't know that the bad thing ended. And by the way, that's the part that's beating my heart and causing the internal sensations in me. And now that part's getting it too, that you're okay. Right, Right. So again, as you're thinking about, right. Like you've got different possibilities for places to stay live.
[36:53] B: Yes.
[36:53] A: Right. You're looking. Right. We don't have anything totally formalized, but we do have some assistance that can help with housing.
[37:00] B: Yes. And I do have one house I think might be ego. I think the landlord is going to accept us. I'm hoping. Just found out today. I'm. He's gonna get back with me in a few days, which I. That's kind of a long for me because my patience has not been very good lately.
[37:18] A: Yeah.
[37:18] B: But I mean, he seemed like he. He was okay with it, but I don't know.
[37:26] A: What would he not have been okay with?
[37:30] B: I don't know, it's just, I guess with, you know, going through like the, you know, the third party that's gonna be covering it expenses, so. But he seemed okay with it. I know he could go with someone else and don't have to go through all that. So that's what I've been running into. A lot of. A lot of owners or realtors don't want to. They want something that's guaranteed something that's not, you know, something's a little easier. And the houses seem to go very quickly, so they don't really have that issue.
[38:03] A: Okay.
[38:04] B: I'm trying to sell that or to rent a house.
[38:05] A: Yeah.
[38:06] B: So it's just been kind of stressful. But I didn't. I mean, I felt good about him. He seemed like he would be a good landlord and he seemed like a good person and he wanted to help. So I feel like it. But I'm still a little nervous because we're getting so close.
[38:23] A: Wouldn't that make sense though, to be a little nervous?
[38:27] B: Yes.
[38:28] A: Right. I mean, it's like I had a woman call me and she was really distressed because she was troubled that she got freaked out by a doctor calling her and that she had a UTI and she had no symptoms, so she was really freaked out. Now, opening up the story a little bit more, she went online and thought, well, if I don't have any symptoms, what could a UTI be? Oh, maybe it's bladder cancer. Now why would she go to something like that? Well, I don't know, maybe her mom died of bladder cancer. And it came up shockingly because it came on quick and they didn't know. So if you go to the doctor and you don't think there's anything wrong with you and the doctor tells you that you have a uti, wouldn't the normal thing, given that your mom died of bladder cancer and it's kind of in the same area for you to have a little more angst about that? That's not an unusual thing. It would be really unusual if. If you didn't. Do you follow me with that? So you being a little nervous. Right. A little anxious about, like, I want to get this so that it's formalized so that we can do it. That makes a lot of sense.
[39:33] B: Yes.
[39:34] A: Right, right. As long as it's not something that's paralyzing. Right. If it's anxiousness in such a way that I can't. I'm not mobile and I can't move, that's where it's a problem.
[39:43] B: Okay.
[39:44] A: Makes sense. But that's not what I'm hearing.
[39:46] B: No. I felt like. I felt like that, you know, at certain days, but I'm getting better. Yeah. It's just been stressful. Like, before, I couldn't find anything. Like, I was just not getting anything. Today has been a better day. And I found a house that I think. I don't know. I just have a good feeling about it, and I haven't had that feeling.
[40:08] A: Oh, good.
[40:09] B: I've looked at so many houses and spoke to so many people, and every time I had left with a bad feeling.
[40:16] A: No. Well, that's why you haven't had one yet.
[40:18] B: And I haven't had it with this one.
[40:19] A: Huh. Isn't that good?
[40:21] B: So I just. I don't know. I feel good with this one, but I. I'm still worried because we're getting so close, and it's just scares me a little bit, especially having, you know, two little kids.
[40:36] A: Right. So that would make sense, though. Yeah. And do we have contingency plans?
[40:42] B: Yes.
[40:44] A: Like, if we're not able to find a place, what we can do for.
[40:47] B: The short term, I have a bunch of different.
[40:49] A: You do? Okay. See, there you go.
[40:50] B: Not great, but I do. I'm gonna reach out to the lawyer and their lawyer and see if they can give us more time.
[40:57] A: Okay.
[40:58] B: I think maybe if it's like a week or something, maybe so they don't have to go through court and all that. I don't know. Because they're not being very good. Good. To us. And they've been very strict, if they would even do that. But I don't think it hurts to try, so that's what I'm gonna do. And then I meant we have other ideas. I mean, if worse comes to worse, we'll go into, like, a shelter or something. Until then, it's not the idea. Yeah, but it's. And then we put stuff in storage, and then until we can find a house, something temporary. Yeah, but I, I, I always like to have, like, backup plans because it makes me feel, like, safer, makes me feel better. So I have different, you know, plans in place. And I'm constantly looking into other houses for backups, too, in case this one falls through. There's another house that I'm gonna look at just to have a backup, because I, it just makes me feel better. I have to have a bunch of backups. Like, I have to have, like, bunch of plans because I feel. I just feel more secured.
[42:00] A: Right, so you're looking at the landscape of what's coming, and you're preparing to the best of your ability. Yes, that makes sense.
[42:10] B: Yes.
[42:10] A: Right. I wouldn't look at it as just backup plans. You're preparing. Right. I'd like. I'm not putting all of my eggs in one basket. Okay, let's hope. Sorry, kids. We got nothing. I didn't do anything more. Right. What you're doing is we're going for what we want. Right. If I don't get what I want, I'm looking at other things that I can do, and they're level, like, okay, maybe we could stay here. If we can't do that, maybe we go to there. Maybe we'll do this and put stuff like, you're looking at. How will we handle based on. And the levels of it?
[42:45] B: Okay.
[42:46] A: That's all useful. That's what we would want somebody to do in the situation that you're in. Okay, so really good. For sure.
[42:55] B: Yes.
[42:56] A: Yeah. Yeah. Okay, cool. So think of it again. You know, your boy, who might, like, run behind you and, like, jump, you know, now he's got his hands, like, here, and maybe part of it's around the neck a little. What do you notice?
[43:09] B: It's not bothering me anymore. I'm not feeling that. Yes. It's really crazy, but yes.
[43:19] A: Yeah. It's not happening. No. That's the difference. Right. And notice how quick that went.
[43:27] B: Yes. And that was what my nightmare was about, too. It's always. My nightmares are always about the choking, so.
[43:34] A: Yeah, well, they won't run the same way Anymore.
[43:36] B: I don't think so.
[43:37] A: No, they can't. Right. Once it's got exposed, it loses its power. It's like film. When we used to care about how many photos we took because you had to pay for the film and you had to pay to get it developed. Like, it costs money right now. People are just like shots. Right? So. But you had to do that. If you opened up the back of a camera when it's sunny outside, you've exposed the film to the light. And when you've exposed the film, it ruins it. So once things get exposed and they're brought in the light and you actually see it for what it was and you've got the whole context. Oh, right. That was a frozen moment. Oh, right. There's other things that I. We changed the ending. Okay, good. Now it can't see it only frozen in that way anymore. Right. That's where that idea of what I said to you guys the other time. It's Santa Claus. Once we all know that the dude's not real, we can't go back to believing him. Right. We pretend for our children, but we can't think. Okay, I hope Santa brings his gifts. I'm gonna write my list too. I'll drop it off at Macy's. And we got nothing. Huh? Well, geez, I thought I was better. Right. Because we know that that's not real. Once your brain gets its data, it can't go back to reading. It still is happening. Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing?
[44:56] B: Yes.
[44:57] A: Yeah. Yeah. So then. Right. So is there going to be. Do you. So let me back up. You say June, there's going to be. We're having to go to trial.
[45:12] B: Yes. I don't know that, like, exact date. I just know the second.
[45:16] A: Like a mediation or trial.
[45:19] B: Trial. They're going to. I just talked to my advocate today, so I don't have a whole lot of information. I don't know exactly how it works.
[45:26] A: Sure.
[45:26] B: But she just told me that on the 2nd of June.
[45:31] A: Okay.
[45:31] B: The. We will know that a date. It'll be within that week or the next week.
[45:35] A: Okay.
[45:35] B: Of the trial. And she said that they will pick the jury that day. The second. And she said it will be about a week. Cases like that are a week. I thought it's gonna be like a day and be over. But I guess it's a week or more. Which. But she said I'll be testifying, I guess, first.
[45:57] A: Okay.
[45:58] B: And get that away. Get that taken care of. So that's good.
[46:01] A: And that will Be you will be testifying because there's a prosecutor and he's going to have a defense attorney. Is that kind of how that works?
[46:08] B: Yes.
[46:08] A: And have you had any conversations with the prosecutor?
[46:12] B: Yes.
[46:12] A: Okay, so you're familiar with who they are?
[46:15] B: Oh, yes. This case has been going on for a year and a half, so.
[46:19] A: Okay. And so they're probably going to prep you by sharing with you these are the questions that I'm going to ask you.
[46:25] B: Yes, he will do that because he's done it before a couple times. We've had court hearings and we've had the deposition and, you know, he didn't know the questions for that one. We never, you know, he doesn't know what the lawyer is going to ask. But he had me watch, like, the ring videos. There's, like, a lot of evidence, and in this case. So he had me look at pictures and the ring cameras and he had me listen to the 911 call. And that was really hard. But that was a long. That was a long time ago. That was like a year ago since then. But I had to listen to all of that. I had to look at all of that pictures. They, like, I took pictures on my phone, but they were nothing like what they had. The way my face looked like I was unrecognizable.
[47:21] A: Yeah.
[47:24] B: So I. I know he'll prep me and get me ready. And that makes me feel better, too, because when I feel prepared, I feel better, more confident.
[47:32] A: Right.
[47:33] B: So it's just.
[47:36] A: Yeah, yeah. So we want you to feel more prepared.
[47:42] B: Yes.
[47:42] A: In you. More settled and confident.
[47:47] B: Yes.
[47:48] A: Right. Because all you're doing is sharing your recollection of what happened. Isn't that what they're asking you?
[47:57] B: Yes.
[47:59] A: Asking you to speculate on things. They're asking you what was your experience, what happened.
[48:06] B: Yeah, they asked me what happened. Sometimes they. His lawyers asked me questions. Like, what is he expecting? Like, he just throws out questions that. Yeah, it kind of just throws me off. And that's kind of what I'm worried about, too.
[48:20] A: What might be a question that would be something that would have thrown you off?
[48:26] B: Well, just questions I wasn't expecting. Like one question, for example, which I think I answered it really well. I did really well on it. I just wasn't expecting it.
[48:37] A: And.
[48:37] B: But he was just asking about, like, the sex toys and stuff, and it was stuff that he bought, and I explained that that was all him. Yeah, he bought that. I don't think he was expecting that answer, but he just kind of threw it at Me, I wasn't expecting it. But there are other questions. Like, he asked, like, he didn't get right to the question. Kind of asked, like, little questions. Like, he asked me, like, how do you put it? I don't remember exactly how he asked it, but he just. I remember he asked, like, little tiny questions, and I didn't really know where he was going, so he would ask me, like, you know, do you always park your car up front? Why do you not park it in the garage? I, like. I don't know why this is relevant. You know, it just was weird. And it kind of, like, made me feel kind of like, why are you asking these questions? He kept asking, is there stuff in the garage? Can you not park a car in the garage? And, like, constantly questions like that. And I said, no, I can. I just don't like to. I, like, just easier for me with the kids to park up front. And he's like, well, is there somebody else's car in there? And then that's when I realized, okay, he's. He thinks I have a boyfriend, or he's trying to go that angle. And he kept. And then finally he got to it. Do you have a boyfriend? Is someone else living in the house? And. But it just kind of, like, just threw me off.
[50:06] A: Yes. I would definitely want to bring another guy in right after that had happened to me.
[50:12] B: I know.
[50:13] A: Are you effing kidding me?
[50:15] B: It got worse. He has a lot of, like, sensitive stuff that I wasn't expecting.
[50:22] A: Okay.
[50:22] B: And like, stuff like. Like, why are you even asking it?
[50:25] A: Yeah.
[50:26] B: And he had a lot of guns in the house and stuff like that. And he asked about that, and where are they now? And I'm like, I got rid of them. I don't like guns. I got rid of them. And it was just like. He just kept asking about a bunch of things that I didn't really feel like was relevant and that really. I didn't. I feel like we were sensitive, and I didn't want him to know. Like, it wasn't really his business, and it was just really, like, hard for me. And.
[50:56] A: And the prosecutor wasn't interrupting, going, no. For relevance or.
[51:01] B: But he did say he would try to make sure that doesn't take, like, they. That he doesn't ask that during trial.
[51:09] A: Because he asked all of that during the deposition.
[51:11] B: He kind of, like, the way that. The way the state attorney said it is that he kind of played all his cards. He kind of just laid it out there. The. His. So Jeff's lawyer, he just lost his wife right after, like, right before the depositions. And so the state attorney thinks he just wasn't doing his best. And he wasn't. Like, his mind just wasn't there.
[51:37] A: Yeah, sure. Jeez.
[51:38] B: But he still was really coming at me. But it was just. It was the stuff that was really unexpected that really got me.
[51:50] A: Okay.
[51:50] B: And I know you're gonna be, like, digging into my past, I'm sure, and things that are harder for me to talk about, which I want to.
[51:57] A: I wonder whether they're gonna be harder for you to talk about. Really.
[51:59] B: There's nothing. There's really nothing. When I think about it, there's nothing bad. It's not like there's nothing. Nothing there. But to me, it's like, you know, I was. Like. I talked about it before, like, last time, you know, I was in another. Another abusive relationship. And really, that's okay. Not a big deal. But when I'm talking about it, when. When it's brought up in questions. Well, you were in this before or anything like that. It kind of like. I don't know. It just makes me feel like something's wrong with me, and it just kind of. I don't know.
[52:31] A: Well, there was definitely something off with the picker.
[52:33] B: Yes. And I understand that now, and I understand why.
[52:38] A: You do, don't you?
[52:39] B: I do. Because, you know, I. I know a lot of that comes down to my childhood, and it comes down to my. My stepdad, and I understand it. And I don't think I would ever get into a position like that again. My eyes are really open. Especially this last time. I.
[52:53] A: That. And you've done the healing. Because it's not the consciousness that puts me in the situations. It's what unconscious does. Unconscious goes for what's familiar. Even if what's familiar was awful. Do you follow me with that?
[53:09] B: And I think that's one reason why I got into this relationship, because it was also familiar. You know, he took my phone away. Well, that was very similar to what my stepdad did.
[53:17] A: That's right.
[53:18] B: And he was very controlling. And so it was my stepdad.
[53:21] A: Yeah.
[53:22] B: And I wasn't allowed to drive. Well, you know, a lot of it's a. Same as I grew up.
[53:27] A: Yeah.
[53:27] B: And I know that it's. It's a lot of. It's because it was familiar to me. And I didn't. I. I thought it was normal. And not only that, but I felt like I couldn't do any better. Like this, you know, I can't do any better than that. Like this there's no one else that's going to love me for who I am.
[53:45] A: How about now?
[53:46] B: Well, I feel a lot better. I mean, I wouldn't say I'm completely there, but I feel a lot better. I've come a long ways this year and a half.
[53:53] A: Yeah. You're getting your own worth.
[53:55] B: Yes.
[53:56] A: Like that you're worth it to you.
[53:57] B: Yes.
[53:59] A: Right. That's where the problem had been.
[54:02] B: Yes.
[54:03] A: Right. I didn't feel like I was worth it. I was attracting people who didn't treat me like I was worth it.
[54:10] B: Yes. And I was willing to go through all that because it was normal to me. It was like, okay, no big deal. And looking at it now, I'm like, how in the world did I go through all of that for so many years? But to me, it was so normal.
[54:26] A: Right. It was what was familiar.
[54:29] B: Yes.
[54:29] A: Yeah. Now you're seeing it clearly.
[54:32] B: Yes.
[54:33] A: And those wounds are healing, which means you're not going to be attracting or attracted to the same kind of guy.
[54:42] B: I don't think there's. I don't think the way I would be.
[54:45] A: Right. Like, that's what's different. As the healing happens, I don't send. My body doesn't seem. Send the same kind of pheromones out. Right. Predators. I think I shared this before, but predators get attracted to weakness.
[55:00] B: Yes.
[55:00] A: Sharks smell blood. A predator doesn't go after something that's strong. Right. Just think of how strong you are.
[55:11] B: I think I'm a lot stronger. I still don't feel like I'm there yet, but I'm definitely come a long ways and I'm. I'm setting like boundaries. I'm doing so much better with boundaries.
[55:20] A: How so?
[55:22] B: Well, I just. Just with my family, even just having more boundaries with them and really just standing up for myself. And even like with the house thing, you know, I found a house kind of right away, but there's a lot of red flags. She kept asking more and more and more for more money and like the owe me would probably just want to went through it.
[55:43] A: Sure. Right. And you didn't.
[55:45] B: I said, no, this is not gonna work out. I'm just like. I'm standing up for myself more. I'm setting. I'm just setting more stronger boundaries and I'm just not letting people get into my head as much.
[56:01] A: Isn't that cool?
[56:02] B: Yes. I still feel like I have a long ways to go, but I mean, I definitely see progress.
[56:08] A: Yeah. Well, then you need to turn around and see where you've come from. Because you may seem to think that you've got a long way to go, but just think of where you've come from.
[56:18] B: I never really went that far.
[56:20] A: Right. You haven't been looking backwards. Like, when we're climbing to the top of the mountain, every once in a while we want to. And there's still a ways to go. Every once in a while we want to turn around and go, holy shit, look at how far I have gone.
[56:31] B: I float backwards, but I haven't went any further than this year and a half.
[56:35] A: Right.
[56:35] B: I haven't went that far.
[56:38] A: Yeah.
[56:38] B: So.
[56:39] A: But even think how different you are now than when you first got into the relationship.
[56:44] B: I think I'm a completely different person. Like, I. You get that in so many different ways. Yes.
[56:51] A: Right.
[56:51] B: And I feel stronger. Before, I wouldn't even be able to do this on my own. Raising kids. I be like, I. But I've been doing it, you know, for a year and a half and it's scary and it's.
[57:04] A: And not easy.
[57:05] B: But I don't think that's going to go away. I think that's just part of it.
[57:07] A: Yeah.
[57:10] B: I am just. I'm able to. What am I trying to say? Like, I feel like I can depend on myself more.
[57:16] A: Isn't that cool? That's what I'm talking about.
[57:18] B: I feel more independent. That's what I'm trying to say.
[57:20] A: Right.
[57:21] B: And before I wasn't like that.
[57:24] A: Right. That's why you can't get with the same guy and.
[57:28] B: Yeah.
[57:29] A: Because you can't be controlled in that way. You can be partnered with, but not controlled.
[57:34] B: Yes.
[57:35] A: That's the difference. So you won't be attracting or attracted to that kind of guy.
[57:41] B: I don't think so. I think I would run the other way. I just. Which I am not interested in dating at all.
[57:47] A: Yeah. Well, that's. Again, that's not where you're at right now.
[57:51] B: No.
[57:52] A: Right. You. You have a. This is what there is for me to do.
[57:56] B: My kids are my.
[57:57] A: I got little kids.
[57:58] B: My first. And I just. It's all about my kids right now. All about my kids. They really help me to push forward and do better.
[58:07] A: Yeah. That's awesome. Good for you. Yeah. Yeah. And this is the season that you're in that. It's all about that. And they're in the. Dependent on you.
[58:17] B: Oh, yes.
[58:18] A: Right. And then they become a little more independent and that season changes. And then later you are in the season that I'm in where my life is revolving around whatever activity my kid has. And getting them there and back. That's what my life is now. So I go to the gym in the morning. That's the one thing I do for me. My wife does that at a different time. And then we deal with whatever activity we had. One week with our four basketball games, two away in completely different locations. Tampa, North Rio, and then Punta Gorda. Like, it's. Like, it's the season, though. That's what there is to do, right? Yeah. And that's where your focus is. What do we need to do for us? How has your son been doing? How have things been in therapy? Or how's that been better?
[59:09] B: I mean, I think he is. I mean, I think he is. We started with, what is the pregnancy like? Talking about my pregnancy. And he seemed to be like, he wanted to know more, which. We brought pictures. I brought pictures. And he was like, very, like, just. He wanted to know a lot about it. Even when we got home, he was asking a lot of questions. I've noticed that he's able to talk about his dad a bit more. And even, like, his grandma, who's not in the picture anymore, she just.
[59:44] A: They're the ones that own the house, right?
[59:45] B: Yes. They don't want to have anything to do with them. They haven't seen them in a year. But they just. Which part of that's my fault? Because I had to set some boundaries and kind of push them away unless it was supervised. I said it was okay, just supervised, but I just couldn't be this person supervising while the case was still open.
[60:03] A: Correct.
[60:04] B: They said, no, they're not going to be supervised.
[60:06] A: That's unknown.
[60:07] B: Which I don't think they cared anyways. But I feel like he's been more comfortable in sessions. I'll make note to the fact that we've gotten far from our last session. I think a lot more because you're more regulated. So there was a lot that we couldn't get to. Because tomorrow, talking about dad, the idea of even bringing pictures into treatment was not. It's not possible in that time.
[60:35] A: Yeah.
[60:35] B: And so, yes, we've come a very far way now. We did it. Yeah. Sorry.
[60:39] A: No, no, no.
[60:40] B: Now we do it. Like, I had the pictures of, like, it was like, me and Jeff, and I'm like, it. It's just really weird looking at his picture because it looks like a stranger. Like, he just feels like someone I used to know.
[60:52] A: That's all his neck.
[60:54] B: It doesn't feel like. It just. It has no meaning, really. Like, when I look at it, the Pictures, I kind of feel like numb to them in a way. Like, I just. Like, they don't bother me.
[61:04] A: Right.
[61:05] B: Just really weird looking at him because it just. He looks. Which I haven't seen in a year and a half. Well, I've seen him, like, I guess in, like, hearings, but I haven't seen him in a long time. But it just. He just feels like a stranger. So. Which is good.
[61:20] A: I guess it is. Yeah.
[61:22] B: But I didn't mean to interrupt you. No, I just wanted to say that you're doing great. I just wanted to point out that the exposure has really helped you. You've come a very far, you know, amount our ways. And I think your son is a reflection of that because we're able to actually talk about dad. We're able to start speaking of the narrative. We're able to look at pictures. You're able to get through that whole session without becoming disrespectful, regulated. And so that direct mirror neuron is where your son is able to stay calm, happy, engaged, alert, and want to know more. So I think a lot of it is back on you. You've been doing great. So he's been doing a lot better. Yes, I think so. I mean, I've seen improvement with him.
[62:04] A: Yeah. Yeah. Well, Mom's okay now.
[62:07] B: Yes.
[62:07] A: Right. Mom wasn't okay for a while, so it wasn't okay for him to be okay.
[62:11] B: Yes. Once we get settled in the house, too, because there's so much stress there and I know he can see it. I know he can feel it. I think once we get settled and things are less stressful, I think it's going to help, too. I think we're going to see a difference. Because my emotions are high and I feel like his are too, because of it. Yeah. Mirror neurons. It makes sense. So I think once we get past that, there's going to be even a.
[62:36] A: Bigger difference and we want to, again, go. Your being stressed is natural and normal and is supposed to be happening when you're going to need to move at the end of the month and you don't have secure place of where you're moving. Okay. If you weren't anxious at all, I'd be like, what the hell is wrong with you?
[62:58] B: Very proactive.
[62:59] A: Do you follow me with that? And as I'm hearing what you've done and the conversations you've had and how you're layering different things. Things in case. In case, like, I'm going, okay, you got this planned in the way that we want.
[63:11] B: Things that's the thing about me. I'm always on top of things. Always. But it's just. It's just a lot. It's just me. It's just me and two kids and it's a lot on my plate. When my plate's already over full. Like it's already.
[63:27] A: Yes. So get the reference point. When you're on top of it, on top of things, how much better does it feel than when the things were here?
[63:39] B: It's gonna be a huge relief. It's gonna be.
[63:41] A: Do you got the difference right? So you are somebody who can manage things by being on top of them. That's where if anything's stressful and it's up here, we need to change the position of it and we need to drop it down there. Change my perceptual position, right. And I liken it sometimes to think of a football stadium, right? And there's a lot of different points of view. You can look at the field, right? We could be at the 50 yard line, right on the field, right. Looking across to the other side. We could be in the end zone looking all the way down the field, right? You could be in a corner up here, right. You could be in the press box, like in the center of the right. You can be on the field, the players. That's a different perspective. You could be a blimp up above the field looking down and seeing all the players. Heck, you can be the field looking up at all the right? So if you change your perceptual position, move it to a different location, your natural thing of being on top of things, your. You're going to feel, okay, I got this. It's when they all get here that I'm not on top of it all.
[64:59] B: And especially with the time, there's a. The time gets shorter. Yes, right.
[65:05] A: And it would make sense. I don't have. But what's even better, this is the really cool part. You went fishing for a house and you caught one and you realize that's not the right house and it's catch and release. Isn't that a good news thing? Yes, till you get to the one that when you get to you like, oh no, this one actually feels congruent with me. So a little nervous because I'm not solid. But it's one that now I'm feeling more congruent with it because I've been.
[65:39] B: Having like this really bad feeling every time I go to a house. And like this, something's not right, something's off. And then I find out later There's. I've had some crazy people. Like there was one man who wanted to move in with us with you.
[65:51] A: Oh, that's fine.
[65:53] B: I supposed to get the whole house and I found out I'm only gonna get half, but the le says I get the whole house.
[65:58] A: We're gonna have a piece of tape down the middle.
[66:01] B: What would the old Natalie do?
[66:03] A: Right?
[66:04] B: I don't even know.
[66:06] A: So really cool. Cuz that's the other part. You are checking and you're checking at a head level, you're checking at a heart level, you're checking at a gut level. That's congruence. Right. This was the first one. Right. And if I'm looking, if I'm going to catch fish and I want a particular fish, all the ones that I get that aren't it because I can't know whether it's going to be the one until I throw the lure in the water and catch something. And then I bring it up.
[66:39] B: I've looked at like 10 houses. I've looked at so many houses, like 10, like a lot. I don't even know. I've lost count. It's up there. And this one's the only one I've actually felt good. It doesn't even have everything I want, but it's just, I don't know, it's just a really good feeling.
[66:56] A: Yeah.
[66:57] B: And I feel like I need to take it. Even the price is better. Everything just. There was just something, I don't know, calming. There's just something that felt like every part of my body was saying, go for this house. Like there's something. So that even though I'm at the downsize a little bit, that's how you.
[67:14] A: Know it's right is when it's in alignment at a head, heart and gut, as you put it. All of my body is saying, go for it. You're in alignment. And what's even better is you had one that you could have, but with the things that you saw, you went, no, not for me. Yes, that's even bigger deal.
[67:42] B: That's why I'm so glad that I have my neighbor go with me everywhere. Because, yeah, there's been some weird people, I bet.
[67:49] A: Yeah. That's an even bigger deal for you because again, that's all out of your being worth it to you. Right. Even though it's a little stressful, I've been willing to wait for the right one.
[68:00] B: Yes.
[68:02] A: And not that there's just a right one, but wait, whatever right one there is. And I can't know whether it's the right one until I actually see it. Right. Good job. I'm super proud of you. You've done great.
[68:20] B: Thank you.
[68:22] A: Yeah. And sleep has been better other than that time that you had nightmare?
[68:26] B: Yes. I still have to take sleep medication. I've tried not taking it a couple of times, and I just can't get to sleep. I don't know what's going on there, but I. With the sleep medication, I'm doing good. No more nightmares. I just had that one.
[68:42] A: Yeah.
[68:43] B: But other than that, I haven't had any more nightmares before. I was having a lot more, but other than that, I don't really know why I'm having sleeping issues. I just feel like there's. I don't know. My mind's always going, what's the medicine? I think it's that. It's quetiapine. I think that's. The quetiapine is a generic, I think.
[69:07] A: Okay.
[69:09] B: And it's been working good for me. It's a low dosage, you know, but it's. It kind of like it makes me sleepy and I just kind of like just go to sleep and I don't feel drowsy when I wake up.
[69:21] A: Beautiful. And that's fine.
[69:22] B: I wish I didn't have to rely on it, but I think especially with everything going on.
[69:26] A: Yeah. So that's the thing that I want.
[69:28] B: To say a lot of this stuff.
[69:29] A: Correct. Right. You've gone through lots of changes. Now you're doing another one. Right. Because moving new how that's a top five stressor in people's lives.
[69:40] B: Yes.
[69:41] A: So it's. Think of it more situationally as things get more settled for you. Settled in the house. Settled with the kids, especially the case.
[69:55] B: I think once I get past.
[69:56] A: But you can re Evaluate then. But useful for right now because sleep is one of those things that the better regulated it is, the better emotionally. I am Right. If we don't get enough sleep, our emotional regulation does. Big waves from excitement to distress, but it's big.
[70:18] B: I feel like I'm getting sleep. Probably not as enough, but I feel like that's probably as good as it's gonna get.
[70:23] A: Well, you got two little kids. Yes. Good luck.
[70:29] B: Yeah.
[70:30] A: Yeah. Cool. All right. Any other stuff for you for now?
[70:34] B: I don't think so.
[70:36] A: Okay.
[70:36] B: That's pretty much it. Yeah. Do you remember those are the two things I had as a mental. No. Was that your nightmare had really caused distress and that you were getting re. Triggered by Jeffrey grabbing you. Yes. So other than that, she really hasn't reported any, any symptoms of severity and she's fully functioning. Very proactive, very resourceful, always sets the bar. Super hyper for herself. So I'm always trying to acknowledge that that's an issue, but I'm, I'm working on it. No, you're very engaged, you're active, you're doing great. I, I tend to do that a lot, but I'm getting back.
[71:07] A: Set the bar high.
[71:09] B: Oh, yes.
[71:09] A: There's. Okay.
[71:10] B: Yes.
[71:10] A: Are you down on yourself if you don't get it?
[71:12] B: Not as much as I used to.
[71:14] A: See, that's the better part. It's not a problem to set the bar high because we want to strive. If I don't make it, I don't want to be kicking myself.
[71:21] B: I don't do that as much anymore. She's really helped me with that. Like, I've come a long ways with that. I still set the bar high at times and she has to.
[71:28] A: Setting the bar is fine.
[71:29] B: We focus on the TA DA's, not the TO do's. Exactly. And that's what I've been focusing on. And I, I feel like even, Even if I don't get like a lot of stuff done, I do so much in a day, Right. I do a lot. Especially with, you know, the kids and I. I'm accomplishing so much already that even if I don't get anything that I wanted to do on that list, I'm okay with it.
[71:52] A: Right.
[71:53] B: Because I'm doing so much. Going to appointments, taking the kids, you know, getting their lunches. You know, it's. It's a lot. You're managing a household and yes. Without a partnership. Yes, you're doing a lot. And it's really hard. Especially with my. Look, the kids are so small and they depend on me so much, they can't do anything. Like, I can't. My son can even go to the bathroom by himself. Like he wants me there. I have to still dress him and I still have to, like, I have to do something.
[72:24] A: You're in survival mode. First five years of a kid's life, survival mode. Mode.
[72:28] B: We both are. I have littles too.
[72:31] A: You do? How old are yours?
[72:32] B: Two and four.
[72:33] A: Oh boy. Yeah. You're in survival mode. Right. If you have another one, it starts over for another five years. So we got to a four year old and had a newborn. What happened?
[72:43] B: Yeah, that's not gonna happen.
[72:45] A: Right. So. But that's the thing. You're in survival mode. When you're in survival mode, you're doing everything you can to keep your own head above water.
[72:51] B: And I feel like that. I feel like I'm. That's what you need the swan, right? The sweet one looks great above water. And then below they're just. I feel like I'm just. And I feel like that even when I'm dropping off my son at school. Of course I. Every time I feel like it's the same thing every day. I'm in line to drop them off, I'm in line to pick them up and then I go get my daughter. And it's like the same thing every day. And I'm doing this.
[73:14] A: It's Groundhog Day.
[73:15] B: I feel like I'm just surviving like I'm doing It's.
[73:18] A: But that's what. That's what it is.
[73:20] B: Over and over again.
[73:21] A: This time time with little children because it is because you are. They're so dependent. You have to feed them, change them, bathe them, clean them, get them places, do things for them. You're constantly picking up after.
[73:33] B: Oh and handle big feelings all day. It's so exhausting. And my two year old. Two year old. Sorry. Is she's starting to show a lot of like big emotions now and now with my son. And it's just so. It's hard and it's so stressful and there are times where I just want to go in the room and scream on top of my lungs. I've done that. It just gets so hard and it's just me. And that's where it really comes down to. I don't have really anybody else.
[74:07] A: 45 minutes of every hour you can devote to them. 15 minutes. Go do something for you. Get out. Go yell.
[74:15] B: It's kind of hard when they follow me.
[74:17] A: They do follow you all.
[74:18] B: My son, my daughter can kind of do her own thing. She's really good. Like she can go play and. But my son, he's so afraid I'm gonna leave him. And he has to know where I'm at. I have to keep the doors open, like the bedroom doors. He has to be able to see me and I have to. Like when I have to do laundry in the garage, I have to bring him with me because he is terrified that I'm gonna leave him. And I can't get past that. I can't. Like I've tried, you know, telling Mommy's always comes back. I'm gonna. You know, I'm right here. I might go anywhere letting him know and it doesn't really change anything. And just he's really like clingy like, he really has to be, like, on me and, like, touching me. And it just gets really hard to able to get anything done. And I'm just really having a hard time with it. I don't have. It's not like I have anybody else to, like, hey, can you help out and give me some time? It doesn't. I don't have that. So all I have is, like, school when he goes to school.
[75:21] A: Right.
[75:21] B: That's like, my time. Yeah, but it's not my window to, like, take a break. It's my window. Go get groceries, get something to food ready or.
[75:31] A: But in those moments, the differences. You're only managing you, right. When you have the children, you're constantly having to manage them when they're in school. The reprieve isn't, oh, I've got breaks and I just kick back and have bonpons, but I'm only managing me. It's way easier for me to be in the grocery store than me and the two of them. It is terrible. Like, I'm in there for way longer. I could have been in and out in like, 25 minutes. And it's an hour and a half, and we're still. Look, okay.
[76:11] B: There'S tantrums. They want to get out. They can't stay irrigate where they're restless, and it's just. Yeah, he's funny. My son will go, let's get the cookies first. Okay. Now let's go get the crackers by the soup. He knows, like, every little snack you get, I'm like, oh, geez.
[76:25] A: Yeah, it's much easier to go without them. So that's what I mean by the reprieve isn't that I'm not doing, but I'm only managing me. I'm going when I want to go, and I'm walking when I want to walk.
[76:38] B: That's what I do when they're at school. I take care of everything that I don't want to do when they're correct at home. So all the errands. But it takes up my time, and I'm just. That's all I'm doing.
[76:49] A: Yes, but remember the errand you're doing and then mind is having. You're only having to manage you in that moment, and you're doing that. So all of those things are done so that you don't have to do those things while trying to manage them at the same time. You're doing those things because it makes it way harder. Right. Like, I mean, that's the issue. Right. My Wife and I, we would, like, go different directions. You got them. I'll go here. This thing. Well, you are having to do all of that in the condensed time of when they're in a location, Right?
[77:26] B: Yeah. I just never really thought about it like that.
[77:29] A: Yeah. And in those moments, you're only having to manage you. And you're a lot easier to manage you. For you.
[77:36] B: Yes.
[77:37] A: Than trying to manage them too.
[77:38] B: So much more quiet.
[77:39] A: Right. I gotta get them out of the car seat. I gotta get him thing.
[77:42] B: It's so much work.
[77:43] A: Little kids. No, really work.
[77:46] B: It's. I mean, you know, it's just taking them. They can't put themselves in the car seats yet. And it's just. It's so exhausting.
[77:53] A: Uhhuh. All of it is like, I.
[77:55] B: By the end of the day, I just don't want to do anything. I'm like. I'm just tired. Once I go to bed, I'm lying in bed and watching my tv. Sometimes I have a glass of wine.
[78:04] A: Right.
[78:05] B: And I relax because I feel like this is me time.
[78:09] A: Right.
[78:09] B: This is me time. I don't have to worry about any errands. I don't have to worry about the kids. They're asleep. This is me time. So I have that every night. And I don't think I could do it without it.
[78:20] A: That's what it is. That's why you put them to bed. So you have a little bit of.
[78:24] B: And I can't. I think about that, like, all day. I can't wait to get there. It's not that I want the day to end.
[78:29] A: No.
[78:29] B: It's just that I need me time.
[78:31] A: Right, right. Right. And consider part of the time that you're running errands.
[78:36] B: Yes.
[78:37] A: Is I'm only managing me time.
[78:40] B: Okay. I never thought about it like that.
[78:43] A: Right. Because I'm not having to manage.
[78:45] B: I'm getting a lot of messages here.
[78:47] A: We're gonna be done in a sec. You're fine.
[78:56] B: I get it, though. We have to fuel our tank. Yeah. Right? We charge that phone at the end of the night. Battery wakes up at 100.
[79:02] A: Right.
[79:03] B: You gotta do whatever it is to take care of you.
[79:05] A: Yeah, for sure.
[79:14] B: Sorry.
[79:15] A: Hey, you're okay.
[79:16] B: I. I brought my neighbor with me because she wanted to go shopping and. But she's at Goodwill. She's like, in the same parking lot, but she's like. Are you like. Are you okay? Did you forget about me? I just so.
[79:30] A: It didn't forget. Guy talks too much.
[79:34] B: We appreciate you.
[79:35] A: Yeah, my pleasure. Who would have thought, you know, spend a few hours together, you can clear up all that stuff.
[79:43] B: She's, like, nervous. Okay.
[79:46] A: It's okay.
[79:47] B: I didn't know it was gonna happen. You reassured her. Yes.
[79:50] A: We didn't forget you.
[79:51] B: Yes. I mean, she knows I'm right here.
[79:54] A: Yeah.
[79:55] B: Hold on.
[79:57] A: Yeah. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. So who would have thought in a few hours you can take care of a whole bunch of stuff?
[80:03] B: Yeah. I have a lot of errands to do, too.
[80:07] A: Oh, no, I'm talking about emotional stuff.
[80:08] B: Oh, yeah, that too.
[80:10] A: Right, Right. Because you don't feel the same way about any of that stuff that you did.
[80:14] B: No, I don't.
[80:15] A: And it's not hurting like it did.
[80:17] B: No.
[80:17] A: And doesn't cause all that ichant like it did.
[80:19] B: No.
[80:20] A: Right. And you're noticing it, and your boy's noticing it and your therapist is noticing it.
[80:24] B: Yes.
[80:26] A: And probably neighbors.
[80:28] B: Yes.
[80:29] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[80:31] B: Yes.
[80:32] A: All right, well, as we get closer to you having to testify, like, if that's going to be in June, maybe towards the end of May, I know I'm out of town. Like May 30 through June 6, though sometime before then. Let's put something in the calendar.
[80:54] B: Okay.
[80:54] A: So that we get you prepped and ready.
[80:57] B: That would be great. I just know that they're talking about, like, the first or second week of June. We'll know on the 2nd of June exactly when it's going to be. And she said that the state attorney will prepare me, like, a week before.
[81:13] A: Yeah.
[81:14] B: Or something. That's what she said.
[81:15] A: Yeah.
[81:17] B: Just kind of give you an idea.
[81:19] A: Yeah.
[81:20] B: That's all I know. Until it gets, like, a lot closer.
[81:22] A: Yeah, I know. I'm gone the 30th through the 6th. May 30th through June 6th.
[81:30] B: Okay.
[81:30] A: We're doing a trip. Chat GPT and our trip to the Grand Canyon. Wow.
[81:36] B: Cool.
[81:37] A: So we're flying into Las Vegas. Vegas. We're going to a Sparks girls basketball game, and then we're the next day going over the Hoover Dam and then to Grand Canyon west and then to the Grand Canyon south, and then to Sedona and then back to Vegas to watch O. Chat GPT Chat.
[81:57] B: I've only done treatment plans with them, but wow.
[81:59] A: Good to know. I said, family of four want to do these activities. What would you recommend? Time, flight. And it, like, the craziest part is, like, in, you know, 12 seconds, all the information comes out.
[82:14] B: Wow.
[82:15] A: Takes me longer to construct the question than it does for it to come up with. All the information.
[82:18] B: Our jobs are all going to be gone in a few years. AI is taking over. I know, it's scary.
[82:25] A: Yeah. We're in the works of an AI.
[82:27] B: Especially if your phone's on you, then they're learning from you.
[82:29] A: We're in a world.
[82:30] B: They're going to replace you.
[82:31] A: We're in the works of an AI model. The. I've got an organization in India that works with. Basically wants to eradicate child sex trafficking. And in the cities that they're in, currently, they've had a 90% reduction of child sex trafficking, which is amazing. But they have shelter homes and they don't have effective trauma resolution treatment. So I went and presented to them in October and they're like, this is wonderful. We want to do that. That. Let's make an AI model. So they're taking all of my audios of sessions and trainings and being able to convert that into an AI version to be able to help teach and train.
[83:12] B: Wow. Well, I know with the super bowl, that's all I thought about. It's one of the highest trafficking events of the year, so.
[83:20] A: And domestic violence and all those fun things.
[83:22] B: Yeah, yeah.
[83:24] A: Cool. All right. You gotta go get your friend.
[83:27] B: Yes.
[83:27] A: Right. Hopefully she found something cool in Goodwill, probably.
