[00:00] A: Second. All right, so today is February 2nd, Nicole. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful, valuable, it might be made available in teaching and training others. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:12] B: Yes.
[00:13] A: Cool. All right. So. Hi. How did our last session leave you, by the way? What did you notice for yourself?
[00:22] B: I don't remember. I think I was a little angry. I am. During the holidays. I don't remember when. I had a tough time around the holidays.
[00:32] A: Okay.
[00:33] B: It was a lot of forced interaction. I think the holidays are fucking stupid. Just like the. The girls and being in one room with them constantly. And like, I was having a tough time with, you know, Jen, and then now Jen's calmed down some and, like, I can deal with it, but I can't. I have a tough time. Like, I'm kind of. I have a tough time with people who are just like, a lot, all the time. I don't know if it's an attention thing. I just have a tough time sometimes with big personalities. It's too much for me.
[01:09] A: How do you have a tough time with it? Like, what does it do to you? Their big personality causes what over there?
[01:19] B: It's just uncomfortable to watch. It's uncomfortable for them.
[01:23] A: You think they're uncomfortable?
[01:24] B: No.
[01:25] A: Like, for me, you're uncomfortable watching them?
[01:27] B: Yeah, just big personality. I don't know. Maybe it's a trigger. My brother had a big personality and was, like, somewhat abusive and not someone. My brother was pretty abusive towards me. I just. It's too much and I don't like being around people in the holidays and I don't know. I'm doing better, though. I feel like I'm trying. I've. I'm better at letting shit go now. I just see other people getting triggered in, acting out and, like, I'm just like, stay the fuck away from me. And I feel. And then I feel guilty because I'm like, I don't even want that near me because if it gets taken out at me, like, I'm. I'm reacting and I'm in a good place. I'm about to go to school. Balancing my recovery. I'm about to start my fourth step with my sponsor, which I'm.
[02:22] A: School where. What?
[02:24] B: I'm just doing nails.
[02:25] A: Nice. That's great.
[02:26] B: I've been doing, like, art and stuff, and I've been waitressing for a long time off and on and like that. That fast, you know, I call it dinking around or Piddling around. Like, I carry that anxiety into my. Because I've been doing it for 20 years.
[02:46] A: You just need to get your butterflies in formation.
[02:48] B: My butterflies in formation. I want to do art. Art calms me. I can like, be still and like, focused and for me, that. So if I can incorporate that with making money.
[03:02] A: That's a better idea.
[03:03] B: Yeah.
[03:04] A: Yeah, that's the plan. Cool. Okay.
[03:11] B: I got a lot going on, a lot of good stuff. And I'm trying to look at my fourth step is I don't remember a whole lot of stuff. So I'm already like, just gonna kind of do my best.
[03:26] A: Don't remember a whole.
[03:27] B: I just don't remember a whole. Like all my resentments. My life feels like such a freaking blur of things. And I know there's a lot there, but I pushed them. Like, I pushed things.
[03:45] A: Okay.
[03:46] B: Away or down or somewhere, like, to where, you know, for my four step. Like, I know I want to bring them up and I'm not even scared to look at them because, like, I feel like therapy with you has, like, helped, you know, look at things like that. The past was the past.
[04:03] A: And distanced.
[04:04] B: Yeah. Like everyone. Right. Well, everyone's like, your fourth step is everybody dreams on the four step. And you know it's gonna be a doozy or whatever they say, you know, and it's like, well, the reason why you do your four step is for healing. Like, it. It happened, it happened and it's not happening. And like.
[04:24] A: Yeah.
[04:24] B: You know, so.
[04:25] A: Yeah. When you came in here the last time, there was anger.
[04:28] B: Mm.
[04:29] A: Cuz you recognized that. I thought I was choosing to do what I was doing and they kinda coerced me and used manipulation to do what I was doing.
[04:44] B: The end, the game triggered the shit on me.
[04:46] A: Right. And then we did stuff to get that part unplugged. Yeah, Right. We want to get it so that you're having an easier time with big personalities.
[04:56] B: Yeah.
[04:58] A: Right. So it doesn't cause that disruption. You can know and go, hey, maybe it relates back to my brother, who is a big personality and abusive. Right. But the issue, right, and that's where it gets confused. The brain does it. The issue isn't the big personality. The issue is that he was abusive.
[05:19] B: Yeah.
[05:19] A: Right. It's like the person who's got the Aerosmith on their shirt and they raped somebody and the person hates Aerosmith now.
[05:27] B: Yeah.
[05:27] A: But the thing that was bothering them wasn't the name on the shirt. That is not the troubling part of the experience.
[05:33] B: Yeah.
[05:34] A: Right. So Watch. What happens is when we go through those moments, things that are structurally similar or things that co occurred get merged into the problem. Right. So when somebody's being a big personality and it's causing that, you know, discomfort in you. Right. Like if it wasn't doing that anymore and you didn't have that discomfort, like, how would you actually be? Like, what would that be like? Like what would it be like that when somebody's doing that thing, it's not causing this in you just.
[06:15] B: Just flow on life.
[06:17] A: You just flow on life. Right. What's it like when you're in flow?
[06:21] B: Peaceful.
[06:23] A: It is because you're just kind of going along with where you're headed. Yeah, right, right. Have you ever done like the. The tubing down a river? Yeah, but you can certainly direct yourself if you want to, but a lot of the time just kind of like it's taking you where you need to be going. You're in flow.
[06:39] B: Yeah.
[06:39] A: Right. So then we want a you who's much more in flow. And what's a symbol of flow?
[06:48] B: Water.
[06:49] A: Water, like kind of how. What do you see?
[06:52] B: Like a stream.
[06:53] A: Like a stream.
[06:55] B: Like not a river, but like the stream that. Going over the rocks.
[07:00] A: Yeah. Right. And now you think of the stream going over the rocks. And look, I imagine it up above out here. See it? Take a deep breath in and then exhale. Right. Open your eyes. See that stream, the water going over the rocks? Right. Breathing in and exhaling. Right. What do you notice starting to happen in your body?
[07:33] B: Calming down.
[07:35] A: It is calming down. Right. One of the things that you want to be doing while you're doing nails is breathing. Right. And in anything that we do world speeds us up.
[07:47] B: Right.
[07:47] A: And being present, I'm really life. Yeah. So this also quieting. So it's easier for you to be emotionally now. Right? Yeah. So we've got the stream, the water going over the rocks. Right. That's an activator. It's a way to tell your brain, hey, we're organizing towards a me who's more in flow. Right. Who's distanced from that. But seeing it clearly, that's just their thing. Right. Because the issue wasn't the big personality, that isn't the part that's trouble. The part that's troubling was the abuse. But they co occurred so it got merged. Right. I don't like that guy. Why don't I like that guy? Well, because he reminds me of that other guy. What'd that other guy do? Well, he did that other thing that the Other guy. Right. So we can. Got it.
[08:45] B: Yeah. And I do. And I have a resentment towards, like. And we were children, and I understand that we were children, but it's like he was. People laughed and he was praised for being funny. Well, what his version of being funny was being a bully and, like, at the expense of somebody else, whether it was physical or emotional.
[09:05] A: Yeah. So how we get that is we go for a thing, a time, a situation. One thing that happened when he did that kind of stuff and was, you know, clapped for, laughed with, praised about having done. Right. What would be a time he did? What? When you might have been how old?
[09:30] B: I don't know. He was. He was, like, fighting neighborhood kids or like.
[09:37] A: Well, I know. So notice how there's more. Yeah, we want to go. Let's think of just one, because we know that we got lots. We're gonna think of one time it happened when he did something at the expense of somebody else and was rewarded or praised or glorified for having done it. So you're aware what happened. How old. When was that?
[09:59] B: He was making fun of a guy on his baseball team because his last name was Gaylord.
[10:04] A: Yes. Right. So he's like.
[10:05] B: And had everybody laughing at him.
[10:07] A: Everybody at the team. Like, at the. On the team.
[10:10] B: Yeah.
[10:10] A: Right. And he was, like, saying things like, gay. Yeah, right.
[10:15] B: Yeah.
[10:16] A: Lord of the gays or whatever. Gaylord. Whatever it was. Right. So. And then they're all laughing. Right. And the kids, like, uncomfortable.
[10:25] B: Yeah.
[10:25] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[10:27] B: Going up to bat.
[10:28] A: And as he's going up to bat. Right. Good.
[10:30] B: Make him uncomfortable. Just. He's just like that.
[10:33] A: Right. And then he made him uncomfortable. Right. And then that moment ended. He either got a hit or he didn't. Or he got walked. Yeah, Right. And then you guys left the park.
[10:45] B: Yeah.
[10:45] A: Right. And then later on, you did something fun.
[10:48] B: Yeah, Right.
[10:51] A: Like draw or do art or make the queue. Yeah, right. So you got making the cue. Yeah, drawing. We got doing art. We got, you know, leaving the park. We got kid being up to bat. We got him saying stuff gets uncomfortable, that. I'm making fun of the name. We gotta go into the park. Right. And you can remember that he did that in the same way you can remember putting your jumper on. Stop putting on your jumper. Go. I'm not.
[11:17] B: I'm not.
[11:18] A: Right, well, then stop him from doing that. Yeah. So then where is it? Satan no longer exists.
[11:23] B: It no longer exists.
[11:24] A: Right. That's what we want to get in. See, you've been thinking. I'm Trying to realize it from my logical brain that I get it, that he was a kid at the time and that it wasn't totally all of his fault because people constantly rewarded him for being such an asshole, a bully. Right. So it wasn't totally his fault. But like, I can't rationalize and reason that out because I'm not troubled by what he did and who he was then because he did and did those things. That's not why I'm troubled. I'm troubled only because my brain doesn't know that stuff ended. It's over. It no longer exists. It's not about me. It's his crap. Right. My brain doesn't know that it's over when my brain gets that it's over because it's causing feeling in me, which I call like resentment.
[12:08] B: Yeah.
[12:08] A: Residual anger.
[12:09] B: Yeah.
[12:10] A: Trying to motivate me to get him to stop doing that. When you were 7, 9, 12, 15.
[12:14] B: Hurry, hit me in the head with a golf club.
[12:18] A: Right?
[12:19] B: You can remember him doing it. Showing off in front of his friends, right. We're like, dude, that's not even funny.
[12:24] A: Right. So he whacked her in the head and that hurt. And then they laughed.
[12:27] B: I cried.
[12:28] A: You cried. They laughed.
[12:29] B: Yeah.
[12:29] A: Right, right. You can remember him doing that. You can remember putting on your necklace. Yeah, it will stop. Putting on your necklace will stop him from doing that.
[12:38] B: He's not doing that.
[12:39] A: Right. Then where is it? Say it doesn't exist.
[12:42] B: Doesn't exist.
[12:42] A: That's right. That's what we want to get in to. The part of the brain that just doesn't know it ended. Those moments are over. Yeah, Right, Right. Him doing that has to do with stuff, being off with him. Right. And who knows, maybe the reinforcement that went along that changed those neural networks in his brain. Because every experience you go through, on purpose or not, literally causes changes in the physical structure of our brain. Did you know that? Whether it's on purpose or not, every thing that happens causes a physical change in the structure of our brain.
[13:17] B: Like PTSD is what they call like the blackout.
[13:21] A: Cause that, that's one of the things. But like, a friend of the family fell and his head hit and he had a brain bleed. And due to that brain bleed, it's affected his short term recall, so it damaged that part of the brain that fall. But other experiences, somebody says something mean, it's gonna. Right. What it does, my take on is it, is it glitches. That moment freezes. Brain is super sensitive to it and always looks for it. That's why things that are similar can trigger the same.
[13:59] B: Yeah. So it sounds petty, but it really did, like, give you brain. Yeah, yeah, right. Okay.
[14:07] A: So all of those things impact us. That's why even with identical twins, they're gonna have different experiences in life. That's how that works. So their brains are going to be designed differently, even though they've got lots of similarities.
[14:23] B: Interesting.
[14:24] A: Yeah, yeah. So you can remember that he did all that stuff?
[14:29] B: Yeah, Right.
[14:30] A: Well, then stop them from doing that. It's not right. So where is it? Say it doesn't exist. That's right. What do you notice happening to the resentment?
[14:40] B: Disappearing.
[14:42] A: It's disappearing. Isn't that interesting? Right? You not resenting what he did then. Does that in any way, shape or form mean what he did then was okay? Got it right. Him doing that doesn't mean it was okay that he did it. You're being okay now because anger, here's the thing about anger. It's a physical and emotional response to threatening that for all animals. As soon as the threat's gone, anger goes away. Right? Mama bear sees a man poking a stick at bear cub. Mama bear gets pissed. Ferociously, angrily charges man, mauls him. Man's dead. Later on, mama bears not, you know, talking to the other bears, telling them how guilty she feels over killing the guy. She probably should have just scared him off. What are we gonna do with the body? Right? Nor if the guy happened to get away, is mama bear posting signs on trees with his picture. And if you see him, any of the other bears out there, you hold him and wait till I get there so I can rip him to shreds. Mama bear doesn't have resentment. There are no guilty elephants. There are no resentful rhinoceroses. Their brains operate only in now, right? We have resentment because my brain is the past thought is being registered as the current thing. So it's making me feel. My logical brain goes, oh, that's resentment. But it's anger. But it's got to be resentment because it's about something that's over. So I call it resentment. But it's only there, the anger to motivate me to get him to stop doing that. Stop hitting you with a golf club. Stop making fun of that boy. Right? That's why it's been causing you. So where most people go, yeah, fourth step, really, really challenging. Because you're going to confront things. You're going to take things head on. You're going to own and acknowledge. You're going to write, forgive, forget, whatever all the Stuff that goes along with that. But you've already done a lot of the work. Right. Which they might not understand. And so even if there are emotions, what you're going to notice is the emotions aren't as intense, they don't last as long. Right. They don't happen as frequent. You're gonna see it more clearly. And yeah, the sad part was that that sucked that I went through that or that sucked. If that person did that or I feel bad that I did that thing, I feel bad that I did that thing, then I'm not actually feeling bad. Right. Because I'm more present now. I'm actually changing my life for the better. Right, Right. So think about somebody like, you know, with a big personality, you know, like Jen, you know, she might take court, she might be talking, hands are moving, you know, she's posing, you know, try to feel that thing that it does.
[18:07] B: It's not as bad.
[18:08] A: Oh, you got a little bit of it. Good.
[18:11] B: Got the feeling it's just the aggravation. It's. I just, it's, it's, it's aggravation. But I don't think that'll go away. I think we just live with each other, but that's okay. But I get the anger.
[18:27] A: What if it's not Jen? Cause the issue isn't about Jen. What if it's somebody else that's a big personality that's talking really loud, really liking your space. You might be at a meeting, they have big hands, are waving it, they're like, right. All about like, how do you actually want to be? What do you notice as you think about that person doing that now?
[18:48] B: How do, how do what, what do.
[18:51] A: You notice inside just in even thinking about somebody being that way? How's it feeling now?
[18:59] B: Better.
[19:00] A: Like how so what do you notice that's better?
[19:03] B: I'm just not as angry. I'm just irritable though. I just am irritable. I'm just irritable. I'm just ready to go, move on to ELP and like have some space.
[19:14] A: Uh huh.
[19:15] B: I think that's normal though.
[19:18] A: Sure, it's normal. Right, right. The challenge for anybody always we're not gonna get rid of emotions. They're there, they serve purposes. We want them to not be problematic. Meaning if they're more intense, more frequent, they last too long. That's where it's an issue. We're going to have minor ups and downs as we navigate life all the time, as we navigate living with people, as we navigate when new people come in and what it does to change the dynamic of living, and whether that be new people staff or new people residential. Right. When somebody moves their way out, like, all of that impacts everything. Right. So that's going to happen up and down. Right. The question goes for you, and I can't know this. Do you feel the extent, both in intensity, duration, and frequency? Do you feel that that's more than you want it to be? I mean, it's warranted because you're in the situations, but is your level of how it feels in you more than you want it to be?
[20:34] B: Not lately. Not lately.
[20:37] A: Yeah. Cool. That's good.
[20:40] B: Not lately. But I've found coping skills, like when I get triggered or.
[20:48] A: Well, I'd be also thinking that some of the triggers aren't so triggering anymore.
[20:52] B: Yeah. And also, like, I. So what happened was I. She. I got into it with Jen and.
[21:03] A: What did you two get into?
[21:05] B: We got into it about. She just doesn't cling to the. She doesn't clean to my. To my standards, but my standards are Salah standards, which are. Whatever. It was silly, but it was a number of things I realized piling up. And it's like. It's the control piece, too. And it's like, I'm just 37 years old. I'm not used to people telling me what to do, how to do it, and then like, if y'all are gonna check my chore, and I'm living on top of this. She's a slob. I'm sorry. She's not a slob. She's less. Just a little more careless about leaving stuff around, trying to pick my words better. I don't know. And then I. And then me and dad got into it. I was just. There was a point that I was getting into it with everybody because it was one thing or another, and I was. Nothing added up. Like, nothing is. And it's still a thing at the house. But I've had to let it go because it was making me crazy. It is what it is. And I'm here. I'm here and I'm sober. The sun's shining. I'm going to school, doing step work. Everything's fine. It's like I have to, like, be present. And it takes a lot of work to be present. To be present and to not. Will have to be right all the time and to not have to be heard. Like, to be heard, but not have to be right. Because sometimes people aren't gonna understand what I'm saying.
[22:53] A: My mom always would say about that. You have A choice in life, you either get to be right or. Or you get to be happy.
[23:03] B: Yeah, Right.
[23:05] A: Cause you can't be happy when you're being righteous. Because when you're being right, it's not. I'm just being right. I'm being righteous.
[23:12] B: Yeah.
[23:13] A: Right. Which has a connotation of better than yes.
[23:18] B: Yeah.
[23:19] A: Got it. When I'm being right, I also am making the other wrong.
[23:26] B: Right. And then it's like, boom. Like. And then it's competitive, and then I don't want that. You know, I had this epiphany in the shower today. Processing in the shower.
[23:37] A: It's the best place to have epiphanies.
[23:39] B: Yeah. And, like, so when I'm really, like, feeling like, on the inside, I try to make the outside look perfect, you know, I mean, I'm, like, doing my hair. It's gotta be, like, straight. And, like, my makeup's gonna be perfect. Perfect. And, like, you know, all of it. And the more I remember this program I went through, this lady, Amy, she was like, when I first started working here, you couldn't walk out of the house without. And I used to be like this. Like, my hair, my makeup, everything had to be perfect.
[24:14] A: Yeah.
[24:14] B: And, like, if it wasn't, I just didn't feel whole. And she's like, nah, you just walk out. You know, however, you just. You're so much. You just seem more content. And, like, that's how I've been feeling lately is good. More content.
[24:35] A: So, like, more okay in you.
[24:37] B: Yeah.
[24:38] A: When you're more okay in you, you don't have to pick sides so much.
[24:41] B: Yeah.
[24:41] A: You don't have to try to tell somebody something.
[24:44] B: Yeah.
[24:46] A: Like my wife was saying the other day, she said somebody, a friend of hers is taking Ozempic, which my wife knows that she is. Ozempic is the thing that people are losing weight with.
[24:59] B: My dad's taking it.
[25:00] A: But my. But the friend doesn't know that my wife knows because her husband told my wife. I'm not supposed to tell that, first of all. That's a whole telltale anyway. So my wife is upset that, you know, the friend said, oh, I've lost a few bones, blah, blah, blah, but didn't say, like, that she was.
[25:16] B: Yeah.
[25:18] A: My wife was like, well, you know, I think she should just come clean. And I'm like, I don't care. Like, yeah, that. I don't care. Like, that is so, like, who cares whether she tells you or not? Like, it doesn't matter. No. Who cares, right? Care about that.
[25:35] B: Yeah.
[25:36] A: But that's the thing.
[25:38] B: And it's mean. It sounds mean to say, I don't fucking care, but I just don't. Like, why you gotta. There's enough going on that that's.
[25:44] A: Now my attention deficit would get the better of me. Like, I would be with neighbors and we'd be talking and then they'd start. We'd have good conversation and go for a period of time and then my wife would continue talking to them and then they would start talking about things that don't matter. Like what they had to eat three days ago. Like, I don't fucking care. And my attention deficit goes, oh, there's laundry to do. I should probably go put in a load of laundry.
[26:07] B: Yeah, you got that.
[26:09] A: Because that's what happens in my head. My wife will continue the conversation, but I can talk about things that like, matter or real or, or, you know, useful that you can be curious about, but lots of stuff. It's like, who cares?
[26:22] B: Yeah.
[26:22] A: So what? It does not matter.
[26:25] B: Yeah.
[26:28] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:31] B: And I think that's the frustrating thing too, because at the house it's like just constant chat.
[26:39] A: Like, constant, constant things having to matter.
[26:41] B: Well, everybody processes. Everybody has to process out loud. And like, that's cool to process out loud, but like, I would like to process my own thoughts too. Like, I don't want to process my thoughts and your thoughts and like, and you ask and it sounds really cold, but I don't, I don't. I'm feeling like I just got rid of all this, like, weight I'm working. Not weight, like fit, but like weight of thought, you know, thoughts and things. I'm working on clearing all the bullshit out. Like, I don't want to. So now it's like learning that bound that balance of like being a good friend and like not co signing people's bullshit, but like wanting to care. It's just. It's like being honestly, like it being at Salah feels like being reborn because I came from a really unhealthy. Like my parents, we were doing a thing on integrity yesterday. My parents were both liars. We were talking about integrity. My parents both lied. My brother lied. We all lied. It was a survivor. Like, it didn't matter. Who cares? We're all a bunch liars. And like, I understand that it's a bad thing, but like, well, you're not your word. Yeah, right.
[27:58] A: Integrity is being your word. Handshake, agreement.
[28:02] B: Yeah, okay.
[28:03] A: Man of your word, woman of your word. Like, yeah, say you put your word on it. It's like you're signing a contract like this is.
[28:11] B: And it's in, you know, you. That's how you earn respect. Now, my father has grown up a lot, and he is very like, a tie. If he fucks up, hey, I fucked up. Okay. This is what we do. Cool. I respect that. And, like, that's how I try to live my life. Do I. Have I done things that aren't to say look like code or integrity or whatever? Absolutely. I think some of the rules are fucking stupid to my morals. Like, there's certain things that. Like, I might have a couple extra, you know, pairs of shoes than 12. We're only half. We are only allowed so many things. Whatever. But I'm, like, basically learning, like, how to live all over again.
[28:56] A: Yeah.
[28:56] B: And like, be authentic, but also trying to change, too, with what is healthy and, you know, their expect not their expectations, but to. I'm also. I'm trying to grow and change, but also keep my authentic self. You know what I'm saying? Like, whatever. That looks like it's all new.
[29:22] A: Except the whole notion of, like, the authentic self is that there's only one.
[29:27] B: True.
[29:28] A: Because it's different. I'm going to interact differently with people based on who I'm with and what it's about.
[29:35] B: Mm.
[29:36] A: So they're gonna be different expressions of me. So if I'm expressing me this way, does that mean I'm being my authentic self and want to expressing me that way? I'm not. Because I'm different in a session than I am when I'm private with my wife than I am with them with my two daughters, than I am when I'm with my college buddies that I am when I'm out on the golf course?
[29:55] B: Yeah.
[29:57] A: They're all different aspects. But am I more the authentic me when I'm golfing versus when I'm with my kids, versus when I'm with my wife, versus when I'm doing this? Or am I always being the authentic me doing those different things? Got it. Like, I'm not. Not being me when I'm with my college buddies. I'm being me, but I'm being that version of me with them. And there are different versions of me. They're all true expressions of me.
[30:33] B: So then what are you saying? So, like, I have. So, like, you know, okay, so you take away the drugs and the alcohol and then comes, like, the men and the codependency piece too, and, like, wanting to make them happy and keep them around, which is really, like.
[30:51] A: No, no, flip that around.
[30:53] B: Right. So you know what I'm saying? So, like, what do you.
[30:57] A: I don't know what I like.
[30:58] B: I'm learning, like, the things that I like and that make me happy because I was never. I always put my focus on to fixing, shaping, and molding the person. Yeah. So that's another. You know what I mean? Learning what, like, what the. My authentic side is really likes, you know.
[31:25] A: Like, who do you want in a mate? Is that what you're talking about?
[31:30] B: No, like working on, like. Like myself and figuring out, like, what makes me happy and what my opinions are about things I don't know, like learning my morals.
[31:45] A: And so let's say you find out all of that and you've learned it. Now what. What does learning it do for you?
[31:54] B: I'm healed. I've arrived. No, I don't know.
[31:57] A: Isn't that weird? We go, then I get to the place.
[32:00] B: Yeah. When there's no place. It's the journey.
[32:02] A: Yeah. The place we get to is when we're dead in this body. We don't know what happens after that for sure. Not with certainty. There are lots of different thoughts as to what happens to us, but we don't actually know. So you're wanting to figure out those things, but you're thinking figuring out those things will do something for you.
[32:30] B: True. Yeah.
[32:32] A: That's why you're trying to figure them out.
[32:33] B: This doesn't fucking matter. None of this matters.
[32:36] A: Or you just get clear about what's already happened. That's changing for the better. Right. We can create a trajectory. We can get an idea of where we're headed and we can move towards it. Right. That's a great thing to do. Move towards wherever we're headed. Right. So but we can't know ahead of time even if that's the exact place. Yeah, not with pinpoint precision.
[33:11] B: So it's just about learning.
[33:13] A: And so opinions may adjust and change and shift based on new learnings.
[33:20] B: Sure.
[33:21] A: Right. So they're not static state. That's what I want you to get. It's not like when we think of, there's an ending. It's a static state. I'm done. And that's the. The what we got installed when we were children. That life is this thing that I finish kindergarten to first grade to second grade to third grade. I finished first grade. I don't do it again. So we think in our worldly view is, oh, if I do all of these things, then finally I'll get to a place of, yeah, right. People do that with money. Oh, I'M going to do all this stuff and once I finally become a millionaire, that's when I'll be happy. And for a little bit they are, but then they're not anymore.
[34:00] B: Because it wasn't.
[34:02] A: Because it wasn't ever about being the millionaire. Yeah, right. So how do we get to be happy? Well, we notice where we're at, we notice what we're doing. We feel good about the things that we're doing because they're in alignment with what we're up to. So that when we think back about having done it, we are satisfied and having done it the way we did. Yeah, follow me with that. Like that's what we focus more on. We're more outwardly focused. I'm not thinking much about me. I'm intending where I'm going, knowing that I'll go all over the place on my way there. Sometimes it'll be back steps, sometimes it'll be forward, sometimes it'll be this side or that side. It never will be in a straight linear line because that's not how the world works with, you know, non linearity. Right. So it's organizing more towards how do you actually want to be. So the question that you keep posing to yourself is, I'm going to try to figure things out. I'm going to try to understand what are my views, beliefs, morals, boundaries. I think all of that comes natural based in the state that you're in. So this state is a container. Have you ever heard it in the world of like psychedelics or other kinds of things? It's your mindset when you do it and the setting that you're in will dictate the kind of response you have to the right psychedelic. Right. So that's why we can use MDNA and go on a rave and be up until, you know, the next day. Or we can use it and be in a therapeutic setting dealing with our ptsd. With two therapists, the mindset and the setting are going to dictate what the. So the setting, another way to say that is the state that you're in, the state is a container that's going to hold how you think, how you feel and how you act. When we have problems, we're in a problem state. The issue with a problem state is that it's not attached to resources. That's why it's a problem. If the resources were attached to it, it would cease to be a problem. It'd be a problem for a bit and then it'd be worked through. But the reason it stays A problem is that it's a container that holds all of the stuff. When we spend time trying to figure out why I'm in that container.
[36:51] B: We're still in the container.
[36:52] A: Yes.
[36:54] B: Okay.
[36:55] A: There are no solutions in the container. That's why. So instead. Right? Yes. We definitely want you to be more in flow. And just like the stream becomes a symbol to the unconscious, the automatic, preconscious. The part that's dictating most of what's going on. Your brain is responsible for all micro little movements. Right. It's also creating its own narrative because brains, it uses up a lot of energy when we're dealing with uncertainty. So our brain likes to have educated guesses as to what that means or what's going on there, what that's going to be. So I say all of that because it's really. How do you want to be? Right. So one, we know that we want you to be much more emotionally present. Right. We want things to be inside, much more slowed down, because it's fine for the world to go around me really fast and me move slow. It's kind of like holding. Like. Have you ever seen one of the. At a fair, the swings that go around. Right. And the center thing is just moving at a very slow pace. The swings on the outside are flat. Flying.
[38:09] B: Yeah.
[38:09] A: Because this thing doesn't need to move as much to make the things on the outside feel like they're going faster. It's like the whip. I don't have to whip it hard. I just have to get the snap. But that snap is a.
[38:22] B: On the wrist.
[38:24] A: There you go. That was during your dominatrix years.
[38:29] B: Actually, my dad's this morning, I walked past her and just gave a little. She was like, ow. And I like, barely got her.
[38:37] A: Yeah.
[38:37] B: I was like, I'm sorry. I didn't think that went through. I didn't think it was gonna be that bad.
[38:41] A: Yeah.
[38:42] B: But it was right.
[38:44] A: All on the wrist. So it's really. How do you want to be? One, emotionally present. Two, more clear. Three, more in alignment. Meaning that your head, your heart, and your gut are all in alignment towards what you're wanting for you. We want to have ease and more spaciousness, to have more room to deal with other people's stuff.
[39:10] B: Yeah.
[39:11] A: Right. So even if I'm hearing somebody stuff, it's not sticking to me. I'm more like Teflon. So, like, it slides off of me like rainwater on the car.
[39:22] B: Right.
[39:23] A: Makes sense. That's how we're interested in things being. And then we've got a powerful symbol already, which is the stream. And that's where the homework comes in. All you do is you look up and you think stream. And you take a slow breath in, and then you exhale. And as you do, your eyes can remain closed. And then you bring your awareness into your breath and just breathe a little bit slower and deeper in and a little bit longer on the exhale. Right. So that as you're breathing in this way. That's right. Your unconscious is responding towards what the stream symbolizes. Right. This time, take another deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Right. And again, checking your body. How does it feel? Calm. Right. So the homework assignment isn't about trying to figure things out, but it is about a few times during the day, taking five minutes and going through the exercise where I look up and I think, straight water over the rocks. I breathe in, I exhale, I close my eyes. I continue to breathe a little bit slow, slower and deeper. I continue to exhale a little bit longer because the longer I can make my exhale, the more settled, quiet, calmer my body feels so that the world can still go around me. But I'm noticing more space. That's the other part. When you're in the house, we want you to see the people, but we want you to see the space around the people, the space in between the people and the other objects, the space above them. Follow me with that, because the more that your eyes are open, the more naturally you're in a state of flow. Right. And then start to feel good about the things that I'm doing that are on the way to what I want for me in my life. Like, I'm going to be going to school, and I'm going to be learning something that I can be doing sitting down that I can take my time in a reasonable fashion and do, versus.
[41:49] B: Me constantly spinning and multitasking and mentally, like, calculating.
[41:56] A: Right. And that's the other part, what we're gonna do with that process that we're doing. This starts to quiet down so that I have more time of space inside.
[42:12] B: I wonder what that does to your brain.
[42:14] A: And it'll be easier to be present.
[42:16] B: Do you think, from waitressing for so long, like, in your brain being like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding for nine hours a day. It does a toll on you.
[42:25] A: Like, I think it definitely clicks into multitask here, but we've got to be thinking about the rest of life. Like the laundry. I've never really done it. I Can get ahead. I feel really good about it. I don't like getting behind because then if there's a lot of work for it, if I regularly do it, maybe do it once during the week and once on the weekend, it is way more manageable. But it's never stopping. Right. So why people talk about an AIDS every. You know, it's the next moment, it's the next minute, it's the next hour, it's the next day. This is the day that I'm in this dog. Right. Like, because it's an ongoing process. Right. We want to make it easier when. And it's easier when we're more clear.
[43:14] B: Yeah. Right.
[43:17] A: Got it, Got it.
[43:19] B: Yeah. Why do you. I have a question.
[43:23] A: I have answers. Probably.
[43:26] B: Why is it when, like before car accidents or things happen, why does time slow down? Like, why does it look like time slows? Like, why does everything slow down? Is that God or is that my brain?
[43:42] A: No, it is the experience that happens. Time is a left hemisphere construction. Right. So left hemisphere is our intellectual brain. So when we're in a traffic accident or something like that's going on, the more activated part is the emotional part of the brain. That part has no access to time. So things do actually slow down. Right. Time distortion is something somebody could do. Ted Williams, who was a baseball player on a record when it was spinning as fast as it is to play, could read the label. How many people can do that? But he could slow it down enough in his mind. Right? Fighter pilot flying 400 miles an hour, gets out of the plane, gets in his car and starts driving. He's driving down the interstate, 100 miles an hour. Doesn't feel like he's moving. Yeah, he's just driving at 400. That's time distortion. Happens all the time for all different reasons, but it's the distortion of time. I remember I got an accident where I was driving up to St. Pete and the water, it was raining, and I didn't know that my tires were bald. And I went to pass a car and all of a sudden my dynamic traction control went error. And then my car started to spin and I literally floated up above it. And from that lens, I could see the me in the car, my car spinning, Other cars not being close to me. Me kind of going into the median and knocking down a bunch of small trees. And then when the car stopped, I was right back in my body and my heart was pounding.
[45:25] B: Wow.
[45:27] A: Yeah. All that stuff can happen.
[45:31] B: Whoa. Yeah, I believe it.
[45:34] A: Yeah.
[45:35] B: Our brains are power.
[45:36] A: So your job is to think of the stream.
[45:40] B: Think of the stream?
[45:41] A: Yeah. That's the first part of the homework. Like three times a day.
[45:45] B: Okay.
[45:45] A: For about maybe two to five minutes each.
[45:48] B: Two to five minutes?
[45:49] A: Yeah.
[45:50] B: Oh, okay.
[45:51] A: So it doesn't take that long.
[45:54] B: It's a long time for me to sit still.
[45:57] A: You're not. You don't have to sit still. You can walk and think, stream and breathe.
[46:01] B: Okay.
[46:01] A: It's about being more intentional about your breath. And then when you notice that you haven't been being intentional about your breath, go back to being intentional about your breath because your mind, Nicole, is going to wander. That's what happens. Our job is to notice sooner. It's not that the best meditators are the longest term. Meditators don't. Their mind doesn't wander. They notice it sooner. They're able to bring it back quicker. And yes, it will reduce. Doing that process will reduce overall stress over time. Will enhance your brain's response to stuff.
[46:42] B: Enhance my brain's response?
[46:44] A: Yeah. Yeah. Cool. All right, come with me.
[46:48] B: All right. That is.
