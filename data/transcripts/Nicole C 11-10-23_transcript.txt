[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 10th of November, Nicole. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do today is useful, valuable, transformative and life changing, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:18] B: Yes.
[00:19] A: Cool. All right, so when you were in here the last time, you told me a bunch of different things. So I want to check in to make sure that I'm understanding what. What's been problematic for you. So one of the things that you mentioned is that there has been a tendency for you to have more anxiousness in you. So some uneasiness, some jitteriness, some discomfort, some discomfort in certain social situations, some self consciousness, some worries about what others might be thinking that kind of gets elevated. And that's something that's been problematic for you. Right. You mentioned that there have been experiences that have happened. One with like a guy that you had been. Whether a friend, somebody died, like they would eat or something like that, that although those moments are over underneath the surface, they have an effect. Again, not that you think about it every moment of every minute of every hour of every day, but if you do think about it or if something reminds you of it, there's still attached to it. Right. You had mentioned to me that primarily, not that other substances haven't, but primarily drinking has been the thing that's been most problematic because. Because you find yourself doing that and then the rails go off and it's fucked up all sorts of things. Clearly there's been stuff that's happened where you had to do stuff with your body or people do stuff to your body that's gone on. And those are like the big components that I'm remembering in terms of what we talked about out of what I said. Is there anything that I missed?
[01:47] B: No.
[01:48] A: Okay. Any other stuff that kind of surfaces that you think would be useful for me to know, to understand?
[01:56] B: No, not at the top of my head.
[01:59] A: Okay. Well, if other stuff shows up, you can certainly tell me. Okay. So what we started off the last time that we got together is kind of giving you a way of thinking about things that's a little bit unusual. Right. So the lens in life that we look at, the circumstances or the situations or the things tend to be from the lens that that thing makes me feel this way. When that person did that thing, I felt like this. Because I did that, it makes me feel this way, that it's the circumstances that cause the feelings, the stuff, the things. And that lens is not wrong. It just gives us this much power. Because with that lens we have two choices. Change it. We work really hard to change it. Can't change it away from it. Right? Which is most of us are dealing with stuff. But you've already discovered that in life there's some stuff I can't change and other stuff I can't completely, no matter how much I want to fully get away from. And then there's a bunch of bad shit that's happened in life that we can't get the bad stuff to have not happened. So we got to do something else. That's where I get to come in. Because my job is about adjusting. Not up here, but the more emotional, preconscious part of your brain and how it reacts and responds to stuff, current, past, future. So I think I gave you this silly example, but if not, it'll make sense. Lion approaches zebra. Most people say lion makes zebra scared. That makes sense, right? I don't disagree with it. But look at it from a different lens. Because what if it's really when the zebra itself sees, senses, feels, smells, thinks that lion's coming. Isn't it really the zebra's brain, not the lion that's now immediately making all of the zebra alert, motivated and stronger. We call it scared. It does run away. And of course the brain of zebra is doing it to the zebra in response to the lion approaching. But it's the zebras brain. Got it. So from this unusual lens, you are not your brain. You have a brain, but it's not you. So we're gonna say from this unusual lens your brain. And we're talking about brain, body, all the stuff that's not conscious or preconscious. We're gonna say that your brain has been making you feel bad. And by bad we're meaning sometimes the unwanted cravings, urges, desires. Sometimes it's a guilt and shame, sometimes it's a hurt and pain, sometimes the anger, regret, sometimes it's the angst, upset, nervousness. Your brain might do all of it to you. Raciness, all that in response to stuff. Could be, yeah. But you recognize that way of your brain working has been problematic. And this is the issue that's on the table for us to get addressed. And brains are common to error because they're complicated machines with lots of parts. And the more complicated a machine is, the more prone it is to error. Hammers are basic, they work really well. I can fling it across the yard, I Can pick it up and still use it. We don't do that with computers. Make sense. So when we look at it from this lens, that your brain makes you feel bad. First question. Do you really think your brain wants you to feel bad? Bad? No, it doesn't want you to feel bad. Do you think it would want you to feel good? And most people say yes. But what we've discovered in working with thousands of people. You're a bright gal, I'm a pretty bright guy. But most of our brain emotionally works like an animal. And an animal doesn't have feelings because their brain is concerned about their mood or their affect or their level of self esteem or self worth or self confidence. It doesn't cause emotion because their brain is concerned about whether they have a good or a bad day, whether they feel lovable. Right? Their brain causes emotion to motivate them to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. It's really that simple. When a rabbit sees a fox, the brain makes it experience fear. Not because the rabbit's brain wants it to have a bad day, but to make it run really fast away. If the squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire, the brain of the squirrel will immediately make all of the squirrel experience that pain. But not because it wants the squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid idiot for being careless and getting too close to the fire. Now it's marred. All the other squirrels are gonna laugh at me. No, it's really simple. Get the tail out of the fire, right? So the crazy stuff for us to consider is what if all the negative emotions we experience, the hurt, the sadness, the sorrow, the grief, the guilt, the shame, the regret, the anger, the angst, the upset, the worries, the pains, are caused by the part of our brain that works like an animal and for the same purpose, to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. And where the error comes in is that many of the times our brain makes us feel bad. It's trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. Have you ever noticed, you and I, as human beings, we feel bad about the same kinds of things over and over and over again, Right? Good news. Many of the things that we feel bad about are in time periods that are finished.
[07:25] B: What do you mean?
[07:27] A: Meaning we feel bad about shit that's over, that's been over for decades. Many of the things we feel bad about are in time periods that are already finished or time periods that haven't even happened yet. Like somebody coming in, going out. I have like, fear of flying. Well, when are you flying? Three months from now. Okay, well, let's start early. Yeah, like, it would make sense if you have a fear of flying while you're in the plane, to start feeling it. But people feel well before they ever get in the plane. Do you follow me with that? So the problem with our brain is it's causing us to do something to solve a problem that we can't solve, because the problem is either already over or, or hasn't happened yet. So the good news is we don't actually have to solve the problem. We just want to update the timing. See, timing is the biggest error in a human being's brain because we have that other part that an animal is lacking, and that's our intellect. And our intellect gives us access to time.
[08:28] B: So we are reading the book, your brain is a time machine. They talk about that and they say that the survival, like how a deer runs, we do that with our mental.
[08:43] A: Anyways, you're in it, right? So that timing error is not problematic for human beings when experiences are positive or even when they're neutral. Because when they're positive or neutral, our brain distinguishes the difference between the memory data and the experience. For example, somebody tells us about a great trip that they had, let's say to Key West. And when they went down there, it was during lobster season. So they went lobster hunting. They went out on a deep sea fishing, got to see a Florida marlin. They took their picture next to the sign that says 90 miles from Cuba. They went and partied down Duval Street. They went and saw Hemingway's house. They wrote on little mopeds. They tell us about the whole experience. But we know that when they're describing what they did, that they know the difference between remembering, doing it and doing it. That's totally clear. So it's not a problem when it's positive or when it's neutral. It's only problematic when it's negative, whether it's weird, bad, sad, awful, scary, upsetting, horrific, catastrophic, traumatic. When it's negative, our brain will confuse the memory of what happened with the experience. So it lives at a deeper, emotional, preconscious level. Not up here, but inside that. That part of my brain. The memory of what happened, in the experience, of it happening, is identical. So that explains why somebody's telling us about how 12 years ago when they got mugged and the guy came up and whacked them on their kneecaps with a baseball bat and they fell to the ground and kneed him in the face. And as he's telling us about it, all of a sudden his face has gone completely white and his looks and choked up in his arms are trembling and shaking and he's got this tear. We're nice. We were kindly listening to him. What the f is happening with him? And what do most people say? He's reliving it. But what's really going on is part of his brain, that emotional part is confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience. That's why he's having that reaction, which we can tell is affecting him when he was talking to us, because we saw it. But guess what? It was affecting him even over the weekend when he was watching college football with his buddies. It was under the surface up here where the guy's logical and reasonable and rational. He knows that he's safe and with us. He knows he's not getting hit. He knows there's no baseball bat.
[11:32] B: I have a lot of memory. Like, I have a lot of that I don't remember.
[11:37] A: I bet. Like, isn't that a good news thing?
[11:40] B: Yeah. But it's like I'm wondering if I get triggered by things that my friend. You know, I mean, I'm curious as to.
[11:48] A: Yeah.
[11:48] B: How that comes out.
[11:50] A: Yeah. Well, sometimes we don't remember because we weren't there for it. Right. Whether it be I was blacked out and I wasn't there for what was happening to my body or. Or it was something that happened more than one time and I knew I couldn't get it to not happen, that I got taken away from being in my body when it was happening. Right. So it's really common for somebody who's had, like, abuse that happened to them for, like, you know, let's say seven years with one person that they know when it started and they know when it stopped, but they don't have a lot of access to any of the times in between, but they know there were lots.
[12:25] B: Yeah.
[12:26] A: It's because they weren't there in their body when those other moments were going on because their brain took them away. Which is kind of a really cool thing.
[12:37] B: Right.
[12:37] A: So you don't have to consciously know the moments. And it's not even about the content, not so much about what happened. It's about the coding, which is happening versus something that happened. So the error is that the coding of how it got programmed or stuck in the brain is that the brain is still reading. It is happening versus data about something that happened. Make sense. So that's the first component of it, right? It's affecting the person not because of how bad it was, not because what they did was bad or wrong or what the other person did was bad or wrong, but because emotionally their brain never got up updated to learn that that moment ended, that they survived it, that they made it through it, that they're okay. Because in the moment that a troubling experience is happening, there are no future related thoughts, right? Whether it be the rabbit who's running for its life from the fox, there aren't thoughts about the rendezvous plan with a cute buddy the next morning or about how it's going to feast on a carrot in that moment, the only thing in the rabbit's mind is the fox and getting away from it, right? So in the moment that the person is being raped, there aren't thoughts about, you know, taking their kid to the playground tomorrow, not in that moment. Because that's about survival. Follow me with that. So. So that's the first part it gets stuck. Second part that happens with all troubling moments is that our brain attaches meanings to things that happen. And the meaning that gets attached to something that was troubling always has something to do with it being my fault. And that's because when we were little children, we were trained to believe that the good things happen when I'm being good. That's why I get toys, I get presents, I get candy, I get praise, I get love when I'm being good, right? We learn as a young child that good things happen when I'm good. All the TV shows, movies, books, stories show how the good people are getting in the good things and the bad people get the bad things. Which is great if for that person's life, life is always good. But I've never met anybody because the human experience is traumatic. And so the error isn't just that we lied and told kids life is good, it's that the reverse must be true. If it's happening and it's good, it's because I am good. Well, if it's happening and it's bad, it's because I am bad. So it feels like it's my fault. So the 17 year old girl had gone out with her older brother to a high school party. She'd never been to one. She's there, somebody had jello shots, she did a few too many jello shots, she's a little bit wasted. Older brother wanted to stay, but he said, hey, why don't you go home with Mark? He's a good friend of mine. She's known Mark since she was a little girl. Okay. Mark will give me a ride home. She had no idea that when Mark was driving her home, he took her to this other place, secluded, and then forced himself upon her and then said, nobody's going to believe you anyway. And nobody's shocked when she blames herself for being so stupid and careless and should have never drank, shouldn't have done that Cello shot that that experience was somehow her fault. Was it her fault? No. But that's what gets stuck to all things that are negative. Parents get divorced. The kid doesn't go, oh, well, dad not being here is because of a mom and dad. Ish. You know, the kid feels, if I was more lovable, my. That's the second thing that gets installed. Does that make sense? So all of those things continue to stay active. So with all negative moments, what's slanted is somehow it had something to do with me. I put myself in that situation. I should have known better. I let it happen. All those words are all words of me to blame. Got it. So once those two things are stuck, that's why our brain does the third thing. And that is it scans through our environment looking for anything that's similar. The problem is that similar is red is identical. So the soldier dies on the ground when the firework bursts in the air. Not because he doesn't know it's the 4th of July and that he was at a firework celebration. It's because, at a different level, his emotional brain confused the sound and thought it was the mortar, the grenade. Right. The guy's making out with the gal. He's into her, she's into him. It's feeling really good. They're totally wanting it, wanting it together. And she touches his inner thigh. And he does this. And now he's going, what the fuck is wrong with me? The girl who I'm into is touching me in a way that should feel good. And I did. Yeah, but is there any similarity to his uncle when he was 10?
[17:45] B: Sure.
[17:45] A: It's a hand. Yeah, but that was a man hand. This is a female. Yeah. It doesn't matter. It's a hand. Anything similar gets confused. There's a certain scent, there's a certain time of day, There's a certain time of year, There's a certain facial expression. There's a name on a T shirt that is the same name on the T shirt that the person who raped me in the park was wearing. And now I'm panicky, even though I know that that's my sister's boyfriend and he's not a threat. So all of those things get stuck. And our brain will constantly be vigilant, scanning, searching, looking for anything that's similar and react to it. But the reaction is always way more intense than the situation needed. Because I'm not dealing just with this situation. I'm dealing with all the past similars mapped into it. Which is why the reaction is higher. That makes sense. Any questions about those pieces you're following me, you're tracking. It's making sense to you.
[18:53] B: Yeah.
[18:53] A: Right. So the one common denominator that those three components have is that they're all based in distortion. Meaning if I take my hand and I slam into the. I can pick it up and it leaves an imprint. But is the imprint that my hand left in the sand the same thing as my hand? Is the meaning at all what happened? Is the what meaning at all what happened? Did she put herself in danger or get a ride home with her brother's friend? Mark? Right. Was it her fault? So the meaning isn't what happened. She wasn't being vulnerable or reckless or careless. She simply got a ride home with her brother's best friend. How different is a firework from a grenade? Right. So the problem with therapy is that it's not the right tool to heal emotional wounds. It's the right tool for a lot of things, but not for emotions. Because therapy thought I buried and repressed it. I locked it behind closed doors, which isn't true. What we all learned how to do with the things that make us feel bad is figure out ways to not think about it. Primarily because if I think about it, I feel bad and I don't want to feel bad.
[20:18] B: Yeah, that's what I was talking about. Like the deer, we run from it and we figure out how to not right.
[20:24] A: The problem is that we can't always not think about it. The problem is that sometimes we think about it at times that we don't want and we get triggered by it. So instead of having to process it and get the bad feelings out of us, it's literally reverse. The reverse is getting the good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know the negative experience stopped. It's about getting the good news in that the negative experience wasn't my fault. The it's about unplugging the memory so the brain can experience what happened as data. Data about an undesirable thing that happened, but is very different than happening.
[21:05] B: Yeah.
[21:07] A: Make sense. So it's not about getting the feelings out. It's about getting the good news in.
[21:13] B: So is this like an energy flow thing?
[21:15] A: Certainly. Energy flows. Attention. Energy flows where attention goes. Right. But it's really more of an inside out approach instead of like a top down approach would be therapy. I need to understand and then I'll feel different. But let's think of an example. Let's say this guy whose uncle did stuff to him, he's done 20 years of therapy. So started in his teen years and then left it and then came back to it. Now he's like 35. So he's done 20 years of therapy. He knows that what his uncle did to him was not his fault. Like, he totally knows that. Yeah, right. He knows that some of what uncle did was pleasurable, but not pleasurable because he wanted it. Not pleasurable because he's gay, but pleasurable because the body part touched in that way is designed to feel good. So it might not even have been pleasurable. It just felt good. Got it. And so for a long time that was confusing. But he knows, like, oh, right. Body parts such in certain ways are designed to feel good. That's it. He has done the intellectual work of forgiving uncle for having been sick and having done that stuff. You would think after all that work, knowing he would feel different inside. But why inside does he still feel some of the guilt, the shame? Because his emotional brain doesn't know that what uncle did stopped. So it doesn't matter what I know where I'm logical, if I don't know it, where I'm emotional, it ever gets in. If a rabbit is in here and a fox is out there and the rabbit sees it, there's nothing we can do to convince the rabbit that it's safe inside. So if the brain emotionally still thinks the awful event is happening, there's nothing that I can tell myself to have me believe that it's not. Got it?
[23:20] B: Yes. Yeah, I'm picturing it, but yes.
[23:23] A: Right. Like that's part of where the error is, is that the brain, if I know it, it doesn't mean that I feel it. Right, right. Because lots of people can know better but not feel different inside. So what we're going to be doing is we're going to be changing things for you, Nicole, at a feeling level and then what, you know, easily integrates.
[23:43] B: Okay.
[23:44] A: Makes sense.
[23:45] B: Yes.
[23:45] A: So we want to unplug the impact that stuff has had so it's not weighing on you like it was. We want to get it so that you're clear so that it's much easier for you to be clean, clear, sober, meaning harder to get you to drink than it would be to push a locomotive over. Like, that's how rock solid we want you to be in your recovery.
[24:13] B: Yeah.
[24:13] A: Got it.
[24:14] B: Yeah.
[24:14] A: Right. So that then you're doing things, and when you're doing them, you're really feeling good about what you're doing. And when you think back about having done it and having done it in that way, you're really satisfied in the way that you did.
[24:27] B: Myself.
[24:28] A: Got it.
[24:29] B: And other people just living in fear.
[24:31] A: Yeah. So that we lighten the whole load and you're much more at peace, much more comfortable in your own skin. Got it. This is where we're headed, by the way. You don't have to see the future you as clearly as I do. Because my question isn't how it's going to happen that we get you here. My question is, would it be okay with you? Yes. Yeah. Okay, good. So we got a green light. And with the green light, we're already on the way. Because in order to get somewhere, you first need to know where you're going, and then secondarily, you need to know whether it's okay to go there. We got both of those two things, so we're a lot closer. Then we want to go through some processes now that are designed to put your body into the right states for healing. And these processes use levers that neuroscientists discovered put the brain at a state of rest. And the first lever is a silly lever. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. So I don't mean completely like, ah, I mean just a little bit. Right. When you slightly lower your jaw, it activates a nerve in your body called the vagal nerve. And activation of the vagal nerve starts to put the body in parasympathetic response. Cut it. So you slightly lower your jaw, right chest, just like that. Second lever is you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth so your jaw is slightly lowered and you rest your tongue. Third lever is you shift how you breathe so that it becomes more intentional. And as you intend your breath, you make it happen in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper as you inhale, and then a little bit longer as you exhale so your jaw is slightly lowered. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. And now begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and then out just a little bit longer than your inhale. And just continue to breathe in this way. A Little bit slower and deeper as you inhale. A little bit longer as you exhale. And as you're beginning to breathe in this way, just check inside your body. How's your body feeling now? Like more tense or more calm? Yeah. So then the next lever is we're going to move from what we call highly elevated beta waves. When beta waves get highly elevated, that's where all the anxiety, anger, agitation, irritation, frustration lives. Beta normally is what we're in for. Conversation, focus, communication, social interaction and engagement. But it's a problem when it's elevated, because when it's elevated, I'm in that emotional state. It also narrows my vision so it becomes much more tunneled. Got it. We want to move your brain waves down into what we call alpha waves. Alpha waves are what surfers call flow, what athletes think of as being in the zone. So it's alert but relaxed at the same time. And what it enables is that it enables an expanding of our awareness to our peripheral vision so that we can notice more of the space without having to intentionally look so, like more with the sides of our eyes. So how it works is you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You breathe in a little bit slower and deeper out a little bit longer. Right. And as you continue to breathe in this slower and deeper way on the inhale, longer on the exhale, you can look across and see me in my nose. You can see my fingers. As you see my fingers, my fingers move out. As they move out, stay looking at my nose. Got it? As my fingers move all the way out and you're looking at my nose with the sides of your eyes. Pick my fingers. Wiggling. Right. Notice that as you're doing this, you're more aware of space. Like, you can pick up the space towards the side windows and doors. You can sense more of the space between you and me in the space that's beyond me, the space underneath the couch, the space behind you, and even the space above your head all the way towards the ceiling. Right. And as you're starting to notice more of the space, how's your body feeling now? Isn't that interesting?
[29:08] B: Yeah.
[29:09] A: Yeah. Weird too. Yeah, right. Because we normally don't pay any attention to something. Space. Normally, space is the thing we disappear. Right. Because we don't see it because there's no objects. If I were to ask you to tell me what you see in the room, you would talk about the objects, the different pieces of art, the end tables, the lamps, the lights. You would never talk about the space. Right, got it. So that's the next lever we bring in the other part, which is. Have you ever said or maybe heard somebody use the phrase, I'm under a lot of stress? And in order for somebody to be underneath stress, where must the stress be? That a weird question, Right? But in order for me to be underneath something, where does that thing have to be in relationship to me if I'm underneath the over? Yes. Have you ever noticed that stress sometimes feels like a weight on you? A weight on my shoulders. So stress is on top. So the reversal is to get out from under it and to rise up above it. Having a different metaphor, a bird's eye view. What does that metaphor mean? It's a view from above. Right. That I'm able to see everything is being underneath and below me.
[30:44] B: Yeah. Like you're controlling it. It's not controlling you.
[30:47] A: Yeah, well, I'm above and over it. Just like a bird. But not a perched bird. Think of a soaring bird, a flying bird that's able to move freely through the space of the sky. Right. Move around in all directions and in all ways. Got it. That's where we're headed. Before we do that, just out of curiosity, right. Think about something that's been troubling. Think about problematic drinking, or feel a little bit of the discomfort. It's already not really there. Isn't that interesting?
[31:25] B: Weird.
[31:26] A: Yeah, weird and cool. So we're on our way to getting things changed. So the next thing again, you slightly lower your jaw. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper out a little bit longer. Right. As you're breathing in this slower and deeper way. Right. Notice that you can look across and see me in my nose. You can see my fingers. You stay looking at my nose. My fingers move all the way out. You notice them wiggling with the sides of your eyes. You pick up more space towards the windows and doors. Between, beyond, under, behind, above. And notice that as you're aware of the space, that the space actually goes well beyond the room. That space literally goes out in all directions and how unending the space is. All the way to outer space, beyond. And then, just for a moment, close your eyes and imagine with your eyes closed, what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof, so that as you do, you rise up above it all, having this bird's eye view. You're able to see everything is being underneath and below you because you're above, you're over it. And just like the bird, free to soar and fly and glide and move all around in all ways, in all different directions. You soar, you fly, you glide, you move, you're free. Big wide turns, arching angles as you curve and soar and fly above and over it all the expanse of the space in all directions. That's right. Bring your awareness back down into your body to reassociate inside you. And then when you're ready, take a nice slow and deep breath in. And now exhale and open your eyes. Eyes. Good job. Those short moments eyes were closed, what were you noticing within yourself?
[33:50] B: How cool birds are. Not about myself. I wasn't here. I left.
[33:56] A: You did.
[33:56] B: It was an out of body experience.
[33:58] A: It was. How's your body feeling now?
[34:01] B: Relaxed.
[34:02] A: It is relaxed, Right. So we're organizing towards the future you becoming more okay in you. And see, one of the things that we know is that sometimes unwanted stuff has happened to our bodies. Whether it be unwanted sexual stuff, unwanted physical stuff. But we've all got lots of different things that have happened along the way. So I'm going to give you another different way of thinking about that. So most of the time when people explain stuff, they talk about how I am my body, that my body is me. But what if you have a body and that your body is totally yours, but we know that it's not you? I say that because my mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident. When people visit her or see her now, or she goes to somebody's house, they don't say to her, hey Susie, I'm glad almost all of you could come over. She's all there, even though that part of her body missing, right? So you have a body, your body's yours, but it isn't actually you. You also think thoughts. But what if you're not the thinker of your thoughts? What if your brain is the thinker of your thoughts? And what if you're not your brain? What if you have one? Meaning your brain is yours. But isn't you weird, right?
[35:23] B: Yeah. Am I conscious?
[35:26] A: Well, let's check it out. So if we know that you're not your body, and we know that you're not your brain or your thoughts, then people go, well, I must be my feelings. Except you feel different ways at different times, so you can't possibly be a feeling, right? Well, then I must be what I do. But you've done different things. And when you stop doing that thing to do this thing and Then you went and did that thing. You didn't stop existing. So the weird question becomes, if you're not your thoughts or your feelings, if you're not your body, if you're not what you do, then what the heck are you? Weird. So let's, for our purposes today, just say something different. Think of a time when you were outdoors in nature and you see something that's beautiful. Like the moment you're looking at it, it's captured you your like in the wow of it. Like, what is it that you see?
[36:22] B: I'm so stuck on the birds. Yeah, stuck on the eagles. We have these bald eagles that fly over the house a lot.
[36:30] A: Isn't there a moment that as you're seeing the bald eagle in flight, that you're feeling both a sense of awe, wonder, excitement, peace? And some people would tell you, well, of course the eagles are dropping those feelings into you. But if we looked at it a different way, we could say that being there and experiencing it, it's not the eagle. But what happened is your awareness was drawn in and down towards your center. Because what if, Nicole, at your center, you always are peaceful and excited. Kind of like, you know, two of us are in here. How do you know that? You look around and your senses bring in data and your data. Intellect organizes and sometimes people call knowledge light. So let's call that the light of knowledge at your center. It's a brighter light, light of wisdom. Right? So we've got the light of knowledge, we've got the light of wisdom. And you know, I work with all sorts of people, have had awful stuff happen to them. I remember this one girl I worked with, this was probably a decade now ago, she had an older brother and her older brother's friend used to take Matchbox cars and drive them up her leg race and then try to park them in her. So she had a lot of uck around that. And as we worked together, we cleared out all the discomfort gone. And so I had to ask her the question. I go, you know all that. I go, where was it? And she looks at me, she's got this glowing smile, she's lit up. And she goes, it's gone. I don't feel any of it anymore. I go, I know, isn't that cool? And she's like, totally. I go, but that wasn't my question. She goes, well, then what was it? I go, right, where was it? And we started thinking. I go, was it a surface level thing? And she's like, no, it wasn't intellectual. I said, maybe it was hiding in your center. And she's like, really?
[38:25] B: Yeah.
[38:25] A: How could that survive in light where I'm peaceful and excited? And I went, huh? Well, then where was it? And this is what she told me. She goes, oh, I know where it was. It was hiding in the shadows. The distortion between the lights. I said, what happened? She goes, the lights, they're touching. I said, whoa, that's pretty cool. And then we started talking about the whole thing about how people mess up their body. They think with identity that they think that how they feel and what they do is who they are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm upset, and you go, why are you so upset? I go, well, you never believe what the jerk did to me. And you go, well, what did he do? I said, well, the first thing he did is he, you know, had me get into this chair. As soon as I sat down, my head is immediately going down, my feet are coming up. And you go, well, of course you're at the dentist. And I go, yeah. Well, then the next thing he did is he took this light and he kind of positioned it right into my eyes. I'm blinded. I can't see a darn thing. And you're like, yeah, you're at the dentist. And then I say, I go, well, then he took this cold metal instrument and shoved it inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness. And you're what? And I go, my mouth. I'm at the freaking dentist. Which is the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother and friend, when you were little, they messed with your stuff. And she said, they did. And for a long time, it fucked up my thinking, and for a long time it screwed up my feelings. And then she looked at me with that same glowing smile, and she goes, but you know what? They never touched me. They mess with my body, but they never got me.
[40:13] B: Oh, that's beautiful.
[40:14] A: And I went, whoa. And so what if, when you see the eagle soaring, that it's not the eagle that's giving you the feelings, but your awareness is drawn in so that you start to experience the capital S self. In the same way, if I'm at the campfire and I'm cold and I take my hands and I move them towards the flames, and I say to you, oh, my goodness, this fire is getting a lot hotter, you would look at me and go, the fire is not getting any hotter. You are becoming much more aware of the heat. So we know that in your life, through stressors and situations and Obstacles and concerns and other stuff. There have been lots of times where you're awareness has been anywhere but at your center. But no matter where your awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited.
[41:12] B: I love that I reached that point when I. And I feel like such a dork sometimes because I feel a lot different than A lot than most people in the program, but legit. I will go sit outside in the sun and just. I call it sun gazing, but it really fucking like takes everything out from like all the chaos. And then I just look at the sun and it's like everything else goes away.
[41:37] A: Yeah.
[41:38] B: And it's like, I'm not trying to get a tan. Like I already got. No, I just. It's like. It's a meditation that I do and I just fucking stare at the sun. And it's like it brings me back to me, my. My thoughts. Because, like, I don't think about anything. It's like just. It centers. It centers.
[41:58] A: Right.
[41:58] B: And that's like a form that I've been using that I think helps too.
[42:02] A: Yeah. Which is fantastic. Right. So we're interested in you in a more ongoing way, connecting to who you really are. Delight at your center, where there's an ongoing, always happening, calm, peaceful and easy, flowing energy. That's you. Right. So one more time, you slightly lower your jaw. You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth and you breathe in a little bit slower and out a little bit longer. Right. And as you begin to breathe in this way, your awareness can expand and you'll notice more space. You'll know what happens when you close your eyes. That's right, that with your eyes closed, you could float up and out of your body and soar and glide like a bird. But you also know that's what's happening in your mind's eye. But what you see is no longer me and what's out in front of you with your eyes closed. What you see is simply the backs of your eyelids. When I look at the backs of my eyelids, there's often different hues of colors, darker or lighter. You can go ahead and open your eyes and you'll notice that as you do, you see me and you see what's out in front of you. And when you close your eyes again, you'll notice that you no longer see me or what's in front of you. But what you actually and really see is just the backs of your eyelids. And what might be interesting is without using your memory or without using your imagination, what do you really see behind you. What do you actually see behind you? And seeing the core? Oh, it might surprise you that what you actually see behind you is nothing. You see nothing behind you. And what's it like to drift back into nothing, being in nothing. That's right, because in nothing, everything exists as a potentiality. In nothing, we're all about healing, rewiring, repairing faulty programming that God installed in you that have had you act and react, think and feel in ways that haven't been best for you. And because your unconscious knows how to heal itself, we're just gonna make a request that your unconscious begin to travel back on its own without you, into the warehouse of the experiences that have happened, to begin to grab, group and categorize different moments of things that happened that were negative that would be useful to bring to your awareness that as they are cleared, moves us more towards the you becoming present, light, free, peaceful, clear, doing the things that make sense so that as you do, you feel good, satisfied, and doing it in that way. This is where we're organizing towards in your unconscious nose. What would be useful to bring to your awareness so that as you begin to bring your awareness back out of nothing and into now, you can float up and out and see everything from that bird's eye view, above and over it all on your way to becoming more free, to be even that much more okay in you, peaceful, clear, present, light. All of this is engineering inside of you now as you rest. That's right. And you don't even have to know everything that's happening to begin to realize that something's happening on the inside. Your unconscious is healing because when planting seeds in the soil, we know once we planted those seeds, covered them with nice topsoil, watering that area, that something's begun underneath the surface, that so much goes on below conscious awareness before you're ever fully aware of the changes and how those seedlings grow. Right? You can bring awareness back down and into your body to reassociate to the light at the center that is you. And then when you're ready, take a big deep breath in, a nice long exhale, and then one more big deep breath in. And then as you exhale, allow your eyes to open. There we go. Good job. Right, and how's your body feeling now? Relax it is. And as your body's relaxed, staying even more relaxed, your unconscious is going to travel you back down that timeline where it's already categorized and grouped certain experiences that would be useful to bring to your awareness for us to clear. So as you And I are organizing towards the future. You. The other than consciousness part travels back down narrow pinpoints and brings to your awareness a particular moment that would be useful to clear. One of those ones that when you think about it, it feels bad. Yeah, that one. Right. That one happened about how long ago?
[49:10] B: I don't even know my time.
[49:12] A: Well, you might have been how old?
[49:13] B: This was like maybe a year ago. Two years ago?
[49:16] A: Uh huh. The feelings that come up are feelings of. What is it? Hurt, sadness, sorrow, grief, Anger, Resentment. Regret. Guilt. Shame. Sadness. Combination.
[49:31] B: Fear.
[49:32] A: Fear.
[49:33] B: Yeah, I must get trafficked.
[49:36] A: Fear.
[49:36] B: Yeah, fear.
[49:37] A: So would it be okay to get the fear gone? Yeah, it would. And if the fear is gone, would it in any way, shape or form mean what happened was okay? Right. You get to be okay even if that wasn't. Got it. So how we clear something simple only requires one thing from you. Do you want to know what it is? Intend to be with me here right now.
[50:01] B: Okay.
[50:01] A: You want to intend to be with me because this is what's happening.
[50:05] B: Got it.
[50:06] A: Two, we're working on a mutual worthwhile goal that we both want for you. Three, Being with me is more fun, hopefully, than a sucky moment. Right. So you're gonna intend to be with me. Got it. Two, you're gonna tell me just facts about what happened. So that happened. That happened, that happened, that happened, that happened. That was done. Three, if that happened, you know, a year plus, go. There have been many things you've done after that moment that were more enjoyable than that moment. What's one thing, anytime from them that happened till yesterday?
[50:35] B: Eating cheesecake.
[50:36] A: Eating cheesecake. Way more enjoyable than that. Good. Something else?
[50:39] B: Going to the beach.
[50:40] A: Yeah, going to the beach. And one other thing.
[50:41] B: Dancing.
[50:42] A: Dancing, Right. So we got dancing, we got going to the beach, got eating cheesecake. All of those moments happen after that. There's a part of your brain as that was going on that doesn't know any moment beyond it. So we have good news to get in. Yeah. So when that moment happened, about a year plus ago, when it happened, you were aware, like where were you?
[51:01] B: Where I was in Ocala.
[51:03] A: So you're in ocala. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[51:05] B: Daytime.
[51:05] A: Daytime. And you're wearing ocala, like at a hotel, at a bar, at a restaurant.
[51:10] B: I was walking or I met some guy and partied with them and then.
[51:15] A: So there was a guy that you'd met and then you had been partied with him. Then you're partying with him. Him. Right, right. And then where'd you Guys go.
[51:21] B: I don't know. I was just driving around. We were. He was. He was doing math and.
[51:25] A: Right. So he was doing math. Right. And you were driving.
[51:27] B: No, I was riding along.
[51:28] A: So you're riding along as he was doing meth. Driving.
[51:30] B: Yeah.
[51:31] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[51:33] B: I don't know. He shoved meth up my ass and, like, literally.
[51:37] A: Yeah. So you put meth up your back.
[51:39] B: Where you kissed, and then he just, like, put it right somewhere.
[51:44] A: Right. Good. And then he, like, took.
[51:45] B: You run away. I end up running away. And it was a whole setup thing.
[51:49] A: Right. So he took you somewhere. Right. And then you got to that place.
[51:53] B: Yeah.
[51:53] A: Right. And then there were other people there. And then you, like, ran.
[51:56] B: Like, people that we had met.
[51:58] A: Yes.
[51:58] B: Walking towards me and this whole van, like, waiting.
[52:01] A: Right. Good job. Right. Good. And then you saw that, and then you ran. Yeah. Right. And then what happened next? So then you ran.
[52:07] B: And then I hid at a church.
[52:09] A: And then you ran into a church, and then you hid. Right. And then what happened?
[52:12] B: And then the cop came.
[52:14] A: You called the cops. Right. And then the cop came to the church. Right. Good job. Good detail on what happened next.
[52:19] B: And then my mom came to pick me up.
[52:21] A: And then mom got you.
[52:22] B: Yeah.
[52:22] A: Right. And then that moment ended.
[52:23] B: Yeah.
[52:24] A: And then later on, you did something more fun, like eat cheesecake or go to the beach.
[52:29] B: Yeah.
[52:29] A: Or dance.
[52:30] B: Yeah.
[52:30] A: Now, notice as you were telling me about it, there was some discomfort.
[52:33] B: Yeah.
[52:34] A: Less. Because you were intending to be with me.
[52:36] B: Yeah.
[52:36] A: Right. Because your brain is beginning to read it as data. Now, what's crazy about our brains is we never go backwards with memory. We only go forward. But when you go backwards, it literally unplugs it and takes away the charge. So we're gonna go backwards. So we got. You were dancing. Right. You're at the beach, you're having some cheesecake. Right. And then you'd gone back to Mom's house, and then mom had gotten you. Right. And then the police called mom, and then the police were there. And then you had called the police, and then you ran into church, and then you saw that group of people. Right. And then you had gotten driven there. And then each of the Mets off as you kissed, and then you were driving around, and then before that, you guys had been partying and seen other people. And then before that, you were off doing whatever you're doing now as I go through it backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it? I know. Isn't that weird?
[53:25] B: Yeah.
[53:25] A: Right? It's because your brain is beginning to read it as data about something that happened. Not happening. I know. Third, emotional brain doesn't get logic, but it does get patterns of association. And the error is that the memory and the experience are glued. But there are things that you can remember doing today that you know you're not doing. Like, for example, putting your jumper on. You can remember doing it. You can remember where you were when you did it. Right? But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your clothes on, and I went, nicole, stop putting on your jumper. You'd be like, I'm not. Because you know, there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually doing it. You can remember combing your hair. But if I said, do you remember combing your hair? And then I said, well, stop combing your hair, you'd be like, I'm not combing my hair again. Because you know that there's a difference between the memory and the experience. If I said, you will then stop me from putting on my shirt, you'd go, you're not putting on your shirt. Got it. So you can remember him doing that, shoving the math, taking to those people. You can remember that happening. You can also remember putting your clothes on. Nicole, stop putting on your clothes. Say, I'm not putting on my clothes. Say that. Well, then stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then you stop combing your hair. Say, I'm not combing my hair. Well, then stop him from taking to those people. Say, he's not doing that.
[54:51] B: He's not.
[54:52] A: Well, then stop it from happening. It's not happening. Yeah, so then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. As that starts to get in, what do you notice happening to those feelings?
[55:04] B: It no longer exists.
[55:06] A: Yeah, but what happens to the feelings?
[55:08] B: It's calmer and calmer.
[55:09] A: It is, isn't it? Right, that earlier you wasn't sure she was going to be okay. Right? In the moment that she pulled up and then saw those people and start, she wasn't sure she was gonna be okay. Got it. What do we know? You're okay. You are, right? That's what we know. By the way, that guy doing that, did that have anything to do with you?
[55:33] B: No.
[55:33] A: No. Had to do with whatever screwed up with him, right? Because would it have mattered there was you or some other girl in the car with him? Isn't that what he would have done?
[55:42] B: Yeah.
[55:42] A: Got it.
[55:43] B: Mm.
[55:44] A: But you didn't know that then. Right.
[55:47] B: I didn't really care at the time either. I didn't think.
[55:53] A: Well, no, you didn't really care. You cared where he took you.
[55:58] B: Yeah.
[56:00] A: Right. Meaning you probably wouldn't have gotten in the car if you knew he was gonna go do that.
[56:04] B: No, no, no.
[56:05] A: You just didn't know.
[56:06] B: Yeah.
[56:07] A: Right. Him doing that had nothing to do with you. Had to do with him, whatever was screwed up over there. So there's three things we want to get in. One, that moment is over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists. Two, that you're okay. That you made it through it. That you had a way. Right. We want to get that into the earlier you. Right. So right now, close your eyes. Think back to the earlier you and let her know what you know now. One. That moment's over. Finish. That it no longer exists. That. That happening back then had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off of them. It's not about me. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know that you're here. Let her know about, you know, dancing and eating cheesecake, going to the beach. Let her know that you're okay. And as this earlier you is getting it, what do you notice happening to her face?
[57:03] B: It's like disappearing.
[57:05] A: Yeah. Notice how she's not looking troubled.
[57:10] B: It's like I'm focusing on more of the good.
[57:13] A: Yeah. And it's not just focusing on the good. It's like getting in. That that's over, finished. That I'm okay. That it no longer exists. That's right. Thought I got away. Right. What's happening now? What are you noticing inside?
[57:41] B: Tears.
[57:43] A: Tears of what? I don't know. You don't know? Or they have sadness. Or are they a relief? They are, aren't they? Right? That you had the wherewithal to notice it early enough to get yourself away. Right. I mean, you wouldn't want to actually start to feel good about.
[58:16] B: And now I'm a little angry because, like, nobody believed me.
[58:19] A: Huh. Okay.
[58:20] B: Because I worked. Hot mess. But it doesn't matter.
[58:24] A: And again, I'm safe. Again. If we're going to be a mess, it's always better to be the hot kind than the ugly kind. Right? They didn't believe you because you were tweaking on meth. But did it matter whether they believed you?
[58:52] B: It doesn't matter.
[58:54] A: No. Did it matter whether the police officer believed you?
[58:59] B: Um. No. No. I'm just glad. I was just really living in fear about them coming to find me.
[59:05] A: Oh, did they?
[59:06] B: No, they didn't see.
[59:08] A: I wonder what it would be like to let the earlier you know that you're okay.
[59:11] B: I'm okay.
[59:12] A: Right, Right. They never found you. You're not even there. You're okay. Right. That it didn't matter whether the police officer believed you or not. He got you to your mom. Right. That you're safe, you're okay. And again, as all of this gets in, what do you notice? Mm. And again, the police officer not believing you. Did that have anything to do with you? No. No. Had to do with him. Cause again, it wouldn't have mattered whether she or some other girl who was tweaking on meth.
[60:04] B: Right.
[60:08] A: Follow me with that. Scared and elevated. Oh. One of those things that go along with Beth is parafuckanoia. Yeah, Right.
[60:18] B: This was a bad guy. He was a bad guy.
[60:21] A: Right. But cops understand that one of the things that go along with meth in staying up so late and not getting any sleep is that it induces paranoia.
[60:33] B: Yeah.
[60:34] A: Right. So that's more what he was thinking than it was actual real. Right. But it didn't matter. Right.
[60:45] B: I wasn't even doing math. He just. Whatever. But.
[60:54] A: You weren't doing meth. But meth got done to you, basically, so you were still at the effect of it.
[61:01] B: Yeah.
[61:01] A: Right. Got it. Yeah. What are you noticing now? Calm.
[61:13] B: I'm present.
[61:14] A: You're calm. You're present. Right. When you think back about that moment, what do you notice?
[61:19] B: It's far away. It's farther away.
[61:22] A: It's farther away too. Oh. It's not even in the same location.
[61:26] B: It's just farther away.
[61:28] A: Try to feel really troubled by it. Scared, fearful. Right, Right. Got it. So the coding is different. Location wise, it's different. It's farther away. But it's also different in that it's no longer reading as happening. Isn't that cool?
[61:48] B: Yeah.
[61:48] A: Yeah. And that's what's starting to change. Things are getting rewired. And see, where are we headed? Your unconscious, whether they make sense to you or not, knows which moments and things have happened in life that would be useful to clear whether you have a full memory of it or not, whether it's just a little blip of it, that part of your brain knows, because that part of your brain is the part that heals all the time on its own.
[62:17] B: Thank you, beautiful brain.
[62:20] A: Right. Like, if I broke my arm, my body knows how to heal it. I'm gonna get it set in a cast so that it heals in the right way, and then the cast is Going to be on there so I. I don't screw up my body's ability to heal it. Well, where are we headed? We're headed towards a Nicole, who's present, who's clear, who's light, who's free, who's much more at peace and okay and comfortable in her own skin, who reads people's stuff as being about them, who's much more centered and grounded, who's guided more by a wisdom on the inside to do the things that are best for her, that make sense, that feel good when she does it. So that when she thinks back about having done it in that way, she's satisfied. This is what we're organizing towards. So just like a surgeon before they cut, we need to have the surgeon know what it's going to look like when they're done. It's the same thing. Then we're using processes that request your unconscious travel back through the timeline. Recent, a long time ago. Ones when you were really little. Ones that may seem small and insignificant now. Ones that have been long time ago that I've never thought about for decades. But because your unconscious knows more than you do, it knows what experiences would be useful to bring into the light so that we can unplug and clear it, two things will happen. One, the energy that was being stuck and used to deal with that will be released. Two, that released energy will be recycled as renew it. A restorative healing energy to reorganize and rewire your brain so that it becomes more optimized to work in the way towards the future. You got it. That's all happening now. Isn't that cool?
[64:14] B: That is really cool.
[64:15] A: Yeah. So one more time, you can slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue and breathe a little bit slower and deeper, exhaling a little bit longer than how you inhale. As you're breathing in this way, notice that even with your eyes closed, you can sense more of the space around you and how the space moves beyond the confines of this room, all the way out in every direction. How this space is truly unending. That's right. And how space isn't the thing that separates you from me, but is the thing that connects you to me and everything else. Because it's what's in between and all around. As you're noticing more of the space and your body's becoming much more centered and grounded and light, your unconscious once again will travel back down the timeline of negative experiences. Things that we try to never think about because whenever we have we felt bad and pinpoint another moment an experience to bring to your awareness now for us to clear. And as it comes to mind, you can find your way back with a breath in and eyes are open. Good job. What's coming to mind now?
[65:55] B: I had a boyfriend leave me pregnant. Yeah, he relapsed and we were sober and then he relapsed and then figured out and then he told me to kill it because whatever. So I had an abortion the only time I was ever pregnant. I do think about that a lot. Yeah, like a five year old.
[66:16] A: As you're thinking about that now, what are you noticing inside?
[66:25] B: Like guilt.
[66:27] A: Okay, so first was probably, I don't.
[66:31] B: Know, not so much anger towards him anymore, but like guilt that I had the abortion. Cuz like that was my one. I feel like that might have been my one opportunity to have children.
[66:41] A: You can't anymore?
[66:42] B: I don't know. I'm getting older. I don't know.
[66:45] A: How old are you?
[66:46] B: I'm 37.
[66:47] A: Oh, really old?
[66:49] B: I don't know.
[66:51] A: I mean, wouldn't you want to be healthy and well, because you were really healthy and well then, I mean, you'd gotten clean. Yeah. Right. But there wasn't any relapses after that.
[67:04] B: Yeah.
[67:05] A: Right. So again, first question. Would it be okay for you to be okay even if what you did was right? Because are you better off feeling guilty? Right? Like are people better off with guilt? Is it a performance enhancer? Does it improve what we do? Do we want the field goal kicker as he's lining up for the game winner to feel guilty about missing the one in the third quarter? Got it. Right. So two separate pieces with this. One, we're getting that it's okay to be okay even though what happened wasn't right. Two, this is gonna sound weird, but what if you're not troubled because of what you did? Meaning having had an abortion. Right. What if you're training troubled because intellectually you can conceive of having not done that.
[68:11] B: I can conceive of not.
[68:13] A: Yeah, having had an abortion. Right. And if you hadn't had the abortion, that might be better. Yeah, got it. So because you can think it, your emotional brain which works like an animal, goes, well, if you can think it, that means we can do it. So it causes the bad feeling trying to motivate you to stop having the abortion five plus years ago. Hurry.
[68:42] B: Well, that makes sense.
[68:43] A: The timing is really fucked up though, don't you think? So an animal brain can only conceive, meaning think of doing things that it can actually do if it can't do it, it can't think it. Right? It's why porcupines don't try to build hang gliders to fly. Squirrels aren't figuring out ways to make their smell sweeter, because if they can't do it, they can't even conceive of doing it. Got it? So an animal's brain, the if you can think it, that means we can do it. So think of this guy. A year ago, his brother had died in a motorcycle accident. His brother had asked him to go and he never went. So he's got a lot of guilt and he's actually thinking he's feeling the guilt because he should have gone on the ride. But what if he's not? What if he's feeling the guilt because intellectually he can conceal of having gone on the ride, and if he had, his brother might still be alive and that would be a hell of a lot better. And so because he can think it, his emotional brain goes, well, then do it. Hurry. Go on the ride with your brother a year ago. Quick. What are you waiting for? Can he do it? No. So when our brain gets one of two things. Either A, the experience no longer exists, or B, there's nothing to be done, it stops causing the feeling. You're not feeling bad because of what you did. You're feeling bad because your intellect can conceive of you having not done it and how that might have been better. And because it might have been better, your emotional brain is going, well, then hurry, stop doing it. The timing is fucked up. Got it? So you can remember that happening. You can remember getting pregnant knowing that you are. Knowing that he then relapsed, knowing that in his relapse he said, we gotta. You can remember all that happening, right? You can also remember, you know, putting on your clothes. Nicole, stop putting on your clothes. Say, I'm not putting on my clothes. Well, stop putting on your watch. Say I'm not putting on my watch. Well, stop me from putting on my watch. Say you're not putting on your watch. Well. Well then you stop doing that. Say I'm not doing that. Stop him from telling you to do that. Say he's not doing that. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[71:10] B: No longer exists.
[71:12] A: Got it? That's the first part. Then we're going to do the second part, which is you can conceive of having not done that. So your emotional brain is trying to motivate you to get you to not have the abortion. Hurry. The timing is really fucked up.
[71:26] B: It already Happened.
[71:27] A: Right. So I'm going to simply say to you, well, then stop having the abortion five years ago, quick. And you're gonna say to me, there's nothing to be done. No. Hurry. What are you waiting for? Stop doing that. Five years ago, what are you waiting for? Say there's nothing to be done.
[71:39] B: There's nothing to be done.
[71:40] A: No. Come on, we'll go.
[71:41] B: Stop.
[71:41] A: Come on. Stop doing that. Quick. Say, there's nothing to be done. Yeah, come on, we'll go together. Let's go. Come on, quick. Say there's nothing to be done. Why? Because it no longer exists. The experience no longer exists. Right. That experience no longer exists. There's nothing to be done. Because the experience no longer exists. Right. And that starts to get in. What do you notice?
[72:09] B: It's gone. It's farther away.
[72:12] A: It is. Again, farther away. Right. So the coding's different again. Right. Right. And as you think about it, try to feel really bad, guilty. What are you noticing?
[72:29] B: It's farther away.
[72:30] A: It is. Well, can you get to guilt now? Isn't that interesting? Right, Right. Another cool thing. Right? Right. Because your brain is really interested in working, working in ways that are best for you. It's number one job is beating your heart and breathing for you. So it wants to work in ways that are best.
[73:01] B: Have you ever had anybody not want to get rid of a memory?
[73:04] A: We didn't get rid of a memory, did we?
[73:06] B: Well, I mean, like, wanting to feel the pain. The pain?
[73:13] A: Yeah. Do you know where that happens most? Grief.
[73:17] B: Yeah.
[73:20] A: Do you know why it happens with grief?
[73:22] B: Why?
[73:22] A: Because my pain is proof positive to the world of how much the person means to me. And if I'm not hurting, then somehow, does that mean that they didn't mean what they meant to me? So I had a girl. Her grandfather kind of, like, raised her. So Grandpa was dad, and Grandpa passed away. And she was in a lot of pain. And I asked her that question, would it be okay, like, for you to not be in pain? No. Okay. What do you think Grandpa would want you to be in pain or. No, I actually said to her, I go, oh, so then Grandpa's a sadist. She goes, what do you mean? Grandpa was always interested in you hurting. That's what sadists do. They like to hurt. No, my grandpa never wanted me to be hurting. Right, yeah. Your grandpa actually isn't wanting you to be hurting. Your hurting is out of your love for your grandpa. But your hurting isn't serving him or you. He's not better off knowing that every time you think about him, you're hurting, because every time he thinks about you, he feels love. So we had to deal with that. The conflict of being okay. And what are all of the other ways that she could be loving Grandpa that have nothing to do with her hurting.
[74:44] B: Loving herself, taking care of herself.
[74:47] A: Right. Because doesn't Grandpa want her to be okay? Right. Just like another guy whose buddy. Best friend in the military died, and it could have been him, and he didn't have a family, but this guy did, and he's felt guilty ever since. No, it's not okay to be okay because it somehow excuses what happened to him. No, but if it was reverse and it was you that died, would you want your buddy's life to suck? Would you want him to continue to drown his sorrows thinking that it should have been him and not you? Or would you want his life to work really well in honor of who you are for him? Which is a whole different way of thinking about it. Right. So where people get stuck is frequently when it's grief that my hurting is my badge. The more they mean to me, the more I hurt over the loss.
[75:51] B: I feel like it's fear of, like, forgetting it.
[75:55] A: That would be the end of them.
[75:56] B: You know, fear of forgetting them. And. And, yeah, I guess that's part of it.
[76:06] A: But you don't actually have access to them when you're hurting, because when you are hurting, you have access to the moment of finding out that they died, because that's the one that's there.
[76:27] B: Yeah.
[76:28] A: So I worked with a guy, he was married for 42 years. His wife got ALS, so there was a progressive decline. This was three years after she had passed away. He was already remarried. He was happy with his new wife. His wife who passed away, wanted him to get with somebody else, knew that that would be good with him. Every time he thought about his wife that passed away, he was in emotional wreck, because every time he thought about her, the moment that kept coming up was the moment of him kissing her cold forehead as her body was filled to the hearse. With that moment coming up, Nicole, what was it? Blocking access to the good memories. Yeah. All of the moments she and him experienced through 42 years of marriage. And which, by the way, is there more of that moment, all of the other moments. So with grief, what we want to do is not erase it, but we want to take that moment and put it in context with all the other moments, because what do we really get from people that matter to us that we love? Is it. The stuff is it the trinkets, is it jewelry? Is it the things or is it the experiences? And once you've acquired an experience, can you lose it? I might lose access to it, but I can't actually lose the experience. Right. Nobody can take away me going to Disney for the first time when I was 11. Got it. So I can't lose the experience, I might lose access to it. Can you lose something that you never had? How could you lose it if you never had it? Could you lose something that you never acquired? No. So the question goes, if you can't lose what you've acquired and you can't lose what you don't yet have, then where's the loss? What if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, it's that their body stops. And because they're no longer in need of it, they exit it. We don't pick them up in the same way we used to, but it doesn't mean they're not here. Interesting. Right? Where do they go? Well, here's the thing. Their energy plus matter. Yeah, they might go there because this is where they've never left. I had a woman one time tell me my parents are in my closet. What? She goes, no, not my parents. The remains. What remains of my parents is in the closet. I go, no, that's not what remains of your parents. They're not in your closet. That's what remains of your parents body.
[79:05] B: Right?
[79:06] A: Your parents. And what remains of your parents is not in that box. It's in the experiences that you acquired in being with them. Them that you can't ever lose. What do we want to do? We want to connect and attach person to more of the moments, of the joys, so they have access to more of who the person is for them. Ongoing. Right. Einstein, who was a really smart dude, we know he's really smart because everybody after him was really, really smart. Is called an Einstein. So the dude was brilliant. He said two things. Energy plus matter equals physical existence. The one that we can touch, the one that we can see, smell, hear, taste. But then what became the second law of thermodynamics is energy cannot be destroyed, it transforms. So when people's bodies stop, it's not that they stop, they exit the body. We don't pick them up like we did, but it doesn't mean they're not here. There are radio waves going through this room and neither one of us feel any of them. But we can go to the car and we can turn the radio on and all Of a sudden, play music where the radio waves not there. And we just turn the radio on, and now they're there. Are they here right now? And we don't feel them. I blow a whistle, we don't hear any sound. But the dog is going, is it not making noise? Or is it beyond what we can experience or underneath what we can experience? What we forget as human beings is that our five senses, the way we interact with the world, are limited in its scope, that the range is outside, that we don't always pick up, make sense. And the other part to it is if, you know, we took a glass of ice and we put it out on the patio. And a week goes. Or a day, an hour goes by, and the kid looks, and now the ice is not ice, it's water. And the kid goes, holy shit, somebody stole the ice and replaced it with water. We would tell the kid, stop swearing. But nobody replaced the ice with water. The ice just melted. It went from solid to liquid with the molecule of H2O is the same. And he goes, oh, I get it. We leave the glass of water. A week goes by. Kid comes back and looks there's no water in there. And he goes, holy shit, somebody stole the water. Come on, stop swearing. And then we'd explain to him, no, the water didn't disappear. The water evaporated, which means it moved from liquid state to gas state. But the H2O molecule that makes it up is the same. Our perception of it's completely changed. And he looks at it, he goes, but if I don't see it and I can't feel it, how is it there?
[81:54] B: Beautiful.
[81:55] A: That's beautiful, right? And we go, oh, right. Well, you're in Florida. It's all around you. We put him in the desert in Arizona. We go, you don't feel any of it here, do you? We bring him back to Florida. He gets off the plane, we go see, you feel it. We show him the rain cloud. We capture the water and discovers it's all the same thing. So when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, it's that their bodies stop and they're no longer in need of it. And see, the thing that happens is it's always a shock of having known them the way I did that blocks my access to being in connection with them. Yeah, right. And that's what we want to get unplugged, right, so that you become more okay, right, because who was it? Kai? Kal?
[82:41] B: Yeah, Jerry. It was Jerry. It was a boyfriend. Found him dead. And I just. Like when I found him dead and like he, like I, like you said, like, that was the memory that I.
[82:54] A: Think about was like, right, so we want to have.
[82:57] B: And how I felt, like the feelings like, of being helpless, like, oh my God, like there was nothing I. Like it was done and I couldn't do anything to fix it. And then like, here's all of his stuff and he's not coming home every day at five thirty. Like you what? Like, it was strange. Right.
[83:15] A: And see, he's been doing much better with what happened to his body than you have for a while.
[83:22] B: Yeah.
[83:22] A: Because he's not hurting.
[83:24] B: Yeah.
[83:25] A: He's not in pain, he's not in shock, he's not in trauma.
[83:28] B: And I feel like weird energy. Like, not weird, but I feel like excited energy from something. Like whenever I'm like doing good or I have an aha moment or something happens in my recovery, Like I just picture him like.
[83:43] A: Yeah, because that's the thing he gets sad about. No, the only thing that he gets sad about is some. Right. You sometimes feel sad when you think about him and he's wanting you to feel good.
[83:55] B: Yeah.
[83:56] A: Because he's way excited about things getting better for.
[83:58] B: For you.
[84:00] A: Right. He wants your life to work really well. Right. That's what we want to get cleared.
[84:05] B: Yeah.
[84:06] A: So how did that happen? How did you find him? You're like, that happened about how long ago?
[84:11] B: September 21, 2020.
[84:13] A: All right, so it's 2020, September 21. You're where? So it was daytime, nighttime.
[84:19] B: I had come home at night.
[84:21] A: So you had come home. So you'd been out working, doing whatever.
[84:24] B: I was drinking.
[84:25] A: So you're out drinking, so you're fighting and you guys had had an argument. He stayed home, you left. Right. You got home after midnight.
[84:33] B: It was like 9:00. It wasn't late.
[84:34] A: Oh, you got home at 9. So you got home at 9 and you opened up the door and you walked in.
[84:39] B: I walked in. I opened the door to the house. The dogs had peed everywhere. My heart dropped. Like, I just. It was weird. Like I.
[84:46] A: Right. So the dogs had peed and that was unusual.
[84:48] B: Yeah, like the dog. Because his. The car was home.
[84:51] A: Right.
[84:53] B: He was home.
[84:54] A: Right.
[84:54] B: But the dogs weren't cared, like really good.
[84:57] A: Right. So you walked in, you saw the pee. Right. Then what happened?
[85:01] B: And then I went to knock on the door.
[85:02] A: Yes.
[85:03] B: It was locked.
[85:04] A: Yeah.
[85:04] B: I ran and then I grabbed a butter knife.
[85:08] A: Right, good. Unlocked the door. Right, good.
[85:10] B: And then I came and I saw him on the floor.
[85:13] A: Right. So it's on the floor. Right. Right. You called 91 1. Right. And then what happened? How you doing right now?
[85:19] B: Okay? Yeah, I'm okay. No, but that's weird. Like, I've emotionally gotten, like, okay with it because it's. I've looped it so many times, of course, that I've detached my emotions from it, but it's still visually.
[85:35] A: Watch. So then you called the police and.
[85:39] B: They told me cpr.
[85:41] A: Right.
[85:42] B: I pulled him, laid him out flat.
[85:45] A: Right. Started doing cpr.
[85:47] B: Started doing cpr. I already knew he was like, rigor mortis had set in.
[85:52] A: Rig.
[85:52] B: Mortis had set him. His eyes were light. He was dead. And then I just stopped because I was.
[85:58] A: And then you stopped. Right.
[85:59] B: I just. I, like, already knew it was gone.
[86:01] A: Right. Because he wasn't in his body anymore. That's why it didn't feel the same.
[86:05] B: Yeah, that's right.
[86:07] A: That's why it didn't feel.
[86:08] B: You know, what's up? It's like, oh, my God. Did I just stop? Because, like. Like, no. Like, I knew so.
[86:14] A: Notice how his body didn't. Right. His body didn't feel the same because he was no longer in it. Right. Right. Then you stopped and the police came.
[86:29] B: That's so weird you said that. That's true.
[86:32] A: Yeah, it is, isn't it? Right, right. That's why his body.
[86:38] B: It's not bad. But it was just a weird realization.
[86:41] A: Right. And then what happened next? They came. They looked. They also determined that he wasn't breathing or alive.
[86:47] B: Yeah.
[86:48] A: Right. And then.
[86:49] B: And I ate a bunch of Xanax.
[86:51] A: Yeah.
[86:51] B: A whole bunch of pills and drink.
[86:53] A: Right.
[86:53] B: I don't remember that whole month.
[86:56] A: Right. Well, then that was over.
[86:58] B: Yeah.
[86:59] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like eat cheesecake. Right. We're going to the beach.
[87:12] B: Yeah.
[87:12] A: Right. So we got. Going to the beach. We got eaten. No, we got. Going to the beach. We got eaten. Cheesecake. Right. We got dancing. Right. And then you were numbed out because you had done all the pills and drinking. Right. And then they'd taken the body, and then they pronounced it dead. Right. And then they had gotten there. Right. And then you had stopped because you recognized that he wasn't in his body anymore. And then you'd been trying to do the cpr, and then you turned him over, and then they said, do CPR. And then you called 911, and then you saw him on the ground, and then you got yourself in, and then you grabbed the butter knife, and then you tried the door before that, you saw that pee, and the dogs didn't seem to be taken care of. And then you would open the door. And then before that, you're out. Then before that, you guys had. Then you left. And before that, you're arguing. Then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, I wasn't.
[88:05] B: Farther away.
[88:06] A: Yeah. Isn't that interesting? You can remember it all happening, right? You can remember putting your jumper on. Stop putting on your jumper. Say, I'm not putting on my jumper.
[88:15] B: I'm not putting on my jumper.
[88:18] A: Well, stop finding him like that. Say, I'm not finding him like that.
[88:21] B: I'm not finding him like that.
[88:22] A: Well, then stop that from happening. Oh, it's not happening.
[88:24] B: It's not happening.
[88:25] A: Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[88:28] B: It no longer exists.
[88:29] A: Right. By the way, him doing that, did that have anything to do with you?
[88:33] B: No.
[88:34] A: No. Notice how it felt that way?
[88:36] B: Yeah.
[88:37] A: All right, because we were arguing. Right. Didn't have to do with whatever was going on with him. Right. And how did he die?
[88:45] B: He overdosed.
[88:45] A: He overdosed. Right. Right. So were we thinking he's going, you know what I'm gonna overdose to, you know, because people who overdose. Right. Because he was overdosing. What, Fentanyl? Right. Because that's what they were planning on doing. No.
[89:03] B: I don't know.
[89:04] A: No. When people overdose on fentanyl or heroin or Oxy's, Roxies, whatever, they're not planning on overdosing. Right. They're not going, you know, I hope this one, you know, causes the heart to stop and the blood not to get to the brain. Do you know why they do it?
[89:21] B: I don't get it.
[89:22] A: Oh, they do it to get numb kind of. In the same way somebody eats a whole bunch of Xanax so they don't have to feel.
[89:28] B: Yeah.
[89:32] A: Because what are those? They're all downers. Right. It was better in the designer era of the, you know, late 80s and 90s where it was uppers. It's a whole world of downers.
[89:44] B: I just don't get the fentanyl thing. I never have. Well, right, because that freaking kid's been killing people.
[89:50] A: That's right.
[89:51] B: But it's okay. It is what it is.
[89:53] A: Right? Right. He was just doing that to not out. Right? To not have to feel.
[90:03] B: Yeah.
[90:03] A: Right. Had nothing to do with you. It had to do with what was going on with him. Right. And the thing that he thinks is Sucky is that you had to find him like that. Right. Other than that, he's been doing a lot better with this than you have. Right, right. And he's wanting you to be okay, and he's really wanting your life to work well for you. Right? Right. Yeah. So you can remember all that happening. You can remember putting your clothes on, stop putting on your jumper, saying, I'm not putting on my jumper.
[90:37] B: I'm not putting on my jumper.
[90:38] A: Well, then stop taking off your sandals.
[90:39] B: I'm not putting on my sandals.
[90:41] A: No, I'm not taking them off.
[90:41] B: I mean, I'm not taking them off.
[90:43] A: That's right. We'll stop that from happening, though. It's not happening.
[90:47] B: It's not happening.
[90:48] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[90:50] B: It no longer exists.
[90:51] A: Right, right. So that we have access. What's something that you and Jerry enjoy eating?
[90:57] B: Cheesecake.
[90:59] A: Oh, interesting.
[91:00] B: Tiramisu.
[91:01] A: Tiramisu. I wonder what it would be like to experience, you know, him feeling good as you eat tiramisu because he knows that you like it and he likes it. That's right. Isn't that interesting? Close your eyes. Picture the earlier you just after that happened and letting her know that it's over, that experience no longer exists, that he was no longer in his body, that he's not hurting, that he's okay, that you're okay, that he's excited about your becoming even more okay. And you are beginning to lighten up even more. Present, clear, interested in life, working in even more and more better ways for you. All of this is happening now. That's right. Your unconscious is doing it for you. Beginning to reach, rewire, reorganize and restructure your brain so it becomes more optimized to naturally work in the way that you want it to. That's right. Oh, what's happening now?
[92:07] B: Relieved, I guess.
[92:09] A: Check it out. What do you notice? Because. Check. Is this of, like, real sadness? Is it of sadness or relief?
[92:20] B: No, it's relief.
[92:21] A: It is, isn't it? Isn't that cool? We're always okay with the crying if it's of relief.
[92:26] B: Yeah.
[92:27] A: Yeah. I don't like people to feel bad when they're with me. Right. And notice how it's becoming okay for you to be more okay with what happened. Because you've been thinking at a different level that if I was okay with what happened, that it would mean what happened was okay. If I wasn't hurting him or what happened, then somehow I would forget him or he wouldn't have mattered. And he matters. Right. And you actually get access to more of who he is ongoing now.
[92:59] B: Yes.
[93:00] A: Right.
[93:00] B: That's cool. Like, that's why.
[93:02] A: That's the cool part is you get access to more of who he is. Right. Because the love hasn't stopped. And it's closer right here. It's never left here. Right in the center. Right. That's the whole part. Like, your love for him, strong as it's always ever been, his love for you, strong as it's always ever been. The only difference is that you haven't been feeling his, even though he's been feeling yours. And you haven't been feeling feeling his. Not because it's not here, but because the shock of knowing him the way you used to with what happened has been blocking access. And now that moment is getting put in contact with all the other moments. Like eating tiramisu. Right, Right. What's happening now?
[94:00] B: Huh?
[94:00] A: I said, what's happening now?
[94:04] B: I'm just, like, picturing us being goofy, like kids, like, messing with each other.
[94:10] A: That's right. And as you're picturing it, how's it feeling? Notice how it's not feeling? Sad. Yeah. Right? Isn't that weird?
[94:19] B: Yeah.
[94:20] A: And really cool at the same time.
[94:21] B: Yeah.
[94:22] A: Yeah. That's what we're talking about.
[94:29] B: Thank you.
[94:30] A: That's what we want. More and more of you being okay in you. So that you get to be more directive in how you want your life to go, that your life gets to move in a completely different direction than the trajectory it had been on. And that's why I love that.
[94:54] B: I feel like, the connection. Like, it's so crazy. Like, you take out that one moment and, like, it's.
[95:03] A: I don't know.
[95:04] B: It's really cool.
[95:06] A: Right? It's that it was not accessing.
[95:10] B: Yeah.
[95:11] A: Because I didn't access it before through. That hurt. So couldn't get to it all the other moments. It's why I like to use this ball. Ping pong. Everybody plays ping pong. But this one's different because it's cool. It does this, but if you took your index finger and touched it, it doesn't do anything weird. Right? Just put your index finger. Take your other one over here. Touch mine. Cool.
[95:48] B: I love that.
[95:49] A: Right?
[95:50] B: Yeah.
[95:51] A: Isn't that cool? Because what is it doing? It's demonstrating that we're made up of energy plus matter.
[95:57] B: Demonstrating energy. Yeah.
[95:58] A: And the energy flows when the circuit is connected.
[96:02] B: That is so cool.
[96:05] A: Energy flows where attention goes. We're changing wiring. Right. That's what's happening up top. Neuroplasticity is changing the wiring in your brain.
[96:18] B: Neuroplastic. I picture little hands, like, doing things.
[96:21] A: Yeah.
[96:22] B: When you were talking about that and picturing like. Like little hands, like. Like doing things.
[96:28] A: That's it. Because your brain is an organ that's rhizomatic. So most plants go from root to trunk to branches. Leaves, rhizomatic, or interconnected webs like mushrooms. Might pop there, might pop there.
[96:57] B: Rhizomatic.
[96:58] A: They're interconnected. Yeah.
[96:59] B: Rhizomatic and neuroplasticity.
[97:02] A: Neuroplasticity. Your brain is rhizomatic, meaning there are neural networks that are all interconnected that as we change attention, energy goes with attention. So wherever attention is, energy flows where attention goes.
[97:20] B: And energy flows where attention goes.
[97:23] A: So with the attention happening, we're rewiring how your brain has stuff coded. Notice one of the codings is a location coding, how it's getting further away.
[97:38] B: Neuroplasticity. What was the other word you said that?
[97:41] A: Rhizomatic.
[97:42] B: Rhizomatic.
[97:44] A: R H I, R Z O M.
[97:48] B: A T, I C. Okay, okay, I'm back.
[97:51] A: So the brain is rhizomatic in that it's interconnected through multiplicities. So when we rewire the. It's why. So if I got gangrene, I could cut off that part of my pinky and not affect the rest of my body. That's why we can trim branches of a tree and it doesn't kill the tree. But if a hurricane comes and the taproot of the tree is ripped out of the ground, the tree's dead. Doesn't matter if we plant it again. Where a mushroom is something I could pick from the ground. The crabgrasses, I can rip out that, but it grows all over the place. We could cut out a square of the crabgrass that we have in Florida. Right. We could take it and plant it somewhere else. It'll start growing from everywhere it got cut. It may grow back into the original source that it came from. Or not. So because your brain is rhizomatic, it doesn't matter where we start. It doesn't matter what direction we're going in, because it all constantly is connected. So as we change in neuroplasticity, we're rewiring how your brain has information coded. And we know that the closer it was to you because your brain understand operates this way, the more intense you felt it. The brain was reading it as happening.
[99:09] B: Oh, my gosh.
[99:10] A: This is so the farther away it Got. As you notice, those moments have gotten farther away. I still can remember that it happened, but it's farther away now. It's not in the same location that it used to. My brain is reading it now as data. Yeah, got it.
[99:25] B: Okay.
[99:26] A: And that's what's changing. And that's why all of a sudden I'm feeling different about stuff.
[99:30] B: Okay.
[99:30] A: Stuff that had been bothering me isn't bothering me like it was.
[99:34] B: Okay, I got a picture of myself flying like an eagle.
[99:41] A: No, I mean you can. But see, here's the coolest part. Watch.
[99:46] B: Think about situations backwards.
[99:50] A: Well, right, but here's what you're trying to do. Okay, So I went to dental school and how I remove a cavity is I go into the person's mouth and I do this, this and this. Yes, you're going into somebody else's mouth. You're not going into your own. Your hands don't work the same way, they work this way. And you can do all sorts. Doesn't work quite the same.
[100:13] B: Oh, okay.
[100:14] A: So what, what are we doing? We're changing things so that you don't have to do anything. When you learned how to ride a bicycle, did you have to take notes? Okay, so I put my feet on the pedals and I put my hands on the handlebars and I move my legs in circular fashion. No, no. Once you got the experience of balance, right? Once you got the experience of balance, your brain went, oh, I know how to do this. And then you hopped on a motorcycle and were able to do it. You hopped on a 10 speed. You hopped on the. That you had. Right. When you learned how to tie a pair of sneakers. Okay, let me. Okay, so like bunny rabbit ears, and then I cross one over and then I loop one and then I loop it around and I pull it through. Right. You didn't then have to write it down. Alright, let me remember how to do this. Times tables. Oh, shit. 5 times 5 is 25. 5 times 6 is 35 times 7 is. Those ones, if I don't use them often, I have to refer them because they're intellectual memories. We're doing change in you that's embodied. Embodied means it's changing at an unconscious preconscious body level. Meaning it doesn't require memory. When your brain reads an experience that had been coded as happening as not happening. When it reads an experience that was living as if it's ongoing as something that's over, it can't go back to thinking it's happening. It just doesn't work. That Way so it doesn't require you having to do anything.
[101:49] B: Cool.
[101:51] A: Because where are we changing it? We want to change it at the level because when you start feeling bad or when you get triggered, you didn't say, oh, I'm going into this situation to get triggered. You just found yourself in a situation, then all of a sudden, boom, you were triggered.
[102:06] B: Right.
[102:07] A: You didn't choose to do it. Right.
[102:09] B: And then I'm the asshole for reacting like a bitch.
[102:12] A: So how, if you're not choosing to do it, can you choose to not do it instead? We want to change it at the level that as it happens and presses the button in you. The buttons already been unplugged, so it just doesn't do it to you. Yeah, that's what we're doing. That's why it's automatic. Now you can get the concept of stuff. And. Yes. Is it useful sometimes to be up above things? Yeah. Is it useful to sometimes recount something backwards? Yeah. But the best dentist in the world isn't doing dentistry on himself. He'll go to his friend who's also a dentist.
[103:00] B: Yeah.
[103:03] A: How easy is it for the hairdresser to cut her own hair in the back? I mean, she might be able to do this in a mirror. Like, see it? A lot harder to get to that spot. Right. Looking into a mirror. Looking into a mirror, looking back at the flower. Got it.
[103:24] B: Got it. Are you an alien? Like, how do you know all this stuff?
[103:33] A: I've been doing this since 2006.
[103:35] B: Brilliant.
[103:37] A: I just learned. I just learned what to do. Right. And it's different because, again, remember, therapy, which most people go to, isn't the solution, isn't the right tool, isn't the right thing to do when it comes to unwanted emotions, thoughts and feelings. It's just the wrong tool. Right, Right. I can go to years of physical therapy for my torn acl, but unless I go and get it physically replaced, repaired.
[104:15] B: Right.
[104:16] A: Still going to be a torn acl.
[104:17] B: Right. What is this called? It's not cbt. What is it? What is this? Oh, at the unplugging.
[104:30] A: What is it called?
[104:31] B: Like, what?
[104:32] A: No, I call what I do. Trauma resolution treatment.
[104:36] B: Trauma resolution Treatment.
[104:37] A: That's what I call it.
[104:38] B: Yeah, yeah.
[104:39] A: The. What are we doing? Resolving emotional wounds, healing. So it's a treatment approach versus a therapeutic approach. It's why we get together for a chunk of time and change a bunch of things.
[104:57] B: Yeah.
[104:59] A: Right. So how you doing right now?
[105:02] B: Good.
[105:03] A: Yeah.
[105:03] B: Relieves peace of mind.
[105:05] A: Yeah. Yeah. Is there any stuff that happens, sexual stuff? That happened. Abuse, molestation, rape, yucky, things like that.
[105:16] B: I don't know.
[105:17] A: I don't know.
[105:18] B: Yeah, but the thing is, is I just thought. It doesn't. I don't feel any type of way about it. I don't know. I'm still deciphering.
[105:27] A: Oh, so you know that there was something that happened.
[105:29] B: Yeah.
[105:30] A: When you might have been how old?
[105:33] B: I was like 16.
[105:34] A: 16?
[105:35] B: Yeah.
[105:36] A: Was it on a date or just.
[105:37] B: I woke up, somebody had like, sexual.
[105:39] A: Oh, good. So you're at a party.
[105:41] B: Yeah.
[105:41] A: Yeah. So you'd gone to a party. Right. And you'd been drinking.
[105:44] B: Yeah.
[105:45] A: Right. And then you'd, like, passed out.
[105:48] B: Yeah.
[105:49] A: Right. And then you woke up and somebody had his penis inside your vagina.
[105:53] B: Yeah.
[105:53] A: Right. And that was really cool. What the. Weird.
[105:56] B: Yeah.
[105:57] A: Right. Then what happened?
[106:00] B: Just happened. And then. Yeah.
[106:02] A: So then you woke up, right?
[106:04] B: Yeah.
[106:05] A: You noticed that that felt all weird.
[106:06] B: But like, it felt good, so.
[106:07] A: Of course it did. Right. But body parts such. In certain ways. That's what I'm saying.
[106:11] B: Like, I never realized this shit was like, not. I don't know, I never looked at it like that because my perception of rape is like my ass beat. You know, I have had.
[106:24] A: Oh, well, that would be useful to get cleared too.
[106:26] B: Yeah.
[106:27] A: Right. But that would have been fawn, which is different than fight or flight or freeze.
[106:34] B: Yeah.
[106:35] A: Fawn is. I go along with it. Yeah. Because some of it was feeling good.
[106:39] B: Yeah.
[106:40] A: But you didn't say, hey, you know what? I'm gonna go drink, pass out. And then I'd like to wake up with her penis inside of me.
[106:46] B: Right. Correct.
[106:48] A: Right. So he did that for a period of time, then he stopped and then he took his penis out of your vagina.
[106:54] B: Yeah.
[106:54] A: Right. And then that moment ended.
[106:57] B: Yeah.
[106:57] A: Right. And then later on, you did something, you know, like eat cheesecake.
[107:01] B: Yeah.
[107:02] A: Right. Or dance, go to the beach. And you can remember it happening. Right. You can remember putting on your bracelets. Stop putting on your bracelets. Say, I'm not putting on my bracelet. Well, stop him from doing that. See, he's not doing that.
[107:15] B: He's not doing that.
[107:16] A: We'll stop it from happening. Those not happening. So then where is it? Satan no longer exists. Right again. Him doing that, was that about you?
[107:25] B: No.
[107:25] A: Was it because you were doing something wrong or being bad? No. It had everything to do with what was screwed up with him. Yeah, got it. Right. The pleasurable part wasn't because you wanted him to do that. The pleasurable part was body part touching certain ways is designed to feel good.
[107:44] B: Yeah.
[107:46] A: Makes sense.
[107:47] B: Yeah.
[107:47] A: You didn't know that then? No, no. What's happening now?
[107:54] B: Cuz it led into this whole issue of the girlfriend and she thought that I slept with her boyfriend and it just so happened that they were, it was, I mean that shit had followed me until like college and, and finally I'm just like fuck all you females. Like I can't like. And that all stemmed from me having sex or getting raped I guess. And I'm the bad guy and.
[108:21] A: Right.
[108:22] B: You know what I mean? And so I liked it. So I guess that whole thing was just a whole screwed up thing.
[108:27] A: Like this was like some like felt good.
[108:32] B: Yeah, yeah.
[108:35] A: It didn't feel good because you liked.
[108:37] B: It for another five years finally.
[108:42] A: Yeah, it didn't feel good because you liked it. Yeah, it felt good. Because body part touch in certain ways are designed to feel good. And because it felt good you thought, well then, oh, I must have liked it. Yeah, follow me with that. Like that's got it got right. It didn't feel good because you liked it. Yeah, right. It felt good because the body part touched in a certain way is designed to feel good. You didn't actually ask him to do that, right? Hey, find me passed out, pull my pants down and stick your penis in.
[109:18] B: Yeah.
[109:22] A: Right. And that happening to you wasn't anything that you did. So it didn't have to do with you, it had to do with him. Yeah, right. That girl acting that way towards you didn't have to do with you. Yeah, had to do with her not getting it and you being confused. Well, I must have wanted it because I liked it because it felt good. So I must have wanted it because it felt good. That means I liked it because I liked it. It must mean that I wanted it. But check it out, it felt good. That doesn't mean that you liked it or wanted it. And then it set up that men get to do what they want to my body because if it feels good, even if I didn't want it, it must be that I liked it. Right. And that's why it's a problem. Because in the world of worlds how it's supposed to work is women are regulators and not men. Meaning how it works in the world is a guy isn't always. Yes. Never know if there's a gal that the guy is interested in. Right. The guy isn't always. Yes. If they're in bed and it's 3 o'clock in the morning and he's got to be to work at 6 and she turns over and goes, sweetie, I'm horny. I really want to fuck. He's like, okay, I'm in. He doesn't go, oh, no, I'm tired, I got to get up early. He goes, yeah, no, I'm good. I'm a guy. It doesn't take long. I'm fine. If a girl is sleeping, it's 3:00 in the morning. She doesn't have to be up till 10. And he comes over with this thing. Get away from me. What are you doing? Ew. Because a woman is a yes when I want to, no when I don't. Men are always yeses. Isn't that weird?
[111:25] B: Is this a fact? Are you just telling me that's always the way it is?
[111:29] A: Well, I'm telling you this because when people have had abuse stuff happen to them, it fucks them up. So a woman is not the one that chases, right? There's a reason that a guy who has sex with many women gets to be called a stud. And a girl who has sex with many different guys is called a slut. Right? Because who's easy? Guys are easy, right? If a guy sees this girl and she's at the bar and he's into her and she's. He, he, he looks at her and she, he thinks she's hot. She walks over to him and goes, hey, do you want to come home and fuck? He's like, all right, I'm out. Yeah, let's go. The guy goes to a girl who's kind of looked at him, kind of thought maybe he was cute. He walks over to, hey, you want to go home? Enough. Sucks.
[112:21] B: Yeah.
[112:21] A: You don't get to ask me that question. You don't even know me. Yeah, yeah, got it.
[112:27] B: Yeah.
[112:30] A: Yeah, right? We have the messages that she was giving it up. So it's a prize possession that she holds on to that she's giving up.
[112:38] B: Right?
[112:39] A: Right. The female panther never runs down a male panther. Even when she's in heat, she doesn't run after him going, me, me, me. The lure never chases the fish. Eat me, eat me, eat me. The lure dances provocatively. Hey, little fishy. Hey, little fishy. And then moves away. Come and chase me, little fishy. Right? The female panther lets the male panther know that I'm approachable. And then as he approaches, she runs to get him to chase. So women who have had fucked up stuff happen to their bodies at an early time than they didn't want it to happen, they sometimes have sex like guys where they have one night stands well, they just fuck to fuck. Yeah, right, got it, got it. So I'm saying all of that because your wiring in that regard has been a little bit screwed up.
[113:40] B: Yeah, got it.
[113:44] A: You follow me with that? So, yeah, we, we want to get things wired in the right way because the woman is the object of desire. And being the object of desire, she could say she as the woman is the one who determines the where and the when and the with whom and the how often, the how much. Not the guy, right? The guy is into the sports event. It's on tv, he's watching, he's totally into it. His girl comes over and starts playing with this thing and he's like, it's the greatest day of my life. I'm watching sports and she's doing that. Yeah, right. She's totally into this romantic comedy. She's fully into it. He nuzzles up next to her and grabs down there fucking hand out of there. What is wrong with you? There is a pecking order that you have got to get to before you get down there. Fuck, man. Do you follow me? So now we're starting to get it where women are the ones who are supposed to have the say.
[114:45] B: Yeah.
[114:45] A: Because they've got the goods, they've got the parts that the guy is interested in. Men get turned on by women. You women are beautiful, sensual, provocative, shapely, you smell good. It moves in different ways, it does different things. Men get turned on by women. Women unfortunately, or fortunately for them don't get turned on by men. It's not just what the guy looks like first, right? If you told a guy, I've got the 10 qualities that you asked for in a woman, his first question is still going to be, yeah, but what does she look like? Because you could have all 10 qualities that I want. But if it doesn't look like what I want it to look like, it doesn't matter that you had the qualities. If you tell a woman, hey, I've got a guy who's got the 10 qualities. You were interested. She's like, OK, cool, well, let's set up a date.
[115:35] B: Yeah.
[115:37] A: Because it's not just what he looks like.
[115:39] B: Yeah.
[115:40] A: So if the guy is interested in the girl, the guy is interested in the package that the girl comes in. So the woman has say.
[115:48] B: So this is a gender role. That is. But you called it in animals too. So that's right, it's a thing. So it's like the gender role, but.
[115:59] A: Then the woman is the one that does the. So go back to if men get turned on by women. What do women get turned on by if it's not men? You know, a woman gets turned on by. You'll get this. It'll make a lot of sense. You go, oh, my goodness. Yeah. What women get turned on by is by being a tease, is by flirting. It's by doing what high school boys complain about. I can't get past their base. Women get turned on by being a turn on, by being an object of desire, by being the person the guy's into, but also having the say of, don't you dare. No way. It's not gonna happen. No way. There was a long time ago song by meatloaf called Blinded by the Dashboard Light. Blinded by the light, right? Whole kind of thing. And then it goes into this baseball scene, right? And he's like, oh, they're making out in the backseat. He gets past first base. Now he's the second base. He's at third base. He's rounding third. He's headed home. He's gonna make it home. Oh, my. He's just about to get there. And then the song goes with her singing, stop right there. And then it goes. Before you go any further. Will you love me? Will you love me forever? Will you leave me? Will you never leave me? Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?
[117:13] B: Yeah.
[117:13] A: Will you make me your wife? I gotta know right now. Will you let me. And he goes, and the guy's answer is, let me sleep on it, baby, baby, let me sleep on it. I'll give you an answer in the morning, right? And they go back and forth in this give and take play where she's like wanting commitment if you're gonna get. And he's like, no, let me sleep on it. And then he finally goes, yes or no is yes or no. And then they do it. And then his at the end of it, song goes, and now I'm praying for the end of time because, oh, my God. Right? But that's the whole.
[117:46] B: Right there, right?
[117:47] A: The whole essence of the thing is she's got the good. She's got say, okay? She's the one that gets to decide the where, the when, the with whom, the how much. And the other part is, a guy is ready to go like that. A woman is not. So guys are like a drag race. It's a hundred yards. They start from not moving at all and go as fast as they can for 100 yards. And then it's over. That's a guy. It's why a guy isn't okay. If he does an orgasm. Because for a guy, it's the ending, it's the crescendo, it's the da da da da da da da da da da da da da. Right. For her, it's along the way. It's why men don't have multiple orgasms. And women can. It's along the way they can have enjoyable sexual experience without having one. A guy can. That's how it works. Yeah, right. But the girl has. Say a girl is like nascar, John. NASCAR works. They all get in the car and then they turn on the engine and they let the engine sit for a little bit and warm up. And then they very slowly proceed following the pace car around the lap, slowly warming the car up. Right. And then once they get to race speed and the pace car goes off, they start the race. 500 laps later, they're done. So guys, quick.
[119:16] B: Yeah.
[119:17] A: Ready to go. Done like that. Yeah, right. It's why that whole thing in Austin Powers was really funny because, you know, Austin goes to investigate a lot of vagina. You know, he goes to a lot of vaginas. Penthouse. And she's in the hot tub and she says to Austin, Austin, in my country, men come first and women come second. And Austin Powers line is, or not at all, baby. Yeah. Because that's the whole nature of it. If she doesn't go first, she's probably not going to. Because if he does, it's over. So that's where we want the woman to have say and be empowered. Because if the guy has any interest because the guy is interested in and the woman doesn't get turned on by the guy, that's not what the guy looks like. Right. If that was the case, then George Clooney and Brad Pitt would have everybody. The rest of us would have nobody. But it's not that. Right? So we want you to have say that you back then got bamboozled into because it felt good. She believed that because it felt good, she must have liked it, which meant she wanted it. As we're looking at it, clearly it felt good, but not because she liked it or wanted it, but because the body touch in certain that way and being attended to in that way feels good. Right. A woman needs a man about as much as a fist needs a bicycle, which is not at all A woman has a body part that sole purpose is sexual pleasure. There's a reason we don't have one. If we had one, we'd never stop touching it all day long. What are you doing? Nothing. We have a hard Enough time not touching ours to begin with. If that's all it did, like, come on, Nothing would get accomplished. The reason we can't have more than one is we keep going, sweetheart, we've been at it for a long time. We've already gotten 267. I know. Let's try to get to 300.
[121:23] B: Oh, my God, right?
[121:24] A: Like, the guy would never stop. You just keep going. She's like, no, I'm good with one. So we have to remember all of that stuff that you have say, and what that younger you didn't know is that she had say, right? Because she wasn't even thinking of it as forced sex. Whether you call it rape or not was uninvited sexual experience.
[121:50] B: Yeah, right.
[121:52] A: She wasn't laying there going, I hope the guy comes in and does this to me. And I got too tired, so I went to sleep. She wasn't saying, hey, later on, meet me in the room while I'm passed out and you know, I'll wake up when we're doing this. Following me with that. Like, that was not any of the shit that was going on back then. And how old were you when that happened? If it followed five years of high school, I was like 16, right? 15. 16 years old, right, Got it. So again, that girl saying that stuff, that guy doing that stuff didn't have to do with you. It feeling good wasn't because you wanted it to. I didn't mean you liked it. You might have found out that, you know, being sexual is something that I like because it feels good. Right? But it's much better if I do it with somebody that I actually want to do it with. Right. It's why in the whole world of whether it be trafficking, prostitution, there are some guys that the person is doing it with and they can get along with it and it's more okay. And then there's some guys that's like, oh, my goodness, this grosses me out that I'm having to do this thing. You follow me with that? So we want to get it that you have complete say, freedom, strength, power inside. So first of all, close your eyes, Picture the younger you and let her know that moment is over, finished, completed, that it no longer exists, that it felt good. Not because you wanted it or because you liked it, because the body part touched in that way was designed to feel good. That him doing that wasn't about you and her being upset it you wasn't about you. That it wouldn't matter whether it was you in that situation or somebody else. That's what he would have done and that's how she would have been. So that the younger you get. It's not about me. Let the younger you know that you're okay. Right. Let her know that you've got say now. Let her know how you're positively changing your life for the better now. That's right. Because you are totally, positively changing your life for the better now. That's right. That's right. I don't know about cheesecake and dancing, being at the beach. I don't know about sitting outside and experiencing the warmth of the sun and how it's a meditative state. That's right. Right. So that you're becoming more okay in you. That you lighten up on that earlier you. That she just didn't know that because it felt pleasurable. It doesn't mean that she wanted it or liked it. Right. And as all of this gets inside connecting, what do you notice happening to that earlier? You's face?
[124:36] B: It's farther away.
[124:37] A: Yeah. Does she look so bothered or confused? Right. And you can open your eyes. Yeah, There we go. Isn't that a good news then? You're doing great.
[124:59] B: It's so weird how my mind can like just be so many places and then like I wake up and I'm like, oh, yeah, you're right here. And then you can be so many places.
[125:11] A: Yeah, right.
[125:13] B: Crazy.
[125:14] A: Yeah. So it was one of those times with the guy, like hit you. Oh, who was that guy? Jerry was Jerry. No, not Jerry. Different guy.
[125:24] B: Yeah.
[125:24] A: Who's that guy's name?
[125:26] B: His name was John.
[125:27] A: John. My friend John. John.
[125:29] B: John.
[125:29] A: John.
[125:30] B: Poor John.
[125:31] A: Poor John. So that one might have happened when you were how old? How long ago?
[125:36] B: 30.
[125:36] A: 30, right. Yeah. And you might have been where and what happened?
[125:42] B: You know, I had a little apartment and you moved into my little place.
[125:46] A: So John moved in, John moved in.
[125:48] B: And me and John drank together.
[125:52] A: Yeah, right. Good job. Good detail. John might have got it and had been a little bit of an angry drunk.
[125:57] B: John was a monster when he drank. Oh, wonderful person when he was sober. Great dude. But when he drank, he thought I was his mom at one point. He was. He had some important. That's what I say. Poor John.
[126:10] A: Like poor John.
[126:10] B: He had some mental health issues.
[126:11] A: He really did. You didn't know that then? I did not how much mental health illnesses he had, nor you didn't know how bad of a drunk he was going to be when he drank. Right. So what's one of the times that he did? So you guys had been drinking probably afternoon, nighttime.
[126:27] B: Yeah. No, he came home one day from shopping.
[126:32] A: Right. Good.
[126:33] B: I was gone for too long. I was helping some little lady.
[126:35] A: Well, that's cuz shopping is a pleasure.
[126:37] B: Yeah, I was helping some little lady.
[126:39] A: And you were right.
[126:40] B: I was making. Helping her make shelves. Anyways, came home, I was drinking, doing my thing, and I came home to a bottle of Patron. Exo. Half drink.
[126:52] A: Yes.
[126:53] B: And he went ballistic.
[126:56] A: Yes. So he started yelling, screaming, and he.
[126:59] B: Beat my ass a couple times, but this was like the last one.
[127:02] A: So he did what? Like he punched you, slapped you, pulled your hair?
[127:05] B: He had me on the bed, like beat me.
[127:09] A: Yeah. So he's punching you, punching you in the face. Right. That hurt.
[127:13] B: I was just more confused than anything.
[127:15] A: Well, and some of it hurt.
[127:16] B: Physical pain. But you're so fun.
[127:21] A: Physical pain. Whatever.
[127:23] B: Whatever.
[127:23] A: But it was really confusing.
[127:24] B: It was really confusing. Because when you love some.
[127:27] A: When you love somebody, why are they doing that?
[127:29] B: Beating your ass for no reason.
[127:31] A: That's right. That's right.
[127:35] B: You like cheer me on, right? Like.
[127:37] A: Yeah, that's right. And then what happened?
[127:39] B: I think the neighbors called the cops.
[127:41] A: Because they just called the cops. Right. And then what happened? Cops came and then he went to jail. Right. And then eventually you left him and then that was over.
[127:49] B: Yeah, that was the last.
[127:50] A: Right. And then later on you did something.
[127:52] B: More fun like eating cheesecake.
[127:54] A: That's right. Or dancing or doing art.
[127:59] B: Yeah. Go to the beach.
[128:00] A: Going to the beach. Right.
[128:01] B: Listen to music.
[128:03] A: Right. Dancing. Jen was telling me that she's really, really into diamond art.
[128:08] B: Diamond art supply thing. She loves her diamond art.
[128:12] A: I'm not sure I could do diamond art. That would require a lot of patience and sitting still and picking up really small things and putting them in places, which is not my forte.
[128:24] B: It's a good focus because when there's a lot of shit and vibes and things going on, that is like. It's an escape.
[128:33] A: Well, I told her that it works really. Really in the same fashion that cutting does.
[128:39] B: Takes your mind away.
[128:41] A: No. Do you know why people cut? Like self harm, self mutilation cutting. So they cut because it's overwhelming, out of control, overwhelming emotional stuff going on with them that's totally out of their control. So what does cutting do? It takes overwhelm and out of control and puts it under their control because they're doing it. It takes a big thing and localizes it to a particular area. So just as you put, it takes this big overwhelming thing and to something that's under my control. That I'm doing. And of course, then when I cut, cutting releases an endorphin. An endorphin is a pain suppressor. So over. Overall amount of control down. What does diamond art do? Over. There's so much emotion, something that I'm doing under my control, that I'm at my pace at my. One at a time. It's not like I can take 10 and throw them there one at a time. Paint by number.
[129:53] B: Yeah. I think it's like a medit.
[129:55] A: You know, it is a meditative process. Yeah, right. Yeah. And there's lots of them.
[130:01] B: Okay, so it's different.
[130:02] A: Gotcha. All different things are meditative processes. Okay. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah.
[130:12] B: I can stare out the window and look at a tree, and I can be there and leave completely. Leave. Leave the room.
[130:19] A: That's right.
[130:20] B: And then I have to explain, listen, I'm triggered to the lady that does in the game. Like, listen, Nicole, I'm just triggered right now. So don't think I'm trying to be a. But, like, my mind won't even, like, go there. My mind will read something and it'll.
[130:32] A: Be like, how do you know when to get triggered? What does it get triggered on?
[130:37] B: When it gets. Just gets overwhelmed. Like when I feel, like, overwhelmed and uncomfortable. Either anxiety or. Or anger or irritability or. Fuck you. Fuck this.
[130:50] A: I'm out. Yeah, right.
[130:55] B: Am I wrong? I don't know.
[130:56] A: I don't know. Everybody gets triggered in different ways about different things.
[131:00] B: Yeah.
[131:01] A: So I'm just curious. How do you know when to do it, Feel triggered? Like, where might you be when it happens? And all of a sudden, there.
[131:12] B: Where might I be?
[131:13] A: Yeah. Because it's a program that your brain is running, interacting with your world. So it could be something you're seeing, saying to yourself, smelling, hearing, tasting, feeling.
[131:24] B: Like, the last time it was like reading this situation and ending the game about some girl who was getting beat by her pimp.
[131:34] A: Oh. Then it reminded you of times that you were hitting. Yeah.
[131:36] B: And then I was like, fuck.
[131:38] A: So just right now, I'm leaving the building. That's right. So just right now, think about that. And what do you notice? Like, you can read about somebody who was getting beaten by their pimp, and.
[131:53] B: It'S not so bad.
[131:54] A: Oh, it isn't. Maybe. I don't know. Check, check inside right now.
[131:59] B: I just feel it.
[132:00] A: I know. Isn't that cool for what I know.
[132:06] B: Okay.
[132:06] A: The thing that used to be the thing that would have you go out to the tree and it's always okay to Go out to the tree. Yeah, but we want it to be more intentional and on your terms.
[132:18] B: Right? Because it just does it. My brain will just.
[132:20] A: You follow me with that. So we want the tool set to stay there. We don't take away the thing. That's a good shield, but it becomes more intense, intentional and on purpose. Right? Because now you can think about that happening. It's not taking you back to what that guy John did, right? Right? Because you can remember John doing that, you know, punching you on the bed. You can remember that happening. You can remember hitting your face. You can remember him doing that. You can remember putting your bracelets on. Stop putting on your bracelets. It'll stop John from you. He's not here. He'll stop him from pulling your hair, stop him from calling you names. We'll stop him from saying that stuff. Well, then stop him from doing that. So then, whereas it say it no longer exists. Right? And again, that happening, was it about you or him? Yeah, you, of course, in that moment, didn't know how fucked up he was. Right? So close your eyes and picture the younger you and let her know what you know now. Over, finished, no longer exists. Not about me. Had nothing to do with me. Had everything to do with what was off with him. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know how much she likes cheesecake and she gets to eat it, dance, be at the beach, do art. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know how much you've already changed and how much more you're changing for the better. Because what's happening now is those things that would trigger you to using, those emotional wounds are getting healed. So it's easier and easier for you to do the thing that makes sense. So that as you do it, you get to feel good. And as you think back about how you've done it, you're glad you did. You're beginning to lighten up and be more and more okay in you, more and more free, light, clear, peaceful, connecting to delight. At the center. Delight, that is you. Because that stuff may have affected your body at times, may have screwed up your thinking or feelings, but there's no part of your body right now that's the same as when any of that was happening. It's all been replaced. Millions upon millions upon millions upon tons. Just like your feet are longer than they were when you were three, yet you're still you. So we could think John might have messed with your stuff, that guy might have messed with your stuff. But they never got who you really are. They never touched you. Not in the way that you can be touched. Which is only with mutual respect or love. Right. The love that you allow in. Because that light that is you can't be touched or harmed. It's whole and complete. There's nothing missing. And you're connecting more to you. To light at the center. That's right.
[135:31] B: I can't wait to start painting what I'm seeing.
[135:34] A: I bet. Right? Isn't that cool? Mm.
[135:39] B: I knew I got rid of all my artwork for a reason. You see how God is so cool?
[135:43] A: Yeah. Now we have room for you to be becoming even more of who you are. Right? Right. Because those pieces of things that you went through were never you. Never a part of you. Never defined who you are. They're just shit that happened to you. Because who you are isn't in those experiences. They're just the experiences that happened. The shit that you went through. The stuff that was done. The stuff. Stuff that you did. But you're not what you do. Who you are is much more than that. And you're becoming more and more connected to you. Essence Light. Clear. Right. You did great today.
[136:39] B: Thank you.
[136:44] A: Yeah. Right?
[136:48] B: Feel peaceful.
[136:49] A: I bet. And see, that's what you're gonna notice. So people tell me all the time is that the shit that was bothering them isn't bothering them. And then if they do get triggered, the intensity is way less. The frequency that it happens is less. The duration that it lasts is less. So they've got a lot more ease in moving through stuff. Not that stuff isn't gonna be happening because it always will. They have more ease. Instead of the mountain that they have to overcome, it's the speed bump, which is a much easier thing to get beyond. Right. You did great.
[137:23] B: Thank you.
[137:23] A: And then we'll get back together again.
[137:25] B: Cool.
[137:26] A: Yes.
[137:27] B: I'm so excited to paint.
[137:32] A: Yeah.
[137:32] B: And be the little weirdo that I am.
[137:34] A: Well, there you go. Nothing wrong with being a weirdo.
[137:37] B: Oh, my foot's asleep.
[137:40] A: Wake up. Wake up, wake up.
