[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 1st of December, Nicole. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable, or transformative, what we do might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Okay, cool. Awesome. So give me an update. First of all, how did our last session leave you? What have you noticed for yourself? How have things been?
[00:23] B: The last session we had was beautiful. I know. Like, I didn't really get a chance to talk to you afterwards because. But I, like, definitely had, like an out of body experience and met with Jerry and like, came to that realization that, like, he's good, like, where he's at, more energy and just really good. Like, I'm just trying to, like, operate in my. In a higher conscious, like, not in my ego. And I've just really been, like, going with the flow, you know, trying to just not take everything so seriously and know, like, people are responding on a trauma responses. And I'm trying to catch myself when I'm responding on a trauma and learning from that. All of it. It's good. It's been good.
[01:12] A: Yeah. So the stuck grief stuff is lifted. Yeah, that part's cool. What else have you noticed? I get that there's been more ability to roll and go with the flow and actually experience other people's stuff. Stuff as being about them. That's cool too.
[01:28] B: Yeah, I'm just having a tough time. I just feel like there's a lot of petty, petty going on at the house.
[01:34] A: And like, what does that mean?
[01:37] B: Just people like games. Oh, I'm gonna talk to you about this. We're doing this. Ending the game, if you're familiar with end it. Fucking hate that class. So. But I hate it because I get triggered and I didn't realize. Excuse me. I didn't realize, like, I was such. I didn't realize how calculated people can be. You know what I mean? As I'm like doing drugs and smoking crack and then they're using me, like, you know, making me think it's my decision to sell myself when, like, really it was all so calculated with the drugs and, you know, the first clients being like, attractive and good looking and I didn't really care at that point because, you know, free drugs and sex and they just go together. And I just didn't realize how, like, gross and disgusting these people, like, use were and, like, used that, like, used me, you know, because I felt like I was powerful and in control and I wasn't.
[02:41] A: Yeah.
[02:42] B: And I'm just a little mad. So. So it's definitely a trigger for me.
[02:47] A: A little mad at.
[02:49] B: I'm just mad at, like, yourself.
[02:51] A: Them. The world.
[02:53] B: The world. And disgusted. Like, because I thought I was a strong person. Like, how could I fall for that? Like, it was all so, you know, just calculated. And then it's making me, like, look at the women in the house and, like, how calculated they are to, like, you know, it got to the point, like, I went off on one of the girls. She wanted me to open these cans for her because she couldn't do it, when really she just wanted me to do it. And it's like. I don't know. It's one of those, like, control thing or something. Yeah. I don't know. But I don't like.
[03:32] A: It felt like.
[03:33] B: It felt like. And like, I'm just kind of been, like, stepping back and, like, everything. To me, like, my perception seems like it's a game.
[03:46] A: Oh.
[03:46] B: And I don't like it. I don't like that.
[03:49] A: So beginning to see things a little more clearly.
[03:54] B: Yeah. And I don't like it.
[03:56] A: And, you know, you don't like seeing things more clearly. You don't like the game.
[04:01] B: How people are, like, manipulative and, like, they don't even. I'm not saying they're bad. I don't think that they realize that they're fucking being like this. Yeah, I see it. And I had an art class earlier, and, like, I just felt it, you know, when you're stuck in, like, the same house with people and then you see how they operate, and it's like, you know, I go outside. Like, I had to step out. We were, like, doing some sewing things. And the repetitive and the sewing and, like, the hand, eye, you know, whatever. Both brains together, working together, whatever. I had to step outside. And I'm just watching these, like, the wildflowers and, like, the bees, and I'm like, yeah, I'm a fucking wildflower. I'm weird.
[04:46] A: You're not. You're kind of hippy. Ish.
[04:49] B: I'm like, I feel like one of those wild. I'm a wildflower.
[04:52] A: That's right.
[04:52] B: And I'm like, you know why I love you?
[04:54] A: You were born in the wrong generation. You could be a flower child generation. Yeah, well, I mean, just look at the tattoos. Come on.
[05:02] B: But you know what? And I was sitting there, and I had to just step away from the people in the room. And I was just watching the bees, like, fly around these beautiful little Purple wildflowers. And I was like that I love nature because it's, like, honest. It's honest, it's consistent. And it's like, got no motives. Like, they're just like. These flowers grow, they don't judge each other.
[05:26] A: Like, well, they have motives, but they don't have to judge each other. But they definitely have motives.
[05:32] B: Yeah.
[05:32] A: Right. The flower is trying to grow, get its own space, create its own petals. Right?
[05:38] B: Yeah.
[05:38] A: That's its motive.
[05:40] B: Okay, well, the motive is to grow.
[05:41] A: But there's, like, the bees are looking for the nectar so that they can convert it into honey. Yeah, Right. So they have tasks.
[05:50] B: They're not out to hurt each other.
[05:52] A: They're not. And not everybody's out to hurt each other. And some people hurt each other not even knowing that they're doing it. Yeah, right. So a couple different things that I heard, I just fucking hate people.
[06:03] B: Like, I'm to the point where I don't know what to do. Like, I really. This is why I isolate. Because I see games and I'm just like, ugh. I'm 37 years old, never been married. Like, never. Like, when I feel people get close to me, too close, like, I can't do it.
[06:20] A: Oh, okay.
[06:25] B: Did you say that? I don't know.
[06:32] A: Isn't that great? Yeah. So, couple different things. One, we want the disgust and the bad feelings over the shit that happened to you. We want that cleared and gone so that you don't feel bad anymore or angry or hurting or disgusted. Right. Wouldn't that be useful to not have those feelings about that stuff anymore?
[06:55] B: Yeah.
[06:55] A: Yeah, I know how to do that.
[06:57] B: I know you do. We've done it.
[07:00] A: Right. But about that stuff is different than what we've done with other stuff.
[07:03] B: Okay.
[07:04] A: Don't we also want to get it so that, yes, you're seeing things clearly and, yes, you've got more emotional distance from it, but that it's also not affecting you in a negative way. Because what I'm hearing is now that I'm seeing the games that are being played, it's causing me to not feel good and I'm having a dislike. And then the last part is, it's not about being open to all. Like, that's a bad idea. Right. It's not about trust. I think I told you that before. Trusting is a bad fucking idea. To think that that person's gonna have my best interest in mind all the time. Oh, Jesus. That is fucking crazy. Now they will have my best interest. When mine matches theirs, they won't when mine doesn't. So instead of trusting, we want to have space and room to maneuver with more ease. Right. Because people keep thinking closeness requires trust in them, and it doesn't. Closeness doesn't require trust at all. But where do we want trust to be?
[08:24] B: In ourselves.
[08:25] A: Yeah. To be able to distinguish in which situations and with whom. I can be more open. I can be more. We call it vulnerable. I can share. And that may vary, and it may even vary with the person. There are times with my wife that I'm going to be really open, vulnerable and sharing. There are other times based on how we're interacting that I'm not all too open. I'm not all too. About sharing. Right. So even with somebody that I've been with for 22, 23 years, married for 22. Right. There are moments. Right. So we want you to have flexibility and freedom and ease in the moments. Having more movement in between, seeing it more clearly, being less impacted or affected by it. Right. Because oftentimes it's the people that don't know that they don't know it's the stuff that's running them in the background. They don't even know that they don't know it.
[09:42] B: Yeah.
[09:44] A: Got it.
[09:45] B: Yeah.
[09:45] A: And you're beginning to see it more because you've gotten some distance from it. You begin to see it more because you're starting to read emotionally. Other people's stuff is being about them, not about me.
[09:59] B: Yeah.
[10:00] A: And I'm not wanting to participate or play in that anymore. Right. Which is cool because that's the arena for growing. Yeah. You know, like the flowers and the bees.
[10:22] B: It sounds so nerdy, but it's so true. You're just like, yeah, simple, but it's not simple.
[10:30] A: Right.
[10:31] B: It's not all these extra distractions.
[10:34] A: Right. So to explain a little bit, we're not angry or disgusted over what those people did that had me be hooked. Right. That had me caught in the web of, you know, psychological manipulation and coercion, then had it, then all the go. You know what? Yeah. No, I'm actually good having people do stuff to my body, you know, to get money to help with the drug. Yeah. No, this is like a good thing.
[11:06] B: Yeah. Just look at it objectively.
[11:08] A: Like we were in a party mode. Like, you know. Right. Like, so not just look at it in an objective way. But it's. So the thing is, you're not troubled because of what they did, because of how it happened, because of what you did, because of how it happened. You're troubled now emotionally because part of your brain doesn't know the troubling ended. Remember all emotional wounds, all things that when I think about it and it still makes me feel, doesn't matter what the feeling is. But if it's a thing that's done and over and I still feel about it, it's an emotional wound that's still active.
[11:53] B: Say that again. I spaced out.
[11:55] A: I know. It's a crazy thought, isn't it?
[11:56] B: My mind spaced out. Okay.
[11:59] A: It's good. Squirtle what I do.
[12:02] B: I have a touch on focusing. I didn't sleep great last night. Okay.
[12:08] A: You're so fun.
[12:11] B: So tired. No, but it's a lot. I want to take it. I want to.
[12:15] A: Like we're gonna get there and you don't have to just get it here. It's gonna get changed here.
[12:19] B: Yeah.
[12:20] A: What I was saying is all emotional wounds, meaning anything that you think about, that when you think about it, past stuff, it makes you feel angry, disgusted, hurt, sad, frustrated, upset, annoyed, anxious, irritated.
[12:37] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[12:39] A: Means that it's an emotional wound. And if it's an emotional wound, what that means is there's a part of your brain that doesn't know that ended.
[12:50] B: Okay. Okay.
[12:51] A: Your logical brain does. Your emotional brain doesn't.
[12:54] B: Okay. So.
[12:56] A: So we want to get the part of your brain that has been confusing those moments where you felt disgust or anger towards them or myself. We want to get that cleared out. Right. Because it's only in clarity. Right. When we're in the state of using, how clear are we?
[13:20] B: We.
[13:23] A: Not that clear. Right. And because we're not clear, how much more susceptible are we to bad things happening? Right. And if I've had any kind of violence in my life, if I've had any kind of sexual molestation or abuse in my life, it already an open wound that attracts predators. Right. The lion doesn't go after the biggest elephant to prove how mighty he is. The lion doesn't go after the strongest gazelle. Now, could the lion take out the biggest elephant and take out the strongest gazelle? Probably. But it also could get hurt. You know, for all predators, getting hurt fucks up their whole livelihood. Because once a predator is hurt, what do they become?
[14:18] B: Victim.
[14:19] A: The prey. The prey got it. So the lion only goes after the smallest gazelle, the tiniest elephant, the older, the weaker, the one that can't put up a fight. Sharks smell the blood. Alligators go after little puppies. Little children don't go after big people. Although an alligator could probably take you and I out it's not gonna go after us. Maybe if it's provoked. But we're not going to do that, right? It's not gonna on its own. It's not gonna on its own go after us. But if it sees a small little puppy there that defends this little thing. Gone. What happened? I don't know. Where'd it go? Splash. What? Oh, no, there's Fifi. So, first of all, would it be okay for you to feel okay now about you and about the stuff that happened and you being okay now with you and the stuff that happened doesn't mean the stuff that happened was okay. Would it be okay for you to feel okay in you now? Yeah. With that okayness, let's symbolize a you who's free from the effect. No longer feeling the hurt, the anger, the disgust, the shame, the. Right. And if we symbolize you, wild animal, something in nature, something that grows from the ground or up in the sky. Right. Who's free from all of that? What comes to mind to symbolize you being free?
[16:17] B: An eagle.
[16:17] A: An eagle? Yeah. Beautiful. Is the eagle, you know, flying still?
[16:23] B: Yeah, yeah.
[16:25] A: Is it like soaring or is it flapping?
[16:28] B: Soaring.
[16:28] A: Soaring. So now all you do is you think Soaring Eagle and look up. So think Soaring Eagle and look up with your eyes open, of course, then same thing. You'll think Soaring Eagle. You'll look up, you'll take a deep breath, breath in. And then you'll exhale. Right? Same thing. You'll look up, think Soaring Eagle. You'll breathe in. You exhale and close your eyes. Good. You can open your eyes. Same thing. You think Soaring Eagle. You breathe in. You exhale and close your eyes. Your eyes. Now close. Rest. And of course, when eyes are rest, you can also rest. You can hear my voice in the background sounds and be aware of how you're seated all at the same time. Your unconscious is responding towards what the soaring eagle is symbolizing, which is a you more at peace and okay and free, clear and connected to who you really are. Right. Take another deep breath in.
[17:41] B: In.
[17:43] A: And then exhale and open your eyes. Good. Those short moments, eyes were closed. What did you notice within yourself?
[17:51] B: Calm.
[17:52] A: Yeah. So one more. Yeah. Right. Well, at least we're hanging out with us. That's right. So again, look up. Think Soaring Eagle. Deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Good. Eyes are closed. They rest. As your eyes rest closed, you also rest. You're aware of your breath and my voice and the background sounds. How it feels to be seated in the way you are with Your hands crossed in the way they are. You're noticing all of this at the same time. Your unconscious is responding to you, organizing towards what the soaring eagle symbolizes. You free, clear, at peace, present and light. All of this, Nicole, is happening without you having to do anything at all. Because it's an inside out process. And more is going on below the surface than you even know yet. Just like with planting seedlings in the soil, once we plant them, cover this topsoil and water, a lot begins to happen under the surface. More goes on at a deeper and deeper level than you know. That's right. And even more is happening under the surface before you ever see any of it sprout. All of this is going on at deeper and deeper levels. Organizing towards your free, peaceful, clear, seeing it clearly. Centered traction, movement, ease, comfort inside. Right. When you're ready, find your way back up by taking a nice big deep breath. Breath in. And then exhale. And open your eyes. Good job. Those moments eyes were closed, what were you noticing?
[20:03] B: I'm calm. And I was picturing little seedlings sprouting in a photo. What do they call it? The photo videos where they take the pictures.
[20:15] A: Time lapse photography.
[20:17] B: Yeah. Yeah, but it shows. It's like a horse.
[20:19] A: That's right.
[20:20] B: Real.
[20:22] A: Yeah. It is cool, isn't it? Yeah. So then all you're gonna do is we're gonna take this arm, we're gonna put it down like that. You're gonna hold your hand like. There we go. You're gonna look at that spot right there. Don't do anything at all on purpose to move that hand or those fingers. Just pay attention to that spot. Spot on that hand. And as you focus in on that spot, notice that with the sides of your eyes, you can see the rest of that hand and maybe even more of the space in the room at the same time. You know that there's more than you can see. Don't do anything at all on purpose to move that hand or move the fingers in that hand. Just become curious about when you'll begin noticing movement happening within the fingers, within that hand. Because as your curiosity grows about when you'll start to notice the movement, whether it be a slight little twitch or a wiggle or a jump or a jerk or start or a stop. That's right. What you can know at a different level is that no matter whether you're noticing the movement on the outside, there is movement happening on the inside. That there's blood flowing through the fingers, tiny capillaries providing nutrients to the cells all that movement's happening. You don't feel it, but you know it's going on. And see, there's more movement happening in that hand all the way down past the wrist, down the forearm, to the elbow and back up. All of that's going on. And see, as you're noticing what's happening, that hand has become what we like to call catalytic. Catalytic simply means it's more wax, like. That's right. And as it's wax, like, it doesn't quite feel the same as your hand normally feels. See, we can kind of move different spots, and it just stays. Isn't that interesting? That's right. It's kind of weird what's happening, because it's entrancing that your unconscious now is responding to you, organizing towards the soaring eagle, which is all about your becoming free to be more okay in you and at peace with. With what did. That's right. Realizing at a deeper level that although we don't like it, that it did. It couldn't have, not then. Because we didn't know back then what you know now. That's right. And see, there's that hand that you're noticing, but you haven't been focusing on this hand, which is also catalytic. And of course, you can move your hand at any time at your hand. That's right. But check inside your body now. And what are you noticing?
[23:24] B: I don't know.
[23:25] A: You don't know, do you? Isn't that weird? Right? Well, does it feel more tense or more calm?
[23:33] B: I mean, I feel calm.
[23:34] A: You do, don't you? Right. Which means there's a lot going on that you don't have to know. Right. You don't have to know the inner workings of how the wiring needs to change within your brain in order for the wiring within your brain to change. You don't have to know the process of how to remove a cavity in order to go to a dentist in order to have them remove the cavity. Follow me with that. So all we're doing is we're organizing your brain towards what the soaring eagle is symbolizing. And because your unconscious responds to things that are symbolic. It's why advertisers use them. It's why when you see a big yellow arch on the side of the road, you immediately think of McDonald's. When you see a swoosh mark on somebody's sneaker, you go, oh, that's Nike. But we also know that the swoosh mark or the golden arch have nothing to do with sneakers or cheeseburgers. Right? I feel like that stuff is evil sometimes. It might be, but it's all about how do we utilize our mind to cause the states we want to be in where we're at, Everything we do in life is state dependent. We can get lured into something. When people watch tennis and they're having a long volley back and forth, you can see people kind of moving in their chair with the ball as it's moving. Yeah, Right. When somebody jumps up in the air because their team scored a touchdown, they didn't decide to do that. Their body, unconscious, was responding to what was happening. Right. What do we want to do for you? We want your mind and body to become more responsive to you. So that even when the games are going on, you've got more ease to maneuver around it. Right. To be outside of it, to not be engaged in it. Yeah. To move through it or under it or over it or behind it. Got it. And that's what's going on now. And you don't have to know inside or outside, up here or in here, what's actually happening to begin to know that there's more going on than you think. Right. Because in your whole body there's things that you can be aware of. Right. Like you can be aware of that you're paying attention to what I'm saying and that sometimes you drift because your mind wanders. Right. But what you're not paying any attention to is your big right toe. Until I brought your awareness to it. Now you can notice it, but see, you can notice your big right toe, but you weren't noticing your left ear. But of course, as I say, it brings your awareness towards it. Isn't that interesting? So the thing that we know is that no matter what's going on at any one time, there's always more going on than you think.
[26:26] B: So is that like, you know, when something like that's going on, think about something.
[26:33] A: Oh, no, we're not gonna have you try to figure it out up here.
[26:36] B: It's just gonna happen.
[26:37] A: Yeah, we want it to change in here so you don't have to think about it. Because then sometimes you might get caught. If you have to always pay attention to think about it, you might get caught in it and then be like, fuck, man, I just got caught in that thing. Where do we want it to change? In here.
[26:49] B: Okay.
[26:50] A: Right. And that's why I say the other part is, no matter who you think you are at any one time, you're always more than that. Right?
[27:01] B: Yeah.
[27:01] A: Yeah. So as we're organizing towards A you, which is symbolized by the soaring ego. Who's free from the hurt, the disgust, the guilt, the pain, the shame over the stuff that happens, who's much more emotionally present and clear. Right. As we organize towards this you, your unconscious, which probably already did it, brought a moment to your awareness of an experience that happened that has that discussed. Right. What we want to do is we want to get it unplugged so it no longer has that feeling. And the moment that came to mind happened about how long ago?
[27:40] B: Two years ago.
[27:41] A: Yeah. Right. And as you think about it, we know there's things you've done later that are more enjoyable. Right. What's something recently you've done that was more fun than that?
[27:52] B: Paint.
[27:52] A: Yeah. Painting was more fun than that. Putting your necklace on was probably more fun than that. Making this necklace even more fun than that. That's right. Good. One other thing you've done that was more fun than that moment.
[28:03] B: Dancing.
[28:04] A: Dancing. So we got dancing, we got making the necklace, we got painting. All of those moments happen after that moment. But there's a problem. Part of your brain emotionally doesn't know that moment stopped. So we have good news to get in. Right. So when that moment happened, a few years ago, when it happened, you're where?
[28:24] B: That's the tricky part.
[28:25] A: Well, naked. So you're at a motel. Hotel. Right. And were you, like, in the lobby or a hotel room? You're in a room.
[28:32] B: They were living in there.
[28:33] A: Good. Right. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[28:34] B: Nighttime.
[28:35] A: Nighttime. And you're wearing the room?
[28:39] B: I was in a bed.
[28:40] A: So you're in a bed. Right. And so you're in the bed. Right. And then what happened next?
[28:45] B: They discuss how I'm gonna make money with their clients.
[28:50] A: Right. So somebody's talking to you while they're in the bed, too. Are they standing?
[28:54] B: They're standing.
[28:55] A: They're standing. You're, like, laying down in the bed?
[28:57] B: Yeah.
[28:57] A: Right. Like you have clothes on or covers or were you over the covers? Right. Whatever it was. Right. And so they're saying, hey, Nicole, this is how it's gonna go. We're gonna be bringing guys in, and they're gonna do stuff to your body, and then they're going to pay you or they're going to pay you before they do the stuff to your body. Because if they don't pay you before, they probably won't pay you after. Then they're going to do stuff to your body. You're okay with that, right?
[29:16] B: Yeah.
[29:17] A: Right. And then what happened next? And you're like, okay, yeah. Right. And then they brought somebody in. Yeah, Right. And that first person was somebody who looked a little more appealing, or was that. Right. And so you were. Okay. That person did whatever they did to your body. Some of it might even have felt good. Some of it might have been enjoyable. Right. And then that person left. And then they might have brought another person in. Yeah, Right. And then that person did whatever they did. And again, that. Some of it might have been good. Some of it might. Right, yeah. And then they brought a different person. Yeah, right. And when did it get to the person that you were like, oh, geez.
[29:50] B: It was before the third person.
[29:51] A: Yeah, so before the third person. Right. So that person came in and you're.
[29:56] B: Like, well, no, I met him earlier.
[30:00] A: Right.
[30:01] B: And there was people coming over, and I walked. I, like, got. I ran out. And I don't remember after that, but my mind. I don't remember walking home, but I know I got out of there. I don't know where I went.
[30:21] A: Right, so you got out of there. Right. Because that person, you were like. Right. And then you left, and then eventually you went back. Yes.
[30:32] B: I don't know. It's really.
[30:34] A: It's all blurry. Oh, right. Because you've been using. Yeah, right. And somewhat disassociated.
[30:39] B: Yeah.
[30:40] A: Right. So we can make up what could have. Or what you think might have happened. So we can make it up. Because it's not about the content. It's about. It's about the structure of how it got coded and the structure of the coding is happening. So then what might have happened next?
[31:03] B: I don't know.
[31:04] A: Don't make it up. You might have walked home and then that moment ended. You don't know, do you? What's happening now?
[31:14] B: I'm frustrated because I don't know.
[31:16] A: Oh, well. But you haven't been making it up. See, you keep thinking that you have to tell me the actual thing that happened, but you don't have to know what really happened, but you can make up what you think could have happened. It'll be structurally similar enough.
[31:31] B: I don't want to make up what could happen in a good way. Can I make up, like.
[31:37] A: Well, why would you want to make it in a good way? I don't know.
[31:40] B: I can't remember anything bad. I don't know.
[31:42] A: Yeah, but it's not about remembering things bad, is it? See, we're not troubled by bad memories when they're actually a memory. We're only troubled by bad memories when the memory is being read as if.
[31:54] B: It'S the experience, it's really frustrating not being able to remember.
[31:59] A: Well, I'll give you a different thought on that. Sometimes when people are going through troubling moments that they can't get out of, they no longer stay in their body. Did you know that? So think of an animal running for its life. The rabbit is being chased by the fox, right? And it's running for its life and it's trying to get away. And the rabbit is having the realization, the knowing that it's death is inevitable. Like, no exit routes, can't get away. So it's death is inevitable. There will be a moment. You can see it on all National Geographics. Doesn't matter whether it's rabbit, fox, wolf, fox, it doesn't matter what's going on. There will be a moment that the body of the rabbit will stop.
[32:38] B: I'm crying.
[32:40] A: And the rabbit will be completely still, and the body of the rabbit will be completely still. And it will be moments before the fox ever gets to it. And in the moment that the body of the rabbit is completely still, the life force that is the rabbit takes the rabbit away.
[32:58] B: Was like a blank stare in its eyes.
[33:00] A: So the rabbit's no longer in its body. I remember working with a girl who was in a torture situation. She was like, in this prison camp in. The guy who was about to torture her was smoking a cigar and he lit it. It's one of those big, like, you know, what is it? Winston Churchill cigar? So it's like a big fat thing. And he takes the cigar out and he's about to touch the embers to her face. She was gone. Gone.
[33:29] B: Yeah.
[33:30] A: Doesn't remember any of the torture, what he did, what he might have done to her body. She came back into her body because it was over when people outside were going, hey, we've got a way out. Come with us. That's what brought her back. So she wasn't in her body for the stuff that happened. Got it?
[33:56] B: Yeah.
[33:57] A: So if I don't have a recollection, a memory of what happened, it's because I wasn't in my body as it was happening. So as it got to the disgusting part, and I knew I wasn't going to be able to get it to not happen, my mind took me away. So I wasn't there for what they were doing to my body. If we talked at all about, like, when we did grief stuff that you're not your body. Yeah, right. You have a body. Your body is totally yours, but it isn't. You there's not a single cell within your body today that's the same as it was. They've all been replaced. Your feet are longer than they were when you were three, yet despite the changes, you're still you. So you have a body. It's yours. It's not you. Just like your brain is yours, not you. And it's the thinker of your thoughts, not you. And your brain is an organ, like your heart or your lungs or your kidneys, yours, not you. Emotions are yours, but you feel different ways at different times. So you're not a feeling. Things you do certainly aren't what you are because you've done this and then you did that. And when you stop doing one thing to do a different thing, you didn't stop existing. So if you're not what you do, or your thoughts or your feelings or your body, then what the heck are you? Think of a time when you were outdoors in nature.
[35:32] B: You see something beautiful, a fucking wildflower.
[35:40] A: You look outside, you see something beautiful. It's caught your attention, and you're in the moment and you're like, wow, what is it that you see? Yeah. And in the moment that you're seeing the sunset, you feel peaceful and excited. And people tell you, well, yeah, seeing that sunset gives you those feelings. But looking at it differently, what if seeing the sunset drew your awareness in towards your center? And what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited in the same way? There's a candle in the light, and I take my hand and I move it towards the flame and I go, fuck, this is getting hotter. And you say, no, it's not. You're becoming more aware of it. So in your life, we know that there's been occurrences and situations where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. But no matter where awareness has been, always at your center, your peaceful and exciting. Just like, you know, two of us are here. How do you know it? You look around your senses, bringing data, Intellect organizes it. That's knowledge. Light of knowledge. At your center, it's brighter. Light of wisdom. And you know that I work with all sorts of people who've gone through awful stuff. I remember a woman that I worked with really early on, she had an older brother, used to take Matchbox cars and drive them up her leg and park them in her. So she had a lot of guilt and anger in her. Hurt and pain and shame and disgust. And as we worked together and cleared it out and it was gone, all the disgust, the pain, the anger, the hurt gone. And I Asked her the question. I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone. I don't feel it. I said, yes, that's cool. But we go, where was it? And I go, was it surface level? She's like, no. I go, was it at your center? She's like, how could it survive there when we're in peaceful? I said, then where was it? She goes, I know now. It was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I said, what happened? The lights have joined. They're touching. I said, cool. And then we started talking about how me going to the dentist gets really scary. She goes, why? I go, well, you never believe what he does. He goes, what did he do? Well, he put me on a chair and my head went down. She goes, okay, but you're at the dentist. I go, well, then he shined a light in my eyes so I couldn't see. She goes, yeah, but you're at the dentist. I go, then he took a cold metal instrument and shoved it in me. And she's like, in your what? I go, my mouth. I'm at the dentist. Which is the same thing that I said to the woman with her brother in the Matchbox car. I said, when you were little, he messed with her stuff. And she said, he did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and my feeling. Long time. It caused a lot of anger and hurt and disgusted. And then she looked at me, she goes, baby, you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body, but he never got me. And I went, whoa, that's fucking powerful. Right? And I'll show you something. Take your hand, hold it out like that, right? Look at that spot. I'm going to bring my hand towards your hand. As I bring it in closer towards your hand, notice that without my hand touching your hand, you're going to to begin to feel it. Notice how you can feel the warmth and the energy from my hand within the fingers, the palm of your hand. Isn't that interesting that you can feel that energy? Which means I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your stuff or hurt your body. Because who you are in the cool can only be touched when with respect. Can only be touched with respect and love. Right? So you could repeat this after me. I have a nose.
[39:22] B: I have a nose.
[39:23] A: 10 fingers, 10 fingers, 2 elbows, 2 elbows, 10 toes, 10 toes. I'm not my nose, I'm not my nose. My fingers, my fingers, my elbows, my elbows, or my toes, right? I have an ass. I'm not my ass.
[39:36] B: I'm not my ass.
[39:40] A: I have a vagina. Not my vagina.
[39:42] B: I'm not my vagina.
[39:43] A: Right. They mess with my stuff.
[39:46] B: They mess with my stuff.
[39:47] A: But they never touched you. I really am.
[39:49] B: They never touched your.
[39:50] A: They never got me. That's right. They mess with my stuff, but they never touched me. They never touched me. Right? Right. Just check that out for a moment. Right. You can rest that hand down and just check that out for a moment. What do you notice? What do you notice happening?
[40:13] B: Feel better?
[40:14] A: You do feel better, don't you?
[40:16] B: Yeah.
[40:16] A: Right. So do we have to know exactly the ugly of what happened? No. Because when the ugliness of the ugly was happening, what did your brain do? It took you away so you didn't have to be in your body for what was happening that you didn't want happening to your body. And you know when it brought you back, when you could leave? That's right. So you can remember that happening. I'm telling you. Here's what's going to go on. We're going to do this in a, you know, that kind of stuff. We're gonna bring the guy in. Okay. That guy's decent. Decent. Oh, geez. I'm not quite sure. You can remember all that happening, right? You can remember putting on your pretty dress?
[41:06] B: Yeah.
[41:06] A: Right. Well, stop putting on your pretty dress. Say, I'm not putting on my dress. I'm not putting on my pretty dress. Well, then stop them from doing that. Say they're not doing that. Well, stop me from putting on my pants.
[41:15] B: You're not putting on your pants.
[41:16] A: Well, then you stop putting on your necklace.
[41:18] B: I'm not putting on my necklace.
[41:19] A: Well, then stop them from doing that. We'll stop them from doing that to your body. Well, then stop it from happening. It's not happening.
[41:28] B: Yeah.
[41:29] A: So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists. Right. And as that starts to get in, what do you notice happening to those feelings?
[41:37] B: They're far away.
[41:38] A: They are far away. Right. They're not even in the same location that they used to be. Right? Right. Them doing that to your body, did that have anything to do with you? No. What did it have to do with? No. Right. Would it have mattered whether you were some other girl in the same situation? Isn't that what they would have done? Yeah. Right. So it had nothing to do with you. It had to do with them, by the way, that you back then didn't know what you know now didn't know that it wasn't you volunteering for it didn't know that there was some form of manipulation and coercion that caused you to think that, oh, this is like, you know, my role in the gang. You follow me with that? Yeah, right, right. They had it like, oh, well, you know, you're good with this, right? Of course I'm good with it. I'm part of the gang. Wait a minute. Fuck. Right? And see, if you had known back then, in that moment or prior to getting connected, those people, if you had known that that's what it was going to lead to, thought it was going to flip it around. There was going to think like, this is a thing that I'm choosing to do. Yeah, right, right. Like, if I had known float way before me ever getting connected with those people and I'd known that it was going to lead to all that, them selling my body, them getting more of the money, even though I was the workhorse. Like, them telling me that they take care of me, but they don't really take care of me. I take care of them. Like, if I'd known all of that ahead of time. Right. If we could float back along the timeline to the earlier you and she had known everything that you know now, would you have done it? No. Right. But we can't have regret and remorse about shit we didn't know was gonna happen.
[43:35] B: Right.
[43:36] A: We can't have guilt and shame about stuff we didn't know was gonna happen and you didn't know then. Right. So I wonder what it would be like from here to lighten up on the earlier you for having not known here. You don't have to throw your gross tissues in your pretty purse.
[43:52] B: All right? And I'm sick a little bit. Like, I'm getting over it.
[43:58] A: Let me just hide it in my bag.
[44:00] B: I don't know.
[44:01] A: It's what I love about my children. They're like, here you go, dad. What in your mind makes you think that I want to hold your gross. Just nose blown into tissue. Like, or they do it and then leave it in the. Like the door handle.
[44:16] B: Yeah. I don't know. It's gross. They're just.
[44:19] A: It's so. I try to do the same tuning to them when I have, like, stuff in my hand that I don't want to hold on to, I hand it over off to them.
[44:26] B: That's hilarious because they always like. That's actually really funny.
[44:36] A: Yeah. Right. So what would it be like for you to lighten up on the earlier you. Cause you've been angry at her idiot me for having not known.
[44:44] B: Yeah. She didn't know any better. She was sick.
[44:48] A: So what happens? Close your eyes so that you float back and let that earlier your know that she didn't know any better. That she was sick. That's right. That she didn't know any better. But let her know that you got out of it. Let her know that you're here now. Let her know how much you're healing. Let her know how much more okay. You are in you. Let her know that out of getting out of it, you're on your way to completely transforming your life for the better. Right. In a way that truly supports you living a life that works for you. That's right. Let her know, dammit. That they never touched me. They mess with my stuff. That there's no part of your body now that's the same as it was then. All those cells have been replaced at least a million times. Right. What happens is all that happens inside you. Because check it out. Are these, like, you know, tears of, like, sadness?
[45:55] B: No. Damn it. I should be like, damn it.
[45:57] A: Emily.
[45:57] B: One of my friends was crying earlier. And like, it was like a chain reaction. And like, I couldn't. I thought that I couldn't cry.
[46:04] A: Oh, really? And then you came here.
[46:05] B: Is that a thing? No. Like, my friend started crying because something had came up for her in art therapy. And then I started crying. It was like a chain ring.
[46:13] A: And then it's like babies, tuning forks.
[46:16] B: Like the art.
[46:17] A: Did you know that?
[46:18] B: No. Like, it's a thing.
[46:19] A: Oh, it's like babies in tuning forks. You know what happens with babies when baby starts crying, Then the rest of the babies start crying. You hit a tuning fork and you hold it up to another tuning fork. It'll also start to vibrate. And then we'll have a whole symphony of tuning forks. Vibrating.
[46:29] B: Yeah.
[46:30] A: You get one person who's going through stuff. Like you are in a contained environment with the same people, and they start having an emotional reaction. Another person's gonna have emotion. It's like throwing up. Somebody throws a fuck and I throw up. And then you throw. The therapist said, like, chain reaction.
[46:45] B: Yeah, well, she. She said, like, the actual term for it. I was like, I didn't know that was a thing.
[46:50] A: Yeah.
[46:50] B: Like when people yawn or something. Because it was, like, contagious.
[46:52] A: Yeah. Yawning is one of those things. You've been thinking about yawning. Cause somebody yawn.
[46:57] B: That was a fake yawn.
[46:59] A: That's why. Right. Just keep trying not to yawn. Right. Keep trying not to yawn. Whatever. You do. Don't yawn. Keep trying not to. Because the more you resist, the deeper you'll go.
[47:13] B: That's not true.
[47:14] A: Oh, it isn't? How do you know? Or better yet, the more that you're resisting, the deeper you already are in your healing. That's right. So think about that situation, what happened with those people. I try to feel really bad about you. Try to feel the disgust.
[47:36] B: I can't.
[47:37] A: Oh, isn't that cool?
[47:39] B: Yeah.
[47:39] A: Try to feel, like, the anger, you know, anger at yourself.
[47:44] B: I'm shaking my head, but I'm not angry.
[47:47] A: You're not, are you? Right. Because based on the circumstances, situations and everything that was going on with that earlier, you back then, she did all the stuff that occurred for her to do, and she couldn't have not done it.
[47:59] B: Yeah.
[48:00] A: Right. We don't have to like it, but we're glad we're no longer in it because it's better to be on this side than that side. Don't you think?
[48:08] B: Yeah.
[48:10] A: That's why I always go. I get the easiest job in the world. My job is to get the person to no longer be troubled by what they went through. They've already done the hardest part. They went through it.
[48:20] B: Yeah.
[48:21] A: The easier part is to get their brain and know that they're no longer going through it. Right. And you might not have full recollections of all the stuff, but you weren't there, so how could you? Right. Because in the moment that I can't get it to not happen, I go away. Right. It's really common for people who've had, you know, sexual violence that's happened to them. Three years with the same person, they remember the first time. They might even remember the last time. No recollection of any of the times in between. Because it's that inevitability that I couldn't get it to not happen. I don't need to be there for that. I don't need to be there for what's happening in my body, by the way, I'm not even my body. Which takes me to the last part. Right. You have more openness. There's a guy by the name of Sadhguru, Indian guy, of course. Right. And he's got a little meditation. It's called the Isha Kriya. Right.
[49:28] B: What's his last name? Spell it.
[49:30] A: Guru. G U R U Sod. S O D. Guru, like grass Guru. Right. And he's got a little small meditation that he guides people through. It's called the Isha Kriya. And the Isha kriya basically has you listen to him saying, I am not my body, I am not even the mind. I am not my body, I am not even the mind. And he has that go on for about 10 minutes and then he has you pause and then he does a chant, like one of those. Ah. But he does it seven times for the seven chakras. So it goes in and then you're like, ah. And then he does a small little prayer at the end. The whole thing takes like 14 minutes. It's a useful thing. It's on YouTube. It's on all sorts of different things. But it may be something that you might be interested in. And I don't know whether it's something that you can do while you're at Selah, because Selah kind of has different things. But. But maybe if it's something that I told them, maybe they'll let you. I'll talk to Sam, cuz I'll see her next week and maybe we can kind of incorporate something like that. Yeah. Isn't she cool?
[50:45] B: She's a great.
[50:46] A: She's a great human.
[50:47] B: So are you. Yes. No. We're allowed to have other religions as long as we don't practice witchcraft.
[50:54] A: Right.
[50:54] B: And like it's. Yeah. You know what I mean? Because I. You can't relate.
[51:00] A: Yeah.
[51:02] B: But that's great. Thank you. I would love to do something like that. I wondered how, like you can clear your chakras. My mom does the Reiki stuff. Like I'm not like. The only thing I do with like my stones is like put them out in.
[51:18] A: Right.
[51:18] B: A full moon.
[51:20] A: Yeah.
[51:20] B: You know what I mean?
[51:21] A: I have stones. They're all over there.
[51:24] B: What is your favorite?
[51:26] A: Oh, geez. They all have different meaning. So this one, a friend of mine gave it to me. So this one's very special. And this one I got when I went through a transformative process. So that's a cool one. You can look. They're all different ones. All different flavors of different things. Yeah.
[51:58] B: Do you cleanse them?
[52:00] A: Of course I do. With Sage. Sage, yeah. Well, not.
