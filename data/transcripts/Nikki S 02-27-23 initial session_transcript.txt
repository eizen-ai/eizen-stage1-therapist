[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 27th of February, Nikki. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that.
[00:08] B: Yes.
[00:08] A: Given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative. It might be made available in teaching and training other professionals and how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:18] B: Absolutely.
[00:19] A: Awesome. So what would be useful for me to know? What do we actually want to get better for you? Because I can get that there's trauma and I got that lots of. It's decades.
[00:30] B: Yes.
[00:31] A: But nobody would care about anything they went through if it wasn't negatively affecting now.
[00:38] B: Right.
[00:39] A: So that's what I'm more interested in. If we could change for you problematic ways that you've been feeling, thinking, acting, reacting, what do we actually want to get better?
[00:50] B: I would like to. To be aware of the triggers while they're happening instead of after the fact. Because when I'm triggered, when I have a trigger, I just feel in the moment like I'm in danger. And I don't really know it's a trigger until after I kind of come back to my center. I would. I just. I would like maybe some healing.
[01:17] A: So you'd like to stay centered.
[01:20] B: Yes.
[01:20] A: Even if things go on that are reminders of things that you've gone through?
[01:26] B: Yes.
[01:27] A: Because when you say trigger, what do you mean by trigger?
[01:31] B: Well, something will happen. My main triggers are angry men, obsessive men. Sometimes I don't know when I'm. I just feel like I'm in danger and I start freaking out.
[01:47] A: What does freaking out mean?
[01:48] B: I panic.
[01:49] A: What does that mean? Sorry.
[01:52] B: It's okay. No, we'll go into detail. I will. I will start acting very paranoid, thinking everyone's against me. I almost start acting like a little kid. It's almost like I'm going back.
[02:06] A: So you're grossed.
[02:07] B: Yes.
[02:08] A: Okay.
[02:09] B: It feels like. Like an altered state in retrospect, when I come back to my center, like, wow, I was acting like a five year old little girl. Sometimes it's like I feel like I'm a teenager, but I'm that scared little girl that's afraid somebody's gonna hurt her. I feel like I'm in danger. I start panicking. Sometimes it even comes out with anger. I just get very upset and I have all this anger inside.
[02:38] A: Okay. Okay.
[02:41] B: And it's happened. It happens at work Sometimes it's embarrassing.
[02:45] A: Like, how so give me an example of what might you be doing at work when it happens?
[02:50] B: It feels like the world is closing. In on me. Like.
[02:53] A: But what might you be doing?
[02:55] B: I'll be at work. Maybe I'll have an angry customer.
[02:59] A: So like you're serving them?
[03:01] B: Yes, sir. I'm a server. I'm a food and beverage server.
[03:03] A: Okay. So you're in the process of serving and the person's kind of pissed.
[03:07] B: Yeah. And I feel attacked. And I'll start panicking. Like I'll be like, I don't know what to do.
[03:15] A: It feels like the world's closing.
[03:17] B: Yes. And it feels like impending doom. Like something terrible is going to happen. Or like the sense of I'm in danger.
[03:27] A: Okay.
[03:28] B: And I just become. My behavior becomes erratic. I go into panic mode. Everyone around me can notice that something's wrong. They're very supportive at my job. They kind of have an idea that I've been through some stuff and they're all very helpful.
[03:46] A: Okay.
[03:46] B: They don't hold it against me, which is very good.
[03:49] A: Yeah.
[03:51] B: And at home, I have a 21 year old at home and she has been through so much because of these triggers. Let's say I meet a guy. He. I'm attracting the same kind of guy. I'll just put that out there right now.
[04:08] A: Oh, so you have a bad picker.
[04:10] B: Terrible. Terrible. And I always seem to pick the ones that are going to trigger me. Seems inevitable. But I don't even know if I dated a healthy guy. At this point in my healing journey, I feel like I would still get triggered because it's me that needs to heal. But I'll start if I get triggered.
[04:32] A: And this might mean he might do what? He might be obsessive. He might be.
[04:36] B: I'll give a good example. I had a guy. It was almost a year ago is when I. I got triggered really bad. This guy showed up to my complex. He didn't know where I lived. He starts knocking on my neighbors doors. Do you know where Nikki lives? Can I use your phone? Just lived in a halfway house, which is probably not the best choice for me. But I am in recovery. So I kind of felt like it might have been a good thing. But he starts knocking on my door. I didn't know he was there. Triggered the shit out of me.
[05:15] A: We got scared, nervous really. Why is this guy who didn't know where I live now here.
[05:20] B: Yeah. And I was right back to yeah. And I mean it's. My heart is racing. I'm panicking. I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go. I feel like my kid was in danger. I was in Danger. And it didn't go away. It lasted for.
[05:33] A: Did you answer the door?
[05:35] B: No.
[05:36] A: Well, then you knew what to do.
[05:37] B: Yes.
[05:38] A: Which was not answer the door. Not good job.
[05:40] B: Yes. And I had some.
[05:41] A: Oh, so you actually knew what to do.
[05:42] B: I did, yes.
[05:43] A: You just didn't think you did.
[05:45] B: Yeah, I didn't think I did.
[05:47] A: Right. But you did.
[05:49] B: I did wind up drinking after that. Yeah.
[05:55] A: You actually knew what to do while it was happening?
[05:57] B: I did, I guess. Yeah. Don't answer the door. But, yeah, I was terrified, and I went on a bender shortly after. Like that day. I wound up drinking before work. Showed up to work under the influence. Didn't lose my job because of it, but I spent the next month drinking.
[06:21] A: Okay.
[06:23] B: Kind of trying to deal with the feelings.
[06:25] A: Okay, so they last a lot longer than you want them to do.
[06:28] B: Yes. That's. That kind of is. The shocker is that it's not like I have a trigger. Work through it. It's. I just stay in those panicky feelings for a while. I've been doing pretty good lately because I've been sober. I gave up the medical marijuana, too, because I came back to Selah, and I want to work through my triggers rather than just reach for the marijuana when I'm triggered, which was very effective in the moment to kind of ground me. But in the long term, it was kind of keeping me emotionally stunted. But I have been sober from alcohol for almost five months.
[07:09] A: Cool.
[07:10] B: And from the marijuana for four months.
[07:12] A: Wow.
[07:12] B: Yeah.
[07:13] A: Right. Good job.
[07:14] B: Thank you.
[07:14] A: Yeah. And are those typically the drug of choice, or was there something else that was.
[07:19] B: I've been clean from IV drugs for over four years.
[07:24] A: Oh, that's fantastic.
[07:25] B: Yes.
[07:25] A: Wow.
[07:26] B: Yep.
[07:26] A: Yeah.
[07:27] B: And I kind of just. My recovery with alcohol has been off and on over the past four years. I'd get four months here and there, five months here and there, and wind up drinking over a trigger. I used to work at Gekkos. It was a different job than I'm at now. And my boss was a hothead, like, very.
[07:47] A: So he would set it off.
[07:49] B: I was constantly in a trigger, and I didn't really realize that was happening until I left jobs, and I don't deal with that now. So I'm more in my center at this job. And so in retrospect, I was like, holy crap. I was constantly.
[08:04] A: Damn it, if I had known that.
[08:06] B: Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I was like a panicked child at my job, constantly feeling like everybody was judging me, I was doing something wrong. I was almost like that scared little Girl that's trying to please.
[08:24] A: So really self conscious?
[08:25] B: Very self conscious. Yeah.
[08:28] A: Okay. So the thing when you get triggered is you lose being resourceful. You don't feel like you know what to do or how to handle it.
[08:38] B: Yes.
[08:39] A: You feel really, really scared and on edge. There's a whole bunch of like worry and worry about what others might be thinking and worry whether I'm gonna be able to handle or. Or.
[08:51] B: Or. Yes.
[08:52] A: Okay, so we'd like that to stop.
[08:55] B: Yes.
[08:55] A: Okay, cool. What else would be useful for me to know? Well, what else do we want to get better?
[09:06] B: Maybe believing more in myself.
[09:09] A: How do you know that you don't? I don't believe in yourself now?
[09:13] B: I have a lot of self doubt. It's getting a lot better.
[09:18] A: How do you know that you have a lot of self doubt? Um, have you ever doubted the doubt?
[09:24] B: No.
[09:25] A: I wonder what would happen if you started doubting the doubt.
[09:30] B: Me too.
[09:31] A: Right, Right. I have a lot of self doubt. How do you know?
[09:38] B: Negative thoughts about myself.
[09:40] A: Okay.
[09:40] B: Negative beliefs that I'm not good enough.
[09:43] A: Okay. I wonder what would happen if you started doubting the doubt whether you're not good enough.
[09:51] B: Right. I'd probably get a lot better quicker.
[09:56] A: It might, huh?
[09:57] B: Yeah.
[09:58] A: Okay. Yeah. Cause I mean, if you've got a lot of self doubt, you might as well start doubting whether you're good enough.
[10:06] B: Yeah.
[10:06] A: Right?
[10:09] B: Yeah.
[10:10] A: Okay. So lot. It's kind of interesting what's happening now.
[10:15] B: Yeah. I mean, it makes sense.
[10:18] A: It does. Well, how's your body feeling?
[10:21] B: A little tense and a little calm at the same time.
[10:23] A: Isn't that weird?
[10:24] B: Yeah.
[10:24] A: Yeah. Right. Okay. So there's a lot of more negative, critical thoughts about you, about your ability.
[10:32] B: Yeah.
[10:33] A: About whether you're good enough sometimes when you're in that distress state. Whether I can handle this or what to do. So a lot more inward, a lot more self conscious about what others might be thinking about.
[10:47] B: Yes. Borderline obsessive.
[10:49] A: Okay.
[10:50] B: I've been doing a lot of work on that. Of just catching those thoughts.
[10:54] A: Okay.
[10:55] B: And, and affirming, you know, the truth that I'm loved, I am capable. So I've. I've been doing a lot of work. It's constant.
[11:05] A: It's a lot of work though.
[11:06] B: It really is it really to try.
[11:08] A: To convince yourself constantly of something that you don't always believe.
[11:12] B: Right, Right. But I mean, I, it became. When I say obsessive, like if I'm passing somebody by at work, I'm looking in their eyes for some kind of confirmation. It's Very strange. And if they don't meet me with what I think is some confirming look, I will spin out in my head with all these narratives of trying to figure out what I did wrong to upset them.
[11:41] A: What.
[11:42] B: What? Why they don't like me. And it's. It used to be worse at my last job. It's not as bad now, but I still catch myself doing it.
[11:52] A: Okay, so a lot. We'd like that to stop.
[11:55] B: Yes.
[11:56] A: So that you're not thinking so much about yourself.
[12:00] B: Yes.
[12:02] A: Because that's what it is.
[12:03] B: Yeah.
[12:04] A: Right. You're thinking lots about you and then spinning out what you think they might be thinking about you.
[12:14] B: Yes.
[12:14] A: Right?
[12:15] B: Yes.
[12:15] A: Yeah.
[12:16] B: Yeah. And it cripples.
[12:17] A: Maybe we want to realize that not everything's about you, Nikki.
[12:20] B: Yes. I would love to realize that maybe.
[12:23] A: It'S not all about you.
[12:24] B: It's like a self obsession and like this fear of not being approved of.
[12:31] A: Oh, okay. By somebody that you walk by.
[12:36] B: By my co workers, my managers, my customers, everybody, I guess. Yeah.
[12:43] A: Yeah. Okay. You and my daughter, Whether she approves of you or not.
[12:49] B: Yeah.
[12:50] A: She doesn't always. No, no.
[12:53] B: That's okay.
[12:54] A: It is, isn't it?
[12:55] B: Yes.
[12:55] A: Right. What if it didn't matter so much?
[12:58] B: I would love to get to that.
[13:00] A: Right. Like, I mean, what if it didn't matter so much what they thought about you? Because what's going on is that you're thinking that what they think about you means something about you.
[13:09] B: Right.
[13:10] A: What if when you realize that they're thinking something about you, it doesn't mean anything about you at all, it means stuff about them.
[13:16] B: Right.
[13:18] A: That when you interact with other people, you actually don't learn anything about you.
[13:21] B: Right.
[13:22] A: You learn about them and you might learn about how they might be thinking about something you said or did, but you're not actually learning about you, you're learning about them. And if you're learning that they're upset over something you said or did based on who it is, we want you to have the freedom in terms of how you respond, which might be with care and compassion, Understanding, acknowledgment. Oh, my goodness. I didn't realize. Or with other people. Yeah. Affirm. Direct. Oh, that's really what I was saying. Or other people goes. Okay, I'm on to the next. We want that flexibility and freedom.
[13:56] B: Yes.
[13:56] A: We want you to be much more okay. In you.
[13:58] B: Yes.
[13:59] A: Much more comfortable in your own skin.
[14:01] B: Yes.
[14:02] A: Right. So it's not so easy to knock you off center.
[14:05] B: Yes.
[14:06] A: Yeah.
[14:07] B: Yes. And I have made.
[14:08] A: We Want it to stop being up here.
[14:10] B: Yes.
[14:11] A: Because I get knocked off center. If it's all up here, we want it to be down here.
[14:17] B: Yeah. And I like blamed it on being sensitive and to energy and you could.
[14:25] A: Be a high an HSPer.
[14:27] B: Yeah.
[14:28] A: Know what that is?
[14:29] B: No.
[14:30] A: Highly sensitive person.
[14:31] B: Yeah. I believe that I am. I get thrown off so easily by other people's emotional state or energy. What they're putting off.
[14:42] A: Yeah.
[14:43] B: But I know that I don't have to. I know that that is me agreeing to being thrown off.
[14:51] A: Not consciously.
[14:52] B: No, not consciously. And eventually I'd like to be able to date again. It's been four.
[14:58] A: Just not that kind of guy.
[15:00] B: No.
[15:01] A: No. And probably not guys who are like, you know, in halfway houses or the ones that you meet at meetings.
[15:07] B: Right, right, right. I have this belief that like everybody would trigger me.
[15:14] A: Okay.
[15:15] B: That it's just not safe to date at all.
[15:18] A: Okay.
[15:18] B: Because I am not healed yet.
[15:22] A: Okay.
[15:23] B: But I mean, eventually I would like to be able to. Let's say somebody's just. I'm dating a healthy guy, but he's not perfect and he's not human. And I have some relationships.
[15:34] A: He's not human.
[15:34] B: I mean, not.
[15:35] A: That would be really fucking weird.
[15:37] B: Well, I do believe in him.
[15:38] A: I'm dating this non human man.
[15:40] B: I'm kind of rambling.
[15:42] A: Nicki. It's so good. But he is human. I don't. Human dog. I don't know why it's so weird.
[15:48] B: That is so weird. I do believe in aliens. I don't know where that came in.
[15:52] A: People have lizard people, all sorts of weird stuff, you know?
[15:55] B: Well, I mean, he is human. So he's going to fuck up.
[15:59] A: Yeah.
[16:00] B: And I feel like at this point in my healing journey that I wouldn't be able to handle just normal relationship or dating.
[16:08] A: Yeah.
[16:09] B: Human.
[16:09] A: So then that's really smart.
[16:11] B: Yeah.
[16:11] A: To not date right now.
[16:12] B: Yeah. Not date. Right.
[16:13] A: Right. And you got to flip around how you go about dating.
[16:17] B: Yes.
[16:19] A: Because you have a bad picker.
[16:20] B: Bad.
[16:21] A: Right. You said it. I keep picking whether they're healthy or not. Guys that trigger the same stuff that makes me feel regressed. And to a little girl.
[16:33] B: Yeah. Yes.
[16:35] A: Totally. Knock me off center.
[16:37] B: Totally.
[16:38] A: Yeah. We'd like that to stop.
[16:39] B: Yes.
[16:40] A: Right. So they get to be much more centered and grounded in you.
[16:44] B: Yes. But I don't want it to be off the table forever. And sometimes, like when.
[16:51] A: Well, definitely have some urgency to it.
[16:54] B: You know.
[16:55] A: That's real attractive in gals.
[16:58] B: Hurry up, date me.
[17:01] A: That's never how it works. No, for it to be successful. Right. Gal is not the one that chases guy. Ever. She lets guy know that I'm available to be chased, but then she makes him work.
[17:20] B: Yeah.
[17:21] A: Because I'm worth it.
[17:23] B: Yeah. Not there yet.
[17:26] A: Right. Female panther never runs down male panther, even when she's in heat, running them down, going, fuck me, fuck me, Come on, fuck me. Doesn't happen.
[17:34] B: Nope.
[17:35] A: She lets him know and then she makes him work.
[17:39] B: Yeah.
[17:40] A: Right.
[17:43] B: I would like to have a healthy relationship eventually.
[17:46] A: Women who have successful relationships with men are women who hold the keys. They're a little less available to the guy than the guy would want them to be.
[17:57] B: Right.
[17:58] A: They trained the guy that if you're gonna ask me out to go out on Friday night, you need to ask me by Wednesday.
[18:04] B: Right.
[18:06] A: If you ask me on Thursday or Friday, I'm busy. Even if I have nothing to do.
[18:11] B: Right. I don't know what that feels like.
[18:15] A: Right. I hold the keys. Women have the goods, they have what the guy is interested in. So I hold the keys. Women who hold the keys have successful relationships because women are the regulators, not men. Women are yeses when they want to, nos when they don't. Men are always yeses.
[18:41] B: I have a hard time saying, saying.
[18:42] A: No, I get that. That's where it's been off.
[18:48] B: Yeah.
[18:49] A: Right. Because if a woman is always yes, it's not good.
[18:52] B: Yeah.
[18:53] A: She's supposed to be a no. She's the regulator.
[18:55] B: Right.
[18:56] A: She's the one that is supposed to determine the where and the when, the how much and the how far and the with whom. Not him. Cuz he's. Yes. Always. Right. The silly example, if you wake a guy up at 3:30 in the morning, he's got to be to work at 6 and I'm really horny, I want him. He goes, okay, try to do that. Get it away. Ew, God. What are you doing? There's a difference.
[19:27] B: I would like to not get triggered.
[19:30] A: As much like triggered as much like in dating, triggered as much in like sexual intimacy.
[19:40] B: I don't really get triggered in sexual intimacy.
[19:42] A: Okay.
[19:43] B: I was a sex addict for a long time.
[19:48] A: Whether there is that or not.
[19:50] B: Whether there is that or not.
[19:51] A: Right.
[19:52] B: Yeah.
[19:52] A: It's kind of a compulsion more than an addiction.
[19:55] B: Yeah. I mean, I was definitely the aggressor.
[20:01] A: Yeah.
[20:01] B: Or the pursuer.
[20:02] A: Yeah.
[20:03] B: Like I felt.
[20:04] A: Well, it doesn't work that way.
[20:06] B: No.
[20:06] A: No. Because men are easy.
[20:08] B: Yeah.
[20:08] A: We're not hard. If a guy sees a gal that's interested in him and she comes over and says, hey, you want to come home and have sex? He goes, yeah. If a guy sees a gal that seems to be a little interested, goes, hey, you want to come home and have sex? She goes, what's wrong with you?
[20:21] B: Yeah.
[20:25] A: You don't get to ask me that up front. There is a pecking order that you gotta go through before you can ask that question.
[20:32] B: Yes. When I hear loud.
[20:35] A: So when women have sex like men, that's when they get in trouble. When men pursue men, when women have sex like a guy. When a woman has a one night stand sex with a guy, not good for her.
[20:48] B: And they don't respect that.
[20:50] A: Right. Well, it's not that they don't respect it even. It's that it's backwards. The lure never runs after the fish. The lure dances provocatively, says, come here, fishy fishy, and then moves away. Doesn't chase, doesn't go after. Right. That's the setup. That's what's been off.
[21:20] B: Yeah.
[21:21] A: Right.
[21:23] B: I think there's a core belief that I'm not worthy. I'm not good enough.
[21:30] A: Not at the center, though. No, it's not that core belief.
[21:34] B: Yeah.
[21:35] A: Is not at the center.
[21:36] B: It's not the truth.
[21:37] A: Oh, it's not the truth because you said I keep getting knocked off center and I want to be centered. But if at the center is the core belief.
[21:49] B: So there's just a belief somewhere that I'm not.
[21:51] A: I don't know. It's something that you've been believing. I don't think that there's a thing called a belief that's sitting there. Okay, I get that it's something that you've been believing about you.
[21:59] B: Okay.
[22:00] A: That because you've been believing it, you've been thinking it's the truth even if it isn't.
[22:05] B: Okay.
[22:07] A: Right. We want to get it so that you're good enough for you.
[22:11] B: Yeah.
[22:11] A: Right. What's happening now? You're doing great. What are you noticing?
[22:21] B: That a lot of the beliefs that I've held.
[22:25] A: Yeah.
[22:25] B: Are not who I am. Are not at my center.
[22:29] A: Yeah. It's just stuff that you've been believing.
[22:32] B: Yeah.
[22:33] A: And because you've been believing it, you've been thinking it's truth. Right. The good news is, because it's something you've been believing, we can believe all sorts of other things about you that are true. Right. That's what we want to be doing.
[22:52] B: Yes.
[22:53] A: We want you to lighten up in you. We want you to be more comfortable in you.
[22:58] B: Yes.
[22:59] A: We want you to be more at peace in you.
[23:01] B: Yes.
[23:03] A: Yeah. We want you to experience other people's stuff as being about them, not me.
[23:10] B: Yes.
[23:10] A: So that you see it clearly for what it is. Right. You want to get it so that you're good enough for you.
[23:21] B: Yeah, yeah.
[23:24] A: Right. And literally have it set up that I don't need a man.
[23:30] B: Yes.
[23:31] A: Right.
[23:33] B: My value does not depend upon whether.
[23:36] A: I have a guy or not.
[23:37] B: Right, Right. And I even pride myself on that because I've been single for so long, but I still have that loneliness, you know, feeling. It's still. I still kind of obsess about it.
[23:53] A: Yeah, I got it. That you're just not dating.
[23:55] B: Right.
[23:56] A: That hasn't changed the programming.
[23:58] B: Right.
[23:59] A: That's showing up that if I don't have somebody, that I'm not good enough. Right. We want it more like the sunset. Who doesn't need you or I there in order for it to be beautiful?
[24:14] B: Right.
[24:16] A: It's beautiful regardless of whether we're seeing it. Make sense?
[24:21] B: Yes.
[24:22] A: Now I'm watching the sunset, I get to experience its beauty. I don't need somebody with me to experience the beauty in the sunset. So it's beautiful. I get to experience the beauty in it. I could have somebody with me and maybe we're sharing, you know, cheese and crackers, but I don't need that person in order for me to be experiencing the beauty.
[24:49] B: Yes.
[24:51] A: Got it.
[24:52] B: Yes.
[24:52] A: That's what we want shifted.
[24:54] B: Yes.
[24:54] A: Yeah. So it's not a need it might add to.
[24:58] B: Right.
[24:59] A: But not necessary.
[25:01] B: Right?
[25:01] A: Yeah. Okay, cool. What else would be useful for me to know? I know what to do about that stuff, Nikki.
[25:09] B: I mean.
[25:14] A: Other than like, using stuff. How'd you get hooked up with Selah?
[25:21] B: I. I witnessed my mother's death when I was two and a half. That's when I was diagnosed with PTSD, way back in the 80s. They didn't really know that much about it. We were in a car accident. My dad chased us off the road.
[25:38] A: So.
[25:38] B: So he was responsible for her death. I got out of the car, saw her head broken, started having nightmares. Then I was raised by my abusive, alcoholic father. He sexualized women.
[25:52] A: What does that mean?
[25:53] B: Like at a party. And I remember these memories so clearly. It's crazy. Like, my short term memory is screwed, but I remember when I was 2, 3 years old, those things got seared in there, man. Yeah, I remember one. One memory in particular. We were at a party. You know, 80s, wild parties, take your kids to them. It was just. Nobody gave a shit back then. He would whisper in My ear. Nicole, go tell that girl to take her shirt off. Lift her shirt up for me. And I remember going over and everybody thought it was cute and she'd do it. I started lifting up my shirt in preschool and it attracted a pedophile to me. I got molested in preschool. Became obsessive about sexuality from a very early age. I was discovered by a trafficker at the age of 14. I didn't know he was my trafficker until I found Selah. It was so like normalized in my brain that I thought that's just what girlfriends did. Thought he was my boyfriend.
[26:55] A: Is that sex with other people? Yeah.
[26:57] B: For the drugs and money and parties and hookups.
[26:59] A: I mean it is totally.
[27:00] B: Yeah.
[27:02] A: I'm surprised.
[27:03] B: I remember that aha moment where I was like, that's normal.
[27:06] A: Really normal.
[27:08] B: That wasn't my boyfriend.
[27:09] A: Oh, right. Yes.
[27:12] B: Then I wanted to get away from my dad. So I met 27 year old when I was 17. Had kids right out of high school, put my babies in the hospital, did time in prison for it. But the head trauma that I witnessed for my mom, my ex husband shattered my baby's skull.
[27:36] A: Oh my.
[27:37] B: She survived. She survived. It was a miracle. But that was the worst of my ptsd, I think because the original trauma being so similar with the head trauma. I'd be at work so somebody would walk in with a baby and I run in the bathroom and just scream and cry for hours. I couldn't really function in society. It was fucked. Yeah. I got.
[28:09] A: How you doing right now?
[28:10] B: I'm doing okay. I'm feeling the anxiety.
[28:12] A: We'll get here. You're telling me about historical stuff.
[28:16] B: Yeah.
[28:16] A: So I want you to get here because guess what? Being here with me.
[28:20] B: Yeah.
[28:20] A: Is way more fun than that fucked up shit that happened to you.
[28:23] B: Way more fun.
[28:24] A: Okay.
[28:24] B: That was not fun.
[28:25] A: None of that was fun. No. So I want you to be here with me.
[28:29] B: It feels like a lifetime.
[28:30] A: I bet.
[28:31] B: You know what I mean? Where.
[28:32] A: Except now I have that. I mean they at least have like, you know, some sort of happy fucking ending.
[28:38] B: Right? Right.
[28:41] A: I don't know why all the Christmas movies either has a mom that's dead or a dad that's dead.
[28:45] B: Right.
[28:45] A: Every fucking Hallmark Christmas movie, Lifetime movie. It's a dead parent.
[28:50] B: Yeah. Yeah. Quite that. Anyway, so we got that feel like I'm a part of, you know.
[28:56] A: Right. Yay me.
[29:01] B: It's just I've been three long term relationships. Abusive, abusive, abusive.
[29:07] A: Okay.
[29:08] B: I got led back out to prostitution in my 30s when I lost Custody of my kids because of violence against me.
[29:17] A: Okay.
[29:17] B: And there were drugs involved and alcohol.
[29:21] A: Yeah.
[29:22] B: I found recovery. Met a guy in an na. After I lost my kids.
[29:26] A: Yeah.
[29:27] B: I just gave up. I just didn't want to be alive anymore. And he started kind of pushing me to do that when we were in our addiction.
[29:36] A: Sure.
[29:37] B: And I found my way back to prostitution.
[29:39] A: Sure.
[29:41] B: It's kind of what I knew.
[29:44] A: Fast way.
[29:44] B: Yeah. So I was out there for about four years, you know, doing drugs to support my habit. The guy was very emotionally abusive. Physically abusive a few times, but not on a daily basis.
[30:00] A: Okay.
[30:01] B: But I was constantly in a trigger with him as well. I mean, looking back, in retrospect, I didn't know it back then, of course, not until. But I found Selah when I got clean back in 2019.
[30:12] A: Okay.
[30:13] B: I did the genogram.
[30:15] A: You did? Did you do that with Ally? With Christine? With.
[30:18] B: I think it was Ally.
[30:19] A: Okay.
[30:20] B: It changed my life. That's when I knew in that moment that Eric was his name. He was me fixing my daddy issues. It was my pattern. That's when I really. It took me about a year to leave. Leave after that.
[30:35] A: That's fine.
[30:36] B: But I did.
[30:37] A: Yeah. Good for you.
[30:37] B: I did. I. Every time he would gaslight me or insult me, I saw my father and I couldn't escape it. It was just. Every time.
[30:48] A: Yeah.
[30:48] B: And I'm like that. He's exactly like my father. So it took me about a year. I finally left. I got an apartment with my 18 year old, who's now 21.
[30:57] A: Right.
[30:58] B: She's seen a lot of shit go down with my mental illness and my drinking, but she's seen me come so far.
[31:05] A: Yeah.
[31:06] B: I haven't been in a relationship since.
[31:09] A: Good idea.
[31:09] B: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
[31:12] A: So you got a lot of wisdom in you.
[31:13] B: I do.
[31:14] A: Yeah.
[31:15] B: I do.
[31:15] A: I really do.
[31:16] B: I have a lot of willingness.
[31:17] A: Mm. We just need to get you free.
[31:21] B: Yeah.
[31:22] A: And lay down some new tracks.
[31:24] B: Yeah.
[31:25] A: And rewire some of the stuff that happened.
[31:27] B: Yes.
[31:28] A: So it doesn't have a negative impact on you.
[31:32] B: Yes.
[31:32] A: Because from a logical level, you can look back and realize that the fucked up stuff is why I don't always feel that I'm enough.
[31:41] B: Yes. Like a programming.
[31:44] A: Yeah. It's faulty wiring.
[31:46] B: Yes.
[31:47] A: Yeah. We want to get that rewired.
[31:49] B: Yes.
[31:49] A: Okay. So again, you get to be more at peace in you.
[31:53] B: Yes.
[31:53] A: Emotionally present, dealing with the stuff that is happening without the effect of what has.
[32:00] B: Yes.
[32:01] A: A lot lighter, clear and free. Much more at peace. Good. In here.
[32:10] B: Yes.
[32:10] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[32:12] B: Able to just work through life's normal crap.
[32:15] A: Right. So that you start being attracted did to and attracting guys that are. Well, yes, that would be useful.
[32:25] B: Yes.
[32:25] A: Okay, Very. I can get behind doing that.
[32:28] B: Okay.
[32:29] A: Yeah. Any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know.
[32:38] B: I have control issues.
[32:39] A: What does that mean?
[32:42] B: I hyper fixate on what my daughter's doing and how she's living her life out of fear that she's gonna go down the same road that I did.
[32:51] A: Did she?
[32:52] B: No.
[32:53] A: Get with a 27 year old and have babies right away?
[32:56] B: No.
[32:57] A: Oh, okay.
[32:58] B: No.
[32:59] A: Oh, right. Maybe we wanna include that too.
[33:02] B: Yes. I would like to give her more space to fuck up and be human.
[33:09] A: Yeah.
[33:10] B: I wanna be more healthy for her.
[33:15] A: And you don't realize that what you went through actually helps guide her.
[33:21] B: No.
[33:22] A: Huh. You haven't been considering that at all?
[33:24] B: No. This fear that she's just going down.
[33:30] A: The same path, itching to, you know, have fucked up shit happen to her.
[33:35] B: Oh, no. Maybe subconsciously.
[33:39] A: It's interesting, right?
[33:40] B: Yeah.
[33:43] A: I mean, sometimes it is in the teaching that we experience of the people around us that help us and guide us. Right, Right. Yeah. We want to get the whole thing shifted so that you don't feel like you've got to be on top of her. Managing.
[34:03] B: Yes.
[34:04] A: Her every move.
[34:05] B: Yes. Yes.
[34:08] A: I actually want to think of her also as having some wisdom.
[34:12] B: Yeah.
[34:13] A: Still 21, but having some wisdom.
[34:16] B: It emotionally triggers her when I don't treat her like she's capable. And then I feel like an a hole going back in that pattern time and time again, even though I'm trying not to, you know.
[34:29] A: Well, you are treating her like she's not capable.
[34:32] B: Yes.
[34:33] A: Because you haven't been feeling like you are capable. Huh.
[34:37] B: Yeah, that makes sense.
[34:38] A: Right? Right. So we want you to be knowing that you're capable too.
[34:44] B: So I'm projecting it on her, basically.
[34:46] A: Well, that's big, big, big psychology terms.
[34:50] B: Yeah.
[34:51] A: I just kind of think of it that. Yeah, part of what's going on is you don't feel like you're capable or weren't capable then, aren't always capable now. So you're really worried whether she is.
[35:03] B: Yes.
[35:04] A: And then she feels like you don't think she is.
[35:06] B: Yes.
[35:07] A: And it's not that you actually don't think she is, it's that you're worried. What if she's not?
[35:12] B: Yes.
[35:15] A: Because you're interested in, you know, her being protected.
[35:18] B: Yeah.
[35:19] A: You want her to be. Okay.
[35:20] B: There's good intention behind it.
[35:21] A: Yeah. There Is.
[35:22] B: Yeah.
[35:22] A: Yeah. Okay.
[35:24] B: I would like that to stop.
[35:26] A: I bet.
[35:27] B: I really would. For her sake and mine.
[35:30] A: Yeah. Right, right, right. What else would be useful for me to know? What else? Are we wanting to get better for you? That's a good breath. Thank you. That was a really good breath.
[35:46] B: Thank you. I would like to heal the trauma.
[35:56] A: Do you know why trauma sticks?
[35:58] B: No.
[35:59] A: Do you want to know?
[36:00] B: Yes.
[36:00] A: Okay. The only reason why trauma sticks. Oh, by the way, I never told you why I'm sitting on a funny pillow.
[36:07] B: Why are you sitting on a pillow?
[36:07] A: I'm sitting on a funny pillow not because I have a hemorrhoid, but I'm sitting on a funny pillow because I've been working with this body worker who's having me strengthen my pelvic floor. And she said, if you sit on this damn pillow, then it sits you up and it sits in the right spot, and then you can work on strengthening. So that's why I'm caring.
[36:22] B: Core.
[36:23] A: Yes.
[36:24] B: I'll sit down.
[36:25] A: No, you don't have to.
[36:27] B: I like posture.
[36:28] A: Good.
[36:29] B: Posture is good.
[36:30] A: So trauma, emotional wounds don't stay on because of how bad they were.
[36:34] B: Okay.
[36:35] A: They stay on only because when they happened, part of the brain short circuited.
[36:39] B: Okay.
[36:40] A: What that means is at that deeper emotional level, that part doesn't know it's over.
[36:47] B: Okay.
[36:48] A: I do. That part doesn't.
[36:51] B: Okay.
[36:51] A: So notice when you started to tell me about the different things that had happened, both with dad and then the guy and the other thing, and then you started to feel. What did I. What did I ask? How you doing right now?
[37:02] B: Yes.
[37:02] A: Right. You're like, I'm kind of feeling a little. What did I say to you? Get here with me.
[37:08] B: Yeah.
[37:08] A: Hi. Because I'm more fun.
[37:09] B: Yeah.
[37:10] A: Being here with me is way more fun than those moments. I want you here.
[37:13] B: Yes.
[37:14] A: So what does that tell us? You started feeling bad about that stuff. Not because that stuff was bad, but you were literally being transported back to those moments even though you were sitting here.
[37:29] B: Right.
[37:30] A: Got it.
[37:31] B: Yes.
[37:31] A: That doesn't happen for physical injury. I break my arm when I'm 11. If, as I was telling you about how I broke my arm when I was 11 right now, and I started to get emotional and well up with some anxiety, you'd be looking at me like, what the is wrong with him?
[37:48] B: Yeah.
[37:49] A: His arm is fine. Right?
[37:52] B: Yeah.
[37:52] A: But we don't do that with emotions. Because if I told you about what my Uncle Mark did to me when I was 11 and I started to get emotional, you'd be like, oh, yeah, of course.
[38:00] B: Right.
[38:00] A: So we have the idea is that I'm troubled because that was bad. I'm troubled because my brain doesn't know the bad thing ended, that I survived it, that I moved through it, that I'm okay, That's the first part. The second part, because it was bad when I was little and impressionable, I was lied to by all things in culture, anybody in authority, parents. All the TV shows, movies, books, stories geared for little children reinforce the same message. Good happens when I'm good. Great life is always good. It isn't bad happens when I'm being bad. Bad happens because I did something wrong. If it was bad, it's my fault. Make sense?
[38:53] B: Yeah.
[38:54] A: So not only as I go through those things, what starts to make me feel worse is the meaning that has me feel like it was somewhat my fault, that I should have known better, that I shouldn't have put myself in that situation, or I just let that one happen.
[39:10] B: Yeah.
[39:10] A: All the stuff goes on.
[39:12] B: Yes.
[39:12] A: Right. Once they're stuck, what is my brain gonna do? It's the thing that you keep calling my triggers.
[39:18] B: Right.
[39:19] A: Some of them are conscious. Some of them are not conscious. Some of them might go, oh, I know the reason that I'm feeling this way is because of that thing. Some I have no idea why I'm feeling this way. I just am.
[39:29] B: Yep.
[39:31] A: Right. All of them are on because my brain at that deeper level, looking through a very narrow lens, is scanning the environment for anything that could be similar to anything that I went through. That was painful.
[39:43] B: That is how my life feels.
[39:45] A: Right. But similar gets confused as identical. Yes, that's the error.
[39:52] B: Okay.
[39:53] A: It doesn't get read as similar. It gets read as same. So my friend was mugged by somebody wearing a red hoodie in Target 10 years ago. She has a five year old, he has a friend come over. It's cold. The friend that comes over happens to be wearing a red hoodie. Maybe not even red, just a black one or a blue one. And she's got this weird sense about this little kid. I don't really like him that much. I don't know what it is about him now. Maybe she knows it's the hoodie, maybe she doesn't. Maybe it's structurally similar enough. Like it was red and she gets red hoodies, but maybe it was a blue hoodie. She doesn't even really know why she's not liking this other kid. She's not thinking, oh, the reason that I don't like the kid is Because I got mugged 10 years ago in Target. Right. And when she got mugged in Target, was the problem that the person wore a red hoodie or was the problem that she got mugged? You follow me?
[41:07] B: Yes.
[41:08] A: The red hoodie wasn't even the disturbing part of the situation.
[41:12] B: It was just a part of the memory.
[41:13] A: Yes. Right. And maybe it happened at, you know, 3:30 in the afternoon. So I don't know why at 3:30 in the afternoon I feel a little down all the time. But you know, I know that, you know, some people need to get their second wind. Again, 3:30 wasn't the issue.
[41:35] B: Right.
[41:37] A: The time of day that it happened was not the thing that troubled her. What he did was what troubled her.
[41:44] B: Right.
[41:45] A: Makes sense.
[41:46] B: Yeah. So our brain just doesn't make sense of it logically. Right.
[41:50] A: Completely makes sense of it emotionally. Because the emotional brain isn't logical and it searches for patterns of association. Association.
[41:58] B: Yeah.
[41:59] A: So therefore, if it occurred around the same time, then it's merged as if it's a part of the problem. That's why we get triggered all the time. And I don't even know why I'm getting triggered. Some of them make sense. Oh, I get it. That guy reminds me of some of them. Like, I don't even know why I'm. But they're all running the same program in me. And the programming error is my brain at a deeper level, doesn't know it ended. Doesn't know I made it through it. Doesn't know I survived it. Doesn't know I'm okay. Doesn't know it wasn't my fault. Doesn't know it didn't happen because I didn't do anything wrong. It just fucking happened.
[42:54] B: Yeah.
[42:56] A: Makes sense.
[42:56] B: Yeah. Makes a lot of sense.
[42:58] A: That's what we want to get shifted. Right. We want to update the part of the brain that doesn't know certain things have ended so that part gets to realize that you made it through it and you're okay. Makes sense.
[43:15] B: That'd be nice.
[43:16] A: We want that part to also integrate so that you can be a grownup. All grown up.
[43:22] B: Yes.
[43:23] A: Right.
[43:23] B: Yes.
[43:24] A: So that you stop regressing back to 5, 7, 9, 14.
[43:29] B: Yeah.
[43:30] A: 17.
[43:31] B: Yeah.
[43:32] A: Makes sense. Because that's where you kind of feel like I'm losing my shit.
[43:36] B: Yeah.
[43:37] A: Because I know I'm this adult gal, but I feel like I'm regressed to a little girl.
[43:44] B: Yeah.
[43:45] A: Who's helpless.
[43:46] B: Yes.
[43:47] A: Fuck, I'm not helpless.
[43:50] B: Yes.
[43:52] A: Got it.
[43:53] B: Yes.
[43:53] A: That's what we want to get shifted. We Want to unplug the emotional effect that those experiences have had so that programming stops running in you.
[44:06] B: Right.
[44:07] A: Right. We want to get in the good news that it ended, that you made it through it, that you're okay.
[44:14] B: Yeah.
[44:15] A: We want to get in the good news that that stuff happening wasn't your fault. And it wasn't because you did something wrong. And it didn't happen because you weren't lovable enough. Got it?
[44:28] B: Yeah.
[44:28] A: We want you to be much more okay and at peace and comfortable in your own skin. We also want you to lighten up a little on you so that you're not so damn hard on you.
[44:40] B: Yeah. Yes.
[44:43] A: Got it. Which will mean that you won't be so damn hard on her.
[44:46] B: Right?
[44:47] A: Right.
[44:48] B: Yes.
[44:51] A: So that we all have a little more space and room to breathe.
[44:54] B: Yeah.
[44:55] A: Right. And that I'm reading other people's garbage as being about them. And that my own well being and whether I'm good enough is not determined by what their facial expression is.
[45:09] B: Yes, please.
[45:10] A: Got it. That's what we're shifting.
[45:13] B: Yeah.
[45:14] A: Yeah. We can get all that done.
[45:19] B: Really?
[45:19] A: Oh, yeah. Why am I telling you all this?
[45:22] B: We can't get it done. I do have a lot of for more forgiveness that needs to take place.
[45:34] A: I don't know about that.
[45:35] B: No.
[45:35] A: I don't think forgiveness is necessary ever.
[45:38] B: What about for myself?
[45:40] A: Yeah, I don't think it's necessary.
[45:42] B: No.
[45:42] A: No. See, when you have a deeper understanding that the shit that happened couldn't have not happened, whether it be the shit that happened to you or the shit you did, it precludes the need for forgiveness.
[45:55] B: I like that. So there's really nothing to forgive.
[45:58] A: That's right. Right. Because we want you to be emotional. Yeah. Right. It's not like you set up going, you know what? I'm hoping this fucking bad thing happens.
[46:10] B: Yeah.
[46:11] A: Because people get screwed up all the time with that kind of stuff.
[46:14] B: Yeah.
[46:14] A: Where it's. When I look back, I look back at the earlier me going, you fucking moron.
[46:19] B: Yeah.
[46:19] A: How could you have not have known?
[46:21] B: Yeah.
[46:21] A: Right. Because in the moment that it was going on, I was thinking, you know, it'd be really cool. I think later on I'm gonna hate myself for having done this thing.
[46:28] B: Yeah.
[46:28] A: Let's do it. Right. I can't wait for me 10 years from now to really kick myself for being so stupid.
[46:37] B: Yeah.
[46:40] A: Right. So we want to get it so that. That's not even necessary.
[46:43] B: Okay.
[46:43] A: Whether it be forgiveness of you or them.
[46:45] B: Okay.
[46:46] A: We want to get it so that you're at peace with what has happened.
[46:51] B: So I can move on.
[46:53] A: So that you're more emotionally present and clear, clearer. And that you get to be more directive about where you're headed. Which doesn't mean that we can go and pinpoint it, but we want to have a trajectory of where we're headed. So a plane flying from Arizona to Atlanta, it's gotta put coordinates along the route at different radio towers of where it thinks it's going to be. Be. Okay. Very rarely, if ever, is the plane exactly where it said it was going to be. That'd be walking a tightrope.
[47:32] B: Right.
[47:33] A: Right. We're non linear. Happens all the time. And the plane is dealing with the weather, which is also nonlinear. Tailwinds, front winds, other conditions, rainy, stormy, beautiful. So they might predict where they're going to be. They're never exact. They're within range. It guides them all the way to get to Atlanta. So as we get you free from the effect of this stuff and you're much more emotionally present, we also want you to be directive and have a trajectory of where you're headed. Got it. So that you can have a life that works more in the way that you want it to, with room for variability within it, but still moving towards how I want to be. Right. So that if I decide to date what I have inside is he's fucking lucky that I'm allowing him to spend any amount of time with me. Got it?
[48:41] B: Yeah.
[48:42] A: How different would that be?
[48:43] B: Very, very.
[48:47] A: Right. That's how we want this thing to shift.
[48:52] B: Yes.
[48:52] A: Yeah. Cool.
[48:53] B: Yeah. So I don't just feel like I'm at the mercy of my circumstances.
[48:57] A: That's right.
[48:57] B: All the time.
[48:58] A: So that you get to be directed. Because what you're doing now is you're changing your life and you're being directive. That's what we're interested in doing.
[49:10] B: Okay.
[49:11] A: Yeah.
[49:11] B: Yeah.
[49:12] A: Cool.
[49:13] B: Yes.
[49:13] A: And then we'll get together for like a chunk of time and we'll get this stuff done.
[49:17] B: Okay.
[49:18] A: And what people tell me over and over again is that the stuff that used to bother them isn't bothering them at all.
[49:22] B: That's amazing.
[49:23] A: The intensity in which they get distressed is way less.
[49:25] B: Yes.
[49:26] A: Doesn't mean that there aren't stressors, but it means that when they do have stressors, they move over them.
[49:30] B: Yes.
[49:31] A: The duration in which it lasts less, the frequency in which it happens less. So it's not the mountain that I have to overcome. It's a speed bump that I drive over, which are still freaking annoying. Yeah, we're gonna have ongoing stressors, but I move beyond them much faster. Make sense?
[49:47] B: Yes.
[49:48] A: Cool.
[49:48] B: Yes.
[49:49] A: Awesome.
[49:49] B: I'm excited.
[49:50] A: Me too. Well, come with me. We'll figure out a time when we can get together.
