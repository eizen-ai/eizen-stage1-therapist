[00:00] A: All right, so today is. Is it the 27th? It is the 27th. Wow. It's the 27th of March, Nikki. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:18] B: Yes.
[00:19] A: Cool. Okay, so as we're thinking about it and given that we met before, how do we want you to be when we're done? Like, if we could really change in current day stuff, ways that have been problematic for you and how you feel, think, act, react. What do we want to get better? How do we want you to be when we're done?
[00:41] B: I would like to be less reactive about outside circumstances.
[00:46] A: Okay.
[00:46] B: Less anxious. I would like to stop.
[00:52] A: If you were less reactive and less anxious, like, how would you actually be at peace?
[01:01] B: With myself.
[01:03] A: Yeah. So I'm more at peace with you?
[01:06] B: Yes.
[01:07] A: Okay.
[01:09] B: Less reactive to, like less fearful.
[01:16] A: Okay.
[01:19] B: It's kind of hard to describe it. When I get a little overwhelmed, I start kind of going into panic mode. I feel like the world is closing in on me. I even get angry when I feel pressure, like, to stop obsessing about my past and beating myself up.
[01:41] A: Okay.
[01:42] B: I would like to be able to focus on my children that are missing without going into a dark place. Place in my mind.
[01:51] A: Say more about that.
[01:54] B: I don't know where. I haven't had contact with my boys in about seven years.
[02:00] A: Okay.
[02:02] B: I'm getting a little better about memories for when. When I. A memory of them would come up. Sometimes I get suicidal thoughts of just. I want to jump off a fucking bridge.
[02:17] A: Okay.
[02:18] B: Fucking hate myself.
[02:22] A: Because they're not with you. Because you haven't had contact with them. Because.
[02:25] B: And this life that I exposed them to when I had them.
[02:29] A: Okay.
[02:30] B: The things I put them through, the trauma that I put them through.
[02:33] A: Okay. So there's a lot of guilt.
[02:34] B: Yeah.
[02:35] A: And bad feelings over stuff that they experienced.
[02:38] B: Yeah.
[02:38] A: When you weren't in a good state.
[02:40] B: Yeah.
[02:41] A: Okay, so. And that totally. Is there based on your love for them? Trouble me with that. Interesting. Like your feeling crappy is based on your love for them, but that's not really helping them. No. Or you. Because you're not better off feeling bad.
[03:04] B: No.
[03:06] A: Makes sense. So as we think about shifting that we want you to be more at peace.
[03:11] B: Yes. I want to be able to just accept my past and move on and really know that that's not who I am. Today.
[03:22] A: Yeah. Yeah. Because you know that it's not who you are now.
[03:29] B: Yes.
[03:30] A: Yeah. And you really want to know it, like, fully.
[03:33] B: Right. Like, when I think about my children or talk about them, instead of going right to that bad place.
[03:40] A: Yeah.
[03:41] B: I would like to be able to really remember the good times and the positive things.
[03:49] A: Yeah. And knowing that you're changing.
[03:52] B: Yes.
[03:53] A: Yeah.
[03:55] B: I've definitely made progress. You know, I found my girls, and now they're back in my life.
[04:01] A: Cool.
[04:03] B: For about three years, I didn't know where they were. They were removed from their adoptive home because the guy made a pass at one of my girls. So for three years, I was struggling really bad with the PTSD and the drinking. Just terrified not knowing where they are. So it's gotten quite a bit better since I found them and they're back in my life and really good things are happening. But when people ask basic questions, oh, where are your kids? How many kids do you have? I just shut them down. I don't know how to respond. I go into a very dark place a lot of the time. I don't even know what to say to people. I don't know how to generally just maybe put up a boundary and say, oh, I don't want to talk about this right now. It's just a basic question that most people think is normal to ask.
[05:01] A: Sure.
[05:02] B: And I don't. I feel very set apart from the messes of people.
[05:08] A: So it's awkward, too. Very awkward when they ask you because, like, how do I answer?
[05:13] B: I don't have a simple answer.
[05:14] A: Well, those were taken from me because this was.
[05:18] B: Yeah.
[05:18] A: How much time do you have?
[05:19] B: Yeah.
[05:22] A: I don't know if I want to even share this information with you. You didn't realize such a loaded question.
[05:27] B: Right. And I shut my daughter down a lot of the times. I don't. I don't allow her to have her feelings and her memories because it makes me uncomfortable. And I would like that to stop.
[05:40] A: Okay.
[05:41] B: You know, I'm not allowing her to have her feelings sometimes.
[05:45] A: Okay.
[05:46] B: Because she'll bring stuff up that I don't want to face myself.
[05:49] A: She'll bring some stuff up of what you did or didn't do or what had happened to her while she wasn't.
[05:56] B: Even just memories or positive things. Or she'll talk about her dad, who is very abusive, or bring up, like, people that we don't know that well. She'll start talking about her siblings, the ones that are missing, and I'll shut her down. She's not allowed to talk about that because it makes Mommy uncomfortable. And I don't say that, but that's just kind of the pattern of, hey. Like, I've even told her, hey, don't bring up my other kids around people. You know, I shut her down, and that's not fair to her.
[06:28] A: Okay. Okay. So that whole discomfort, both in how to handle the question.
[06:36] B: Yeah.
[06:37] A: And how you are with your girls, we want that to get shifted. So you're more okay.
[06:43] B: Yes. And I let her be able to think and feel and talk about what she wants to.
[06:50] A: Yeah. Okay, cool. So, yes, a lot of stuff that has happened that although the experiences are over, it still has an impact on you. So we want the weight of that lifted and clear.
[07:08] B: Yes.
[07:08] A: We want you to be much more at peace and okay and comfortable in your own skin. Realizing that even when I was doing that stuff or that stuff was happening to me, it wasn't really who I am.
[07:23] B: Right. And I do think that, like, in light of all of the sexual trauma that's happened to me and the abuse, the trauma of losing my kids, what's affecting me most today?
[07:39] A: Okay. Okay. So good news that you got connection with your girls.
[07:46] B: Yes.
[07:46] A: And we'll see what shows up in terms of the boys.
[07:51] B: Yes.
[07:52] A: Okay. Okay, cool.
[07:54] B: There's hope for the future. I didn't even think this would have been possible a few years ago.
[07:59] A: Yeah. Right. Okay. So. Yeah. Again, getting you to be much more emotionally present, the jumpy jitteryness settled down. This quieter you, more comfortable in you. The lingering effect of the past stuff. Clear. Whether it be the stuff that you did or happened to you. So those strong and painful emotions, whether it be anger or agitation or resentment or guilt or shame, or. We want that stuff lifted and gone. So you're more okay and at peace.
[08:37] B: Yes.
[08:38] A: Cool.
[08:39] B: And when people are kind of mean or rude to me, which I deal with a lot at work, you know, my reaction to it is. Can be kind of severe sometimes. Just if somebody's having a crappy day and they're kind of rude to me, they don't like the food or the service. It feels like such an attack.
[09:02] A: Okay.
[09:02] B: And I get angry.
[09:05] A: Yeah.
[09:06] B: I feel very offended.
[09:07] A: Yeah.
[09:08] B: How dare they?
[09:10] A: Piece of shit. Yeah.
[09:12] B: You know, and I think it's probably just kind of brings me back to the abuse that happened to me. And that at work is affecting me the most, I think.
[09:26] A: Okay. So other people's attitudes.
[09:29] B: Yeah.
[09:30] A: Kind of get on you.
[09:33] B: Yeah.
[09:34] A: We'd like that to stop.
[09:35] B: Yes.
[09:36] A: Okay. So you read their garbage as Being about them.
[09:39] B: Yeah. And it's all about me. They're attacking me.
[09:42] A: Yeah.
[09:42] B: Yeah.
[09:44] A: That's how it feels, right?
[09:45] B: It does.
[09:46] A: Okay. And that's what we want shifted so that you read it as not information about you. Yeah.
[09:52] B: Yes.
[09:53] A: It's information about them.
[09:54] B: Yes.
[09:55] A: And maybe information about how they're unhappy and maybe with the service or the food or what have you. But again, not about you.
[10:05] B: Right.
[10:06] A: Cool. Okay. I get behind doing that. Okay. Okay.
[10:10] B: I'm glad this stuff is coming up. This is good.
[10:13] A: It is good. Yes. You're prepared. It's so cool. Thank you. I'm so glad you're here.
[10:18] B: Me too. Me too.
[10:23] A: Yeah. That's such a good news thing.
[10:25] B: Yes.
[10:25] A: Yeah. Yeah. Any other stuff in terms of how we want you to be?
[10:35] B: I think I did bring this up before. And again, I am making progress with this, but my 21 year old daughter, her life choices kind of bring up this fear of her going down the same path as me.
[10:56] A: Okay.
[10:57] B: I would like to back up off her even more. Let her be free to make her own choices and not feel so afraid she's gonna go down my path. And I've made a lot of progress because I put in a lot of work of constantly catching myself when I'm being the helicopter mom.
[11:19] A: Okay.
[11:20] B: But I really want to give her that emotional safety and emotional freedom, not be so controlling.
[11:30] A: Like, give me an example of how that had shown up in a way that you view is not okay with her.
[11:38] B: She had a glass of wine at work. She's not an alcoholic like I am. She had previously made a commitment like, I have a million times that, you know, I don't like the way alcohol affects me. I'm gonna stop. And I overreacted. Like, it was this terrible thing that she had a glass of wine after work with her co workers, you know, saying the way, you know, it runs in the family and, you know, I quit drinking, so almost making it like now that's what she has to do. And I later did come back and I apologized and I told her I overreacted and she's not expected to make the same choices I do.
[12:28] A: Yeah.
[12:29] B: But I felt in retrospect, I did see that I got triggered.
[12:33] A: Yeah.
[12:34] B: In that moment of like this panic and anxiety.
[12:38] A: Oh, my God.
[12:38] B: You had a glass of wine. Like, it was this big deal in my head.
[12:43] A: Yeah.
[12:44] B: And I mean, that's. That's too much to put on her.
[12:49] A: Okay.
[12:50] B: She's 21.
[12:51] A: Yeah.
[12:52] B: She's a responsible adult. She goes to work, she pays her Bills.
[12:55] A: Yeah.
[12:56] B: She doesn't go out and party and get crazy. And even if she did, she's not me. I don't want to put the expectations that I have on myself on her.
[13:06] A: Okay.
[13:07] B: So I want my home life to be more relaxed.
[13:13] A: Okay. You know, well, the good part of what you did was that you owned it.
[13:21] B: Yes.
[13:23] A: Follow me with that.
[13:24] B: Yes.
[13:24] A: Like, the real true lesson isn't that you don't get triggered. It's that as you recognized you did and realized that it was your gunk, you went and owned that with her. I did. Which is the real learning. Does that make sense?
[13:46] B: Yes.
[13:46] A: Like, that's a really good news thing.
[13:48] B: Yes.
[13:48] A: Yeah.
[13:49] B: I am trying hard.
[13:51] A: We're doing a really good job with that.
[13:53] B: Thank you.
[13:53] A: Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. And it's okay for. Because of what you went through, for you to be a little more sensitive to it.
[14:04] B: Right.
[14:08] A: Makes sense.
[14:09] B: It does make sense.
[14:09] A: Which makes her a little more aware, which is better for her. See, I don't know whether you get.
[14:20] B: That yet, that it's better for her to have the awareness of, like, potential outcomes.
[14:29] A: So let me give you a different example. So growing up, my mom's brother got addicted to all sorts of stuff, and he died in his early 40s. Lots of drug stuff, alcohol, what have you would call back when you made collect calls and would be wasted and wanting to talk to mom or grandmom, want money, different things like that. So my mom was very vigilant on drinking, drugging, bad.
[15:10] B: Okay.
[15:11] A: Right. And that was her stuff. Right. Not that I was a bad kid, but that was, like, her stuff, like, real, like. But there was a benefit that came out of it. And the benefit that came out of it is me having more of an awareness of what could go wrong. Because it wasn't just her brother, her dad. So grandpa was an elementary school principal and had a drinking problem and got in a fight with a parent at the bar and was asked to resign.
[15:51] B: Wow.
[15:55] A: So her dad and her brother. So those two things certainly shaped my mom.
[16:01] B: Right.
[16:03] A: And it trickled down to me.
[16:05] B: Right.
[16:07] A: So that I was way more aware of alcoholism and alcohol being a problem and maybe, like, you know, not. Right. That didn't mean that I didn't every once in a while do Right. But it wasn't. It's always been a thing in the background that's not that bad.
[16:28] B: And you didn't hold it against your mother for being overbearing or.
[16:33] A: Yeah, that was her neuroses and her worry.
[16:36] B: Right.
[16:37] A: Out of her love, out of what she went through that. She had experiences of that she didn't want me to have the same experiences of.
[16:48] B: It's a different perspective to take on that, I bet. Yeah.
[16:52] A: Than the one that you have been.
[16:54] B: Yeah.
[16:55] A: Right. I'll give you the other thing. My mom has a teenager all growing up, she made my bed. Every morning. She made my bed. I didn't make my bed. She made my bed. When I went away to college, I couldn't leave my dorm room without my bed being made. Isn't that interesting?
[17:18] B: That is interesting.
[17:19] A: My mom never made me eat anything I didn't want to eat. So at the time, I was very, very picky as a kid eating. I wouldn't eat anything that didn't smell right. Didn't look like any. I'm not trying it. I'm not even. She didn't even make me try. Okay, now, vegetables, all sorts of stuff like that. Wouldn't eat any of them.
[17:41] B: Really.
[17:42] A: I had a friend whose parents forced him to eat vegetables. Made him. Had to. Can't leave the table if you don't. Right now he only eats meat and potatoes now. We're vegan.
[18:01] B: Wow.
[18:04] A: I eat all sorts of things. And prior to being vegan, I would try all sorts of things because I wasn't forced to have to.
[18:12] B: Right. So you didn't have that subconscious resistance to it.
[18:16] A: Right. But he won't eat anything other than he won't eat anything green.
[18:26] B: Yes, they are.
[18:28] A: So I just say that to you because sometimes we think our own stuff and we don't want to land our own stuff on them. But your fears and worries, some of that's a benefit in that she's aware of it. Now, what you recognized, and this is the cool part is. Wait a minute. I totally overreacted because you having a glass of wine at 21 with some other co workers is not the same thing.
[19:00] B: Right.
[19:01] A: That's cool because you own that.
[19:05] B: Yeah.
[19:06] A: Right. That doesn't mean that that's not something that she needs to pay attention to because it does run in family lines.
[19:15] B: Right.
[19:17] A: Does that make sense?
[19:18] B: Yes.
[19:20] A: So her knowing it has her be more careful, cautious, understanding.
[19:29] B: And she is.
[19:31] A: Right. Seeing the effects that it's had.
[19:33] B: Yes.
[19:34] A: Got it.
[19:37] B: Yeah.
[19:37] A: And that's a big deal thing.
[19:39] B: Yeah, that is a big deal thing.
[19:41] A: Right. Even if somebody were to have had a few drinks and drive, I want that person to go, yeah, I've had a few. Okay, I'm gonna drive versus I'm fine. And burn out of there.
[19:54] B: Right.
[19:55] A: One is gonna be a little more Careful and cautious than the other.
[19:58] B: Right. And she is, now that I look at it, because she went through a phase where she was drinking kind of a lot. That's why she made the commitment to not do it, because she saw what I went through and I was on her ass about it.
[20:17] A: Yeah.
[20:17] B: You know, I tried very hard not to be controlling about it, but I didn't let it just slip past me and not address it.
[20:26] A: Right, Right.
[20:29] B: So she is paying close attention.
[20:33] A: Yeah. And that's useful. And she's got a mom who's more present now.
[20:41] B: Yes.
[20:43] A: Right. So she sees there's a difference in this too.
[20:46] B: Yes.
[20:48] A: Makes sense.
[20:49] B: Yes, it does make sense.
[20:51] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[20:53] B: She saw that I came out of it.
[20:56] A: Right, right.
[20:58] B: And how happy am today.
[21:00] A: Got it.
[21:01] B: Yes.
[21:02] A: Yeah. Okay, so that's a really. Again, we don't. We. We cannot give all of the lessons we learned to somebody else. Right. Because they may need to do their own experimentation.
[21:16] B: Right.
[21:16] A: But we can certainly shape put some bumpers.
[21:20] B: Right.
[21:21] A: That doesn't allow them to not throw the ball down the lanes. We got some bumpers.
[21:25] B: Right.
[21:26] A: Which is helpful.
[21:27] B: Yes.
[21:28] A: Yeah. Makes sense.
[21:29] B: So what I went through is helping to spare my children from going through the same thing.
[21:36] A: Right, Right. And that's because you're more present now.
[21:42] B: Yes. Yes, it is.
[21:47] A: Yeah. Yeah. Cool.
[21:50] B: Okay. That's good news.
[21:54] A: Yeah. Yeah. So then we think where we're headed is a you who's much more emotionally present.
[22:02] B: Yes.
[22:02] A: Dealing with what is going on with the wisdom that she's gained from what she's went through. But not the emotional charge attached.
[22:12] B: Yes.
[22:12] A: Got it. So we still keep the wisdom right there. But the emotional charge, the effect that that's had cleared and gone. So that you're much more at peace.
[22:24] B: Right.
[22:25] A: At the deepest level. Although there's lots of things that we don't like that had happened. Stuff that happened to me, stuff that I did. We also want that at that deeper level, crystal clear, that it couldn't have not happened exactly the way it did.
[22:44] B: Yeah.
[22:45] A: Right. And that there's nothing for me to do about the stuff that happened then now.
[22:53] B: Right.
[22:54] A: Got it.
[22:55] B: Yes.
[22:57] A: That's what we want. Shifted.
[22:59] B: Yes. I like the way you said eliminating that emotional charge.
[23:03] A: Right.
[23:04] B: So I could still be aware of a pattern or something and still voice it and talk about it, but not with so much attachment to it.
[23:15] A: Correct. Right.
[23:17] B: That would be great.
[23:18] A: And that you read emotionally, other people's stuff as being about them.
[23:25] B: Yes.
[23:26] A: Not you.
[23:27] B: Yes.
[23:28] A: So that. That shifted too.
[23:30] B: Yes.
[23:32] A: Cool.
[23:32] B: Yes. Freedom from that Would be great.
[23:35] A: Yeah. Yeah. Any other stuff that comes to mind in terms of how we want you to be when we're done.
[23:43] B: Well, I would like to stop attracting.
[23:47] A: Oh, right. Yeah.
[23:49] B: I'm doing very good. Making a commitment not to.
[23:53] A: Not to date. Yeah.
[23:54] B: Off the table. I'm not ready. Even if I attracted a healthy guy at this point in my healing journey, I would still be triggered by normal human behavior. So I'm very confident in my commitment that I'm not gonna fall back into that pattern. And that loneliness feeling, that pull. But sometimes it's easy for them to get me when they show an interest in me and kind of do that love bombing of showering me with compliments and being very persistent. I. I do still have a tendency to get hooked in a little. I don't let myself go all the way. But like, I went on a date, an ice cream date a month or so ago.
[24:46] A: Okay.
[24:47] B: And at the end of. Was him going, I'm gonna put my 100% into this? And it was the first date, and I was like, oh, here we go again. So I never went out with him again. But I did break my commitment to not.
[25:04] A: Wasn't that smart?
[25:05] B: Yes.
[25:08] A: Because what did you hear in somebody saying, I'm gonna put my 100% in this?
[25:16] B: Same story, different face.
[25:19] A: Right.
[25:20] B: I don't even have 1% to give.
[25:23] A: Does somebody, if they're putting their 100% in need to tell you that's what they're doing?
[25:30] B: No.
[25:31] A: Follow me. That's how you know it's not true, Right?
[25:41] B: Yeah. That. It's just those words to try to correct words.
[25:46] A: Actions. Actions are what we follow always. Not what they say. It's always what they do. That makes sense.
[25:58] B: Yes.
[25:59] A: Yeah.
[26:00] B: Men tend to get obsessed. I tend to attract obsessive men. And I'll give you an example. And this is like a common occurrence. This is my pattern. It's my joke. Is I attract stage 5 clingers. That's what I tell them. Yes. So I have a co worker.
[26:22] A: Oh, my goodness.
[26:23] B: And this. I'm glad this came up because the common denominator has to have something to do with me. It has to. I have a co worker. He's wired a little differently. So am I. You know, So I. I don't just view that automatically as some kind of red flag. I don't know if I should, but I'm extra, extra happy and nice. I'm just one of those people, especially to someone you might view that society might reject or not. You know, just Kind of be like, whoa, what's your deal? And I think men like that, that maybe have some kind of loneliness wound, aren't used to somebody being so overly nice, showing them attention. Like, I get very friendly, very jokey. I've been working on not sexualizing everything. I'm doing a lot better with that. But the guy, my co worker, in his head, we were together. He was in love with me. And I saw some red flags. Saw and kind of had to put him in his place a couple times and say, look, we're just friends. But I didn't change the way I acted towards him. And that was a green light for him in his mind that he had to help me, he had to rescue me. He was like, kind of Facebook stalking me. It got to the point where he was following me around at work. When he was behind me, he would grab stuff from my hands and I would like. It would kind of shock me because he wasn't in front of me grabbing the plate. And I had to eventually bring it up to management because I set boundaries with him and he didn't listen. He showed up to my house one day, he texted me, he helped me move along with some other co workers. Then he got kind of weird and obsessive over me one day at work arguing with somebody else about who's gonna take me home. And I was like, look, I'm really uncomfortable. I'm not going home.
[28:46] A: And you. So good.
[28:51] B: It was great. It was. I. It was a great time. And so I set a boundary. And I was like, look, I'm going home with a girl coworker. He texted me, I'm sorry, blah, blah, blah. I said, okay, just don't put me in the middle of your argument. That made me uncomfortable. He texted me the next day and said, can I stop by? And I said, no, I'm spending some time with my daughters. I went to take one of my daughters to get her nose pierced. My 21 year old was at home alone. He showed up to my house anyway with his shirt unbuttoned, a dozen fucking roses and a cake knocked on the door. My daughter opens the door. He's laying on the stairs like this with flowers on him and a cake in his hand. I come home and found out I flipped my shit. And the behavior still didn't stop. It got worse. And this. I would like to change something inside of myself to stop, to maybe set boundaries when I see red flags because I feel like I'm inviting the behavior because it's such a common occurrence.
[30:06] A: Okay.
[30:07] B: It doesn't seem to be happening to everybody else.
[30:11] A: Okay.
[30:12] B: So I don't know.
[30:15] A: Yeah.
[30:16] B: What I'm doing that's inviting this kind of behavior.
[30:19] A: Yeah. Whatever it is.
[30:22] B: Yeah.
[30:22] A: And we don't even have to know.
[30:24] B: Okay.
[30:25] A: We want that to stop.
[30:26] B: Yeah. Yes.
[30:30] A: So that you're not getting unwanted advances.
[30:34] B: Yes.
[30:35] A: Because that's part of what's been happening.
[30:37] B: Yes.
[30:38] A: And maybe it's me overly nice.
[30:40] B: Yes.
[30:42] A: Right. But the problem is that then it's gone beyond what I'm comfortable with.
[30:49] B: Yes.
[30:50] A: And it's triggering and I get unwanted advances.
[30:54] B: Yes.
[30:55] A: Yeah.
[30:57] B: And when that was occurring, I was so jumpy at work.
[31:01] A: Yeah.
[31:01] B: I felt like I was being followed all the time. So I started getting very paranoid, and eventually that's when I had to bring it up to my boss.
[31:09] A: Yeah.
[31:11] B: Because I was like, look, I. You know, they know I was diagnosed with PTSD a long time ago and that I'm working on it.
[31:19] A: Did it stop finally?
[31:21] B: Yes. Yes. They have.
[31:24] A: Without you having to go to a different job?
[31:26] B: Yes.
[31:27] A: Okay.
[31:27] B: They held a little meeting and talked to him and basically said, look, if you don't stop, you have to find somewhere else to go.
[31:35] A: Okay. So that's cool.
[31:36] B: He did. So. I still feel the stairs. Makes me a little uncomfortable, but it's not as bad. He doesn't follow me around. I blocked him on every platform. He can't call me or text me or anything, so that definitely helped.
[31:51] A: Okay. But that whole thing of, like, how come there's an opening for it.
[31:57] B: Yes. And why does it keep happening to me?
[31:59] A: Yeah. We'd like that to stop.
[32:02] B: I would love that to stop.
[32:03] A: Okay, cool. I can get behind doing that.
[32:06] B: Yes. I'm glad that came up.
[32:10] A: Yeah. Any other stuff as you're thinking about it?
[32:34] B: I do still think about my ex a lot.
[32:38] A: Okay.
[32:39] B: I should have blocked him a long time ago.
[32:43] A: Have you blocked him now?
[32:45] B: No. I did, and then I unblocked him. I kind of obsess about him a little bit.
[32:49] A: How so?
[32:51] B: Wondering what he's doing. That little girl inside of me kind of wants the validation from him that he still wants me, still thinks about me, still cares about me.
[33:01] A: And then what would that do?
[33:03] B: Make me feel wanted.
[33:05] A: Oh, make the little girl in you feel wanted.
[33:09] B: I'm figuring that's where it's coming from. Like the me trying to fix my daddy issues. That's where I'm thinking that core feeling comes from. Back in September, Right. When I came back to Saylock because I was struggling with my PTSD, the 12 step recovery was helping, but it wasn't sure. Fixing everything. I. He invited me to his house. We've been broken up for, like, four years.
[33:45] A: Okay.
[33:46] B: We were using together. He was physically abusive. I minimized it. Like, normally, I'll say it was only a few times. That's my minimization. But I'm trying to stop doing that because it wasn't as many times as the guys before him.
[33:59] A: Well, I mean, so he's definitely a better guy. Yeah.
[34:07] B: I stopped using. I stopped doing that recently.
[34:10] A: Isn't that cool?
[34:11] B: Yes. Yeah. I stopped trying to minimize it. Well, you know, it was only a few times. I feel like I shouldn't want to have contact with him, and I still do.
[34:24] A: Okay.
[34:25] B: And I would like that to stop.
[34:27] A: Okay.
[34:27] B: I would like to just. I thought. I've let him go plenty of times. So it was back in September. He invited me over. We were drinking. His baby mom shows up. They got into an altercation. I went outside to see what was happening. I got locked out of the house. When I went to retrieve my things, he punched me in the face.
[34:47] A: Oh, that's fun.
[34:48] B: Yes. And I thought that was it. That was gonna be the one thing that, you know, I finally let him go. And the guy. The two guys before him, wasn't hard for me to write them off. Once I was done, I was done, you know? But they. They had. My life was torn apart with the last two, where I lost my kids. You know, I didn't want anything to ever do with them again. And for some reason, with Eric, I still kind of seek that.
[35:21] A: Okay. Connection.
[35:23] B: I haven't let him go.
[35:26] A: Okay.
[35:27] B: I'll block him and unblock him. I guess I haven't had enough.
[35:32] A: So there's still been a hold.
[35:33] B: Yeah.
[35:34] A: That he's on. On you?
[35:35] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[35:38] A: Do you think that it's. That you haven't had enough?
[35:41] B: No.
[35:41] A: I mean, how much more do you need?
[35:43] B: I don't. I'm just, like, wondering, like, when is enough enough?
[35:47] A: When is enough enough?
[35:48] B: Yeah. Why him? Why am I. We haven't been together in four years. I don't want to be in a relationship with him.
[35:56] A: Right.
[35:57] B: We have a sexual relationship, but I. He uses me. I let him.
[36:03] A: Oh, okay.
[36:05] B: It's pretty much what it is. When he wants to have sex, then he'll call me, and then he won't talk to me again until he wants to have sex with me again, and he randomly will punch me in the face. I would like to just let that go. And I don't know why I Haven't.
[36:26] A: Okay. So whatever's there that's been keeping that, you know, we want that going.
[36:36] B: I do.
[36:37] A: Yeah. So that you're free.
[36:40] B: So I'm not craving abusive men.
[36:44] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[36:46] B: Like I say, sometimes in recovery, but.
[36:49] A: That whole weird thing of, like, wanting to feel wanted.
[36:52] B: Yeah.
[36:52] A: Huh.
[36:54] B: By the one that's hurt me and abused me.
[36:59] A: Interesting. Well, I wonder what it would be like for you. To be wanting you more.
[37:04] B: Way better, don't you think?
[37:06] A: Because the younger you's been thinking that she's needed to be wanted by somebody else.
[37:10] B: Yeah. Yes.
[37:13] A: Maybe. You.
[37:15] B: Like I'm the answer to that, right? Yeah. The thought has crossed my mind before.
[37:21] A: Yeah. That you're enough for you.
[37:23] B: Yes. Like this is a desire within me that I've been wanting for a long time.
[37:27] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[37:29] B: I just don't know why, when. But it's up with all these missing pieces. Like, what is that pull?
[37:33] A: Maybe there isn't any missing pieces. Maybe it just feels like there is.
[37:39] B: Okay.
[37:41] A: Maybe it's the piece that's missing and you. Yeah, Right. But there's no missing pieces. It's just your missing piece.
[37:54] B: Yeah.
[37:55] A: Inside of you.
[37:56] B: Yeah.
[37:57] A: Right. Because I keep searching over there for it, thinking that there's missing pieces.
[38:05] B: Right.
[38:05] A: But I'm just not connecting to the piece that's already in you.
[38:11] B: I keep it from my daughter. It's embarrassing.
[38:14] A: The piece? No, that I. Oh, that you still like the guy. Yeah.
[38:19] B: It would be.
[38:21] A: Hey, sweetie, here's a really cool thing. Don't do what I do, but have this guy.
[38:25] B: Yeah.
[38:25] A: On the side that whenever he's, you know, drunk and alone, he'll call you.
[38:29] B: Yes.
[38:29] A: Have sex.
[38:30] B: Yes.
[38:30] A: And then you go.
[38:31] B: Yeah, yeah.
[38:34] A: And then feel really good.
[38:35] B: But I'm so concerned.
[38:35] A: You're like the Dua lipa. New rules. Ever hear that song?
[38:39] B: Yes.
[38:40] A: One, don't let him in.
[38:41] B: Yes.
[38:42] A: No, don't. One, don't pick up the phone.
[38:44] B: Yes.
[38:44] A: You know he's only gonna call when he's drunk and alone, too. Don't let him in.
[38:48] B: Yeah, I need that. I told Bri I blocked him and then I unblocked him.
[38:53] A: Yeah.
[38:54] B: We've had multiple conversations about it. Like, I think I need to block him.
[38:58] A: No, block and delete and delete.
[39:01] B: Right from here.
[39:03] A: Yes.
[39:04] B: Yes, that's right.
[39:05] A: Okay, cool. I get behind that, too. Anything else? You're doing great.
[39:11] B: Thank you.
[39:11] A: Really. Thank you.
[39:15] B: I'm glad. I was really thinking so much about the past that I'm glad all this present stuff is coming up.
[39:22] A: Yeah.
[39:22] B: I really Want to focus there.
[39:23] A: Right. Because that getting that cleared is a side benefit.
[39:28] B: Okay.
[39:30] A: What we really want is now to work better.
[39:32] B: Yes.
[39:34] A: Right? Yeah. So any other stuff that shows up.
[39:49] B: I don't know, I have. When I worry about my kids, sometimes the obsessive thoughts are very dark.
[40:01] A: Those are the ones I think about, like I should be dead or like.
[40:05] B: I'm afraid they're gonna die. I mean it's natural, I think, for a mom to worry, but for my brain to take it there and I redirect it because I know those thoughts. It's almost like a obsessive compulsive thing where like my daughter is driving back to Palm beach after a visit and I'm like, oh my God. Car accident, death. Like, God, please protect her. Like I, I, I kind of go into deep like, I don't know, like my worst fears and I don't want to, I don't want my brain to automatically go there. Like if I feel a little worried. I'm grateful for my spirituality because I pray.
[40:51] A: Yeah.
[40:52] B: I give it to God.
[40:53] A: Yeah.
[40:53] B: Take this, take this thought. But I'm not sure why, like my brain goes that dark, that deep, that quick.
[41:00] A: Okay.
[41:01] B: And that's something that just came up yesterday when she was on her way back home. And then I'm like, with manifesting and the law of attraction, I'm like, dude, I don't wanna, I don't, I almost feel like I, it's not realistic to think this, but like I don't wanna energetically cause these bad things to happen because I'm over focusing on it and then I feel like I'm gonna catch 22. Like how do I get rid of this thought?
[41:32] A: The first thing we have to realize is that the law of attraction is not a law.
[41:36] B: Okay. Yeah. There's fear based with that, right?
[41:43] A: The law of attraction is not a law. It's not a law that goes. Oh, okay, so because I thought this, I manifested this, right? It's not how it works.
[41:52] B: It's not true.
[41:53] A: No, no, that's not how. What did the little six year old do? What kinds of thoughts was she having to have the person molest her? Nothing, Nothing, Nothing. Right. There's not a law of attraction. Right. We frame it that way and it's really good when it's in positive.
[42:16] B: Right?
[42:17] A: Oh, well, because I was thinking this, I manifested this and I attracted this to me. All good things, right? So the law of attraction only is useful when it's me being intentional about things I want for me.
[42:34] B: Right.
[42:36] A: My Brain brings up all sorts of other thoughts. I'm not doing anything to think those thoughts or bring that. And I'm not attracting that. Right, got it.
[42:47] B: Yes.
[42:48] A: So that whole thing of going dark quickly, we want the lights on.
[42:55] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:58] A: So it's not so scary.
[43:00] B: Yes.
[43:00] A: There's a reason that they only do Halloween horror nights at night. Because during the day when you can kind of see the person hiding behind the shrub wearing the mask.
[43:13] B: Uh huh.
[43:14] A: It's not nearly as scary.
[43:16] B: Right.
[43:16] A: When the lights are on.
[43:18] B: Right.
[43:18] A: If you walk through the haunted house when the lights are on, it's not that scary.
[43:24] B: It's not.
[43:25] A: No, no. You're not gonna get nearly as startled as when you can't see and then something jumps out of the.
[43:33] B: Right.
[43:34] A: Does that make sense?
[43:35] B: Yes.
[43:35] A: So we want the lights on with this stuff.
[43:37] B: Yes.
[43:38] A: Yeah. Okay.
[43:40] B: Loud noises, sudden noises.
[43:42] A: That's the stuff that's been really knocking.
[43:45] B: Anybody knocking on my door.
[43:46] A: Yeah.
[43:47] B: It like fucking my heart goes into my stomach. I mean, the handyman will come knock on my damn door.
[43:54] A: Yeah.
[43:55] B: And I'm like, I mean, I'd like that to stop.
[43:59] A: Yeah. Right, right. So that the volume of that stuff gets turned down the you a little.
[44:07] B: Yes.
[44:07] A: Okay.
[44:08] B: That would be great.
[44:09] A: Okay, cool. So we got our work cut out for us.
[44:12] B: Yes. I think, I think I covered it all.
[44:15] A: Yeah. So to kind of give you the framework of how we're going to go about making these changes. Right. I gave this to you a little bit. But the lens we look at, we go. Those things make me feel this way. When that person did that, it made me feel like this. I did those things, I felt that way. This thing causes this in me. It's stuff that cause inside here, the lens we're going to look through is more of when lion approaches zebra. It's not lion that makes zebra scared. It's zebra's brain doing it in response to lion approaching. But it's zebra's brain that causes zebra to become alert, motivated and stronger. And it does it as soon as zebra sees, senses, smells, feels or thinks lion is approaching. Got it. So it's not the stuff that causes this in you. It's something your brain has been doing only because there are errors.
[45:19] B: Right.
[45:20] A: So from the lens of that is your brain's been making you feel bad again. Whether that be the, or the guilt or the anger or the frustration or the shame or the sad. Your brain does it in response to stuff past, current, future. Your brain's been making you feel bad. Do you think it really wants you to feel bad?
[45:39] B: No.
[45:39] A: No. Do you think it would want you to feel good?
[45:42] B: Yeah.
[45:42] A: No, that's the fucked up part.
[45:45] B: It just does. It just.
[45:48] A: You would think, damn it, why wouldn't it want me to? But here's what we've discussed. I'm a pretty bright guy. Most of our brain emotionally works like an animal.
[45:58] B: Okay?
[45:58] A: Animals don't have emotions because their brain is concerned about their mood or their affect or their level of esteem or how they feel about themselves or whether they have good or bad days. It causes emotion to motivate them to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. When a rabbit sees a fox, the brain causes rabbit to experience fear to get it to run away.
[46:23] B: Right?
[46:23] A: Not because it wanted it to have.
[46:25] B: A bad day, like self preservation.
[46:27] A: Yeah. If the squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire, the brain makes it experience pain, but not because later on it wants the squirrel to feel like a stupid, dumb moron for being such an idiot, getting too close to the fire. Now all the other squirrels are gonna laugh because I'm marred. No simple answer. Get tail out of fire.
[46:44] B: Yeah.
[46:45] A: All the negative emotions we experience, the hurt, the sadness, the sorrow, the anger, the resentment, the grief, the guilt, the shame, the pains, are all caused by the part of our brain that works like an animal to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem.
[47:04] B: Like, even the guilt is a way for my brain to say, I don't want to do that again.
[47:09] A: It's not, I don't want to do that again. It's trying to get me to stop that from happening. Now then, that's the weird part. Okay, so I'll give you an example of this guy's brother had died on a motorcycle accident a year ago, and he had asked his brother to go, and his brother never went. So now that brother's feeling horribly guilty.
[47:32] B: Yeah.
[47:32] A: And he's thinking he's feeling guilty because he should have gone on the ride, but he's not. He's feeling guilty because intellectually he can conceive of having gone on the ride. And if he had, his brother might still be alive and that would be better. So, because he can think of it, the emotional part of his brain which works like an animal, animals can only think of doing things that they can actually do, right? If they can't do it, they can't think it, right. Porcupines don't try to build hang gliders. If they can't do it, they can't think it, right. Dogs aren't depressed that they can't climb trees. If they can't do it, they can't conceive of doing it. So the animal brain lives. If I can think it, that means that I can do it. So he's thinking, I should have gone on the ride. His animal brain goes, well then hurry, do it. What are you waiting for? Go on the ride with your brother a year ago, quick. Can he do it? No. But the animal brain is always now. The animal brain is the part that's only in now. Dogs don't think about tomorrow or worry about yesterday. They're always now. If you told your dog, I'm coming home in three hours and it winds up being two, the dog's like, oh, good, you got home early. And if one of four, the dog's like, what the fuck? Where were you? I had to hold this for not happening either way because the dog doesn't have access to time. Time is an intellectual left hemisphere construct, not logical. No, I mean time is logical. Emotional doesn't have that. Okay, so the error is that, that a brain is trying to get him to go on the ride with his brother a year ago. Now can he do it?
[49:31] B: No.
[49:31] A: No. So when our brain realizes one of two things, we're gonna get to the one in a minute. One, the experience no longer exists, or two, there's nothing to be done about stops causing the feelings.
[49:47] B: Right.
[49:47] A: It's not causing them because it wants us to feel bad. It's causing it to motivate us to do something. The problem is that what it's trying to get us to do is in a time period that no longer exists. So where we call it guilt, because our logical brain goes, well, I wouldn't be feeling this. Oh, it must be because I feel guilty. No, it's that my brain is literally trying to get me to do the thing that I'm thinking of because that would be better.
[50:18] B: Wow.
[50:19] A: Isn't that crazy? Wow. It's such an error.
[50:23] B: Wow. So we have like the human part of our brain and then we have the animal part of our brain. Yes.
[50:29] A: And they don't always interact together. Not in a useful way. Because that's why we say your brain doesn't give a rat's ass how you feel. Not because it's not concerned about your well being. But that's not the purpose of emotion. The purpose of emotion is to get the animal to do something. Get something to stop, to solve a problem.
[50:53] B: Right.
[50:56] A: Right.
[50:56] B: That's what it's doing really makes consciousness.
[51:00] A: Very Complicated or not so complicated, because we're going to get to that in a second. But we have to understand the animal is the emotional part of our brain. And that's primary, okay? Right. Primary brain is survival, the mechanism that we got engineered with. And it's the joke that God plays on us all. God gave us a system that's really designed to keep us alive, right? Figuring out how to be happy, that's the joke. Good luck.
[51:29] B: It's on you.
[51:32] A: There's nothing. The system will keep you alive. You want to be happy, that's totally on you. You figure it out, right? So that's where it is. Because if we look at it, that your brain has been making you feel bad, right? Do you really think it wants you to? No. Does it want you to feel good? No. It wants to keep you alive. Survival, right? That's where the error is, right? So let's then go to human beings, right? So when it comes to positive or neutral experiences, our brain can distinguish the difference between the memory of the experience and the experience itself, right? Somebody tells us about a great trip that they had to the Florida Keys. And when they were down there, they rode on cool little mopeds, they took their picture next to the sign that said 90 miles from Cuba. They walked up and down Duvall street, they went to Hemingway's house, they went out deep sea fishing. They tell us about the whole thing, right? You and I both know that they know the difference between remembering doing it and doing it. It's totally clear. The problem is when things are negative and it doesn't matter whether it's a big negative or a little negative, it doesn't matter whether the negative happened a long time ago when they were a young child or just yesterday. And it doesn't matter whether it was a one time occurrence or happened many times through decades. All the negative experiences, the weird, the bad, the awful, the sad, the scary, the confusing, the upsetting, the horrific, the catastrophic, the traumatic, our brain confuses the data and memory about what happened, thinking it's happening, causing a reaction. So it's very simple. Guy is telling us about being mugged 14 years ago when he was in LA. And he gets to the part where the guy has got a gun jammed in his back, whispering, if you even breathe, motherfucker, I'm gonna. This guy's face is completely white, his voice is choked up, his arms are trembly, shaky. He's got tears. We're nice people. We were kindly listening to him. What the F is happening with him?
[54:10] B: Yeah.
[54:11] A: And what do people say? He's reliving it.
[54:15] B: Yeah.
[54:16] A: But what's actually happening is at a different level. That part of his brain, emotional part, is confusing. The memory data and info, thinking it's happening, causing him to have that reaction, which we totally tell is affecting him when he was talking to us because we saw it on him. Yeah, but it was affecting him even over the weekend when he was playing catch with his son, was under the surface.
[54:43] B: Yeah.
[54:44] A: Up here. He knows he's safe. He's with us. He survived. There's no gun. He's okay. There's a problem is that that part of his brain never got updated. That part of his brain is still stuck. So all the negative moments that we go through, part of the brain short circuits where it short circuits. That part doesn't know it ended, doesn't know I made it through. It doesn't know I'm okay. I do. That part doesn't.
[55:15] B: Is that because in that moment, our brain doesn't really know how to process the trauma?
[55:21] A: I don't think that. It's just that it doesn't know how to process the trauma. It's that the difference for human beings is for the animal, as soon as it's over, it's over.
[55:31] B: Right.
[55:32] A: Because for animals, stressors are very different. I either get away or I'm probably being eaten alive.
[55:41] B: Right.
[55:42] A: It's that kind of survival for us, it's a little different. We very rarely have to worry about being eaten alive.
[55:49] B: Right.
[55:53] A: Right. But for most stressors for animals, and they will show that an animal, when it's over, will do a violent shake out of all the distress that was happening in their.
[56:04] B: Yeah.
[56:05] A: Body that we don't have. And the other air is where it got stuck. We move forward so it like blipped. So think of that part of the nervous system that got disintegrated from the rest of me that moved forward.
[56:22] B: Right.
[56:23] A: What that part isn't connected to is anything after the worst of the worst that was more enjoyable than the worst of the worst. It doesn't know it's stuck.
[56:34] B: Literally.
[56:34] A: It's literally stuck. That's why it's kind of like frozen.
[56:39] B: Right.
[56:39] A: Brain doesn't know, but it's frozen in a always on, always active way.
[56:45] B: Right.
[56:45] A: So where it's frozen, that part is looking through our environment for anything that's similar.
[56:55] B: For the risk.
[56:56] A: Yes. Because in an animal world, the sooner I respond, the better chance I have to live. And the more intensely I respond, the better chance I have to survive. So when A rabbit hears a twig snap and runs. That rabbit's got a much better chance of living than the one who thought it was his friend George. And it wasn't.
[57:23] B: Right.
[57:26] A: That's what our brain does too. But here's how it searches. It searches through that very narrowed lens. So notice if you look through the lens, you can't see much more than that small round spot.
[57:43] B: Yeah, that's it.
[57:44] A: Makes sense.
[57:45] B: Yes.
[57:46] A: So on a hyper vigilant, super sensitive way way, our brain is scanning ongoingly, looking for anything that's dis similar to anything that I went through. That was painful but confuses similar as identical.
[58:06] B: That feels like the way my brain is constantly operating.
[58:09] A: Yes.
[58:10] B: That's why I'm so sensitive to people energies.
[58:14] A: Because not just so sensitive, people's energy so jumpy because I don't notice it until it's right there.
[58:21] B: Yeah, right.
[58:22] A: If I only have that lens to look through, I don't see anything over here until it gets here.
[58:27] B: Right.
[58:30] A: Follow me with that.
[58:31] B: Like I'm not seeing the whole picture.
[58:33] A: Correct.
[58:34] B: I'm seeing through this lens of looking for a risk.
[58:37] A: Yes. Small narrow lens all the time. So I will get startled more quickly because I'm not seeing with a broad angle. I'm seeing with a very narrow lens. And the narrow lens has to move quickly to try to pick up everything. And it constantly has to be scanning back and forth, back and forth and up and down and through to pick up stuff.
[59:02] B: Yeah.
[59:03] A: And so with a quick scan and through a narrow lens, anything that has similarity will get confused the same. So if the person was mugged by somebody wearing a hoodie, and now her son's having a sleepover and the boy comes over wearing a hoodie. She's like. She's not even thinking it's the hoodie. But there's something about the kid. I better watch him.
[59:23] B: Yeah.
[59:24] A: Because he doesn't seem safe. Maybe they'll sleep in different rooms tonight. No, mom, I really want to camp out and sleep with her. I don't think I'm gonna be okay with that. She has no idea that has anything to do with that. The kid wore a hoodie.
[59:40] B: Right.
[59:41] A: But the brain confused the hoodie when she was mugged. But the issue when she was mugged wasn't that the guy was wearing a hoodie, was actually getting mugged.
[59:50] B: Right.
[59:51] A: But because they co occurred, it got merged.
[59:54] B: Wow.
[59:55] A: Makes sense. The guy's making out with the gal. He's into her, she's into him. Right. She touches his inner thigh like this. And he does this. And he's going, what the hell is wrong with me? The girl I'm into is touching me in a way that should feel really good. And I did. Yeah. But is there any similarity to uncle when he was 11? Yeah, the hand. Yeah. But that was big man sausage hand, fingers.
[60:18] B: Right.
[60:18] A: This is dainty female hand with pretty nails. Yeah. It doesn't matter. Hand is hand. Makes sense. So times of day, tones of voices, facial expressions, all sorts of things can get to be triggers.
[60:34] B: Yeah.
[60:35] A: Makes sense.
[60:36] B: Like my reality is starting to make a lot more sense.
[60:39] A: I bet. Well, good.
[60:40] B: Yeah.
[60:40] A: Yeah. That's why we're talking about this stuff, because it's gonna start putting things into position to change and heal.
[60:49] B: Right.
[60:50] A: Makes sense.
[60:51] B: Yes.
[60:51] A: So then with that going on, it's constantly scanning. Anything that's similar gets mapped on is same, even if it wasn't a part of the problem but co occurred.
[61:01] B: Right.
[61:01] A: It's now merged as if it is.
[61:04] B: That makes sense now of why I scanned for people's facial expressions as some kind of validation that everything's okay.
[61:13] A: Right. And why you're also constantly scanning for approval over there.
[61:21] B: Yeah.
[61:23] A: Versus in here.
[61:24] B: Yeah.
[61:26] A: Right. Also, why am I overly nice to people on the margins? Right, got it.
[61:34] B: Yeah.
[61:35] A: Because I've got something in common with you. I've also been people on the margins. Right. But as you've recognized, sometimes in doing that, those people view my being nice as an invitation.
[61:55] B: Yeah.
[61:58] A: And I don't want it to be an invitation anymore. Make sense.
[62:03] B: Yeah.
[62:04] A: And then the last little part, which, this is going to make a lot of sense too, because once the stuff got stuck and there's multitudes of it. Right. And the brain is ongoingly looking for it. The other thing that makes it really challenging is that because it was bad, it feels like it means something about me. Because at the littlest time, when we were super impressionable, we were trained to believe good things happen to me when I'm being good. So the good happens because I'm good. Which is great if everything that happens is good.
[62:50] B: Right.
[62:51] A: Because then when I get hugs and I get, you know, kisses and I get love and I get stories told to me, and I get good grades and I get presents and candy, it's all because I'm good. Good things happen because I'm good. Every message for little children reinforce the same message. Good things happen because you are good. Well, what does that also mean? Bad things happen when you are bad. When you are bad, the bad things happen. So when I was drawing on the wall, making a pretty picture for my mother. And she didn't think it was going to be a pretty picture. And she grabbed me and yelled at me and spanked my hiney and said, no, no. I learned quickly I was doing something I wasn't supposed to do. Bad things happen when you do things that are bad. I got spanking. Mommy was mad. Bad happens because I'm bad. Even the enlightened mom that says, I'm not mad at you, I'm mad at what you did. Well, it really feels like you're mad at me.
[63:53] B: Yeah.
[63:55] A: And when I'm a kid, I don't distinguish what I just did from who I am. They're identical. They're synonymous. They're the same thing.
[64:05] B: That's why people are like, what did I do to deserve this? Yeah, that.
[64:11] A: Right.
[64:11] B: That's very.
[64:12] A: Because somehow we have to be thinking that I must have done something.
[64:15] B: Yeah.
[64:16] A: To deserve it.
[64:17] B: Yeah.
[64:17] A: But in life, in all actuality, people don't get what they deserve.
[64:21] B: Right.
[64:22] A: And they didn't do anything to deserve it.
[64:24] B: Right.
[64:25] A: People get what they get regardless of whether they deserved it or not.
[64:29] B: Right. It's just life.
[64:32] A: It's just life. And it's not fair. See, the other messaging with that goes, well, life's supposed to be fair. Right. Because in little kid world, it's fair.
[64:42] B: Right.
[64:42] A: We all start off the same. No, we don't. We don't all start off the same. Some kids are born with, you know, health issues. Some kids are born with abusive families. Some kids are born with a silver spoon. It doesn't start off fair. It damn well doesn't end fair.
[65:00] B: Yeah.
[65:00] A: Some people die too young. Some people stay around. It doesn't end fair.
[65:04] B: Yeah.
[65:04] A: How if life doesn't start off fair and doesn't end fair, is it supposed to get to be fair in the middle?
[65:09] B: Right.
[65:09] A: It's not. Yeah, but that's the message. We have as little. Like, it's fair. Like, even sports things. Oh, it's fair. Well, it's this team versus that team. Yeah, but this team's got really good athletes and that team doesn't. Not fair. Makes sense.
[65:25] B: Yeah.
[65:27] A: So all that messaging is what continues to contribute. The good news is they all have one common denominator distortion. Because the imprint isn't what happened, it's what got left. If I take my hand and I slam it in the sand and I pick it up, it leaves an imprint, which is not the same thing as my hand. The meaning isn't what happened. But see, that's what the attachment goes. That feels it's my fault. Right? So the girl had gone out, and she went out with, you know, a co worker's friend that's. She got a blind date. Now he sexually assaulted her. But she kind of blames herself because she did have a few drinks and she was wearing the dress and she did, you know, tell to go over to his place. Now, she had no idea that that was going to lead to a sexual assault, which is what it did. Right. But because it happened, and I must have been my fault, I shouldn't have worn that dress. You know, I shouldn't have shown the cleavage. That's why the guy manhandled me. What? I mean, we take it to the Bible all the way back. You know, it's Eve's fault if she didn't bring the apple to Adam. And Adam can't resist anything Eve does. Hey, you're gonna have this apple. You're not gonna have any me. I'll eat the apple. You follow me with that?
[66:53] B: Yes.
[66:54] A: So with all of that stuff spinning over and over and over and over and over again.
[66:59] B: Yeah.
[67:00] A: Anything bad feels it must have been about me.
[67:03] B: I remember when I was molested in preschool, right? I tried to tell on the. The teenager that I was the bad kid. I was exhibiting sexual behavior.
[67:16] A: Right.
[67:16] B: My dad, the way he raised me.
[67:18] A: Right.
[67:19] B: And it attracted the pedophile to me. And I. Like when I was writing this down, like what you're saying makes so much sense. Like, that's kind of really where it started for me is the rapes that have happened to me, the trafficking, the abuse in the back of my head, I was looking for all the reasons why it was my fault.
[67:40] A: Mm. Right. I should have or shouldn't have been or. Or.
[67:47] B: Or shouldn't have been drinking, shouldn't went to that party.
[67:50] A: Right?
[67:51] B: Yeah.
[67:51] A: Right. Because that's what happens with guys, too. No guy over drinks and the girl just totally takes advantage. Yeah. No, no, no. Right? Because for men, guys are always yeses. If it's a gal that he finds attractive, he's a yes. Always.
[68:16] B: Yeah.
[68:16] A: Never know. So she could go, hey, do you want yes? How about not yes? Yes. 3:30? Yes, but you got to work sick. Yes. Guys are always yeses. Women are not.
[68:29] B: Yeah.
[68:29] A: Women are yeses when they want to.
[68:31] B: Yeah.
[68:32] A: No's when they don't. They may be more of a yes right up front because they have that. But they're. They're the ones that are the regulators, not the guys.
[68:41] B: Yeah.
[68:44] A: Guys are easy.
[68:45] B: Yeah.
[68:47] A: And that's how it works. So we want you to get it that you get to choose. Right. Who you're gonna allow to spend time with you.
[69:04] B: Right.
[69:06] A: So it's never, oh, my goodness, do I get to be with the guy?
[69:10] B: Yeah.
[69:11] A: I gotta allow him to hang out with me.
[69:13] B: Yeah.
[69:15] A: Got it. So those three pieces. Right. How different is a truck backfiring from a grenade? Very different things.
[69:26] B: Yeah.
[69:27] A: So we don't have to process it out. We want to get the good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know certain things ended. That I made it through it. That I survived. That I'm okay. Once the memories get unplugged, then the meaning that got distorted also gets shifted. So I see it clearly for what it really was, not about me. I notice what's enhanced in your world is feeling like everything is about me.
[70:06] B: Yeah.
[70:07] A: Right. Not everything's about you, Nikki.
[70:12] B: I've heard that from somebody.
[70:18] A: Certain people can just be in a shitty mood, and it has nothing to do with you. That's right. Or you're so right.
[70:24] B: And certain people could not like me.
[70:26] A: And that's not my right. And that's the other messaging. When we're little kids, we get taught that we're supposed to like everybody and everybody's supposed to like us, but that's not true. You know, in preschool, I go to everybody's birthday and they come to mine.
[70:39] B: Yeah.
[70:40] A: By, you know, middle school, I don't go to everybody's birthday, and I don't get invited to everybody's birthday.
[70:48] B: Yeah.
[70:49] A: Make sense.
[70:50] B: Yeah.
[70:52] A: That's how that works. That's what we want shifted.
[70:56] B: Yes.
[70:57] A: So where we're headed is a you who's much more emotionally present, dealing with what is. With the wisdom of what she's gone through without the emotional charge.
[71:08] B: Yes.
[71:09] A: Where the picker's been adjusted.
[71:11] B: Yes.
[71:12] A: That you're enough for you. That you're worth it to you. That it's not about getting something over there in order for me to be okay in here.
[71:22] B: Yes.
[71:23] A: That the pieces that I've been looking for out there, that I think have been missing is really me connecting to the piece inside that's always there. Right. This is where we're headed. Make sense.
[71:38] B: That's great.
[71:39] A: Yeah. So now we want to go through some processes that are priming your brain to be in the right states for healing. The right states for healing are states of rest. It's why cold flus and surgery. We tell people to do the same thing. Rest.
[71:57] B: Yeah.
[71:59] A: So what we do is we have a cool process. It uses brain levers. First lever, silly. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. So not like ah, but just a little bit. When you slightly lower your jaw, it activates stimulating vagal nerve starts putting body into parasympathetic response. So you slightly lower the jaw. Second lever, as you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. When you rest your tongue, it starts to satiate the body. Helps to turn down internal dialogue. Third lever, as you begin to shift how you breathe and intentionally breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper as you inhale, and then slightly longer as you exhale. Right. And as you're beginning to breathe in this way, just check inside. How's your body feeling now? Like more tense or more calm?
[73:01] B: Definitely more calm.
[73:02] A: Isn't that cool?
[73:03] B: Yeah.
[73:04] A: So then the next lever is we're gonna go from that narrowed vision into expanding awareness. When our vision moves to our peripheral vision, it also settles. The body begins to move us from beta down into alpha waves, which are correlated with flow. So again, your jaw is slightly lowered. You rest your tongue and you breathe in a way that as you inhale, it's a little slower and deeper. As you exhale, it's a little bit longer. Notice as you're breathing in this way, you can see me in my nose. As you see me in my nose, you see my fingers, Right? My fingers begin to move out. You stay looking at my nose, but as they move out with the sides of your eyes, notice that you can pick up my fingers wiggling or way out here. You're becoming more aware of space. Right. There is the space that's between us, but there's the space that's beyond me. There's the space that's to your right and to your left. There's the space behind you, underneath you, and up above. And how this space literally goes out. And as you're noticing space, again, check. How's your body feeling now?
[74:38] B: Very relaxed.
[74:39] A: Isn't that cool?
[74:40] B: Yeah.
[74:40] A: And as your body's really relaxed, I want you to think of a time when you are outside in nature and you see something. It's just beautiful. Like, you might be like, wow. What is it that you see?
[74:54] B: Waterfall.
[74:55] A: Yeah. And isn't the moment that you're seeing the waterfall, you feel that peace and excitement, that awe, that wonder?
[75:02] B: Yeah.
[75:03] A: And people might tell you, nikita, of course, being there and experiencing the waterfall is going to give you those feelings. But if we looked at it differently, we could say that being there and experiencing it drew Your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited? Kind of like if I'm at the campfire and I'm cold and I bring my hands down towards the flames, I go, oh, my goodness, this fire is getting hotter. Is the fire really getting any hotter? No, no, I'm becoming more aware of the heat. So we know that in your life, through stressors and situations and other stuff, there's been times where awareness has been anywhere but at your center. But no matter where your awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited, just like two of us are in here, honey, you know what? You look around. Senses bring in data. Data's organized. That's intellectual knowledge. We call knowledge sometimes light. Light of knowledge at your center, it's a brighter light. It's wisdom. So now we've got knowledge and wisdom. And as you know, I work with lots of people who've gone through all sorts of awful stuff. And I remember this one little girl that I worked with, her older brother's best friend used to take Matchbox cars, GI Joe figures, for whatever fucked up reason, park them, drive them up her leg and shove them in her. So she had a lot of ugh around all of that stuff. And as we worked together, cleared it, gone. All the anger, the hurt, the guilt, the shame, the resentment, the pain, all gone. And I had to ask her the question. I go, you know all that. I go, where was it? And she looks at me and she goes, it's gone. I don't feel any of it anymore. I go, I know. Isn't that cool? And she goes, yeah. I go, but that wasn't my question. Question. She said, what? I go, my question was, where was it? And we started thinking. I go, was it at the surface levels? And she's like, no, it wasn't. I go, well, then maybe it was stuck in your center. And she's like, really? How could it survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited? I said, well, then, where was it? And she goes, oh, I know now. I was hiding in the shadows in between the lights. I said, well, what happened? She goes, the lights have joined, they're touching. The shadows are gone. I said, whoa. And then we started talking about how people tend to screw up their body all the time. They screw up who they are all the time. They say things like, I'm anxious, I'm depressed, I'm shy. Thinking the way that they feel is who they are. What if they're not what if the way they feel isn't who they are? What if the way they feel is just a way that they feel and that they're not their feelings? Because you have feelings and you felt different ones at different times, that when you were feeling a different feeling, you didn't stop being you, Right? So you can't be a feeling. You're clearly not what you do because you've done different jobs at different times and you've remained you. So you're not what you do, huh? Well, maybe you're how you think. Except there's lots of ways that you think that you don't think the same now. And you're not even the thinker of those thoughts. Sometimes thoughts come in that you don't even want to be having. So you clearly can't be the thinker of your thoughts. Your brain is, and your brain isn't you. It's yours. It's an organ. Just like your lungs or your heart or your kidneys. They're organs. They're yours. They're not you. Maybe you're your body, except your body's changed over time. Yeah, Right. Your feet are longer than they were when you were two, yet despite the changes, you're still you. So now we've got a really weird, interesting question coming up. Because if you're not what you do, and if you're not your feelings and if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not your body, what are you? Isn't that weird?
[79:26] B: Yeah.
[79:27] A: So for our purposes, with what we're doing, let's just say that who you are is what you become aware of as you see the waterfall. That the who you are is that peace, that excitement, the light. Religion likes to call it my soul, spirit. But instead of us thinking of it as a thing that you have, let's think of your fingers, your toes, your nose. They're things you have. Let's think of the light as you and see the light that is you, Nikki. It can't be touched or hurt or harmed. It experiences. The love that you allow in is whole and complete and indestructible. And I say that again because people screw up identity. Anxious, shy, depressed. If I go to the dentist, though, and I'm upset, you go, why? And I go, you'll never believe it. When he came to me and you go, what did he do? He put me on a chair. My head went down, my feet went up. It's very uncomfortable. You're like, yeah, but you're at the dentist. Then he positioned a Light right in my eyes. I can't see anything. You're like, yeah, you're at the dentist. Well, then he took this cold instrument, shoved it inside of me, and you're like, oh, my goodness. And you're what? And I go, nicky, my mouth. I'm at the dentist. But it's the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother in the Matchbox cars, our older brother's best friend. The Matchbox cars. The GI Joe. When you were little, he messed with your stuff. And she looked at me and she said, oh, my goodness. He did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and my feeling and fucked up a lot of what I did. But then she started to smile because she goes, well, you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body. It screwed up my thinking, my feeling, a lot of what I did. But he never got who I really am. He never touched me. I said, whoa, that's powerful. And see, what you and I are doing is powerful. We're bringing energy together towards a mutual and worthwhile goal that both you and I are interested in having happen for you. And when people bring energy together, energy does not go, one plus one equals two. But energy is exponential, right? So notice you can slightly lower your jaw, resting your tongue at the bottom of your mouth and breathing a little bit slower and deeper as you inhale. Longer as you exhale. Exhale. Seeing me in my nose, my fingers, they go all the way out wide. You notice them wiggling. You're aware of space between us, beyond me, behind you, to your left and right, underneath you and up above. And that the space goes beyond this room. If you really think about it, space goes out in all directions in every way. Space is unending. Right. As you're noticing space, I'm going to show you something. Take your hand and hold it out like that. Right? If you look at that spot there, as you look at that spot there, I'm going to take my hand and I'm going to move it towards your hand. And as I move my hand in towards your hand, you notice it getting closer. That's right. But as it gets closer and closer, notice how you're going to begin to feel. That's right. The energy. That's right. From my hand. Right. Notice how you can feel that energy without my hand touching your hand. Isn't that interesting? That's so cool that you can feel the energy. Which means I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your stuff. Hurt. Your feelings screwed up your body because who you are can only be touched with respect. That's right. And it's mutual. That's right. All of this is happening now. We take that like that and we just drop that hand down. That's right. Notice what starts to happen to that arm and those fingers. Just like that. It becomes more what we call maxi flexible. That's right. Just. That's right. Like that. And see, what's going to happen in a moment is that arm and that hand is going to drop down, but only at the same rate at which you drop down and inside towards that calm and peaceful, easy, light, flowing energy. The light that is you. That's right. Dropping all the way down. Down. That's right. Down and inside towards this calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy. And what are you noticing now?
[85:46] B: I feel very relaxed.
[85:48] A: I bet that's right. As you're feeling really very relaxed. Yeah. Because things are getting plugged in. And see, your body can stay in this nice and calm, very relaxed state as your unconscious starts doing some other changing. Meaning your unconscious is a warehouse of everything you've ever gone through. The good, the bad, the ugly. It knows which moments would be useful to bring into the light and clear. Right. Whether they be ones you thought about and wrote down or not. Whether they be in the order you thought or not. Your unconscious knows more than you do on how to heal itself. And it's really interested in organizing towards this future you that we're both collaborating towards. Present, clear, light, free. Right? That's right.
[86:58] B: So beautiful.
[86:59] A: Yeah, that's right. That's what's happening in here. You're connecting to your beauty. That's right. Not outside, inside, it's already there. The problem that's been happening is that you've been thinking that it's been outside of me, the pieces. Right. That I need something over there to make me feel full here. That's been the error.
[87:38] B: Yeah.
[87:39] A: There's just been stuff that got slammed in that's been blocking access to you, connecting to more of who you really are. Right.
[87:52] B: Yeah, I see that. Like I tried everything outside of myself to make myself feel whole and better and kind. Men, drugs, spending money, anything.
[88:06] A: Right. Because you hadn't been realizing that you're whole.
[88:13] B: Yeah.
[88:15] A: Inside there's nothing missing. And all we're gonna do is we're gonna take those pieces that have been in the way of you, experiencing you as being whole, peaceful, clear. So it's no longer in the way. Make sense? Yeah, yeah. And what's happening now? What are you noticing?
[88:44] B: I feel light.
[88:47] A: I bet.
[88:47] B: I feel like a energy presence.
[88:51] A: That's right.
[88:51] B: Right here.
[88:52] A: Yeah.
[88:54] B: My heart feels light. I feel that sense of nobody has been able to touch my light.
[89:03] A: That's right.
[89:04] B: It never was gone.
[89:06] A: That's right.
[89:08] B: I didn't become dark like them.
[89:12] A: No. Right. And now we're gonna get in this good news that you're connecting to now to earlier aspects and parts that didn't know it then. Got it? Yeah. So as we're organizing towards the future, you and that other part of your brain travels back down the timeline in your own history. What experience comes to mind now for us to clear? Yeah.
[90:00] B: My dad.
[90:01] A: Yeah. At a particular time, you might have been how old?
[90:10] B: 10.
[90:11] A: Yeah. Good. So how to clear? Something really simple. Wanna know how to do it?
[90:16] B: Yeah.
[90:16] A: Okay. You're gonna intend to be emotionally with me. Clear. The reason that you wanna be emotionally here with me is that this is what's happening and that isn't.
[90:28] B: Okay.
[90:28] A: Two, we're working on the mutual goal that we both want for you. Three, I'm a little more enjoyable than a sucky moment.
[90:35] B: Okay.
[90:35] A: So I want you with me. Got it. Second, you're gonna go through just facts.
[90:41] B: Okay.
[90:41] A: In a very matter of fact way that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened. Then it was done. Three, it happened when you were 10. There have been many things you've done after that were more enjoyable than that.
[90:54] B: Yes.
[90:55] A: What's one thing that you've done anytime from 10 until yesterday that was more enjoyable than that moment?
[91:01] B: Spending time with my girls.
[91:02] A: Yeah. Spending time with your girls. Way more enjoyable than that. Good. Something else.
[91:06] B: Being outside at the beach.
[91:08] A: Yeah. Being outside at the beach. Good. One other thing.
[91:11] B: Riding my bike on the trail.
[91:13] A: Riding your bike on the trail. All those things happen after that. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond that. So we have good news to get in. That moment happened, you might have been around 10 when it happened. You might have been where?
[91:28] B: Oh, in my apartment.
[91:29] A: Apartment. In the apartment with dad. Right. Would have been daytime or nighttime?
[91:33] B: Daytime.
[91:34] A: Daytime. And you would have been wearing the.
[91:35] B: Apartment by his bedroom?
[91:39] A: Sure. By his bedroom. Right. Good.
[91:40] B: Yeah.
[91:40] A: And then what happened next?
[91:42] B: He was cleaning his guns.
[91:45] A: Right. Good. So he was cleaning the guns. Right.
[91:47] B: He polished them.
[91:49] A: Yes.
[91:49] B: They were hanging from a hallway doorway.
[91:52] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right.
[91:53] B: And then what happened next? I bumped into one of them.
[91:57] A: Yes.
[91:57] B: He got freaked out.
[91:59] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right.
[92:01] B: He beat the shit out of him.
[92:02] A: And then he like, hit You. Bunches of times. And that hurt.
[92:04] B: Yeah.
[92:05] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[92:08] B: I knew it wasn't all my.
[92:09] A: No. Then what happened next?
[92:11] B: Oh, he kept screaming at me.
[92:13] A: Right. Good. Then what happened?
[92:15] B: I went in my room and cried.
[92:17] A: Right. Which is better than when he was screaming at you.
[92:19] B: Yes.
[92:20] A: And then that particular moment ended.
[92:22] B: Yes.
[92:22] A: And then later on, you did something more fun. Yeah. Like hang out with your girls.
[92:26] B: Yeah.
[92:26] A: Or go to the beach. Yes. Or go bike on the trail.
[92:29] B: Yes.
[92:30] A: Right. Now, notice as you're recalling that there was some discomfort.
[92:34] B: Yeah.
[92:34] A: Right. A little bit less because you're intending to be with me.
[92:37] B: Yes.
[92:38] A: Right. The discomfort wasn't there because that was yucky. The discomfort is actually your brain trying to motivate you to get that moment to stop. Good news. It has.
[92:49] B: Okay.
[92:49] A: Right. We never go backwards, but when we do it, unplugs it and takes away the charge. So we go backwards.
[92:55] B: Okay.
[92:56] A: So we've got, you know, riding on the trail, probably going to the beach. We got hanging out with your girls.
[93:01] B: Yeah.
[93:01] A: Right. And then you'd probably left your room at some point. And then you were crying in your room. And then you went in your room, and then he was yelling at you, and then he had hit you bunches of times.
[93:09] B: Yeah.
[93:09] A: And then you had bumped into one of the guns.
[93:12] B: Yeah.
[93:13] A: Right. And then he was hanging them there. And then he was cleaning and polishing.
[93:15] B: Yeah.
[93:16] A: And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[93:18] B: Right, Right.
[93:19] A: And as I ran through it backwards, compared to forward, emotionally, I wasn't.
[93:24] B: Wasn't as bad.
[93:25] A: Right.
[93:26] B: Yeah.
[93:26] A: Because your brain is beginning to get it, that it's data about something that happened versus happening. Make sense?
[93:35] B: Yes.
[93:36] A: Third, emotional brain doesn't get logic, but it does get patterns of association. Right. You can remember putting your shoes on today.
[93:45] B: Right.
[93:45] A: You can remember dad doing that. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your shoes on, and then I went, nikki, stop putting on your shoes. You look at me and go, but I'm not putting on my shoes. Because, you know, right now there's a big difference.
[94:00] B: Yeah.
[94:00] A: Between you remembering putting your shoes on and you actually put. Got it.
[94:05] B: Yeah.
[94:06] A: We want to use the pattern of association so that your brain gets the difference between the data and the experience. Because you can remember bumping in the gun, dad freaking out and beating you up.
[94:17] B: Yeah.
[94:18] A: You can remember that happening and yelling at you, screaming. You can remember getting your shoes on.
[94:22] B: Yeah.
[94:22] A: Pinky, stop putting on your shoes. Say, I'm not putting on my shoes.
[94:26] B: Say that I'M not putting on my shoes.
[94:27] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shoes. Say, you're not putting on your shoes.
[94:30] B: I'm not putting on your shoes.
[94:31] A: Well, then you stop putting on your sweater. Say, I'm not putting on my shoes. Sweater will stop me from putting on my shirt. So you're not putting in your shirt.
[94:36] B: You're not putting.
[94:37] A: Well, then stop dad from yelling and beating you. Say, he's not doing that.
[94:40] B: He's not beating me.
[94:41] A: Right. So I'll stop him from yelling at you.
[94:43] B: He's not yelling at me.
[94:44] A: Well, then you stop putting on your pants.
[94:46] B: I'm not putting.
[94:47] A: We'll stop me from putting on my pants.
[94:48] B: You're not putting.
[94:49] A: Well, stop him from doing that. See, he's not doing that.
[94:51] B: He's not doing that.
[94:52] A: So then, where is it? See, it no longer exists.
[94:54] B: It no longer exists.
[94:55] A: There we go. Just check what happened. Right. What's happened to that moment? Now think about that moment. What do you notice?
[95:07] B: It's not there.
[95:09] A: Oh, it's not, is it?
[95:10] B: No.
[95:11] A: Right. When you think about that moment, it's not causing that.
[95:16] B: No.
[95:16] A: Right. You can remember that it happened.
[95:18] B: I don't feel the feeling of it.
[95:20] A: You don't? I know. Isn't that cool?
[95:21] B: I can kind of see, but I don't feel it.
[95:25] A: Right. You can still remember what happened, but it's no longer like you're there.
[95:31] B: No.
[95:32] A: Right. Wow. Isn't that cool?
[95:34] B: Yeah.
[95:35] A: That's what's starting to happen.
[95:36] B: That was fast.
[95:40] A: Yeah.
[95:40] B: Wow.
[95:41] A: That's what we like.
[95:42] B: Yeah.
[95:44] A: Right. Now, from here, you know that Dad's reaction had nothing to do with you.
[95:50] B: Right.
[95:51] A: Had to do with dad. And that really, in all actuality, it wouldn't have mattered whether it was you or anybody else with that dad.
[96:00] B: Right.
[96:00] A: That would have bumped the guns like you had.
[96:05] B: Yeah.
[96:05] A: Isn't that what he would have done?
[96:07] B: Yeah.
[96:08] A: Right. At that age, we didn't know how unwell dad was.
[96:12] B: Right.
[96:13] A: We do now.
[96:15] B: Yes.
[96:16] A: We didn't know that.
[96:17] B: Didn't know then.
[96:18] A: Right. So that you felt like some of it had to do with me. If I had been more careful, if I had been more cautious, if I had hit it then. Makes sense. Just like the kid who got four Ds and an F on his report card. And Mom's mad and dad comes home even more mad. Dad storms upstairs, pulls down the kid's pants, takes his belt off and starts whipping him with the belt. The kid feels I'm getting hit because I got pulled. Poor grades. But is he see Isn't there more than one way to handle poor grades other than the belt?
[96:53] B: Yeah. Effective ways.
[96:57] A: Right. So did it have to do with the kid?
[96:59] B: Say it again.
[97:00] A: Did it have to do with the kid or did it have to do with dad?
[97:03] B: That was Dad's anger.
[97:05] A: Yeah. Right. Got it.
[97:08] B: Yeah.
[97:08] A: So I want you to repeat these four words. Here we go. It's. It's not about me. Right. It's not.
[97:16] B: It's not about me.
[97:18] A: That's right. Now close your eyes. Picture the earlier you and let her know, one, that's over. Finished. That it no longer exists. Two, dad being that way and that happening and nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with dad. It's not about me. So that she gets it. But the younger you know that you're okay. Let her know about hanging out with her girls. Let her know about going to the beach, riding on the trail. Let her know it's not about me. Right. And as she's getting it, what do you notice happening to her face?
[97:56] B: She's happier.
[97:57] A: Yeah. You can open your eyes. Right. What are you noticing now?
[98:07] B: I'm so grateful that I am who I am today.
[98:12] A: Yeah.
[98:13] B: We made it out.
[98:14] A: That's right.
[98:15] B: He was sick. That wasn't our fault.
[98:19] A: That's right. And we're okay.
[98:22] B: I'm okay.
[98:23] A: Yeah. You are on your way to even better.
[98:29] B: Yeah.
[98:29] A: Then. Okay.
[98:30] B: Yeah.
[98:32] A: Yeah. Cause now as you think about that moment, what do you notice?
[98:38] B: I feel peaceful.
[98:41] A: Yeah.
[98:42] B: It's like I gave her what she needed.
[98:46] A: Yeah.
[98:47] B: She just needed somebody to let her know that it was okay.
[98:50] A: That's right.
[98:54] B: And we were gonna make it out.
[98:57] A: That's right. Yeah.
[99:01] B: Nobody's hurting me now.
[99:03] A: Right. Right. And that kind of hurting wasn't because you did something wrong?
[99:14] B: No.
[99:15] A: Right. Got it. That's where. Garbage. Here.
[99:23] B: Thank you.
[99:24] A: Sure. I need to take him home again. Yeah. Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[99:33] B: It felt almost like she was waiting there for me to.
[99:38] A: Mm.
[99:40] B: Be there.
[99:44] A: Right. And just notice that it doesn't feel the same. Right. So now that's a piece we want to do more. Slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue. Breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper. That's right. Notice how much easier and quick. Quicker it is to simply rest. That's right. So much more is underway as your unconscious has begun to take in what it's learned. That's right. Imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof. So that you rise way up above it all in the sky. Having this bird's eye view of seeing everything as being underneath and below you. Because you're above, you're over it. Free. Just like a bird to fly, glide and move all around in all ways and in all directions. That's right. Soaring through space. Becoming more and more. More connected to who you really are. Peace. Fully integrating whole and complete. There's nothing missing inside. Bring your awareness back down to re. Associate inside you. And then when you're ready, a big breath in. And then exhale. Dies. Are open.
[102:18] B: Could.
[102:19] A: Good job. How's your body feeling now?
[102:23] B: Light.
[102:24] A: Yes.
[102:25] B: Happy?
[102:26] A: Yes. And again, as your body stays light and happy, that other than conscious part will travel back again down through moments and experiences and bring another that would be useful for us to clear. Right. What comes to mind now?
[102:50] B: I was 13.
[102:52] A: Thirteen. Good. And you want to stay here. Hi. Hi. Hi. Right. Notice how you're going there for a second. Hi. I want you to be here. I need more fun. Right. You just intend to be. My job is to keep you here.
[103:04] B: Okay.
[103:04] A: Right. So when I notice that you're not, I'm gonna do things to get you back.
[103:07] B: Okay? Okay.
[103:09] A: Got it. Cause we're in this thing together. Yeah. So you're 13. Right. When that one happened, you're where?
[103:17] B: It started at the high school.
[103:19] A: So you're at the high school. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[103:22] B: It was daytime.
[103:22] A: And like after school, Morning.
[103:24] B: It was in the middle school.
[103:25] A: Middle school, Right. Good. And you're like, where in the school?
[103:30] B: I was by the tree outside.
[103:33] A: Yes. You're by the tree outside. Good job. On break. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[103:37] B: Some kids asked me to skip class.
[103:41] A: Right. So they're like, hey, come and skip class.
[103:42] B: You're like, okay, let's go smoke some weed.
[103:45] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. And what happened next?
[103:47] B: I get on the city bus with them.
[103:49] A: Yes.
[103:49] B: Right. And we head out to Palmetto.
[103:53] A: Yes. Good job, good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[103:56] B: We were walking down the street.
[103:58] A: Yes.
[104:00] B: There. Said the weed is at their friend's house.

[104:21] B: And I'm following them in the house.
[104:23] A: Right? Yes.

[104:25] A: Yes.
[104:25] B: It's dark inside.

[104:39] B: Yeah. There's a bed.
[104:41] A: Yes. Good job.
[104:43] B: And they start fast, talking me and taking my clothes off.
[104:46] A: So then they're taking their clothes off. Right.
[104:48] B: Backpack off.
[104:49] A: Right. And that's weird.
[104:50] B: They lead me to a bed.
[104:52] A: Right.
[104:52] B: There's two guys waiting there.
[104:54] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right.
[104:55] B: Standing on each side of the bed.
[104:57] A: Yes.
[104:58] B: They get my clothes off of me. They put me on the bed.
[105:02] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[105:04] B: The two guys, One ones holding each side of me down.
[105:07] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right. Then what happened?
[105:09] B: And they take turns raping me.
[105:12] A: So then they put their penis in your vagina.
[105:13] B: Yep.
[105:14] A: Right. Did they put it in your mouth? They put it in your butt? Just your vagina?
[105:17] B: Just my vagina.
[105:18] A: Right. Good. And that happened for a period of time. Some of it hurt. Some of it might have felt good, but some of it hurt.
[105:23] B: Yes.
[105:23] A: Right. Then what happened next?
[105:24] B: Very. Just confused, of course.
[105:26] A: Right. Then what happened?

[106:29] B: Yes.
[106:33] A: Then that moment ended.
[106:34] B: Then the moment ended.
[106:35] A: Yeah. And then later on you did something more fun.
[106:38] B: Yes.
[106:38] A: Right. Like hang out with your girls.
[106:40] B: Yes.
[106:40] A: Right. Or go on the bike ride.
[106:41] B: Yes.
[106:42] A: Or go to the beach.
[106:42] B: Yes.
[106:43] A: Again, notice, as you were telling me, the discomfort.
[106:45] B: Yeah.
[106:46] A: Again, a little less because you're here. Yes, but we want to get it on. Plus so we go backwards.
[106:51] B: Yes.
[106:51] A: Right. So we got, you know, being out on the legacy trail.
[106:55] B: Yes.
[106:55] A: Right. We've got going to the beach, We've got hang out with the girls.
[106:58] B: Yeah.
[106:58] A: Right. And then you were back home. Right. Then you'd smoked weed, then you'd gotten back, and then they dropped you off and then you got the ride.
[107:05] B: Yeah.
[107:06] A: Right. And then they got you the ride, and then they gave you back the backpack and then they walked you out.
[107:10] B: Yeah.
[107:11] A: Right. And then you've gotten clothes back on. Right. And then the bigger guys left.
[107:16] B: Yeah.
[107:16] A: And then different guys had done different things to your body and they put their penis in your vagina multiple times. Different guys. Right. And then they had laid you down, and then they had taken your clothes off, and then they'd taken your backpack off and they walk you in the back, and then they walked you in the house.
[107:31] B: Yeah.
[107:31] A: Right. Then you got to the house, and then you guys had gotten off the bus stop. Right. And then you guys were on the bus, and then you guys had gotten on the bus.
[107:38] B: Yeah.
[107:39] A: And then they're like, hey, why don't you come with us? We're gonna go and smoke some weed.
[107:42] B: Yeah.
[107:43] A: And then you're by the tree, and then you were on break.
[107:45] B: Yeah.
[107:45] A: Then before that you're in class.
[107:47] B: Yeah.
[107:47] A: Then you'd gone to school.
[107:49] B: Yes.
[107:49] A: Right. And as I ran through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, I wasn't better. Right, right. Because your brain again is getting that. It's data.
[107:58] B: Yeah.
[107:59] A: You can remember it happening. Right. You can remember those guys doing that.
[108:03] B: Yeah.
[108:03] A: Right. You can remember putting nail polish on.
[108:06] B: Yeah.
[108:06] A: We'll stop putting on your nail polish.
[108:08] B: No, I'm not putting on my nails.
[108:09] A: Will stop me from putting on my sneakers. I'm not putting. Well, then you stop putting in your pants.
[108:15] B: I'm not putting on my pants.
[108:16] A: Well, then stop them from taking your clothes off.
[108:17] B: They're not taking my.
[108:18] A: Well, then stop them from putting their pieces in your vagina. See, they're not doing that.
[108:21] B: They're not doing that.
[108:22] A: Well, then stop it from happening.
[108:23] B: It's not happening.
[108:24] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[108:26] B: It no longer exists.
[108:27] A: Right, right. And again, as you went through it, what do you notice?
[108:31] B: I feel better. You do not have any.
[108:34] A: It's not happening. Right. By the way, that happening, did that have anything to do with you?
[108:38] B: No.
[108:39] A: Right. Would it have mattered whether you were somebody else in the situation? Isn't that what they would have done?
[108:44] B: They would have done that to anyone.
[108:46] A: That's right. Is there any part of Your body now, that's the same as it was then.
[108:50] B: No.
[108:50] A: No. Right. They messed with your stuff.
[108:54] B: Yeah.
[108:55] A: They never got you.
[108:56] B: No.
[108:58] A: Right. You didn't know that then. You're learning it now.
[109:06] B: Yeah.
[109:07] A: You didn't know that then. Right? So close your eyes and picture that earlier. You let her know that it's over, finished. That it no longer exists. That that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with them. So she realizes it's not. Not about me. That they never got who you really are. They messed with your stuff and there wasn't anything that you could have done differently then to get that to have not happened then. That's right. Because you didn't know that by going with them to that house, that's what was gonna happen. You thought you were just gonna smoke some weed. Right? But the you know that you're okay ride, let her know about hanging out with her girls, going to the beach, who she is now. Let her know about riding her bike and enjoying the breeze, the trail. That's right. And again, as all of this information is getting in. Right. We didn't know what is happening to the earlier you.
[110:27] B: She realizes that there's just dark people in this world.
[110:32] A: It's not her fault. That's right. That's right.
[110:36] B: And she survived.
[110:39] A: That's right.
[110:40] B: And we're happy.
[110:42] A: Right.
[110:43] B: And nobody touched her light.
[110:45] A: That's right. Even if they're dark, the darkness will.
[110:48] B: Never touch her light.
[110:50] A: That's right. Because her light is her. The light is you. The light is you. Light can't be touched by darkness, can't be touched in that way. The light is you. Right. They talk about that with grief. That when the person's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, it's that their body stops. They're no longer needed if they exit it. We don't pick them up in the same way we did. But it doesn't mean they're not here. Einstein, who was really smart, said that who we are as human beings is energy plus matter equals the tangible, touchable existence. And that what became the second law of thermal dynamics is Energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. Got it?
[111:55] B: Yeah. They never had me.
[111:58] A: No. They messed with your stuff.
[112:01] B: Yeah.
[112:01] A: Right. That's right. They never got you because you can't be touched in that way. Right. Because you are not your body. Right. And as this is sinking in, just check. What are you noticing now?
[112:27] B: I feel a lot calmer. I bet I don't feel as nervous.
[112:34] A: I bet I was feeling not cool. And we open up a wider view. Right. Because a fire detector works when it lets us know at the earliest sign, not after half the house is inflamed. Make sense?
[113:04] B: Yeah.
[113:05] A: So what makes us less susceptible to dark people's intentions is by noticing it before they get too close. See, if I'm only looking through this lens, they get to get really close before I see. Got it.
[113:31] B: Yeah.
[113:32] A: We're beginning to open up so that we pay more attention. Not in a vigilant sense. Right. But in a background sense to know. Right.
[113:48] B: Where I'm not just looking for the risk.
[113:52] A: That's right. That's right. And that goal.
[114:00] B: Yeah.
[114:03] A: So all sorts of things are changing. Yeah. Right. And again, notice when you think about that moment now.
[114:21] B: It'S almost like the house is empty.
[114:24] A: Yeah. Try to feel like it was your fault or you should have known better.
[114:29] B: That's not true.
[114:30] A: Right.
[114:33] B: I just happened to be there.
[114:36] A: Right.
[114:37] B: That that's who they were.
[114:40] A: Right. And you didn't know.
[114:42] B: And I was not their first victim. Clearly I wasn't their last victim. Sure.
[114:49] A: Right.
[114:52] B: And they didn't touch me.
[114:54] A: Right.
[114:55] B: I didn't just survive.
[114:58] A: Right.
[114:58] B: I'm happy.
[115:00] A: I'm free.
[115:01] B: Free. That's not happening to me anymore.
[115:04] A: Right. Yeah. What do you notice even as you're saying it?
[115:15] B: I feel peace.
[115:18] A: Yeah. Notice how it's not just words that you're saying.
[115:28] B: It'S true.
[115:30] A: Right. You're feeling it.
[115:35] B: I am feeling it.
[115:37] A: Right. See, there's been other times where you've tried to tell yourself, yes. Got it.
[115:43] B: Yes.
[115:43] A: Notice how this isn't showing up as a time that I was trying to.
[115:47] B: Tell myself, yes, I believe it now. I feel it.
[115:52] A: Right. Got it.
[115:55] B: Yeah. Because that's right. I have known and tried to tell myself that.
[116:00] A: Right.
[116:01] B: So for so long.
[116:03] A: Right.
[116:04] B: Because logically I knew it wasn't my fault.
[116:08] A: Right.
[116:08] B: But I guess somewhere at the time I felt like it was.
[116:11] A: Well. Right. Because it was bad. And the message little kids get that if it's bad, bad, it's my fault. And that's what's changing.
[116:32] B: Yeah.
[116:32] A: Right.
[116:33] B: Yeah.
[116:33] A: Isn't that cool?
[116:34] B: That's so cool. That's great.
[116:44] A: Because this starts to feed forward to knowing more. Right. Think of it as wisdom is knowing what I know, being wise, more aware without the emotional fact. Right.
[117:17] B: So wisdom is like the experiences I had but without still feeling trapped in them.
[117:25] A: That's right. Right. We can't get experiences to have not happened.
[117:31] B: Right.
[117:32] A: We don't need to. To get you to Be okay. Yeah. And this is what's happening now. You're becoming more okay in you. Right. You're beginning to lighten up on you.
[117:53] B: Yeah.
[117:54] A: Right. Because you're not feeling like that was your fault.
[117:59] B: Right.
[118:00] A: You're not feeling. Feeling like you should have known. Right, Right. Right.
[118:09] B: Back then, I. I did feel like it was my fault.
[118:13] A: Right.
[118:13] B: That's why I didn't tell anybody.
[118:15] A: That's right.
[118:17] B: I was ashamed.
[118:19] A: Yeah.
[118:19] B: It wasn't my fault at all.
[118:21] A: Right. So try to feel ashamed now.
[118:24] B: I don't.
[118:25] A: Right. And even the not fighting.
[118:31] B: Right.
[118:34] A: Right. Do you know that by not fighting, it got it done quicker?
[118:41] B: Right? That's true.
[118:51] A: Right.
[118:52] B: And that experience saved me in future experiences where I knew that if I didn't fight, I might survive.
[119:08] A: That's right.
[119:09] B: Wow.
[119:12] A: Right.
[119:13] B: Wow.
[119:14] A: Right. And survive with the least amount of damage done to my physical body. Because I remember working with a gal one time who was, you know, jogging in the park, and it wasn't even night, but a guy tackled her and threw her behind bushes and started. And she was fighting and he would just punch her. She would fight and he would just punch her. And then she said to me. And then I gave up. And then he did what he did. I go, right. And then it was over. Right. Past. Because he's a guy.
[120:03] B: Yeah, that's true.
[120:11] A: That's right. Got it.
[120:15] B: That saved my life in the future.
[120:18] A: Yeah.
[120:20] B: Looking back at that.
[120:21] A: Yeah.
[120:22] B: It's almost a new perspective.
[120:25] A: Right.
[120:26] B: Like, I knew.
[120:27] A: Right.
[120:28] B: Going forward, like, how to survive in situations like that.
[120:35] A: Right.
[120:35] B: I don't show fear and don't fight back.
[120:47] A: Right. Because that's what gets it done the fastest.
[120:50] B: Yep.
[120:52] A: Right.
[120:56] B: And then it's over.
[120:57] A: Right. And then it's over. Right. And because he's a guy, doesn't take very long.
[121:03] B: No, exactly.
[121:09] A: There you go. And then the flip side goes. Can you imagine being them?
[121:15] B: No.
[121:16] A: That that's what occurs for you to do.
[121:19] B: No, I can't wrap my head around.
[121:21] A: Right. Like. Like there's your experience of what happened. But if we flipped it around, that's what occurred for them to do to bring you to this place, to hold you down, to do that. Like that's what shows up for somebody.
[121:40] B: I can't. I can't even wrap my mind around that. I'm so grateful.
[121:45] A: Right. Like, how fucked up they have to be.
[121:47] B: Right.
[121:48] A: That that's what shows up to do.
[121:49] B: Right, Right.
[121:54] A: Right. And the person, quote, unquote, who is being nice to you, that found you the ride. Right. Was out of There feeling bad about what happened.
[122:12] B: Yeah.
[122:13] A: Right. Because not all of them found you the ride. No, no. Got it. Some of them just left. Gone.
[122:26] B: And most of them were kids my age.
[122:29] A: That's right. Yeah. How you doing now?
[122:38] B: Better. I almost feel a little more compassion for the people that did that to me.
[122:47] A: Right.
[122:49] B: I can't imagine, like what process they had to go through or who had to fuck them up.
[122:57] A: Right. That, that even is something that occurs for them to do.
[123:01] B: Yeah. Yeah. And I could have wound up like that with the shit that I went through.
[123:06] A: Right.
[123:07] B: I could have wound up one of the bad guys and I didn't.
[123:09] A: Right. No. You're the one that goes, sweetie, watch out. Don't drink too much.
[123:13] B: Yeah.
[123:14] A: Don't drink because it can lead to fucked up shit.
[123:16] B: Yeah. That's a miracle.
[123:20] A: You're pretty cool.
[123:21] B: Yeah.
[123:22] A: You are.
[123:26] B: Thank you.
[123:27] A: Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. So do you need to take a break or anything? You need to use the restroom?
[123:34] B: I would like to use the restroom.
[123:35] A: Okay. Go use the restroom, then we'll get back.
[123:37] B: Okay.
[123:40] A: Right. Yeah. So just check in. What are you noticing now?
[123:43] B: I feel good. I feel very like optimistic about my future. I, it's. I feel very surreal. Like it's a spiritual experience that I'm here in this moment and this healing is happening.
[123:59] A: Yeah.
[124:00] B: I feel very proud of myself that like I chose to get this healing and chose to better myself.
[124:10] A: Yeah.
[124:11] B: Stay clean.
[124:12] A: You're worth it to you.
[124:13] B: Yeah.
[124:15] A: Right. You keep thinking that I need that validation wanting from somebody else.
[124:24] B: And I'm going to get it for myself.
[124:26] A: See, now you're wanting it for you. Right. And you are it for you.
[124:36] B: I am. I'm doing this.
[124:38] A: You are.
[124:39] B: Nobody forced me to come to say law. Nobody forced me to.
[124:45] A: Right.
[124:46] B: Get help.
[124:47] A: Right.
[124:48] B: Nobody forced me.
[124:48] A: You're wanting a better life for you.
[124:50] B: I do. Cuz I love myself and I love the people in my life.
[124:55] A: Yeah.
[124:57] B: And I want to be a decent human being. I am a decent human being.
[125:03] A: Right. You weren't ever. What happened to you or what you did, that was never who you are, who you really are. Even though it was stuff that you did. Right.
[125:22] B: It wasn't.
[125:23] A: Yeah.
[125:24] B: Who I was at all.
[125:26] A: That's right.
[125:26] B: And the proof is how my life is now.
[125:30] A: That's right. That's right. Right. Yeah. So again, we're organizing towards the. Your becoming free, at peace, more comfortable in your own skin. Free from the effect of the past, more emotionally present. Right. Adjusting the attraction and attractor. Right.
[126:08] B: I didn't realize that there was still emotional charge in those experiences because I told the story before, sometimes I could tell it without feeling.
[126:21] A: Sure.
[126:23] B: But I just feel differently remembering it.
[126:29] A: Right. And see, those moments came to mind. You have a whole bunch. But those moments came to mind. Mind. Because we're asking your unconscious, which is the part that directs all the automatics, to bring what your unconscious thinks would be useful to clear that as we do our linchpins that start to rewire the whole wire ring to organize towards this. You here.
[127:03] B: Wow.
[127:05] A: Right.
[127:08] B: Yeah. Even like when I thought about what I should bring up or what order I should bring it up in. It's interesting what just came up.
[127:21] A: Right.
[127:22] B: That first memory wasn't written down on the paper, you know, just popped up.
[127:32] A: Isn't that cool?
[127:33] B: Yeah, that is really cool.
[127:35] A: Right.
[127:37] B: I think that's when the terror really started with my dad. Now that I look back.
[127:44] A: Yeah.
[127:44] B: Like, that is when it went from spanking me to, you know, really hitting me like a grown person.
[127:56] A: Right.
[127:58] B: So it's very interesting that that came up. That was that kind of threshold, 9 and 9 between 9 and 10, when the abuse really got bad after my dad's divorce and stuff.
[128:10] A: Yeah.
[128:12] B: That's really cool that my subconscious brought that up.
[128:15] A: It is, isn't it?
[128:16] B: That's really cool. Yeah.
[128:18] A: Because your subconscious wants to work in ways that are best for you.
[128:24] B: And the rape I brought up was the first rape. I didn't notice that until I just thought, wow, that seems pretty profound.
[128:35] A: Yeah.
[128:36] B: Both of those memories were.
[128:38] A: Right.
[128:39] B: Kind of the first of their kind.
[128:41] A: Right. And heck, if we're gonna do it, let's do it. Like, wow. Can't top it.
[128:49] B: Yeah. That's impressive.
[128:55] A: Wow. You are.
[128:57] B: Thank you. Yeah, you are.
[129:00] A: Well, you're here. Right. You're choosing you. You're worth it to you. Right. And for a long time you've been thinking I needed to be worth it to them in order for me to be okay.
[129:17] B: Yes.
[129:18] A: Right?
[129:19] B: Yes.
[129:20] A: And now you're getting. It's about me being worth it to me.
[129:25] B: Yeah.
[129:26] A: Right. Right.
[129:30] B: Yeah.
[129:31] A: Yeah.
[129:33] B: I do love myself.
[129:35] A: Yeah. Yeah. So think of the guy, you know, four years ago guy.
[129:42] B: Okay.
[129:42] A: The guy that you know is the Dua Lipa guy.
[129:45] B: Yeah.
[129:46] A: Just think about him for a minute.
[129:48] B: Okay?
[129:48] A: Right.
[129:49] B: Okay.
[129:50] A: And whatever. There's been with him, like, this whole, like, thought, I'm done. Not done. I'm done. I'm not done. You love me? Do you love me? Not like that, like that thing.
[130:01] B: Yeah.
[130:01] A: Right. So there's been a part of you that's been Interested in him.
[130:06] B: Yeah.
[130:07] A: Right. And then there's a part of you that realizes he's not. Right.
[130:14] B: Right.
[130:15] A: For you. So the part of you that's been interested in him. Right. What do you think that part's highest positive intention for you is?
[130:28] B: To feel one and loved.
[130:30] A: Ah. And if you wanted and loved. Right. So. And if you feel wanted and loved, what would that then give you?
[130:42] B: A sense of wholeness.
[130:43] A: A sense of wholeness. So that part has been interested in your being whole. But what that part hasn't been realizing is that by being attracted in wanting him, doing that is in direct conflict with your feeling whole. So it's intention, its intention is for you to feel whole. Because if you're wanted, the step above that is your feeling whole.
[131:17] B: Yeah.
[131:18] A: Right. But by wanting him, that part hasn't realized that by wanting him, it's in direct conflict with your feeling whole.
[131:27] B: Yes. Complete opposition.
[131:29] A: That's right. And to the extent that we're getting it now, we can change it. Right. Because what are all of the other ways that part connecting to you can have you feel whole?
[131:50] B: Showing love to my children and my family. People that genuinely love me and want the best for me.
[131:58] A: Yeah.
[131:59] B: Taking care of my body and my mind.
[132:04] A: That's right. So what's something that it could be in charge of? In taking care of your body and mind.
[132:12] B: What'S something that it could be in charge of?
[132:14] A: Yeah. Right.
[132:14] B: Existing, wanting instead of going to be with him. What's something that it could do.
[132:21] A: Yeah. That would be, you know, useful for you. Taking care of your body and mind.
[132:37] B: Maybe making an effort to reach out to my loved ones for connection.
[132:44] A: Okay. What would be something that you could be. That's a great thing. What would be something that would be your taking good care of your body and mind.
[132:56] B: What would be something that is me taking care of my body and mind?
[133:03] A: Something that you can be doing that helps take care care of your body and mind.
[133:08] B: Consuming healthy things like what I consume, to be good for me and bless my body.
[133:18] A: Yeah.
[133:18] B: And be healthy.
[133:20] A: Yeah.
[133:21] B: Meditation and prayer. Spending time connecting with the higher realms.
[133:31] A: Right. So meditation and prayer.
[133:34] B: Yeah.
[133:36] A: Right. So just check now, what's his name again?
[133:42] B: Eric.
[133:43] A: Eric, right.
[133:44] B: Yeah.
[133:45] A: So think about Eric.
[133:46] B: Okay.
[133:47] A: Right. And there's this, Aw, man. Like Barrett calls me. What do you notice?
[133:56] B: It's not really that appealing.
[133:58] A: Oh, it's not really that appealing.
[134:00] B: No, it's like a fake kind of appealing.
[134:04] A: Good. But you notice how you got a little bit of that?
[134:07] B: Yeah.
[134:07] A: Right. Close your eyes. Grab a hold of that feeling tone and let the feeling tone take you back and grow you earlier and younger. Back, back, back, back. Right. In a moment that may not have anything to do with Eric will be brought to your awareness. Ah. What is it that comes to mind?
[134:55] B: When I was molested.
[134:57] A: Yeah.
[134:57] B: In preschool.
[134:58] A: Right. So you might have been how old?
[135:01] B: Three or four.
[135:02] A: Three or four. And you're where A dandelion preschool. A dandelion preschool. Right. Good. Right. Be here. Hi.
[135:12] B: Hi.
[135:13] A: Hi.
[135:15] B: I.
[135:16] A: So you're at preschool.
[135:18] B: Yes.
[135:18] A: When this happens.
[135:19] B: Yes.
[135:19] A: Right. And you're wearing the preschool.
[135:22] B: I'm in front of the class.
[135:23] A: So you're in front of the class. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[135:26] B: I lift up my shirt.
[135:27] A: Right. Good job.
[135:28] B: I show the class.
[135:29] A: Right.
[135:30] B: I get pulled off.
[135:32] A: Right.
[135:32] B: I get in trouble. They talk to me.
[135:35] A: Right. Don't do that. We're not allowed to do that.
[135:37] B: Yeah. I'm confused. I think it's funny.
[135:39] A: Of course. Right.
[135:40] B: Yeah. Then it's movie time.
[135:43] A: Right? Yes.
[135:44] B: And one of the teenagers that's supervising us, Movie time. Comes and gets me.
[135:53] A: Yes.
[135:54] B: Pulls me off the floor.
[135:55] A: Right. Good job.
[135:58] B: He takes me back into empty classroom.
[136:02] A: Yes. Good job.
[136:03] B: Kind of dark.
[136:04] A: Yes.
[136:06] B: He pulls out his penis.
[136:09] A: Yes. Good job. Good detail. Right.
[136:11] B: I didn't know what it was.
[136:12] A: Of course not. Right.
[136:13] B: He had me touch it.
[136:14] A: Right. Good. Right.
[136:16] B: He touched me.
[136:19] A: Right. Good job. Right.
[136:21] B: Next talking to me. Yes. And then I went back to movie time.
[136:29] A: Right.
[136:29] B: After it was done.
[136:30] A: Right. So he touched you. He may have even ejaculated. Or not.
[136:33] B: I don't.
[136:34] A: Right.
[136:34] B: Yeah. I don't know.
[136:35] A: Because you wouldn't have really known what that was.
[136:38] B: No.
[136:38] A: Right. And then you went back to movie time.
[136:40] B: Yes.
[136:40] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[136:43] B: And it happened again.
[136:44] A: Well, that happened again with him.
[136:46] B: Yeah.
[136:47] A: Another movie time.
[136:48] B: Yeah.
[136:49] A: Yeah.
[136:49] B: It was always during movie time.
[136:50] A: Right. Good.
[136:51] B: Yeah.
[136:52] A: Right.
[136:53] B: And I remember. I remember the feeling of something's not right.
[137:00] A: Yes. Good job. Good detail. Right.
[137:01] B: I remember that feeling. And I remember trying to tell on him.
[137:06] A: Yes.
[137:07] B: But I didn't have the words to say.
[137:09] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right.
[137:11] B: So I grabbed a teacher and I pointed at him.
[137:14] A: Yes.
[137:14] B: And I was kind of just making noises.
[137:17] A: Yes.
[137:17] B: And I remember they. He was like, get that girl away from me.
[137:25] A: Yes.
[137:26] B: Like I'd done something wrong.
[137:28] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. And what happened next?
[137:30] B: They picked me up.
[137:31] A: Yes.
[137:32] B: And I was kicking and screaming.
[137:33] A: Yes. Good job. Good detail.
[137:35] B: And I remember wanting attention from him again.
[137:42] A: Yes.
[137:42] B: I didn't want to be the bad girl.
[137:44] A: And then what happened next?
[137:45] B: Every time I would go anywhere near him, he would yell for somebody to come get me.
[137:51] A: Good job. Good detail. Right.
[137:53] B: I remember that feeling.
[137:54] A: Right. And then that move, that part ended.
[137:57] B: It ended.
[137:57] A: And then later on you did something more fun.
[137:59] B: Yeah.
[138:00] A: Like hang out with your girls.
[138:01] B: Yeah.
[138:01] A: Right. Or go to the beach.
[138:03] B: Yeah.
[138:03] A: We're on the bike ride.
[138:04] B: Yeah.
[138:04] A: So we kept going on the bike ride. We got going to the beach without hanging out with the girls.
[138:07] B: Yes.
[138:07] A: Right. And then that was over.
[138:09] B: Yes.
[138:09] A: And then he would yell anytime he saw you.
[138:11] B: Yeah.
[138:11] A: And then you. Then he yelled. And then you had tried to tell the teacher by pointing.
[138:15] B: Yeah.
[138:16] A: Right. And then he had done that. And then he had done that. And then he pulled you out the first time, had him. Had you touch his penis. And then you were watching movies.
[138:24] B: Yeah.
[138:24] A: And then before that you'd gotten in trouble. Don't lift up your thing. And then before that you'd lift up your thing. Cuz dad had told you to go tell other girls to lift up your thing.
[138:31] B: Yes.
[138:32] A: Right. Then what happened before that is you're doing whatever you're doing.
[138:35] B: Yep.
[138:36] A: Right. As it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally outward, was it better? Right. You can remember it all happening. You can remember putting your pants on.
[138:44] B: Yeah.
[138:45] A: Icky. Stop putting in your pants. Well then stop him from doing that.
[138:49] B: He's not doing that.
[138:49] A: Well then stop them from doing that.
[138:51] B: They're not doing that.
[138:51] A: Well, stop it from happening.
[138:52] B: It's not happening.
[138:53] A: So then where is it? Say it doesn't exist.
[138:55] B: It doesn't exist.
[138:56] A: Again, that happening. Was that about you? Right. That you didn't want to be the bad kid?
[139:04] B: Yeah.
[139:06] A: Right. Felt like I did something wrong, knew that something was a little bit off.
[139:10] B: Yeah.
[139:10] A: But also was getting individualized attention.
[139:13] B: Yep.
[139:15] A: Got it.
[139:16] B: Yeah.
[139:17] A: So then I was seeking out individualized attention, but anytime I went to do it, I was being yelled to get her away from me.
[139:25] B: Yeah.
[139:27] A: Got it.
[139:27] B: Yeah.
[139:28] A: So back then that earlier, you thought all of that, it had something to do with you.
[139:33] B: Yes.
[139:34] A: Did it have anything to do with you? No. Right.
[139:38] B: Nothing to do with me.
[139:40] A: Right.
[139:40] B: That behavior was passed from my dad.
[139:43] A: Got it. And you wanting to be with the kid, did that have anything to do with you really wanting to be with him?
[139:50] B: It didn't?
[139:51] A: No. Everything to do with not wanting to be bad.
[139:56] B: Yeah.
[139:57] A: Had everything to do with not wanting that lens shine down on you. Right, right. Right. Cause did you do anything wrong with him?
[140:12] B: No.
[140:13] A: Right.
[140:14] B: No.
[140:16] A: Right. That though was thinking, oh, I must want him. Got it.
[140:27] B: Yeah.
[140:28] A: Cause it wasn't about wanting him.
[140:31] B: No.
[140:33] A: Right. Right.
[140:37] B: Wow.
[140:38] A: Yeah. What's happening now?
[140:41] B: I see the link between this and Eric.
[140:44] A: Oh. How so?
[140:49] B: I'm the good guy. I want to be the good guy. I want his attention from this person that's hurt me.
[140:56] A: Yeah. Right. But thinking that if I get the attention and he's okay, then I'm okay.
[141:13] B: Yeah. Holy crap. Wow.
[141:19] A: Got it.
[141:20] B: Yeah.
[141:22] A: Even if you had gotten the attention, would have made it okay.
[141:29] B: No.
[141:30] A: Or you didn't know that then.
[141:32] B: No.
[141:33] A: Right. Right. You do now.
[141:40] B: I do now.
[141:41] A: Right. So close your eyes and picture the earlier. You let her know that that's over and finished, that it no longer exists. That happening had nothing to do with you being bad. Had everything to do with what was off and things that you had experienced. Right. Right. That what's becoming more clear was that you just wanted to have that whole thing stop. Right. And as all of this is getting in, what are you noticing now?
[142:37] B: I feel even lighter than the first two traumas we went through.
[142:42] A: Mm.
[142:46] B: I feel hope. And I feel she wasn't alone.
[142:52] A: Right. Right.
[142:58] B: She is so loved. But none of this was my fault.
[143:07] A: Right.
[143:12] B: None of it was my fault. Even my returning to the abuser wasn't my fault.
[143:21] A: Right.
[143:32] B: My life makes more sense. My life makes more sense.
[143:42] A: How so?
[143:43] B: I lost my kids. Cause I didn't leave. Abuse that guilt had has been tearing me up for a decade going back to that moment. Like what I went through with my dad, what I went through with that teenager. My brain was just trying to make sense of what happened back then.
[144:13] A: Right.
[144:13] B: And just repeating.
[144:16] A: Right.
[144:16] B: It wasn't my fault.
[144:18] A: Right.
[144:19] B: I didn't know better.
[144:21] A: That's right. And that at that, with that running, you couldn't not stay or go back to the abuse. Right. With it being exposed. See, things can control us. Like a hand in the puppet controls the puppet until it's exposed. Once it's exposed, it loses its power. Make sense.
[145:04] B: Yeah.
[145:08] A: So it's losing its control. Thoughts can control us until they're exposed. If I have a gun and I can shoot thoughts into people's heads, and there's a guy on a bench and I shoot a thought into his head that his wife is having an affair with his best friend, you know what he's going to do? He's going to walk up to him and say, hey, man, what's the matter? He goes, oh, my goodness. My wife is having an affair with my best friend. You know what? He's never gonna say, I'm Being troubled by this thought that I'm having that my wife is having an affair with my best friend. See, the first way the thought has him, the second way he's having a thought. If we're walking down a school and the lights are off, it's dusk. So it's kind of dark, but not fully dark. Somebody jumps out of one of the rooms wearing an ugly scary mask and goes, rawr. We might be startled and scared. We might jump back, might scream. But if we're now in a lit room with the mask on the table and they say to you, oh my goodness, Nikki, your facial expression was priceless. I gotta see it again. Let me put on the mask. Rawr. Not gonna work. Loses its power once it's exposed.
[146:29] B: Yeah.
[146:30] A: Back when people were conservative about how many photos they took. Cause you had to pay for the film and to get it developed, but if you popped open the back, it would expose the film and ruin it. Make sense?
[146:50] B: Yeah.
[146:51] A: So that it had a hold over you. Right. That's why there had been the. I'm going to block. Oh, now I'm unblocking. I'm going to block up. Now I'm unblocking because it had a hold of you, not the other way around. Check it out now. I mean, it's only a few times. I mean, the last time when he punched me, he didn't really. Didn't get a good. Because, you know, I was over there when it's like baby mama came by because, you know, that's what I want to see.
[147:27] B: Yeah.
[147:32] A: So just check it out. What do you notice? There's only a few, it seems, acts of violence. I mean, I mean, it's not as bad as like being gang raped. So I mean, he's up here in comparison.
[147:48] B: That's exactly. That was my logic.
[147:53] A: Well, at least he didn't gang rape me. So we're good.
[147:56] B: It's ridiculous.
[147:58] A: Just check it out for a second.
[147:59] B: I see the.
[148:01] A: The tie there right now that you see.
[148:05] B: Yeah.
[148:06] A: Clearly.
[148:07] B: Yeah.
[148:08] A: Try to, you know, think of Eric as really appealing.
[148:11] B: No, that's not appealing.
[148:13] A: I really hope he calls me.
[148:15] B: No.
[148:16] A: Jaw's feeling better. I kind of get jammed in the other direction.
[148:21] B: That is the little girl inside of me wanting to not feel be bad.
[148:28] A: Oh, right. So I wonder what happens if the little girl realizes that by going back it's her being bad. By going to see somebody that's bad for her is her being bad. Because that's bad.
[148:48] B: That is bad.
[148:49] A: That's right.
[148:51] B: Oh, so it's counterproductive Check it out. Yeah.
[148:55] A: What if that part realizes that by going to somebody who's bad for her, it's her being bad.
[149:11] B: That's the opposite of what she's trying to do.
[149:14] A: That's the opposite.
[149:15] B: Yeah.
[149:16] A: Right. So close your eyes and think of her. She's been thinking that the two wrongs make a right. She didn't know that two wrongs don't make a right. And that it's bad for her to go towards something that's bad for her, which is in essence her being bad when she really just wants to be good. Right. And what's happening now? What are you noticing?
[150:08] B: I just. I get it now. It makes sense. Like what I really want is to be protected and feel whole and loved.
[150:28] A: And the little girl thought that in order to be protective and feel whole and loved, it comes from somebody outside of you.
[150:39] B: Yes.
[150:41] A: What happens when the little girl realizes from you that it's inside of you already? Whole, protected. Peace. The peace is not outside of you. The peace is in you. You.
[151:08] B: I'm feeling this sensation in my core. Like my stomach and my chest.
[151:14] A: Yeah.
[151:14] B: It feels light, fuzzy. I don't need them.
[151:25] A: That's right. You don't get the light and fuzzy feeling from them, do you? Oh, right. Where do you get the feeling from? If it's not from them, where is it?
[151:39] B: It's who I am.
[151:40] A: That's right. Light and fuzzy comes from you.
[151:44] B: Yes.
[151:44] A: Not them. That earlier you just thought I needed it outside of me in order for me to be okay inside. But what we're doing, discovering is you're already it. Light and fuzzy on the inside.
[152:02] B: Yeah.
[152:02] A: Cuz you're feeling it. Not out here. It's in here. Light and fuzzy. You're feeling it.
[152:12] B: I just had it. I had it backwards.
[152:15] A: That's right.
[152:16] B: Yeah.
[152:17] A: She had it backwards.
[152:17] B: She had it backwards.
[152:19] A: Right.
[152:27] B: This is good.
[152:28] A: It is good.
[152:29] B: Yeah.
[152:30] A: Yeah. So think about, you know, how protected you feel with Eric.
[152:36] B: Not at all.
[152:37] A: Oh, right.
[152:39] B: Not at all.
[152:40] A: Right.
[152:42] B: I felt blatantly disrespected.
[152:44] A: That's right.
[152:45] B: I felt onward.
[152:46] A: Definitely go back.
[152:47] B: Unwanted, unloved.
[152:50] A: Right. And see, that's the problem is that the earlier you kept thinking, if I could get somebody out there to want me, then I'll feel wanted.
[153:01] B: Yeah.
[153:03] A: All trying to solve what I never got when I was a kid.
[153:06] B: Yep.
[153:09] A: But what the younger you didn't know is that you didn't need it.
[153:13] B: That's right.
[153:14] A: When you were a kid, in order to be it for you. Light and fuzzy.
[153:19] B: Yeah.
[153:21] A: Enough Worth it. That's why you're here. You're worth it. That's why you didn't give up even when things got dark. That's why you didn't give up even if you relapsed. Right. That's why. You know what? I'm not gonna get into a serious relationship. That's. That's why as soon as the guy said, ah, I'm in this 100%, bring. Bring an A game with you. Okay, good. I'm out. Right.
[154:25] B: I am not that little girl anymore.
[154:27] A: You're not growing up.
[154:31] B: Yeah.
[154:32] A: Right. She's growing up. And the adult that she gets to become, who actually loves herself, who's changing her life for the better. Right. Is having more of a voice. Right.
[154:59] B: Yeah.
[155:02] A: Who's recognizing some of the things that are off and then doing stuff to get it to be better. This is what's happening.
[155:13] B: Yeah.
[155:14] A: Right. She gets to be one happening galaxy. Right. Isn't that cool?
[155:29] B: That's so cool.
[155:31] A: Yeah. Right.
[155:37] B: Seeing the bigger picture.
[155:40] A: That's right.
[155:41] B: Yeah.
[155:44] A: Not so narrowed any.
[155:46] B: Right. At myself.
[155:50] A: That's right.
[155:51] B: Yeah. Wow. I was looking for the risk in myself just as much as I was for other people. Like, I think that's where a lot of the guilt came from.
[156:05] A: Yeah. Right.
[156:08] B: I was so worried that I was not good enough.
[156:11] A: Right.
[156:11] B: My kids.
[156:12] A: Right.
[156:13] B: Like I was putting them in danger.
[156:15] A: Right.
[156:21] B: But I'm not.
[156:23] A: Right.
[156:25] B: I'm changing my life.
[156:27] A: That's right.
[156:29] B: And I'm working hard at it.
[156:31] A: Mm.
[156:32] B: Because I love myself and I love them.
[156:35] A: That's right. Right. Your guilt was only because they matter to you.
[156:42] B: Yeah.
[156:44] A: And because you can conceive of an alternative outcome to something that's already over. But what we're also getting at a deeper level. And all the stuff, even the stuff I don't like, that stuff couldn't have not happened the way it did. Even though I don't like it.
[157:04] B: Right.
[157:05] A: That it happened that way.
[157:06] B: It couldn't have happened differently.
[157:08] A: Right. Right. Because back then, I was impacted by those thoughts, those feelings, those experiences, all the stuff that was going on for me then.
[157:18] B: Yes.
[157:18] A: Right now things are changing.
[157:22] B: Yep.
[157:24] A: Right now my eyes are opening.
[157:26] B: Yes.
[157:27] A: And I'm seeing more.
[157:28] B: Yes.
[157:29] A: Of what's around me. Right.
[157:37] B: I am a good mother.
[157:39] A: Yeah. Right. Because a good mother isn't one that doesn't make errors, that doesn't make get triggered. A good mother is when she realizes that she has been. She owns it and apologizes and wants more for her kids than she had for herself. Yes. Right.
[158:13] B: Yes.
[158:14] A: Huh. That's what you're getting.
[158:20] B: I can finally let that go.
[158:22] A: Yeah. Notice how it has no hold on you now.
[158:25] B: Yeah.
[158:30] A: Yeah. So what are you noticing?
[158:34] B: I feel peaceful.
[158:36] A: Yeah.
[158:37] B: I feel hopeful.
[158:39] A: Yeah.
[158:40] B: And proud of myself.
[158:43] A: Yeah. Awesome.
[158:47] B: I don't feel that looming guilt feeling.
[158:52] A: Yeah.
[158:53] B: That always seemed to sit in my chest. In the back of my mind. Yeah. It feels different right now than it did when I just walked in here.
[159:05] A: Right.
[159:06] B: And I would talk about my kids.
[159:08] A: Right. Right.
[159:12] B: I feel much better about it.
[159:15] A: Yes.
[159:18] B: I. There's no way I could have done things differently given the circumstances of my life.
[159:24] A: Right.
[159:26] B: The cards were stacked against me. I was just playing the hand that I had.
[159:31] A: That's right.
[159:34] B: And that's the truth. I. That's not just something I have to tell myself.
[159:38] A: Right. But even if you got to trade your hand with Dad's never. Right.
[159:50] B: Never.
[159:51] A: So despite the crappy parts of the good, you're still glad you got yours?
[159:57] B: Yes.
[160:03] A: Right?
[160:04] B: Yes.
[160:05] A: Right. I didn't fold.
[160:07] B: Nope. I didn't fold.
[160:08] A: That's right. I stayed in the game long enough to have it turn around.
[160:15] B: Yeah.
[160:16] A: And it's turning around.
[160:18] B: Yes. It is.
[160:19] A: Right. It's the same thing with the stock market.
[160:22] B: Yeah.
[160:23] A: All you gotta do is stay in long enough.
[160:26] B: Don't pull it out.
[160:28] A: Warren Buffett made 90% of his wealth after the age of 65.
[160:35] B: Really?
[160:37] A: You just have to be able to ride it out long enough.
[160:40] B: Wow.
[160:41] A: Cuz in any 20 year chunk it goes up. That doesn't mean there might not be dips within it.
[160:48] B: Yeah.
[160:49] A: There's not been a 20 year chunk that hasn't gone up. So you gotta ride the wave.
[160:54] B: Yeah.
[160:55] A: Be in it long enough. And not that we're going for short term gains. It's a different game.
[161:00] B: Right. I stuck it out.
[161:05] A: That's right. For you. Cause you're worth it.
[161:09] B: I am. And I didn't give up hope.
[161:12] A: No. Right.
[161:14] B: I knew somewhere deep inside the whole time that I wasn't anything like them.
[161:21] A: That's right.
[161:22] B: The people that hurt me.
[161:26] A: Yeah. So we're on our way.
[161:29] B: Yes.
[161:29] A: You did great today.
[161:30] B: Thank you.
[161:31] A: Yeah.
[161:32] B: Thank you. I feel great. That was great.
[161:36] A: Awesome.
[161:38] B: Thank you.
[161:39] A: Yeah. And then we'll get back together again.
[161:41] B: Okay.
[161:41] A: Yeah. Because we made a lot of progress. Progress. Today.
[161:44] B: We really do.
[161:44] A: Even more.
[161:45] B: Okay. I'm excited.
[161:47] A: Yeah. Yeah. Because as you think about the stuff that we talked about. What do you notice?
[161:53] B: I don't feel bad about it.
[161:55] A: Right. Notice how that's different than it's ever been.
[161:58] B: Yeah.
[162:00] A: Right.
[162:00] B: Yeah.
[162:01] A: And that's how we know that things are changing. Because when you think about that now, it doesn't have the same feeling tones that it did.
[162:10] B: It doesn't. My body doesn't feel the same when I think about it.
[162:13] A: Right. That's changed at a deeper level. And then your job is to start to notice what's new and different in terms of how you feel, think, and react. Like, I'll be really curious when you interact with some person who's kind of in a shitty mood ordering food for you to be reading it as their stuff.
[162:43] B: Yeah.
[162:44] A: Right.
[162:45] B: Yeah.
[162:46] A: That guy's just having a bad day.
[162:49] B: That is freedom right there.
[162:52] A: Right. Don't you think?
[162:54] B: Yes.
[162:54] A: Right, Right. That you notice things more with space because your eyes are more opened up. You're seeing more of it all than just a small little at a time.
[163:15] B: Right, Right. And it's like that lens was pointed outward, but inward too.
[163:22] A: Right. Now it's going to be more outward.
[163:25] B: Right.
[163:26] A: So you're gonna notice lots of changes. Some will be in the moment. I'll be in a situation that normally I'd be all. And I won't be. And I'll be like, okay. Sometimes it'll be after the fact that I've gone through the whole situation and been like, normally I would have been. And I wasn't.
[163:41] B: Right.
[163:43] A: So you're gonna notice it in those ways. Make sense.
[163:47] B: I'm excited.
[163:48] A: So your job is to pay attention to what you notice that's new and different.
[163:52] B: Okay.
[163:53] A: In terms of how you're feeling, thinking, reacting. And then we'll get back together and do more.
[163:58] B: Okay.
[163:58] A: You did great today.
[163:59] B: Thank you. That was wonderful.
[164:04] A: So cool. And I'm gonna take this because you already wrote it, so that'll be fun for me to have.
[164:08] B: Okay.
[164:12] A: And then we'll go out here.
[164:14] B: Okay.
[164:14] A: Figure out another time for us to get together.
[164:16] B: Okay. Very well.
