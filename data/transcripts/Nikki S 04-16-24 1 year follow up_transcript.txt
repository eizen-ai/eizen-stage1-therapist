[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 16th of April, Nikki. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, it might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:14] B: Yes.
[00:14] A: Cool. So give me an update.
[00:16] B: All right.
[00:16] A: We've got a year. Like, let's see how things have been.
[00:19] B: My life has radically changed. Radically. It's like I almost feel like I have to get to know the person I am. My kids have all said the same thing. Like, it's even taken them aback a little bit because they're used to this spazzy mom that they kind of have to, like, help. And now they're just like, I don't know you, like, while we're getting to know each other again.
[00:43] A: Yeah.
[00:45] B: But I.
[00:46] A: So you had one daughter that was like, over on the east coast, right?
[00:49] B: Yep. I. She's in college in West Palm Beach.
[00:52] A: Okay.
[00:52] B: I live with my 22 year old.
[00:54] A: Yes.
[00:54] B: She's turning 23 this week.
[00:57] A: Cool.
[00:57] B: And then I. Really big news to my little 13 year old. She was with my 19 year old. They grew up together. They had a failed adoption.
[01:08] A: Yeah.
[01:09] B: They're both in and out of group homes and, like, mental health places. Well, they created this new law in the state of Florida, and I filed a motion to reinstate my parental rights.
[01:23] A: Wow.
[01:23] B: I'm the first person to file this motion, and I'm the first person to win.
[01:29] A: Yes.
[01:29] B: Yeah. She comes home for good May 6th.
[01:34] A: Oh, my goodness.
[01:34] B: How cool is that?
[01:36] A: Good for you.
[01:37] B: It's unbelievable. Unbelievable. Being a present mother and a, like a centered, stable mother who's not just so wrapped up in my own.
[01:50] A: Yeah.
[01:52] B: My relationship with India, the one that lives with me, has radically changed.
[01:56] A: Cool.
[01:58] B: Her choices.
[01:59] A: Yeah.
[02:00] B: Used to trigger the crap out of me because I would just play the tape through what I'd been through, and I just don't do that anymore. It just stopped. You know, I give her advice when she wants it.
[02:14] A: Sure.
[02:15] B: I'm not. Sometimes I'm. If I've become concerned, you know, I'll express how I feel. But I'm not that helicopter mom anymore that's constantly trying to control everything she does. I. My children's pain and my children's feelings and emotions, they don't get clouded by my own crap anymore.
[02:36] A: Isn't that cool?
[02:37] B: It's phenomenal.
[02:39] A: Yeah.
[02:39] B: I'm not the same person.
[02:40] A: You're able to see it clearly.
[02:42] B: Yeah.
[02:43] A: Yeah.
[02:43] B: And I. I can get out of.
[02:44] A: My own distinction is no longer confusing. Similar as identical.
[02:50] B: Yes. Yes.
[02:53] A: Right, Right. So you get to have a little more space and distance. I'm still going to. If she asks for provide and I'm mom, so if I got stuff, I'm going to share. But it's not in that way.
[03:07] B: Yes.
[03:07] A: How cool is that?
[03:08] B: It's amazing.
[03:09] A: Oh, good job.
[03:10] B: Amazing. It's like this change just blows me away. I think the reason Bree requested this session. It was quite a while back.
[03:23] A: I actually requested the session.
[03:24] B: Did you?
[03:25] A: I did. Oh, I didn't know that I requested. I wanted to know follow up with me. Yeah.
[03:29] B: Okay.
[03:30] A: Like, it's been a year. I gotta check in.
[03:31] B: Wow. I didn't know that. That's so.
[03:36] A: Yeah.
[03:37] B: Yeah. Life. Life is great.
[03:38] A: Yeah. Well, I know we did like a whole bunch of stuff.
[03:41] B: A whole bunch of stuff.
[03:42] A: Yeah.
[03:43] B: Yeah.
[03:43] A: Yeah.
[03:44] B: I. I've been through a couple things.
[03:46] A: Yeah.
[03:47] B: I bet that send me into a tailspin.
[03:51] A: Cool.
[03:51] B: Yeah.
[03:52] A: So what, what, what, what's happened like that normally would have sent you into a tailspin?
[03:58] B: Well, I. It was last July, I believe I met up with this guy that I've known my whole life. But I hadn't seen him in a long time.
[04:08] A: Sure. Sure.
[04:09] B: And I didn't tell anybody in my support system. I kind of kept it a secret. And I put myself in a fucked up situation with him. Yeah. He was getting high and I didn't know it and I didn't get high with him. Yeah. But I woke up to him like violating me.
[04:29] A: Oh my.
[04:30] B: Yeah.
[04:31] A: He was trying to have sex with you and you.
[04:33] B: And I was sleeping.
[04:34] A: Right.
[04:35] B: Yeah. And. And it didn't send me, like, if I wouldn't have gone through this therapy, I could have been in month long, three month long benders because I really. I would have been overtaken by that fear. I processed it with say, law.
[04:52] A: How'd you handle it? So like he wakes you up and that's going on. You're like, what the.
[04:57] B: Yeah, I. I packed up, I got out of there.
[05:00] A: How cool is that?
[05:01] B: Yeah. Phenomenal.
[05:02] A: So you stopped.
[05:03] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[05:04] A: Stopped him and then you left.
[05:05] B: Yep. Yep.
[05:09] A: That is awesome.
[05:10] B: Yep. It's. It's just like. And it didn't send me into this tailspin. You know, I went home and when I was.
[05:18] A: It's not about you.
[05:20] B: No.
[05:21] A: Right.
[05:22] B: I, you know, I didn't really think things through. So I learned from that.
[05:28] A: Yeah.
[05:29] B: That going forward I have to protect myself even further. I have to really. If I'm doing something for me Reaching out to my support system and running stuff past them and having a lot of healthy input and then having people on speed dial because they know where I'm going and what. As a single woman, you know, I need my community. So.
[05:54] A: Yeah. And you hold the keys.
[05:57] B: Yeah.
[05:58] A: You get to decide.
[05:59] B: I won't be doing that again. I'll be like, hey, I haven't seen you in 20 years. Let's hang out.
[06:06] A: Yeah.
[06:07] B: But I did. I reached out as soon as I got home, and I was in, like, a safe place. I called my sponsor and I called Bri immediately.
[06:14] A: Yeah.
[06:15] B: And it was hard for me to name what he was trying to do. And Bree kind of brought it out. She's like, that's rape. And I was like, oh, shit. I guess you're right.
[06:24] A: Yeah. That's unwanted sexual advances by a guy when I'm sleeping.
[06:29] B: Yeah. Yeah, that's right. It's not normal. Call it like it is.
[06:35] A: I actually get to decide whether something goes in any of my parts.
[06:38] B: Yes. That's my choice. That's right.
[06:41] A: 100%.
[06:44] B: So I processed it. But a few months later, my work environment became toxic. That guy on the margin I was telling you about that I work with, he started. Somebody caught him spying on me in the parking garage, like, kind of stalking me. Yeah. And he. Special needs. So everybody else was kind of just blowing it off. Oh, but he wouldn't hurt you. And it was irritating me a little.
[07:12] A: But.
[07:15] B: Triggered me a little. I, you know, I'm like, sitting there. Walk me to the parking garage, please. Like, looking out for him. But on New Year's eve's Eve on December 30, right after I found this out, I had a new assistant manager that was relentlessly hitting on me. I spoke up and told somebody about it, but he was kind of making my job hell. After I told on him, everybody around me was drinking, and I grabbed a drink and drank from it.
[07:46] A: Yeah.
[07:46] B: But I went home. I went home, didn't go out with everybody. Called my sponsor the next day and said I just impulsively grabbed a drink. In recovery, you kind of have to start your clean time over. But it wasn't that big a deal.
[08:05] A: In recovery, they say you have to start your clean. Clean time over.
[08:09] B: Yeah.
[08:10] A: But that's not realistic. Right. Why do you think so? Check it out. Why? Why is that a laid out guideline or ground rule that they have, Try.
[08:24] B: To maybe encourage you to keep consistent recovery time?
[08:27] A: Well, yeah, but there was a. There was a different thing and a different purpose for it. Right, right. Like, so it's not that somebody had a drink or two or whatever and then stopped and went home.
[08:41] B: Right.
[08:41] A: It's that they're on a several week.
[08:46] B: They're back in this cycle.
[08:47] A: They're back in it.
[08:49] B: Yeah.
[08:49] A: So if you got fully back in it, then you go, okay, well, now you gotta start over.
[08:54] B: Yep.
[08:55] A: If you had a slip up.
[08:56] B: Yep.
[08:57] A: Well, that's not the same thing.
[08:58] B: It's not the same thing.
[09:00] A: So the problem is when you live in the world that it's either or then, you know, you either were driving over the speed limit or you weren't. Right, right. Like that's where it goes. This is not either or. This has a little nuance to it.
[09:18] B: Right.
[09:19] A: That makes sense.
[09:20] B: Yes.
[09:20] A: Because you did it with all the stuff that was going on and went, this isn't for me.
[09:27] B: Yep. Yep.
[09:29] A: Right.
[09:30] B: Yeah.
[09:31] A: That shows how much more clear you actually are.
[09:35] B: Yes, yes. I've never done that before.
[09:40] A: Right.
[09:41] B: Usually I'd have one and then off to the.
[09:44] A: It's the person who's on the diet that has the cookie. And then they go, well, I might. As if I had the cookie, I might as well have the pie. And then the rest of the cookies.
[09:54] B: Yep.
[09:54] A: Right.
[09:55] B: I knew it wasn't going to solve any problems. And I have so much, so much in my life today that is just worth fighting for.
[10:06] A: Yeah.
[10:06] B: Worth being present for.
[10:08] A: Yeah.
[10:08] B: And I did struggle with a little guilt and shame because of that black and whiteness in 12 step recovery programs.
[10:18] A: Sure.
[10:18] B: It. I had a little resentment against the program for a minute.
[10:22] A: Well, yeah.
[10:23] B: Because it's like it brings a level of shame. That's not necessary.
[10:26] A: Not necessary.
[10:27] B: Yeah.
[10:28] A: Because the issue isn't in having done it. Right, Right. The issue would be in not stopping.
[10:35] B: Right.
[10:37] A: Follow me.
[10:38] B: Yep.
[10:38] A: The problem that you had when it was a problem.
[10:41] B: Yeah.
[10:42] A: Is that I didn't stop it.
[10:43] B: Yep.
[10:44] A: I stopped.
[10:45] B: I stopped.
[10:46] A: Right.
[10:47] B: Yeah.
[10:47] A: That's huge.
[10:48] B: Huge. I went right home, I ate a half pie and I went to bed.
[10:58] A: Yeah.
[10:58] B: And that was December 30th. Yeah. It's just hard to even wrap my mind around the person that I am today.
[11:06] A: Yeah.
[11:06] B: It's amazing.
[11:08] A: Right. You value. You see, that's the other part. You value you more. That's why when I did it, it was an impulse of everybody and I did.
[11:18] B: Right.
[11:19] A: But I value me.
[11:20] B: Right.
[11:22] A: Right. That's not who I want to be.
[11:25] B: Yep.
[11:27] A: Right.
[11:28] B: Yep.
[11:29] A: And that's the nature of any kind of change. Right. Nobody takes just all steps up. The stock market doesn't do that. Right. There are ups and then it's a back and then I continue. That's just how the nature of change works.
[11:47] B: Yep.
[11:48] A: You're changing for the better. Good job.
[11:51] B: And it just keeps getting better.
[11:52] A: I bet.
[11:53] B: Yeah.
[11:53] A: Yeah. Cuz you're more solid and more grounded in you.
[11:59] B: And when I feel emotionally triggered, like, I process it.
[12:04] A: Right.
[12:05] B: I identify how I'm feeling. I talk to somebody about it.
[12:09] A: Yeah.
[12:10] B: And I work through it.
[12:11] A: Yeah.
[12:12] B: Yeah. It's a foreign concept to me. I bet.
[12:15] A: Right.
[12:16] B: Yeah.
[12:17] A: But that all comes from. I've got a little more space and distance from it. So I can kind of like the language. Va kind of can take a step back and process what the heck is actually going on with me. More in tune. Not so scary of an emotion where I got to not feel it.
[12:37] B: Right.
[12:38] A: Right.
[12:38] B: Right. We're like, I'm afraid of how I'm feeling.
[12:41] A: Right.
[12:41] B: Yeah.
[12:42] A: It's not that anymore.
[12:43] B: No.
[12:43] A: How cool is that?
[12:44] B: It's amazing. People at work almost on a daily basis. I just wanted to let you know that I used to not know who I was getting when you would walk in the door. And I just can't even believe the person that you've come. And even like my daughter in West Palm was a little freaked out by my change at first because she was.
[13:06] A: Just like, well, not sure it's gonna last.
[13:09] B: Right. Waiting on the other shoe to drop.
[13:11] A: Right. That kind of thing. Which we never think of what kind of shoe it is.
[13:14] B: No.
[13:15] A: It's like, is it a heel? Is it a boot? What color?
[13:20] B: It's just amazing that my children can trust that. I mean what I say now.
[13:26] A: Well, you're walking your talk.
[13:29] B: Yeah.
[13:31] A: Right. You do it because you exude it. You're being it. That's awesome.
[13:41] B: I can't even find the vocabulary words to describe.
[13:46] A: I'm so excited for you. That's great. So even when things that happened. Right. If we were to look back, you handled them.
[13:57] B: Yes.
[13:57] A: How we would have wanted somebody to expertly handle them with the guy when. Nope. Done. Not getting out.
[14:08] B: Right.
[14:09] A: Getting back home. I'm in an okay. Safe space. Let me have communication support. Same thing.
[14:20] B: Yep.
[14:21] A: Not all the spinning stuff. Did not. What I am up to. Stop. Leave.
[14:28] B: Yeah.
[14:29] A: Don't go out with the rest. Don't do the whole thing. Right.
[14:33] B: Yeah.
[14:34] A: Isn't that cool?
[14:35] B: It's really cool. Yes.
[14:38] A: And even now, like my work valuing you.
[14:42] B: Yes.
[14:42] A: Right. You're owning it.
[14:45] B: I am.
[14:46] A: You're worth it to you not to go that's the coolest part.
[14:48] B: Yes.
[14:49] A: For me, I am worth it. To me, that's the coolest part.
[14:52] B: Yes.
[14:53] A: I love that.
[14:54] B: Yes.
[14:55] A: Yeah. Yeah. What happened with the manager? Well, still hitting on you? He's still there.
[15:03] B: They let him go because it came out that I wasn't the only one. He was being like that too. But I was the first one to speak out about it. And now we have a new GM that I don't love. He's kind of a dick. But, you know, I remember my last job. I left because the GM was a dick. Now I'm just, like, always a dick.
[15:25] A: Right.
[15:26] B: I'm doing my best that I can do, and anything outside of that, I really can't help. So I'm not personalizing.
[15:37] A: Right.
[15:38] B: The fact that, you know, he's rubbing everybody the wrong way. That's him.
[15:44] A: How cool is that?
[15:45] B: It's really cool.
[15:46] A: Notice how clear that is.
[15:47] B: Yeah. I would have wanted to quit.
[15:50] A: When? Before. It would have all felt like me.
[15:52] B: Yep.
[15:53] A: Doing it to me.
[15:54] B: Yep.
[15:55] A: Now I'm clear. It's him. Even with the other guy that got fired.
[16:00] B: Yep.
[16:01] A: That would have all felt like it was me somehow. I must be doing something to have this guy hit on me. And I don't want him to hit on.
[16:10] B: Like, the name of my first book, Dr. Q, would be, like, predator magnet. That's how I freaking felt for a long time.
[16:20] A: Right.
[16:20] B: Yeah.
[16:21] A: And that's because for a long time, there was open wound.
[16:25] B: Yes.
[16:25] A: Right. So what do predators get attracted to? Not strength.
[16:29] B: Weaknesses.
[16:30] A: Right.
[16:31] B: Yeah.
[16:32] A: Right. The lion doesn't go after the strongest gazelle to prove how mighty he is. He goes after the baby or the old one that can't fight him off.
[16:39] B: Yep.
[16:43] A: Yeah. That's all the healing.
[16:46] B: Mm.
[16:47] A: Right. That you're worth it to you.
[16:50] B: Yep.
[16:50] A: Right. It's not even doing the same thing. That wasn't about me at all. It was about him. And how cool in the reinforcement of that as you bring it to light, that other people go. I was experiencing it too. Huh. Okay. That's not the experience we want our staff to be having.
[17:11] B: No. That's not cool. That's not cool, buddy. This is a family place. You know you can't do that here.
[17:17] A: Right.
[17:19] B: I decided not to go to the employee party tomorrow. Okay. Because it's just gonna be. Everybody there is gonna be partying and drinking. And that's a. That's another example of self love. Because before, like, I wanted people to like me so badly, I was willing.
[17:37] A: To bend myself to whatever you need Me to do.
[17:40] B: Right. And, like, compromise my values.
[17:43] A: Yeah. You're not doing that now.
[17:45] B: No.
[17:45] A: How cool is that?
[17:46] B: No. There were two co workers last night drinking on the clock, and I got a little taste of. Okay, well, this is how they're behaving on the clock. I'm not going to that party. There is no way I'm subjecting myself to that.
[17:58] A: Yeah. Right.
[18:00] B: I have a different life today.
[18:01] A: That's right.
[18:02] B: Yeah.
[18:03] A: That's right.
[18:04] B: That's not who I am. I wouldn't even enjoy myself.
[18:06] A: Right. And I can be friendly with all of my co workers and I can hang out with them as we're working together. That doesn't mean that they're my peeps that I hang out with.
[18:17] B: Mm.
[18:18] A: Right. Good job.
[18:21] B: Thanks.
[18:23] A: I'm so excited for you. That's such a good news for you.
[18:26] B: My life is so different today.
[18:28] A: Yeah. So did you have to. Did you petition, like, judges here, there. How did that whole thing even work? Because when we ended, you were like, going, okay, I'm gonna figure out how to do this.
[18:41] B: Right. Well, I did. I did. And I didn't even have an attorney. I did it all my. All of my own work.
[18:50] A: Yeah.
[18:50] B: Yeah. I. I looked on the websites to Guardian Ad Litem and the coalition.
[18:56] A: Yeah.
[18:56] B: To see who the staff was. And I was going to mail everybody this letter that I wrote just explaining what my life was like before.
[19:04] A: Yeah.
[19:05] B: Why I lost my kids and what's different now.
[19:07] A: Yeah.
[19:07] B: Not even knowing about this new law.
[19:09] A: Yeah.
[19:10] B: And I saw on the Guardian Ad Litem website, their head attorney used to represent me years ago. Mind blowing. And so I decided to email her the letter that I was mailing out to everybody. Every manager I could find. Every. Find out. I found out who the caseworkers were for my kid, and she emailed me back a copy of the statutes, the new law. And I printed it out and I was looking it over, and I met every single requirement. And there were a bunch of them. One of them was that she had to be 13 and she was 12 at the time, so I just decided not to wait. But it was just all divinely orchestrated. It's just mind blowing. Like the case manager, because they see a case like mine, and most people can't help but to make assumptions and have prejudices, and they've never seen anybody do something like this, so. But I prayed. I put on some worship music and I went heavy into prayer and I was like, I trust you. Just give me courage to just speak the truth. And I called my Daughter's case manager at the time. And I said, look, this is a complicated case. It's a shot in the dark, but this is how I've changed my life. And she has nowhere to go. Would you be willing to just look into my life so I can at least talk to her?
[20:43] A: Yeah.
[20:44] B: And she got it, opened her heart up and she said, wow, okay.
[20:49] A: Yeah.
[20:50] B: And then I went and filed the motion a month or so later. And they turned me away at first because they'd never seen anything like this. And they were like, you don't have the right to file because you lost your rights. I walked out and I got this feeling and it said, turn around, walk back in the building. And I turned around, I walked up to the counter and I said, look, it says right here that the parent who's lost their rights has the right to file. I said, so I'd like to speak to your supervisor and I need it in writing why you're denying me my right to file. This motion took them about 45 minutes. They came out, they said, okay, you do have the right to file. And it was still shot in the dark.
[21:43] A: I just get chills.
[21:45] B: The judge that used to do Tyla court over Selah Freedom happened to be the judge that got the motion on her.
[21:53] A: Which one is that?
[21:53] B: Yes. Malucci.
[21:54] A: Malucci. Okay. Yeah.
[21:56] B: And I had Selah Freedom like all in my letter that I sent out. And for that to even be orchestrated is just mind blowing. I got a notification on my email that she sent a hearing and huge celebration. I knew that things were. I just knew that like if it was God's will, my baby would come back. That I just had to do the footwork.
[22:23] A: Yeah.
[22:23] B: And walk it out in faith.
[22:25] A: Yeah.
[22:25] B: And the judge set the hearing after that. She opened it up and said, I'm gonna court order visitation and we're gonna court order contact and set the hearing. Three days after my daughter turned 13. And on March 14th, my parental rights were officially reinstated for my 13 year old daughter. And it's the first in the state. And she had everybody stand up, give me a round of applause in court. Everybody involved in this, it was just like their hearts were open. And so next or at the end of this month, I'm speaking at this event in front of a bunch of judges and the head of the coalition of the state sharing my story to try to kind of push them to keep families together instead of adopt kids out. Because the people they adopted my children out to were very bad people. If I would have had the Support then that I had now could have saved my children from all of that trauma. So I'm, like, helping create changes in circuit 12 now.
[23:47] A: Cool.
[23:48] B: Yeah.
[23:48] A: Oh, that's awesome.
[23:50] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[23:52] A: Good job.
[23:53] B: Thanks.
[23:54] A: So proud of you.
[23:56] B: It's just mind blowing the direction my life is heading.
[24:01] A: So cool.
[24:01] B: This was a miracle.
[24:03] A: Yeah.
[24:04] B: This was a miracle. And I, you know, I'm very spiritual and I am. I don't want to blur lines between patting myself in the back and giving props to God, but everyone around me is. You should be so proud of yourself. You should be so proud of yourself.
[24:21] A: Yeah. Right. You did it.
[24:24] B: Yeah, I did it.
[24:26] A: Yeah.
[24:26] B: I did it.
[24:27] A: Right.
[24:28] B: I didn't know how I was.
[24:29] A: And you prayed.
[24:30] B: I did.
[24:31] A: You did it.
[24:32] B: Yeah.
[24:33] A: Right. And you had faith and you believed and you advocated.
[24:38] B: Yeah.
[24:39] A: And you didn't stop. You didn't walk out when they said, oh. And you're like, no, I'm gonna go back. Right.
[24:50] B: I thought.
[24:51] A: Which shows. Right. How much you want her.
[24:54] B: Yep.
[24:55] A: And she gets to feel that.
[24:56] B: Oh, yes, she does. She does. Her attorney pulled me aside. I know. She just got to feel my whole crew come in there to support me and everyone in the courtroom. Like, I'm just so grateful she gets to experience that. Is that somebody fought for her.
[25:20] A: Yeah.
[25:20] B: And she has family.
[25:22] A: Yeah.
[25:22] B: Yeah. Because for five years she was lost in the system.
[25:27] A: Right.
[25:27] B: And now she's not. And her behavior completely flipped around. Completely. She. She got Baker acted over and over and over again. She's in a behavioral center.
[25:40] A: Okay.
[25:40] B: And they kept extending her date. And right after the custody thing happened. She hasn't gotten in any trouble. We get a three day visit every weekend. Yeah. She's just. She's a success story. It's just so amazing to watch. Is that, like. And my. My oldest daughter that lives with me, she followed suit as well. She's doing so good.
[26:08] A: Yeah.
[26:09] B: And I even asked her, I said, do you think you would have been able to deal with all these codependency issues if I wouldn't have dealt with mine? And she said, absolutely not.
[26:22] A: Yeah.
[26:23] B: It just.
[26:24] A: Again, it's not lip service.
[26:28] B: Yeah.
[26:29] A: You're walking the talk.
[26:31] B: Yeah.
[26:32] A: You're an embodiment of the whole thing.
[26:36] B: Yeah. I couldn't have even dreamed this up. I couldn't have even. It's like, beyond my wildest dreams.
[26:44] A: Yeah.
[26:45] B: Where my life is today.
[26:46] A: Yeah. So cool.
[26:47] B: Yeah.
[26:48] A: So she'll be back in May.
[26:49] B: May 6th.
[26:51] A: Wow.
[26:51] B: Like three weeks, two and a half weeks. Full time, Forever.
[26:58] A: Awesome. Then you got to figure out, like schooling and all that other stuff.
[27:01] B: Yep. And luckily it's the summer.
[27:03] A: Yeah. Right.
[27:04] B: So.
[27:04] A: Great.
[27:05] B: And we'll have a really good transition, a lot of time together. I dropped a shift at work starting at the end of the month.
[27:11] A: Yeah.
[27:12] B: And I gave my oldest daughter the choice. I. I was very clear with her. I said, I want to let you know you are not a parent. You are not responsible for watching her while I'm at work.
[27:24] A: Sure, Sure.
[27:25] B: I. I will handle it.
[27:27] A: Sure.
[27:28] B: But if you want to, if you are willing, I will drop your rent. You can focus more on school.
[27:37] A: Yeah.
[27:39] B: And just let me know. It took her a couple months to think it over. And I didn't bug her about it.
[27:44] A: No.
[27:44] B: Didn't even bring it up. I was just kind of trying to prepare for.
[27:49] A: Yeah.
[27:49] B: You need getting a day job and switching things over. Yeah. And I knew it would be fine. And she came to me like a month ago and she said, I want to help. I want to be here for my sister. And so she's going to watch her the four nights that I work.
[28:05] A: Okay.
[28:05] B: And as my day come in, daytime income kind of goes up. Then I'll drop another shift for night and transition into daytimes. But at least I'll be able to be there during the day. She has any issues at school.
[28:18] A: Yeah.
[28:19] B: You know I'll be there.
[28:20] A: Right.
[28:21] B: Yeah. My whole life is just rad.
[28:24] A: So at 13, she gonna be seventh, eighth grade.
[28:27] B: She's going into eighth grade.
[28:29] A: Going into eighth grade. Okay.
[28:30] B: And she's brilliant. She's in all advanced classes.
[28:33] A: Wow. Awesome. Where do you think she'll go? Where are you guys?
[28:37] B: She's going to Booker.
[28:39] A: Okay.
[28:40] B: Middle. Yeah, yeah. That's the school zone.
[28:43] A: Okay.
[28:43] B: But we're gonna check it out since we have the summer to kind of.
[28:46] A: Definitely check it out, look at it.
[28:47] B: And see if there might be better options.
[28:50] A: Yeah. Because you do get choice.
[28:52] B: Yes, we do. Yep. We're gonna do a little tour when she comes home this weekend and just to drive around and get the feel of it.
[29:01] A: Yeah.
[29:02] B: We've started looking into the schools. Looks like a decent school. It's a magnet school.
[29:07] A: It is.
[29:07] B: Yeah.
[29:08] A: Yeah. I have a friend that his daughter went to Booker High based on all of the art stuff that they have.
[29:15] B: Right.
[29:16] A: And that was great for her.
[29:18] B: Nice.
[29:18] A: Yeah.
[29:19] B: Yeah. I think it's a science, like.
[29:21] A: Yeah, like science, magnets. Yeah. Maybe stem something to that extent. Yeah.
[29:26] B: Yeah.
[29:27] A: That's so cool.
[29:28] B: I know. I haven't been a mother to a minor child in 12 years.
[29:34] A: Wow.
[29:35] B: Yeah.
[29:37] A: Isn't that cool?
[29:38] B: Yeah. I'm nervous in the best way.
[29:42] A: Right.
[29:43] B: And so excited.
[29:44] A: Right.
[29:45] B: But I'm just like swimming in gratitude. Once a day at least, I cry and I'm just. I feel so loved.
[29:55] A: Yeah.
[29:56] B: By God.
[29:57] A: Yeah.
[29:58] B: So loved.
[29:58] A: Yeah. Well, you can feel it now.
[30:01] B: Yeah. Yeah. I don't.
[30:03] A: You always have been.
[30:04] B: Yes.
[30:06] A: But with that stuff.
[30:07] B: Yeah.
[30:08] A: You couldn't feel it.
[30:09] B: Yeah.
[30:10] A: Right. Now that you get your own worth to you, you feel more of it.
[30:20] B: And the urge to date has completely went off. I'm like, man. Nope.
[30:26] A: Life is full in other ways.
[30:28] B: Oh. Yeah. I would like to really put my 100% into repairing my relationships with my children. I don't have time to give to another human being right now. I'm full and I'm fine with that for the first time in my entire life.
[30:44] A: Right. I don't need that in order for me to be okay.
[30:49] B: No. I don't have this nagging loneliness feeling anymore.
[30:52] A: Isn't that cool?
[30:55] B: I just thought that was who I was. Like, I just. I like accepted it.
[31:00] A: Yeah.
[31:01] B: And learned how to cope with it as best I could.
[31:03] A: Yeah. Right.
[31:04] B: You know, I never thought in a million years it would go away.
[31:08] A: Yeah.
[31:09] B: Yeah.
[31:10] A: That's so cool.
[31:11] B: I, like, accepted it as an innate part of who I was and tried to do my best with it. And I just never imagine how much fuller I would be single. Like, it doesn't bother me.
[31:27] A: Right. Right. It's not needed.
[31:31] B: No.
[31:32] A: To have a full life.
[31:33] B: No.
[31:34] A: Right. If at some point I desire it later.
[31:37] B: Right.
[31:38] A: Fine. But you get it that what there is for me to do now is to get this.
[31:44] B: Yes.
[31:45] A: To work.
[31:46] B: Yes. This is my season with my children.
[31:49] A: That's right.
[31:49] B: And healing these.
[31:50] A: I keep thinking about that. In my world, I go, I've got an 11 and a 15 year old. That means the 15 year old's got three more years.
[31:57] B: Yeah.
[31:58] A: Well, I don't have a lot of time, so if there's any time that I can be off and have space and be with her at an activity or an event or. Yeah. Definitely going to make sure I. I get that.
[32:14] B: Yeah.
[32:15] A: So that I can be present, be there and around. Doesn't mean I'm always great.
[32:22] B: Yeah.
[32:25] A: Yesterday I yelled, did you? Oh, my. My daughter, youngest daughter, she was trying to help in the morning and we had had a cup that had like a smoothie in it without the top on and she happened to hit a. I guess it would have been a cutting board that was in the sink. She hit it and it hit that, and then that spilled, and then it went all over and it splattered everywhere. And she's the kid that, like, is the Messian.
[32:57] B: Yeah.
[32:58] A: And I'm like. Because of course we're trying to get to school. All the other stuff, it doesn't happen. You know, Saturday afternoon when you got nothing going on.
[33:12] B: Right, Right. That is when I'm the most easily triggered, is when I'm pressed for time.
[33:20] A: And that's it.
[33:21] B: Yep. Yeah.
[33:22] A: And that's where part of where we want to go is the world that we live in does everything it can to speed us up.
[33:30] B: Right.
[33:31] A: Right. Everything that it can to speed us up. And. And for people who are doers, we just get in do mode.
[33:37] B: Right.
[33:37] A: Right. What we all want to learn how to do and the practices is how do I slow down and create more space. Right. That's my practice.
[33:50] B: Right.
[33:50] A: And I don't always do a good job of it, but I know that if I don't do things that take care or slow things down, then I have a tendency to just go.
[34:00] B: Yep. Yep. That's where I become a spazzy mommy.
[34:05] A: Yeah. Yeah. And I'm a doer, so I just do.
[34:10] B: Yeah.
[34:10] A: I'll take it all on. And I'm like, yeah. And then when I'm crunched or there, then I'm more agitated or reactive.
[34:19] B: Yep. Because you're under this pressure.
[34:21] A: Yeah. When I don't want to be.
[34:24] B: Yep. That's time management is the biggest things me and the little one are working on.
[34:29] A: Yeah.
[34:30] B: Because she wants to stretch out all her time at home. But I. The one thing I can't budge on is being late for work, showing up late to bring her back. Eh. I'm enjoying my time with her. It's not correct, this big thing, but I can't be late for work.
[34:47] A: Yeah.
[34:48] B: So I've. I. She sees the difference of when I'm just driving or we're in traffic and I'm running late.
[34:57] A: Right.
[34:57] B: Different moms.
[34:58] A: Oh, yeah.
[34:59] B: Yeah.
[34:59] A: Yeah.
[35:00] B: And I'm always like, I'm sorry. My anxiety is very high.
[35:03] A: Yeah.
[35:05] B: So yesterday I asked her, can you do me a favor and get ready and leave a little early? Well, I don't want to. And I said, I'm just asking because I knew if I asked her, she would say yes because I'm starting to learn her. I was like, I'm just asking as a favor so I don't get so stressed out. And she was like, okay. And we left a little early, and she didn't have to see this fazzy mom on the way to take her back.
[35:36] A: Right. Yeah. Because that's what happens.
[35:38] B: Yeah. I've got to leave early when we're.
[35:40] A: Pressed for time, and then it's more stressful. Traffic lights. I don't know why. When I'm in a hurry, it seems that I get the traffic lights.
[35:49] B: All of them. And then you get stuck behind people in the left lane that are going five miles under this.
[35:55] A: Right. Because here's why that happens. When we're stressed, our vision becomes more tunneled.
[36:03] B: Huh.
[36:06] A: So I don't see over here.
[36:09] B: Right.
[36:10] A: Right. When I'm more settled and I've got more time or space, I see more.
[36:16] B: Yeah.
[36:16] A: So therefore I'm able to adapt more to the flow of traffic when I'm tunneled. I am not able to be adaptive to the flow. I don't see the opening that I could move into that I can. When I'm in the flow, when I give myself more time.
[36:44] B: Yes.
[36:45] A: Yeah.
[36:46] B: Yes.
[36:46] A: That's a good thing to learn and a good thing for her to be getting.
[36:49] B: Yes.
[36:50] A: From you.
[36:51] B: Right.
[36:51] A: Right.
[36:53] B: I'm really grateful that we're gonna have this summer to kind of pan our schedule out. That's a gift too.
[36:59] A: Oh, yeah.
[36:59] B: That I don't have to just put her right in school.
[37:02] A: Right. And she doesn't have to go into what is more stressful.
[37:06] B: Right. Adjusting.
[37:07] A: She will be more stressed if she had to do both at the same time.
[37:11] B: Yes.
[37:12] A: Right. Because we're always. It's always different. Adapting to fully living.
[37:16] B: Yep.
[37:17] A: With someone and then being there part time.
[37:20] B: Yeah.
[37:21] A: Right. And then I would. Having to go right to school. That's a whole nother all the peer interactions. And still in the world of like middle school, nobody wants to go back to being 13, 14, 15 ever. And it's really funny because I. We had a supervision yesterday with like our counselors and one person brought up that they were dealing with like a 15 year old who is doing homeschool, but it's like so a little bit isolated, but also like down and depressed, doesn't like herself or what she looks like or. And you know, what do we do with that? I'm like, well, we normalize that. How many of us raise our hand, felt really good about ourselves at 13, 14, 16. How many of us thought that we were like, you know, the. The prettiest, handsomest, best. Nobody. No, nobody. Right. How many of us would go back to being 13 or. No.
[38:20] B: That's when I was the most insecure.
[38:22] A: Right.
[38:23] B: Yeah.
[38:23] A: Right. It's the flip side. Like, nobody in their 20s would trade places with Warren Buffett, who's in his 90s.
[38:29] B: Right.
[38:30] A: Even though he's worth billions.
[38:33] B: Right.
[38:35] A: Because he's 90.
[38:36] B: Right.
[38:37] A: What do you do with the billions?
[38:38] B: Right.
[38:41] A: Right. So it's the same thing. Nobody wants to go back to being 13, 14, 15. And so we want to normalize that. This is normal and natural for you to have insecurities, for you to sometimes feel down and depressed, for you to have anxiousness, for you to be quiet or loud or like all of that stuff is how people adapt. Even the people who seem to be the talkers, they're doing that in the social situation because that's what they do when they're uncomfortable. Somebody else might just get quiet when they're uncomfortable.
[39:12] B: It's like a coping mechanism.
[39:13] A: It is where people, like other kids will go, oh, no, that person's fine because they're able to talk. Yeah. No, that's their coping mechanism. I got all the same anxieties too.
[39:23] B: I do that. Like, if I ever get pulled over, that cop is getting an earful. He knows my whole story. I just start babbling and getting even more social when I'm anxious or nervous.
[39:40] A: Yeah, right, right.
[39:42] B: Yeah. That really. I kind of. I did need to hear that because I want to tell my. My 22 year old dad.
[39:51] A: Yeah.
[39:52] B: And I do. But I. I think that was a sign to reiterate that, like the, the social anxiety that you feel.
[39:59] A: Yeah.
[39:59] B: The pressure you feel working and going to college, wanting to kind of sink into your bed on your time off.
[40:06] A: That's all natural.
[40:07] B: It is natural and normal.
[40:09] A: Yeah. That's the problem. We don't normalize things. It's the same stuff. You know, when I was doing a lot of sex therapy.
[40:18] B: Mm.
[40:18] A: Well, yeah. No, we need to normalize what's going on with that person because people go, I might have a quote, unquote, bizarre, unusual interest. That's normal and natural. Right, Right. We want to normalize the human behavior, the human existence.
[40:39] B: Right.
[40:39] A: Because it's not easy, and it's not easy all the time. And it's hard and things aren't fair or just or Right. The key thing we want to back into is it doesn't need to be fair, just or right in order for me to be. Okay.
[40:54] B: Yes.
[40:55] A: In order for me to have what I need to maneuver my way through it in a way that's best for me and the people that matter to me. Right. So the issue isn't that there were things that Happened. It's what you did after the thing that happened that's so dramatically different.
[41:16] B: Right, Right.
[41:19] A: You reached out to support. You stopped, you left. You have say yes.
[41:29] B: And I didn't sabotage.
[41:31] A: Right, Right. And I just didn't keep eating all the cookies. Yeah. That's awesome.
[41:42] B: I know.
[41:43] A: Good for you.
[41:44] B: Yeah. In the past 18 months, I had that slip.
[41:49] A: Yeah. Right.
[41:50] B: That's amazing.
[41:52] A: Right? Right. And it isn't the slip. It's that I immediately stopped.
[41:57] B: Right. Yeah. So I haven't been an active addict or alcoholic.
[42:03] A: That's right.
[42:03] B: Over a year.
[42:04] A: Right. Mm. How cool is that?
[42:07] B: That's not me anymore.
[42:08] A: Right, Right. And that's that part you are in the process of. I'm changed. And now I'm also creating. How do I want to be right in the world? How do I want my life to go? I want to be as a mom. Who do I want to be as a person?
[42:27] B: Yeah.
[42:27] A: I knew growing up in the space town that I grew up in, if I had stayed there, I was going to be the same person because it was the same kids from K through 12. And you would be stuck as the same person.
[42:43] B: Yeah.
[42:44] A: So I needed to leave. And then I got the opportunity to transform myself when I went away to college, and then when I came down to grad school, and then when I left grad school and worked in the school system. Then when I left the school system and move down here, each time, I got to create a new iteration, taking the parts that didn't work as well. Right. Keeping the parts that did and adding more. Yeah.
[43:15] B: Yeah. It's pretty cool. Like I'm just discovering who I am.
[43:19] A: Yeah. Right, right, right.
[43:22] B: It just trip. It even trips me out sometimes.
[43:25] A: I bet it does.
[43:25] B: I'm just like, whoa, who am I? Who is this person? And it's so cool too, because I hear it from everybody.
[43:37] A: Yeah.
[43:38] B: People sit next to me in meetings that I go to.
[43:40] A: Yeah.
[43:41] B: You're different. I know. I am different.
[43:45] A: Yeah.
[43:46] B: I'm not this attention crazed.
[43:48] A: Right.
[43:48] B: Impulsive, insecure.
[43:50] A: Right.
[43:51] B: Little stuck in 15 mentality person anymore.
[43:56] A: Right. He's healed. That's the difference. Right. When you connected with the guy, who's a guy that I've known since I was little, and then I reconnected with him after not knowing him for a long period of time. Right. That was the regressed part.
[44:13] B: Right.
[44:16] A: And then you got to be you. No, this isn't working. This isn't what I want.
[44:21] B: No, thank you.
[44:22] A: Right. And I got up and I left.
[44:25] B: Yeah.
[44:25] A: I stopped.
[44:26] B: Yep.
[44:27] A: Right.
[44:27] B: And never spoken to him again.
[44:29] A: Right.
[44:30] B: Blocked him.
[44:30] A: Because he doesn't fit.
[44:31] B: No.
[44:32] A: He doesn't fit with who I am and who I'm becoming.
[44:35] B: No. And before, I would have felt like I owed it to him.
[44:40] A: Right.
[44:41] B: Apology and all that. Now I'm just. No. No. Thank you.
[44:45] A: Right. Right. That's where I never get when people go, I gotta have closure. That was closure.
[44:51] B: That was closure.
[44:52] A: Right. I didn't need some extra thing.
[44:56] B: Yes. I'm not fixing my daddy issues with this guy. Please apologize and love me enough to change your ways. Like that little girl healed.
[45:07] A: Right. Right.
[45:10] B: She got the closure.
[45:12] A: Right. That you're okay.
[45:14] B: Yeah.
[45:14] A: Yeah.
[45:15] B: And I will.
[45:16] A: She gets to see.
[45:18] B: I protected her.
[45:19] A: You did, didn't you?
[45:20] B: Yeah.
[45:21] A: Mm.
[45:21] B: And that's all she ever wanted.
[45:23] A: Right. And she gets to see who she becomes.
[45:25] B: Yeah.
[45:26] A: Mm. Right. That's what your kids are seeing. That's what other people are seeing.
[45:30] B: Yeah.
[45:31] A: And it's more and more of an evolution.
[45:34] B: Yes, it is.
[45:34] A: Isn't that cool? So.
[45:35] B: So cool.
[45:36] A: Good job.
[45:37] B: Thanks. So I'm glad you called me in here because it really, like, puts into perspective, like, where I was when I first met you.
[45:46] A: Yeah.
[45:47] B: You know.
[45:48] A: Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's what I was curious. I'm like. We've done lots of stuff. I'm really curious to see how things have, like, you know, just expanded.
[46:00] B: Yeah. Radically transformed.
[46:02] A: Yeah. Yeah. You did great.
[46:05] B: Thank you.
[46:05] A: You're doing great.
[46:06] B: Thank you.
[46:08] A: It's awesome.
[46:09] B: I have service commitments through recovery. I'm working with this organization called Parents for Parents.
[46:16] A: Yeah.
[46:16] B: I'm all. I got voted into this board where we present all of our ideas to circuit 12 CPS caseworkers.
[46:24] A: Isn't that cool?
[46:25] B: Big things happening.
[46:26] A: Yeah.
[46:27] B: Yeah.
[46:27] A: That's awesome.
[46:28] B: Yeah. I don't have idle time. Like, I'm busy and doing things with my life.
[46:33] A: Right.
[46:34] B: I got a car.
[46:35] A: And doing more than just working. Like, really doing stuff that becomes a contribution in a bigger way.
[46:44] B: Yeah.
[46:45] A: Yeah.
[46:45] B: And I remember in one of our sessions, I mentioned, like, I've been afraid to drive because of that accident where my mom died.
[46:55] A: Yeah.
[46:56] B: I got my license. I got a car. I'm just, like, a functioning member of society, so.
[47:04] A: Cool.
[47:05] B: Yeah. I got the car last. I think it was October.
[47:12] A: Okay.
[47:12] B: Yeah.
[47:13] A: Yeah.
[47:13] B: That radically changed my life.
[47:15] A: I bet it did.
[47:16] B: Yeah. I didn't drive for 12 years.
[47:17] A: Yeah.
[47:18] B: 12 freaking years. The whole time I was without my kids.
[47:22] A: Yeah.
[47:22] B: Basically.
[47:23] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[47:26] B: And now that's normalized.
[47:28] A: Mm.
[47:28] B: I would not go without a car again. I don't know how I did that for so long.
[47:36] A: It was purgatory.
[47:37] B: Yeah.
[47:38] A: You're out of purgatory.
[47:39] B: Yeah, I'm out of purgatory.
[47:42] A: Right. Killing the game and not handcuffed yourself anymore.
[47:45] B: No.
[47:46] A: Right.
[47:46] B: No, I'm not in a box anymore.
[47:48] A: Right. Right. So if your daughter or anybody needs anything, happy. To do anything I can to be of assistance with any of that.
[47:57] B: Yeah.
[47:57] A: So know that that's in the background too.
[47:59] B: Yeah.
[48:01] A: Yeah. Cool.
[48:03] B: I know.
[48:04] A: I'm so proud of you. Good job.
[48:06] B: Thank you. Thank you for helping me.
[48:08] A: Oh, my pleasure. It's such an honor. Yeah. Yeah. You're doing great.
[48:16] B: Yeah.
[48:17] A: Cool.
[48:17] B: Thank you. This is a good time to do an update, right? Check in.
[48:21] A: Yeah. Yeah. Well, cool.
[48:24] B: It's hard to believe. It's been almost a year.
[48:26] A: It's been over.
[48:27] B: Over a year.
[48:28] A: Over a year since the last time that we met.
[48:30] B: Wow.
[48:30] A: Right?
[48:31] B: Wow.
[48:31] A: Yeah. Because you had just thought about. I'm gonna write the letter.
[48:35] B: Yes. It has been over a year.
[48:38] A: Right.
[48:39] B: Wow.
[48:40] A: This is what I'm doing. I'm gonna do and see if I can advocate for it. Then all of a sudden, there's an opening. I go, wow, the law changed, huh?
[48:50] B: And I nabbed it, jumped on it. That's right.
[48:52] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[48:54] B: And this has opened the door for other people.
[48:56] A: That's right.
[48:57] B: Yeah.
[48:58] A: Right.
[48:58] B: I've had, like, news stations reach out to me already, but I'm gonna wait.
[49:02] A: Yeah.
[49:03] B: Till my case is closed. Get. Get my kid back.
[49:07] A: It's not about that. Right. And yes, you can let other people know, but it's not about that. No, it's about that. And this is the coolest part. Right. That people can heal and they can transform their lives for the better. That's the thing that struck me most in working with any of the Sala survivors, except for the longest time, people are like, yeah. They're never gonna change.
[49:31] B: Yeah.
[49:32] A: Well, no. Not only can they change and heal and transform, and then they get to go out and make a bigger difference. Yeah.
[49:43] B: I'm graduating Selah in June.
[49:45] A: Oh, awesome.
[49:46] B: I know.
[49:46] A: And show people the way.
[49:48] B: Yes.
[49:49] A: That's the key thing. It's showing people the way. And notice that I said show. It's not telling people the way.
[49:56] B: Right.
[50:00] A: You're showing people the way.
[50:01] B: Yeah.
[50:02] A: Good job.
