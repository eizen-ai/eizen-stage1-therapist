[00:00] A: All right. So today is the 17th of April, Nikki. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable, it might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:14] B: Yes.
[00:15] A: Awesome. So first, give me an update on how our last session left you really good.
[00:20] C: The first few days, I was very tired. Yeah. I think I slept for like 16 hours after the session.
[00:28] A: Yeah.
[00:29] C: I went home knocked out. I think my brain just had to kind of process everything.
[00:34] D: Well.
[00:34] A: Yeah, we did like, you know, 15 years of therapy.
[00:37] B: Yes.
[00:38] A: In an afternoon.
[00:39] C: Yes. So it definitely. Definitely wiped me out physically. So I had slept it off, but I did keep track of a few things that happened.
[00:51] A: Yeah. What have you noticed for yourself? What have you noticed that's been different?
[00:56] C: My response to things that are happening around me. I've just. I felt very even keeled.
[01:06] A: Cool.
[01:07] C: I've had a couple instances that came up that before the therapy would have definitely emotionally triggered me.
[01:18] D: Okay.
[01:19] C: And a lot like, I. My response was like, non reactive.
[01:26] A: Really cool.
[01:27] C: Which is very surprising. Even with, like, my daughter and the job thing.
[01:33] D: Yeah.
[01:34] C: Pressure really used to be an emotional trigger for me because I would have all these thoughts about homelessness hanging over my head. And with her not working and me picking up her slack, I used to light into her and I mean, she would hear my mouth for hour or more sometimes because I would be scared, you know, that I was gonna lose my place to live or.
[01:59] A: Yeah.
[02:02] C: And my response to her, like, nonchalantness about me picking up her slack. And I even bre. Noticed it, my case manager, that I'm just like, yeah, so picking up some extra shifts and it's gonna be good. Just overall, I've been so calm.
[02:22] A: Cool.
[02:22] C: It's been great.
[02:24] D: Yay.
[02:24] C: Yeah. It's been different at work. I had an incident happen yesterday where I was getting my butt handed to me. They cut all the other servers off the floor. Cause we were dead. And it was just me and two other people. And the restaurant filled up and there were no sections. I had table all over the place. I'm zigzagging around and two ladies had to wait 10 minutes to get their wine. And they knew the owner. And I found out that as they were sitting there, they texted him, complaining. And when I found out about it, Dr. Q. Normally that would have triggered the shit out of me.
[03:12] A: Sure.
[03:13] C: Because in my emotional mind, they were dangerous. Like, I. I Would just feel this sense of like, they're out to get me.
[03:22] A: Yeah.
[03:22] C: You know, how dare they? And it would throw my whole night off. And that didn't happen. I mean, I bitched about them a little bit, and I was like, who would do that?
[03:35] D: Right.
[03:36] C: Who would go out of their way to. I know. The owner. When clearly I said. I explained it to every table.
[03:44] B: Look, we.
[03:45] C: I just got, like, eight tables. You know, I'm doing the best I can. It's gonna be a couple minute wait, but that was just yesterday. That was the most recent, like, thing that it would have sent me into a spiral.
[03:58] D: Yeah.
[03:59] C: Because the way that people treated me, I personalized.
[04:05] D: Yeah.
[04:06] C: Big time.
[04:07] D: Yeah.
[04:07] C: And yesterday I literally just laughed it off.
[04:10] D: Yeah.
[04:11] C: Like, oh, I'm going out of my way to complain. Rare. You know, So I, like, I complained about it, but more in, like, poking fun at them kind of way.
[04:22] D: Right.
[04:23] A: It wasn't personal.
[04:24] C: It wasn't personal.
[04:25] A: Yeah. Was their crime.
[04:27] C: It was their stuff.
[04:28] D: Right.
[04:29] A: Yeah.
[04:29] C: I. That's crazy, right? Yeah.
[04:32] D: Yeah.
[04:33] A: Isn't that cool?
[04:33] C: I didn't flip my shit.
[04:35] A: Right.
[04:36] C: I knew it had nothing to do with me.
[04:38] A: Yeah.
[04:39] B: That I was.
[04:40] C: I'm literally in tears right now thinking about how freaking. So good.
[04:44] B: Yes.
[04:47] C: Whoa.
[04:47] D: Yeah.
[04:47] A: That's awesome.
[04:48] D: Right?
[04:48] C: Yeah. I mean, any other time, I would have lost my shit.
[04:53] D: Yeah.
[04:53] C: Not 80% of the time. Not 50% of the time. 100% of the time. Because I was under so much pressure Right. At work anyway.
[05:04] A: And everything felt like it meant something about me.
[05:09] B: Yes.
[05:09] A: It was a personal affront to me.
[05:12] B: Yes.
[05:13] A: But you get. And that's where you were emotionally. It wouldn't have mattered whether I was the server or somebody else.
[05:21] C: Right.
[05:22] A: That's how they would have been.
[05:23] B: Yeah.
[05:24] A: I know the owner.
[05:26] C: I will text you.
[05:28] A: Do you know it's taking me 10 minutes to have my wife.
[05:31] C: I know.
[05:32] A: I'm whining.
[05:35] C: Never mind all the servers that are running around like mad people.
[05:39] D: Right.
[05:39] A: Yes.
[05:40] C: Yeah. So I didn't get that rage feeling that would come over me.
[05:45] A: Yeah.
[05:45] C: I didn't get that panic feeling that was coming over me.
[05:49] A: Cool.
[05:49] C: Yeah. I handled that shit like a boss.
[05:54] A: Good job.
[05:55] C: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Awesome. Yes.
[06:00] A: I'm so happy for you.
[06:01] C: Thank you.
[06:02] A: When you think about the stuff that we cleared, some of the incidents that happened, what do you notice about those things now?
[06:12] C: I don't feel very emotional about them.
[06:15] D: Yeah.
[06:17] C: I don't even feel this pressing need to share my story with people to explain myself away.
[06:24] A: Isn't that cool?
[06:25] B: Yeah.
[06:25] C: Which I kind of felt compelled to do on a daily basis for some reason.
[06:29] A: Really Interesting. Okay.
[06:31] C: Like, hey, I've been through some shit, everybody. This is why I am the way I am. You know, I don't. That's kind of died down.
[06:38] A: Yeah.
[06:40] C: I don't feel. When the thought of Eric comes up. My ex. There's zero attraction. Oh, I have a little story to share. The universe is funny. Dr. Q. What in the hell? So I had a court hearing.
[07:04] A: Okay.
[07:04] C: And I didn't bring this up. I don't know why. It just didn't cross my mind. But I filed a motion to have my rights reinstated after termination for my 12 year old daughter.
[07:14] A: Cool.
[07:15] C: Just shot in the dark. But I did it. And the judge loved me. The judge advocated for me when DCF put. Pushed against me.
[07:26] D: Yeah.
[07:27] C: And we have to wait till she's 13 in December because that's a statute.
[07:31] A: Okay.
[07:32] C: But she set up visitation.
[07:34] A: Cool.
[07:34] C: And we're revisiting in December. Two days before my court date, my ex's baby mama started working at my job. And I trained her. On her first day, she comes in and my manager's like, this is Audrey. You'll be training her today. And my jaw dropped to the floor. And I was like, audrey, Eric's baby mom? She denied it. I think maybe she was nervous. This would have emotionally set me off because my last. My last meeting with her, the last time I saw her, I was drunk.
[08:23] D: Yeah.
[08:23] C: I guess I. This is confidential, right? Guess I punched her in the face and drug her by her hair. I don't remember that. They didn't arrest me for it.
[08:36] A: Sure.
[08:37] C: But that's what he told me. And that's what she said. And she tried to get me arrested. She stole my phone. She tried to sabotage my job. So like two days before court, all of those thoughts would have normally been like, oh, my God, she's gonna try to fuck this up for me. Because I normally get very paranoid about stuff like that. I handled it like a boss.
[09:03] D: Yeah.
[09:04] C: I was so nice to her. It didn't even emotionally trigger me at all.
[09:08] D: Right.
[09:08] C: I honestly was just like, brought up a little about what happened and I was like, if it is you, I just want you to know that, like, I don't mean you any harm.
[09:20] D: Yeah.
[09:21] C: I quit drinking, you know, six months ago. After that.
[09:26] D: Yeah.
[09:26] C: I'm really sorry. Like.
[09:29] D: Yeah.
[09:29] C: And I just got through it and it kind of worked itself out because she was. Her behavior wasn't good at work and they didn't wind up keeping Her. But it was just so. It was like the universe sent me a test. The biggest test I could have possibly fucking faced me in my face, bro. I was like, what? I'm like, this is either her stalking me or this is gone. Like, there's no in between. This doesn't just happen. And either way, that would have triggered me normally because I had all this healthy stress about court coming up. And the one thing I was afraid most of Dr. Q was is that that police report was gonna be used against me for my case because my pattern was abusive men. And that was the night he punched me in the face. You know what I mean? And my whole thing is proving that I'm not doing that anymore.
[10:25] D: Right.
[10:26] C: So this was a huge test for me.
[10:28] D: Yeah.
[10:29] C: Cause it's like, oh, shit. Like, it was staring me right in my face. And normally it would have sent me backward.
[10:37] D: Yeah.
[10:37] C: And I would have been right back in that fear of, oh, my God, they're gonna see that police report. And nothing came of it. And it wasn't verified, but still, it. Like, in my PTSD mind, like, none of that mattered.
[10:49] D: Right.
[10:49] A: Of course.
[10:50] C: It was like something I was obsessing about being held against me, and I didn't this time.
[10:57] D: Yeah.
[10:57] C: I was like, this is an opportunity to pray for her. That's literally was my first thought.
[11:02] D: Right. Right.
[11:05] C: That's how I got through it.
[11:07] A: Isn't that cool?
[11:08] B: Yeah.
[11:09] A: Yeah. Well, that. And you shifted it in. I owned what I did.
[11:16] B: Yeah.
[11:18] D: Right.
[11:18] A: And that. That's not me.
[11:20] C: That's not me.
[11:20] D: Right.
[11:21] A: That was behavior that I had. That's not me.
[11:23] B: Yep.
[11:24] C: That's something that happened.
[11:26] D: Yeah.
[11:27] C: And the way I even handled it back then was good because I reached out to Selah the next morning.
[11:34] D: Yeah.
[11:34] C: And I said, hey, the pattern's back. I need some help.
[11:39] D: Right.
[11:39] C: And now I'm here.
[11:40] A: Yeah.
[11:41] C: Yeah.
[11:42] A: Isn't that cool?
[11:42] B: Yeah.
[11:43] C: Good job. The universe is, like, trippy. I was like, no, no, bro.
[11:51] A: So cool.
[11:51] C: I know.
[11:52] A: Yeah.
[11:53] C: Good stuff, right? Yeah.
[11:55] A: Yeah.
[11:56] C: I mean, it didn't trigger me at all.
[11:58] D: Yeah.
[12:00] C: And anytime the thoughts would even try to creep back in, they were shut down immediately.
[12:05] D: Right?
[12:06] C: Immediately.
[12:06] D: Yeah.
[12:07] C: And I was like, no, cool. That doesn't exist.
[12:11] B: Yeah.
[12:11] C: That was great.
[12:12] D: Right? Right.
[12:13] B: Yes.
[12:14] A: So the stuff that we cleared, that doesn't have the effect on you. It's adjusted how I'm seeing current situation, so it's not doing that to me.
[12:25] B: Yeah.
[12:25] A: Not everything's coming in is meaning shit about me.
[12:29] B: Yep.
[12:30] A: I'm reading other people's stuff as being about them. So I bet you that they were doing that thing.
[12:35] C: Yeah.
[12:35] D: Right.
[12:36] A: Like, I still didn't like that they did that thing, but it wasn't feeling like it was a personal.
[12:40] C: Right.
[12:41] D: Right.
[12:42] B: Yeah.
[12:42] C: And, like, I normally, I would have been obsessing about her sabotaging me, and, like, I would have went right back to all of my worst fears.
[12:52] D: Right.
[12:52] C: It was so right.
[12:54] A: Even handling your daughter not working.
[12:56] B: Yes.
[12:56] D: Right.
[12:57] B: Yep.
[12:58] A: Like, it's. The context of, this isn't permanent. This is temporary.
[13:05] B: Yep.
[13:06] A: She was doing it at that job. She didn't really quite like that job. Now she's got a different job. Well, let's make sure now that she likes this job to, like, act the way that you want to be acting, to have a job to keep your job.
[13:20] D: Right.
[13:21] B: Yeah.
[13:22] C: Yeah. Pressure doesn't make me buckle.
[13:25] D: Right.
[13:26] C: That's a miracle.
[13:27] D: Right.
[13:27] A: And it's. It's context as well. Context in everything. Used to be. Oh, my goodness.
[13:33] C: Ah, yes.
[13:35] A: Now it's like, oh, okay, this is what we're dealing with now. It's not going to be like this forever.
[13:38] C: Bigger picture.
[13:39] A: Yes. Right. Because you're like, okay, so I'll be tired for a few days.
[13:44] B: Yeah.
[13:44] A: A couple weeks. Work an extra shift so that we cover things so it's not stressful.
[13:48] D: Okay, great.
[13:49] A: I'll be tired for a little bit. No big deal. I'll find times that I can take naps. Oh, I did. Cool. Awesome. Whoa. Wow. Good job, Nikki.
[14:01] C: Thank you.
[14:01] A: You're doing great. Wow, that's so awesome.
[14:07] C: And my first test since our last session, my dad, when he would lose something, like his keys or his wallet because he was a drunk, he would always wake up and I'd hear him stomping. And then you'd be like, nicole, where's my goddamn keys? And if I didn't fix his problem quickly, he would beat the. If I showed him any talk back or I didn't help him find him.
[14:36] D: Right.
[14:36] C: He would beat me. So for years, anytime I would lose something or something would go wrong, I would panic, and it would feel like the world was closing in on me, and it took me a long time to figure out why. And, like, I made the connection years ago, and I started trying to stay aware of that. But, like, since the session.
[15:01] B: It was.
[15:01] C: The day before court, and I had to print out all these things, and my printer wouldn't connect because she was fucking with her printer on her computer, and then now mine wouldn't work, and that panicky feeling started to come up again. And for a second, it lasted, but I caught it. And I was like, oh, my God. Well, you know, why are you doing this and trying to connect right when I have all this important stuff going on. And I saw her about to walk into her room, and then I caught it, and I was like, no, we're not doing this. This is the pattern. And I immediately just shut it down. So it did kind of try to creep back in, but I caught it. And that was the first catch since the therapy.
[15:55] D: Yeah.
[15:56] C: It was the first time I kind of saw that pattern try to come back. And I was like, wait, come back here. We're not doing this. You know, I'm not. I'm not who I was. We're not gonna go down that road. I was like, let's pray. Let's pray together, because this is not that big of a deal. It's a fucking printer.
[16:16] D: Right.
[16:17] C: And she came back, we held hands, and I was like, God, thank you for your healing. I am not going down this road. I'm not letting this pattern and the enemy come back into my life anymore. And it just went away.
[16:35] D: Yeah.
[16:35] C: And after that, I haven't really had to catch anything. It just happened. But that was like the first little test, and I saw the pattern trying to creep back in, and I was like, no, I'm not doing this. And normally I wouldn't catch it till after my freak out.
[16:52] D: Right.
[16:52] C: And then I would come back and I'd apologize and say, hey, I got triggered. I freaked out. But this time it was right before my little meltdown. Yeah. I even wrote it down just in case I forgot to tell you.
[17:07] D: Yeah.
[17:07] C: But that was, like, the first little thing that happened, I think, a couple days after.
[17:13] A: Yeah.
[17:14] C: I saw you.
[17:15] A: Yeah.
[17:15] B: Yeah.
[17:16] A: That's awesome.
[17:17] C: So awesome.
[17:18] A: Yeah. Because you took time and you paused and you breathed and you prayed.
[17:33] D: Right?
[17:33] B: Yeah.
[17:35] D: Right.
[17:36] A: And it was in the pausing that gave perspective. Because you recognized. No, here's the thing that I normally get. I'm not getting looped by that.
[17:47] D: Yeah.
[17:48] C: That had me in its grips. My whole life.
[17:52] D: Yeah.
[17:52] C: My whole life. Any one little thing would go wrong. And it felt like my world was closing in on me.
[18:01] D: Right.
[18:01] C: Something terrible was gonna happen. Because I'd lose a fucking paper. I couldn't find my keys or the printer stopped working right before this big thin. And I caught it.
[18:15] D: Right.
[18:16] A: So the world didn't get to close in.
[18:18] C: No.
[18:19] D: Right.
[18:20] A: It stayed open.
[18:21] B: Yep. Yep.
[18:22] A: And you found that you had more space.
[18:24] B: Yes.
[18:25] C: That it was just a printer.
[18:27] D: Right.
[18:27] C: There were other solutions Right. Even if I couldn't get it to work.
[18:32] A: And see, the coolest part is the construct of that changed. So construct is how that had been coded in your brain based on what you had experienced in life. That's not running you like it was.
[18:48] C: No.
[18:49] D: Right?
[18:51] A: Yeah.
[18:52] B: Yeah.
[18:52] A: And we didn't even do a lot with dad and being pissed.
[18:56] B: No.
[18:57] D: Right.
[18:58] C: We did that one with the gun.
[19:01] D: Right.
[19:02] A: Just that one.
[19:02] C: Just that one.
[19:04] D: Right.
[19:07] C: Wow. I'm so grateful.
[19:11] A: And your brain generalizes out.
[19:17] D: Right?
[19:19] B: Yeah.
[19:19] C: Cause I mean, that was years of every day he would do that shit to me.
[19:24] D: Right.
[19:25] A: Even when you think about. Cause you wrote down a whole bunch of stuff on that piece of paper.
[19:31] D: Right.
[19:31] A: And I read through that. But even that, if you think about the time that there was the first gang rape.
[19:39] B: Yeah.
[19:40] A: And you think about that now and you even know that there was another one.
[19:44] B: Yeah.
[19:46] A: When you think about that other one, what do you notice?
[19:48] C: I feel nothing.
[19:49] A: I know. Isn't that so cool? Nothing.
[19:52] C: You said the word gang rave. And I'm like, the piece didn't even waver a tiny bit.
[19:59] A: That's so freaking cool.
[20:00] B: So cool.
[20:01] A: And we didn't talk about that one.
[20:03] C: No.
[20:04] D: Right.
[20:05] A: So here's the cool part about our brain. When our brain learns something and it gets it, it will start applying it to all of the other experiences that have similarity. Right. And notice we didn't do the same experiences. We had a selection of.
[20:23] C: We did.
[20:24] A: Which means the brain is taking those pieces and going, oh, generalizing out to.
[20:31] C: All sorts of amazing.
[20:33] A: Isn't that cool?
[20:34] C: That's amazing.
[20:36] D: Right.
[20:36] C: Going through one specific trauma. Just healed. Years of ongoing abuse with my father.
[20:44] D: Right.
[20:45] A: And then because the construct underneath was, it still felt like it was my fault that.
[20:54] D: Right.
[20:54] A: So now I fast forward to being at work and super swamped. Even letting people know that because I'm super swamped, things are going to be a little bit slower.
[21:04] B: Yep.
[21:06] A: And normally these fucking bitches telling my boss about like, what the fuck, they're out to get me. You're like, fucking bitches. Whatever.
[21:14] B: Yeah.
[21:15] C: I had one of my friends leave me a good review this morning. Liz was so great. They did come in to eat. But I, you know, before it, I was like, hey, will you write a review for me?
[21:29] A: Yeah.
[21:30] C: Just to kind of counteract it because I am a great server.
[21:34] D: Right. Right.
[21:36] A: And even in texting the owner, it's not your fault.
[21:41] C: No.
[21:41] A: You didn't say to the rest of the servers, we're going to know send you home. Cuz we're not busy.
[21:49] B: Yep.
[21:50] A: That wasn't your decision to make.
[21:51] C: Nope.
[21:53] D: Right.
[21:54] A: And who would have thought that. Oh, well, now we're getting swamped with all.
[21:58] C: Now we're getting swamped with three people.
[22:01] A: It's a big restaurant.
[22:02] C: They didn't have to calm me down.
[22:04] D: Right.
[22:05] C: Like they've had to do before and reassure me.
[22:07] D: Right.
[22:08] C: That everything was okay and that it wasn't my fault.
[22:11] D: Right.
[22:12] C: They even, like. They were like. Yeah. I mean, there was nobody to ask for help to get the wine.
[22:18] D: Right.
[22:19] C: There was one manager there.
[22:20] D: Right.
[22:21] C: One server. Assistant. Three servers, one bartender. There was nobody for Liz to even say, hey, could you run that wine?
[22:29] D: Right.
[22:30] C: Just wasn't. Was what it was. And the manager came back later and said, yeah. I looked at the camera. There was absolutely nothing you could have done. You're fine. That nobody had to freaking coddle me.
[22:45] D: Yeah.
[22:46] C: And tell me they love me and it's okay.
[22:48] A: Because you're becoming more okay in you.
[22:50] B: Yes.
[22:52] D: Right.
[22:52] A: That it's not so directed by. Out there. You're already okay in here.
[22:57] B: Yep.
[22:58] A: Right before as I kept having to look and hoping that I get it out there.
[23:03] B: Yes.
[23:03] A: To reaffirm when I'm not sure I fully can believe in here.
[23:07] B: Yes.
[23:08] C: And thank God I work in a place where they were willing to do that for me that they don't have to anymore.
[23:14] D: Right.
[23:15] A: But that also says something about you changing.
[23:19] B: Yeah.
[23:20] C: That says a lot about me changing.
[23:22] A: Right. And you were growing even prior to coming in here, that they were interested in doing that.
[23:29] B: Yeah.
[23:29] A: Because you said you worked at a different place before.
[23:33] B: Yeah.
[23:33] A: Where it felt like sometimes the. The kitchen staff would just give me a hard time just screwing me.
[23:41] B: Yeah.
[23:42] C: The gm, Right. He was a piece of work.
[23:46] D: Right.
[23:46] A: And you left that job.
[23:47] C: I left.
[23:48] A: Good job.
[23:49] B: Yeah.
[23:49] C: Thank you.
[23:50] A: Right.
[23:51] B: Thank you.
[23:51] A: Because again, that's you valuing you.
[23:55] C: I knew from all the work that I've been doing that I would have to agree that I liked it and stay in a sense, so to speak. I've got a shitty boss. He's an asshole. He yells at me. Either I'm gonna keep letting myself be emotionally triggered all the time, or I'm gonna try to find somewhere else that's better. You know? Like, I knew I didn't want to be a victim anymore. I didn't want to set myself up to be victimized because I played that card for a long time and it worked. I got a lot of pity for a long time telling my story. But then I stayed in those victim scenarios.
[24:37] A: I Didn't want that anymore.
[24:40] C: I don't want my angry boss to beat me up.
[24:43] D: Right, Right.
[24:44] A: Anything more about the guy at work that, like, came to your house? That guy?
[24:51] C: Oh, he doesn't bother me at all. We're good. I fist bump them all the time. Yeah.
[24:57] A: Yeah. But it's no longer a yeah. It's not a don't come here. Don't come here.
[25:02] C: Yeah.
[25:02] A: Anymore. Right.
[25:05] C: He's remaining blocked. You know, I'm not gonna re friend him and no.
[25:12] A: Be like, hey, because he's a work person.
[25:15] B: Yes.
[25:16] D: Correct.
[25:17] A: Very different.
[25:18] C: And he doesn't creep on me. I don't feel that energy.
[25:23] D: Right.
[25:23] C: I treat everybody the same. I'm not sexualizing my energy. Like, I was either before.
[25:30] A: Isn't that cool?
[25:31] C: Yeah.
[25:31] D: Right.
[25:32] C: I mean, I just did that, like, subconsciously, constantly. I invited that energy in.
[25:38] A: Right.
[25:39] C: And now I just am more professional.
[25:43] D: Right.
[25:44] A: Because I don't need to go there.
[25:46] B: No.
[25:46] C: I don't need that validation.
[25:49] D: Right.
[25:51] C: I didn't even notice that part. I didn't even notice that part. I've been trying to work on that for a long time. Even at my last job.
[26:01] D: Yeah.
[26:01] C: When I got involved with Selah, I was like, I need to work on sexualizing my energy. Not sexualizing my energy.
[26:07] A: Yeah.
[26:09] C: But it was a struggle for me. I found myself doing it all the time. Time.
[26:12] D: Yeah.
[26:12] C: But, yeah. This. Since our last session, I haven't been doing that.
[26:18] D: Right. Right.
[26:21] C: I didn't even notice that one.
[26:23] A: Right.
[26:23] B: Yeah.
[26:24] A: Because it's not anything that I'm needing that kind of validation outside of me to be okay in here.
[26:30] C: Right. And I'm not trying to recreate the trauma on some subconscious level.
[26:38] A: Well, that's what I meant by. Remember how I said earlier, like, the first time we got together, that you have a broken picker.
[26:45] B: Yes.
[26:46] A: That both the guys that you're finding yourself being attracted to and attracting to you are guys that are not.
[26:56] B: Well, yes.
[26:58] A: That was. That whole sexualizing.
[27:01] B: Yes.
[27:02] A: That would repeat the cycle.
[27:04] B: Yep.
[27:04] D: Right.
[27:05] B: Yep.
[27:07] D: Right.
[27:07] C: I have like, zero urge.
[27:11] D: Right.
[27:12] C: To draw guys in.
[27:15] D: Right.
[27:16] B: Well.
[27:16] C: Or unwell.
[27:18] D: Right.
[27:21] A: Because you're not. It's what it isn't anymore. And what it was before was an open wound.
[27:28] B: Yes.
[27:30] A: That a certain kind of person is drawn to.
[27:34] B: Yes.
[27:36] C: So it's like a wound. Like my behavior.
[27:39] A: So predators.
[27:40] B: Yeah.
[27:41] A: Are attracted to weaknesses, not strengths. The shark smells the blood.
[27:48] B: Yes.
[27:49] A: It's already an injured thing. So all predators go after things that they know are weak.
[27:57] B: Yes.
[27:58] A: Or weaker than them. Because predators are in trouble. If they go against something that's strong.
[28:04] C: So that's why when I show weakness or reaction, he becomes stronger. Yeah, that makes sense.
[28:12] A: Yeah. Predators are attracted to weakness because if they go against something strong and they get hurt, their livelihood is over. So I use the example sometimes of lion is king. But lion has mighty roar. Lion doesn't seek out strongest gazelle, biggest elephant, tallest giraffe, most robust zebra, biggest rhinoceros.
[28:45] C: Love your safari references.
[28:47] D: Right.
[28:48] A: Lion doesn't search out the biggest gorilla.
[28:52] B: Yes.
[28:52] A: And say, I'm gonna take you on to show you how mighty I am. What lion goes for is the baby, the injured, the old, the ones that can't fight back, the ones that I know I will completely destroy.
[29:10] B: Wow.
[29:11] D: Right.
[29:12] A: The alligator goes after the small child or the small dollar.
[29:16] C: And I'm not putting off victim vibes anymore.
[29:18] A: Right. That's what I meant by the wound. Right. So there's a certain thing that there's two areas. One is that predators get attracted to it. But I don't see them as predators, even though they are. But the other one that it shows up is rescuers that also have their own shit. But I gotta rescue you. Follow me. So those would be the things that I would find myself drawing towards me and being drawn towards.
[29:52] B: Yes.
[29:54] A: I don't feel that rescuer is all about I gotta fix the other person.
[29:58] B: Yep.
[29:59] A: Whether it be something that I do, I gotta fix them.
[30:01] B: Yep.
[30:02] A: Or something that they do, they gotta fix me. But when a rescuer does that, what they're not doing is taking care of themselves. So it's a hundred percent projection. It's all the other person.
[30:11] C: Yeah. That's like the story of every relationship I've ever had.
[30:17] D: Yeah.
[30:18] A: So that's what's changing.
[30:19] C: Yes.
[30:20] A: Yeah.
[30:21] C: So that really got fixed without me noticing.
[30:24] D: Right. Right.
[30:25] A: Because I'm not sending out those vibes or that pheromone or that Whatever. Right. To draw that towards me. And as you put it, I want to be solid and not need someone else. Right. The deal with the world that we live in today, a woman needs a man about as much as a fish needs a bicycle, which is not at all.
[30:53] C: Right.
[30:53] A: Right. Because a woman doesn't need a man. Heck, the penis wasn't even designed for her pleasure.
[31:00] C: Right.
[31:01] A: Designed to make babies. She's got a whole other thing that's designed just for pleasure. She doesn't need that for that. A woman needs a man about as much as a fish needs a bicycle. A woman doesn't need a man to go to the Grocery store for. Doesn't need a man to make money. Doesn't need a man to pay rent. Doesn't need a man. Right. So she doesn't need him. For a woman, it feels really good when the guy is a caretaking guy, when he cares about her and he does nice things and he likes her to feel good. Like, he brings her flowers or he says, well, you look pretty or you smell nice or your hair looks beautiful or. But I don't need that. Like, I don't need that. Right. So where we want it is for a woman. One. She's the regulator. She's the one that gets to decide. And the question for a woman always with a guy is not, oh, my goodness, do I get to be with the guy? But is, am I gonna allow that guy to spend time with me? Because he's lucky if I allow him to spend time with me, because as a woman, I've got the goods.
[32:13] C: Come to think of it, saying no has been so easy for me.
[32:18] A: So cool.
[32:19] C: Yeah. Like, I've get hit up on. On messenger. I have a lot of friends in recovery.
[32:24] A: Yeah.
[32:25] C: So, like, guys will hit me up.
[32:27] D: Yeah.
[32:28] C: And I literally used to struggle and not be able to say no, even if I meant no.
[32:36] D: Right.
[32:37] C: I would be like, oh, yeah. Maybe because I was so afraid to hurt feelings.
[32:41] D: Right.
[32:42] C: And every single time I've gotten hit up since the appointment, I'm like, you know, I'm not available to date until I've got at least a year clean.
[32:53] D: Yeah.
[32:53] C: And my youngest daughter's been home for a while, so I just don't have time to see you.
[32:59] D: Right, Right.
[33:01] C: I never would shut somebody down that quickly.
[33:04] A: Right.
[33:07] D: Right.
[33:08] A: That's great.
[33:09] B: Yes.
[33:09] A: That's you taking care of you. And that's why I say women are regulators. They're the ones that get to decide.
[33:15] B: Yeah.
[33:16] A: Guy is the pursuer. Woman is never to be the pursuer.
[33:21] B: Yep.
[33:22] A: The female panther never runs after the male panther.
[33:25] B: Yep.
[33:26] A: Even when she's in heat, she doesn't run after him going, do me, do me, do me.
[33:30] D: No.
[33:30] B: Yeah.
[33:31] A: She lets him know that I'm approachable, But you're gonna need to work to get me because I'm worth it.
[33:36] B: Yeah.
[33:38] A: Right. So the woman is the regulator. She gets to decide the where and the when and the with whom and the how much and the what time. Not him.
[33:49] B: Yeah.
[33:50] D: Right.
[33:51] A: So that's where. Where you're getting solid in. I don't need a guy.
[33:56] B: Yep.
[33:57] A: So I liken it to. If there's a sunset, it doesn't need me there in order for the sunset to be beautiful.
[34:05] B: Right.
[34:06] A: It's beautiful on its own.
[34:07] B: Yeah.
[34:08] A: If I'm there seeing the beautiful sunset, I don't need somebody else with me in order to experience the beauty of the sunset. Now I could add and have somebody with me and we might share nice conversation as we watch the sunset.
[34:24] B: Right.
[34:25] A: And it may add to the experience, but I don't need it in order to experience the beauty of the sunset. Just like the sunset doesn't need me there in order for it to be beautiful.
[34:37] B: Yep.
[34:38] D: Right.
[34:40] A: That's how we want you to be.
[34:42] B: Yes.
[34:42] A: Is that I don't need that.
[34:44] C: I don't.
[34:45] D: Right.
[34:45] C: And I'm very like.
[34:48] A: And so I'm gonna be way more protective of my time.
[34:53] B: Yes.
[34:54] D: Right.
[34:55] C: And I've made the decision that right now is not the time. This is the time that I'm committed to my healing journey and my recovery. So saying no, not alignment with what.
[35:08] A: You'Re already up to. And it's easier for you to do what you're in alignment with.
[35:14] B: Yes.
[35:15] A: Yes.
[35:18] C: Other people's feelings.
[35:20] D: Right.
[35:20] A: So think of alignment. Alignment with your head energy, your heart energy, your gut energy. That's an alignment. Alignment is like a laser beam.
[35:33] D: Right.
[35:33] A: If it's diffuse, it's like a light in a dark room that's not very bright. It sends off diffuse light so you can't really read. Right. Laser beam is like right on. That's coherence. That's alignment.
[35:53] D: Yeah.
[35:54] A: Cool.
[35:54] C: It's so cool.
[35:55] A: Yeah. Those are huge changes.
[35:58] C: Huge changes.
[35:59] D: Yeah.
[36:00] C: Saying no is like such a struggle for me before.
[36:04] D: Right.
[36:05] C: I think it really brought up those feelings of my dad.
[36:08] D: Yeah.
[36:09] C: I'm not like that victim remorsed type feeling of I don't want to hurt their feelings.
[36:15] A: Right. What will they think of me?
[36:18] B: Yeah.
[36:18] C: They won't like me.
[36:19] D: Right now.
[36:21] A: Do we care?
[36:22] B: No.
[36:23] D: Right.
[36:24] C: No, Like I just.
[36:25] D: Right.
[36:26] A: Because do you want people to like you or that aren't okay with you being in coherence and doing things that are in alignment for you?
[36:36] B: Right.
[36:38] A: Because if they don't like you because you said no, that's better.
[36:42] C: Right.
[36:43] A: Now they don't have to be part of the.
[36:45] C: Then their intentions were not good.
[36:46] A: If they're like, cool, that's great, maybe I'll hit you back up in a year.
[36:50] C: Right.
[36:54] A: Right. Different story.
[36:56] B: Yeah.
[36:56] D: Yeah.
[36:58] A: Cuz like, I'm supportive of what you're up to.
[37:00] B: Yep.
[37:01] D: Right.
[37:02] A: Which is what you want in a mate.
[37:05] B: Yes.
[37:06] A: Is somebody who's supportive of what you're up to and sees your greatness and sees you even as more.
[37:18] C: Then easy.
[37:20] D: Right.
[37:21] A: Sees you as more than maybe you're seeing you. They see your greatness. So I tell my therapist, if you can't see the client in front of you as more than the problem, you need to refer them to somebody else. Because the best a person can be for you is always based on your own internal representation of them. So if a teacher sees the kid as a C student, guess what? For that teacher, the kid's gonna be a C student and get beyond it. Right. So the best a person can be is based on your own internal representation of them. So if you can't see your client's greatness, you're doing a disservice working with them.
[38:10] C: I like that.
[38:11] D: Right.
[38:12] A: So in a partner, in a mate, you want your mate to see your greatness see you as more than problems.
[38:22] B: Yes.
[38:23] D: Right. Right.
[38:26] A: And you're not needing that from them to give me the attaboys for me to know that I am doing the things. So the other part of it is I'm not just talking my walk.
[38:43] C: Right.
[38:43] A: I'm walking the talk.
[38:46] C: Right.
[38:47] B: That's a huge.
[38:48] A: Well, not just giving lip service to things.
[38:51] C: Right.
[38:52] A: So that's what I mean by when you had the conversation, if you are that Ashley.
[38:57] B: Right.
[38:58] A: I'm not the same gal I was. And that actually led me to really changing me in a positive way.
[39:04] B: Right.
[39:04] A: I'm really sorry for, you know, what I did. That's you not just giving lip service. It's walking the talk.
[39:17] D: Good job.
[39:17] C: It was easy.
[39:18] A: It was easy.
[39:19] C: So easy. I'm just like, I'm not gonna waste my time.
[39:23] A: Right.
[39:24] C: Here's the deal. I don't have time to see you.
[39:27] D: Right.
[39:29] C: Normally I just string them along.
[39:32] D: Right.
[39:32] C: You know?
[39:33] D: Right.
[39:34] C: And I mean, like, it was almost kind of masochism on my end too.
[39:39] A: Well, it was one of those things that I needed, so just in case. But I got somebody, you know, in the. In the. In the works, in the back end, just in case.
[39:50] C: Somebody that wants me and desires me. So I'm going to string him along a little bit so I can get my little fix.
[39:56] D: Right.
[39:57] A: Because it makes me feel good to know that somebody wants me.
[40:00] B: Yeah.
[40:00] A: Even if I don't want that.
[40:01] B: Yep.
[40:02] C: I don't need that.
[40:04] D: Right.
[40:04] A: Because I want me.
[40:05] B: Yep.
[40:06] A: Right. I don't need. It's not coming. That's the sunset.
[40:10] B: Yeah.
[40:10] A: It's not coming from somebody else. Don't need us. Beautiful.
[40:14] B: Yeah.
[40:15] A: Sunset doesn't go. There's nobody at the beach.
[40:16] D: Okay.
[40:17] A: Well, I guess I'm not that pretty today.
[40:20] C: I've been trying to achieve this, like I've been on this healing journey for few years now.
[40:24] D: Yeah, right, right.
[40:27] A: And this was just a little bit over that.
[40:29] C: Yeah, right.
[40:30] B: Yeah.
[40:31] A: You did great.
[40:32] C: Thanks.
[40:32] A: Yeah. So what kind of shows up? What do you want our time today to be doing?
[40:38] C: The only thing that's kind of been stressful, emotionally triggering, kind of occupying my thoughts when my I don't hear from my little one. You know, I got good news in court. Case manager's working with me. It's all good. But, you know, my kid is stressed out. I'm not allowed to share the good news with her. And it probably would help if I could so she could have some help.
[41:10] A: You're not allowed to share the good news with the 12 year old?
[41:13] B: Yeah.
[41:13] D: Okay.
[41:14] C: I can't tell her that visits got approved. I can't tell her that we won in court, but we have to wait till December. The case manager and the whole team's like, you know, let's just let her be a kid. But she was allowed to hear about it, and now up until a point where it turned good, it's like she wants to know the answers. And now I have to say, well, I can't share details with you. So she hasn't been calling as much. Sounds a little depressed. But when she doesn't call, I start thinking the worst. Kinda like I'm like, oh, God, did I say something wrong? So I think that the thing with the kids is still kind of triggering me a little bit.
[41:59] D: Okay.
[41:59] C: I wonder if it's not like it was before, but it's still. My brain's like, oh, you know, did I say something? Did I go too far? And now I can't talk to her. Do I need to hurry up and get this done? That's kind of the only thing that's been really irking at me that I've had to put a lot of effort into.
[42:21] A: Not so I want to understand you. You had the situation where you gave up parental rights and then she's living.
[42:30] C: With whom in a group home.
[42:32] A: So she's living in a group home. You went and petitioned to get parental rights back. She's still living in a group home.
[42:39] B: Yep.
[42:40] C: She was adopted. And three years ago she was removed from the adoptive parents home.
[42:45] D: Okay.
[42:46] C: And I lost contact with her. Just got back in contact with her last year.
[42:51] D: Okay.
[42:52] C: Her first words were, mommy, will you adopt me? When I talk to Her. And I was like, you know what? I'm gonna try. I'm gonna see what I can do. So I did a lot of research. I found out that you have to meet all these requirements to have rights reinstated after termination. And I met all the requirements except for her age. So I didn't hire an attorney. I did all this on my own. It's been a lot of work. I mean, like, packets submitted as evidence. Like, just lots of work. But I did it, and the judge sided with me because she hasn't succeeded anywhere else. She's going from group home to group home to group home, has a lot of behavior issues. She wants to come home to me in India. So it's looking good, but I. I have this fear that I'm gonna lose contact with her again.
[43:50] B: That keeps coming up.
[43:51] D: Okay.
[43:52] C: That's kind of what's been bothering me. So if I don't hear from her.
[43:55] A: So you can't reach out to her, she has to reach out to you. That's part of the rule, so to speak.
[44:02] B: Yeah.
[44:02] C: And she was calling like clockwork until I had to tell her. I can't really discuss details with you, but it's moving. I did tell her, but it's moving in a positive direction. But now she's kind of in a slump and she's not calling us like she was.
[44:20] A: So after the court date when you knew, you're like, oh, I can't tell you, but it's moving in a positive direction.
[44:30] B: Yeah.
[44:31] D: Okay.
[44:32] A: Which is scary.
[44:35] C: What's scary for her? That it's moving in a pos. Oh, for That I can't tell her.
[44:40] A: No. That it's moving in a positive direction. Because that actually could mean.
[44:45] B: Yeah.
[44:47] A: And that's scary.
[44:48] C: That's scary.
[44:49] D: Yeah.
[44:50] B: Yeah.
[44:51] A: Cuz like, she hasn't been ever for a long time in her life not getting what she really wants.
[44:58] B: Yeah.
[44:58] A: To have an opportunity to finally get what I want. That's scary. Yeah.
[45:05] B: Yeah.
[45:06] D: Right.
[45:07] A: It would be like, you know, somebody finally, you know, dating a decent guy.
[45:11] B: It's not about me.
[45:12] A: It's scary that, like, I could actually be with a decent guy that treats me well. Like, what the fuck? Like, that's weird. Like, that's scary. Like, have more of what I want. Like, no way.
[45:25] D: That.
[45:25] B: Yes.
[45:26] A: Right. So that's part of it is that it's scary.
[45:30] B: Yes.
[45:31] A: And it's not sure.
[45:33] B: Yep.
[45:34] A: That's huge. And we've got a still even when December hits. A long time.
[45:40] B: Yeah.
[45:41] A: Because when December hits, there's like. Then, like, we get to see each other, be with each other.
[45:46] C: Like she gets overnights and stuff.
[45:47] A: Yes, but not 100%.
[45:50] C: Right.
[45:51] A: That's scary.
[45:53] B: Yeah.
[45:54] D: Right.
[45:55] A: I mean, she's a kid that was adopted.
[45:57] B: Yeah.
[45:58] D: Right.
[45:58] A: Lived with that people for however long, know what that was like, but for whatever reason, got plucked out of it and put in a group home.
[46:08] B: Yeah.
[46:09] A: With, like, a foster mom, dad, whatever.
[46:12] B: Yeah.
[46:12] C: And now she's in a shelter because she was attacked at her last group home.
[46:16] D: Right.
[46:17] C: So now she's been there a lot.
[46:19] D: Yeah.
[46:20] A: Good thing we know what to do about that.
[46:22] B: Yeah.
[46:22] C: So this isn't about me.
[46:24] D: Right.
[46:24] A: But good thing we know how to help her.
[46:27] C: I was thinking the same thing. It's perfect. It's perfect, right? Yes.
[46:36] D: Right.
[46:36] C: Who better, right, To. To know that all of any meltdowns or any behavior issues she's having is a response to trauma.
[46:45] D: Right.
[46:45] A: It's no longer the what's wrong with you?
[46:47] C: Right.
[46:48] A: It's what happened to you.
[46:50] B: Right.
[46:51] D: Yeah.
[46:52] C: Right. I know.
[46:54] A: So all of that's scary for her.
[46:56] B: Yes.
[46:58] D: Right.
[46:58] A: When things get scary, people sometimes shut down.
[47:01] B: Yeah.
[47:04] D: Right.
[47:06] A: Cause this is something that I've been hoping for and wanting more than anything. Mom said that she would, you know, do what she could to try.
[47:14] B: Yeah.
[47:15] A: Now, she just told me that I can't tell you everything, but it's, you know, looking good.
[47:20] C: Yeah.
[47:21] A: So to speak. Oh. You know, like, there's all that. What do you mean?
[47:28] B: Yeah.
[47:31] C: She'S been acting out.
[47:34] D: Yeah.
[47:35] A: Because I'm gonna. Then, Art, do you really want me? Right. I mean, that would be the thing. It's the testing behavior of. Well, what if I'm a fuck up? Are you gonna want me then?
[47:50] B: Yep.
[47:51] A: What if I do that? Are you gonna still want. What if I. Yeah, makes sense.
[47:56] B: Yep.
[47:57] C: That does make sense. Another one of my fears is that they're gonna move her and that I won't be able to see her or some shit like that's gonna go down. So that's kind of been popping up into my psyche.
[48:08] A: Where is she now?
[48:09] C: Bradenton.
[48:10] D: Okay.
[48:12] A: Do you live in Bradenton?
[48:14] C: I live in Sarasota. Very close.
[48:15] A: Oh, well, maybe they'll move her to Sarasota.
[48:18] B: Okay. Yeah, that's true.
[48:19] A: I mean, if we're gonna think about them moving her, why not think about them moving somewhere closer?
[48:24] C: Right?
[48:25] D: Right. Right.
[48:29] A: Cause if it took, you know, an extra 25 minutes to get to her, that would deter you being able to see her.
[48:35] B: No.
[48:37] C: What if it's in a different district? It'll be a Different judge or something.
[48:43] B: I don't know.
[48:44] C: I think losing my kids, I think that fear is coming up again.
[48:47] B: You know what I mean?
[48:49] C: Scared to lose her again.
[48:51] D: Right.
[48:52] A: But, okay, so what's different about you now than.
[48:57] C: Then I move to the solution. I'll handle it. I'll get around it.
[49:03] D: Right.
[49:03] A: What's different about you now?
[49:07] C: Everything.
[49:07] A: Than when you lost kids.
[49:09] C: Everything.
[49:10] A: That's right. You're not the same woman you were then.
[49:15] C: No. Not even close.
[49:18] D: Right.
[49:20] A: That's what's really different.
[49:22] B: Yeah.
[49:23] A: You're different. That's the reason that the judge sided with you, because not only did you petition, you did all the research. You didn't hire an attorney to do it all for you. You did the research, you filled out the paperwork. You've been consistent. You've been. Over time, you've been doing. You've been having conversations, you've been keeping. Like, I'm a different person now.
[49:55] D: Right.
[49:57] A: Where is the best place for my daughter to be? Well, when I wasn't. Well, not with me.
[50:06] B: No.
[50:07] C: Definitely not.
[50:10] A: But now that I'm well and I'm creating solid ground.
[50:17] D: Right.
[50:19] A: And she's scared.
[50:21] B: Yeah.
[50:22] A: Because she doesn't know what that means. She also hasn't been. She may talk to you and know that you're different, but she's not experiencing you like India is.
[50:33] B: Right.
[50:34] A: Like, mom would normally fly off the handle, and Mom's like, wait, no, come back out here. Let's hold hands and pray. Who the fuck is this lady?
[50:45] C: Right.
[50:46] A: Right. This is not the same mom that I knew. What the hell?
[50:52] B: Yep. Yeah.
[50:55] A: Got it.
[50:55] B: Yeah.
[50:57] A: So she doesn't also fully know how different you are yet.
[51:09] B: And this is.
[51:10] C: I mean, okay, if this is scary for me.
[51:13] D: Yeah.
[51:14] C: This has to be 20 times scarier for her.
[51:17] D: Right? Right.
[51:20] B: Yeah.
[51:21] A: And that can be something that we acknowledge.
[51:23] B: Yeah.
[51:24] A: Scary, Exciting.
[51:25] D: Scary.
[51:25] B: Yeah.
[51:26] A: I have to do that with my daughter all the time. So my daughter, oldest daughter, 14, she gets nervous, anxious.
[51:35] B: Mm.
[51:36] A: And I have to switch it to. Oh, so you're really excited. Oh, so this really matters a lot to you. Oh, so you really want to do really well. Which is all true. But she gets all that nervous.
[51:52] B: Yeah.
[51:53] A: Palms start getting sweaty. She starts getting all.
[51:57] B: Yeah.
[51:57] D: Right. Oh.
[51:58] A: Because it's like, you. It matters to you. You really want to do well.
[52:01] B: Yeah.
[52:01] A: It's really important to you.
[52:03] B: Yeah.
[52:04] D: Right.
[52:04] A: It's exciting.
[52:06] C: Yeah.
[52:07] D: Right.
[52:07] A: Which when. When we say anxious, it's the only term that we use for both nervousness and excitement. When my mom says, I'm really Anxious to see the girls. We know that she's not meaning nervous, intense.
[52:24] B: Right.
[52:26] A: She's meaning excited.
[52:27] B: Right, Right.
[52:31] A: Make sense?
[52:33] B: Yep.
[52:33] C: In this whole situation, none of it's guaranteed, so it's scary for everybody.
[52:39] A: Yes.
[52:39] B: Yeah.
[52:40] D: Right.
[52:41] A: So do I get my hopes up too high and then get disappointed again?
[52:46] C: Right.
[52:48] A: I don't want to get too close and then have it not work.
[52:53] B: Yes.
[52:56] D: Right.
[52:58] A: I'm gonna do these things. Well, maybe she won't want me if I do those things.
[53:02] B: Right.
[53:03] A: All the testing stuff.
[53:04] B: Yeah.
[53:05] A: Got it.
[53:08] B: Yep.
[53:08] D: Yeah.
[53:09] C: So the best thing I can do is just stay available and love.
[53:13] D: Right, Right.
[53:15] A: And just so if you weren't finding yourself so nervous and scared.
[53:23] D: Right.
[53:24] A: Because we know that what you're doing are taking the right steps and taking the right action. So if you weren't finding yourself so nervous and worried, and if she's not talking, it means she must. If that's no longer going on for you, how would you actually be?
[53:39] C: I would just keep going forward.
[53:42] A: And if you keep going forward, like, how do we want you to be as you keep going forward?
[53:47] C: Confident.
[53:49] B: Centered.
[53:50] A: Confident and centered. What's it like when you feel confident and centered?
[53:54] B: Peaceful and happy.
[53:56] A: Yeah.
[53:57] C: And I get to be that supportive mother.
[53:59] A: Right. So we think of you as confident, happy.
[54:06] D: Right.
[54:07] A: Peaceful. Being the supportive mom that's open to however her daughter's being. And any way that her daughter is being is okay. Because you're confident in that you're doing the steps that there are for you to do. And when you're confident and peaceful.
[54:33] D: Right.
[54:34] A: Moving forward.
[54:35] B: Yep.
[54:36] D: Right.
[54:37] A: And as you're checking in right now, how's your body feeling?
[54:41] B: I feel better. I feel light.
[54:44] D: Right.
[54:44] A: Oh, and now I get to lighten up.
[54:46] B: Yeah.
[54:47] D: Right.
[54:47] A: Because that stuff's far too important for us to be so weighed down.
[54:52] B: Right.
[54:53] D: Right.
[54:54] A: We don't want to be so serious unless we're having some fun. Serious fun is good.
[55:02] D: Right. Right.
[55:05] A: So again, as you check in, peaceful and confident, doing the steps there are for you to do to move this thing forward, open as a mom, it's okay with however she's being.
[55:23] D: Right. Right.
[55:27] C: And no matter what any potential outcome could be.
[55:31] D: Right.
[55:31] C: I'm doing the best I can.
[55:33] D: Right.
[55:34] A: You're interested in staying connected in whatever way that looks like.
[55:39] B: Yes.
[55:40] A: There's the. What we want. And I'm moving forward towards it.
[55:44] B: Yep.
[55:44] D: Right. Right.
[55:48] A: And just check. Notice what you're doing, what the judge said. Right. What DCF said, which, again, wasn't about you. It was about past behaviors or Worries they might have had. But you're being different now.
[56:12] B: Yeah.
[56:13] A: We're not human is's. We're human beings. And you're being different than you were.
[56:23] C: I am.
[56:24] D: Right.
[56:25] C: I really am.
[56:26] D: Right.
[56:27] A: You're taking care of you. You're not so easily swayed. You don't need that. Atta boy. Or, wow, that guy's interested. But I don't.
[56:39] C: And I haven't been obsessing. I haven't been obsessing like I normally would.
[56:44] D: Right.
[56:44] C: It does still pop up because, I mean, she's my daughter.
[56:47] D: Right.
[56:47] C: And I'm crazy about her.
[56:49] A: Right.
[56:49] C: She's amazing.
[56:50] D: Yeah.
[56:50] C: And I give anything to have her home right now.
[56:53] A: Right.
[56:54] C: I want her to be okay. I love her so much and I would do anything to take that pain away from her. And I wish I could fix it right now, but, I mean, I am pretty consistent with praying and saying, God, take this. This is stressful.
[57:17] B: This is my kid.
[57:18] C: We don't know what's going to happen.
[57:20] D: Right.
[57:22] C: But I really get now that that doesn't have anything to do with me.
[57:29] A: Right.
[57:30] C: She is stressed. She's scared.
[57:33] D: Yeah.
[57:35] C: And I can't predict what's gonna happen.
[57:37] D: Right.
[57:39] C: Neither can she.
[57:40] D: Right.
[57:40] A: And some of the behavioral stuff is in the testing of, will you still want me?
[57:54] B: Yeah.
[57:54] A: Will you still love me? Because I question all of that. Because, like, the whole parental rights thing.
[58:06] C: And she does struggle with rage and anger. And I. Now that I think about it, she probably was doing her best to keep me from seeing that while I was working hard to do this. And then it's like, okay, well, now this is me.
[58:28] D: Right.
[58:29] C: I'm not perfect.
[58:31] D: Right.
[58:31] C: I'm not this perfect, good little girl.
[58:34] D: Right.
[58:34] C: You know, like, will you love me for who I really am? Or.
[58:40] D: Right.
[58:41] C: The issues that I have.
[58:42] D: Right.
[58:43] B: Yeah.
[58:43] C: That makes sense.
[58:44] D: Right.
[58:45] A: Because I put up my face.
[58:47] B: Yes.
[58:48] A: Will you really love me when you really know me?
[58:51] B: Yep.
[58:55] D: Yeah.
[58:57] A: And then she's gonna get that. Yes, of course I do.
[59:02] C: Better than. Than where she's at now. By far.
[59:07] A: Yeah.
[59:10] C: I think it's just such a mirror. This opportunity is such a miracle. I couldn't have even dreamed this was possible.
[59:17] D: Right.
[59:18] B: Six months ago.
[59:19] D: Right.
[59:21] C: You know, like most people, when they lose their rights or surrender their rights, that's game over.
[59:28] D: Right.
[59:29] C: I'm the first person to do this in Manatee County.
[59:31] D: Yeah.
[59:32] C: They have zero case studies.
[59:34] D: Right.
[59:34] C: Like, I'm the forerunner of this.
[59:36] D: Right.
[59:38] C: And there's other avenues. I'm not going to just give up. I'm not who I used to be. I'm not going to say, oh, you're right, everybody. I can't do it right here because I know that's not true today.
[59:54] A: You're a powerhouse.
[59:56] C: Yeah. And I love my kids.
[59:59] D: Right.
[59:59] C: I do make shit happen.
[60:01] D: Uh huh.
[60:02] C: I do.
[60:03] D: Right.
[60:04] A: And now it's getting channeled.
[60:06] B: Yep.
[60:08] A: In a way that serves you, that supports you, that makes a difference for those that matter to you.
[60:19] D: Right.
[60:21] B: I'm doing great.
[60:22] A: Isn't that cool?
[60:23] B: Yeah.
[60:24] D: Right.
[60:24] A: And just check. Even when you said it, I feel great.
[60:29] C: I feel fine.
[60:29] A: Right. Notice how it's not like, oh, I'm trying to pretend myself to be it or not really it, but I just said it.
[60:34] C: It's just a matter of fact.
[60:36] A: That's right.
[60:36] C: I'm doing great, bro.
[60:39] B: That's crazy.
[60:40] D: Yeah.
[60:41] C: Yes.
[60:41] A: And I'm okay in me.
[60:43] C: Yeah. And this is normal, stressful stuff. This is a big fucking correct deal.
[60:48] D: Yes.
[60:49] C: A huge deal. Like the future hanging in the balance.
[60:55] D: Right.
[60:56] C: And I'm getting through it.
[60:57] D: Right.
[60:58] C: Even if I'm in a place right now where it's fresh and it's new and I'm constantly having to give it to God. That's what I'm doing. That is literally what I'm doing. I'm not spitting out and all these crazy narratives and staying there.
[61:14] A: It's the practice.
[61:15] B: Yeah.
[61:16] D: Right.
[61:17] C: I know. I'm doing my best.
[61:19] A: And the practice is you've been catching it.
[61:21] B: Yes.
[61:22] A: Earlier and earlier and earlier.
[61:25] B: Yep.
[61:26] D: Right.
[61:27] B: Yep.
[61:28] C: Like I normally. I would have texted her caseworker a thousand times almost. Trying to fish and see if I'd done something wrong.
[61:37] D: Right.
[61:38] C: Because it was about me. She not calling.
[61:40] A: Because.
[61:41] D: Right.
[61:41] C: Did I.
[61:42] B: Shouldn't.
[61:42] C: Should I not have said things are moving in a positive direction? I would have tried to fish because I've already done that with her a few times.
[61:50] D: Yeah.
[61:50] C: When I didn't hear from Sefari.
[61:52] D: Right. Hey.
[61:53] C: Just making sure everything's okay. And then I would explain one of my paranoid narratives to her and then she'd know it's not that. And I'd be like, but I didn't do that this time. No, I didn't. I. A couple times I went to and I was like, no, again, bigger. Yeah. Bigger picture.
[62:14] D: Right.
[62:15] C: This is a stressful time for right now.
[62:18] A: You're getting it. That. Oh, it's her being scared.
[62:23] B: Yeah.
[62:28] A: To actually get what I want.
[62:29] B: Want.
[62:31] C: Or even potentially lose it again.
[62:33] D: Right.
[62:34] C: And think I'm getting what I want.
[62:35] D: Right.
[62:36] C: This is the unknown.
[62:37] A: It's Scary to even think that I can get what I want. Cuz what if I lose it? I don't want to have my hopes up high.
[62:43] B: Yeah. Yep.
[62:49] A: But you're taking the steps and the actions.
[62:52] C: I'm so glad I didn't.
[62:54] A: You're in alignment.
[62:56] B: Yes.
[62:58] C: I did not text the caseworker with my paranoid shit either. So that's good.
[63:02] D: Right?
[63:03] C: I didn't think of that because I've done that several times.
[63:07] D: Right.
[63:08] C: Thinking that I did something wrong.
[63:10] D: Right.
[63:11] A: It's not about you.
[63:12] B: No.
[63:14] C: I'm doing everything I can. I'm not perfect.
[63:17] D: Right.
[63:18] C: So I'm doing my best.
[63:19] D: Right.
[63:22] A: And that's what all parties want.
[63:24] B: Yep.
[63:25] A: Caseworker too.
[63:27] B: Yep.
[63:31] D: Yeah.
[63:32] A: Cool.
[63:33] C: Yeah. If by some random chance I had some shitty caseworker that thought the worst of me, that still wouldn't be about me.
[63:43] D: Right?
[63:45] C: And I would fight.
[63:47] D: Right?
[63:48] C: I would fight back. I'd be hiring an attorney.
[63:51] A: Right.
[63:51] C: That's my solution. That's my backup plan.
[63:55] D: Right.
[63:55] C: Because my changed life speaks for itself.
[63:58] A: That's right.
[63:59] C: The fact that I've had my own place for four years speaks for itself.
[64:02] D: Right?
[64:02] C: And the fact that I've had employment for six years with no break speaks for itself.
[64:07] D: Right.
[64:08] C: And no arrests.
[64:11] D: Right.
[64:11] C: You know what I mean? Like, yeah, so that is, that is good news. I didn't text my paranoid shit to her caseworker. Like, I'm sitting there thinking, God, like, should I not even be feeling scared, you know? Yeah, no, that's my baby.
[64:33] A: It's scared.
[64:33] B: Yeah.
[64:34] A: Scared, excited, anxious, all in the same verse thing.
[64:39] B: This is a huge.
[64:39] A: About the same stuff.
[64:41] B: Right?
[64:42] A: So should my daughter not be feeling any of that? No, it's like we had a clinical meeting today and one of the therapists brought up that They've got this 14 year old that, you know, doesn't feel life purpose and is only here because like, you know, she loves her mom. He doesn't want to hurt her mom. Okay, well that's scary, right? Like, there's no. I'm like, okay, let's raise our hand. How many of us would want to go back to being 14? Anybody?
[65:09] D: Anybody?
[65:10] A: Anybody? Anyone?
[65:11] D: Anyone?
[65:11] A: 14, right. So, yeah. At 14, do you have the whole picture of the world? No. You got about this much of it about this far in front of you.
[65:21] B: Yep.
[65:22] A: Do you need to have a purpose?
[65:23] D: No.
[65:23] A: But what you do need to know from the therapist that you're seeing is some context that even at 14, you didn't know. And life sucks at 14. I remember my uncle said to Me, you know, you need to know that this is the best time of your life. I'm like, best time of my life? If it doesn't get better than this, why the fuck are people. Oh my God, this is fucking awful.
[65:47] C: My teenage years has to be the.
[65:49] A: Best time of my life.
[65:50] C: Fuck no.
[65:54] A: I don't feel comfortable. I've got acne. I'm a crybaby because I have no emotional regulation skills.
[66:00] C: Everybody's trying to control my life.
[66:02] A: None of that is good. I hated all of it.
[66:05] C: No, thank you.
[66:10] A: Right. So none of that was good stuff. Like it was awful. So for him to tell me this is the best years of my life. Are you kidding me? Why do people stay around if it doesn't get better than that?
[66:23] C: Right, right.
[66:28] D: Right.
[66:31] C: We're gonna get through this as a family no matter what.
[66:34] D: Yeah, yeah.
[66:37] A: So it's about having the context of.
[66:40] D: Oh, right.
[66:41] A: That's not just natural and normal, but that's like it. And I don't know anybody really, really. Who's 14 that goes. You know, life is just grand.
[66:51] C: Right.
[66:52] A: I love everything about my life.
[66:55] B: Me neither.
[66:56] D: Right.
[66:58] C: I mean, she's so strong.
[67:00] D: Right.
[67:01] C: She's getting through this. I was able to give her good advice too. I told her that we did worry about her a lot when we didn't hear from her. That I thought I was gonna lose her again or like they moved her. And I told her that no matter what she did and no matter what happened, that I would always love her. That when you're not doing good, you can call me. I will never hold that against you. You have been through so much and.
[67:38] A: Now you're saying those things. What she doesn't have confirmation of.
[67:43] B: Yeah.
[67:44] A: Is that you walk that talk.
[67:46] B: Yeah.
[67:47] A: That's what you're going to be demonstrating by what you're doing.
[67:51] B: Right.
[67:51] C: By not giving up.
[67:53] A: And that's what takes a little time.
[67:55] B: Right.
[67:56] A: For her to really get it.
[67:59] C: Because everybody's giving up on her. Every foster family she went to.
[68:09] D: Right.
[68:09] C: She was taken away from them.
[68:14] D: Right.
[68:17] A: Cuz she's got a heavy duty. People don't really want me.
[68:22] B: Yes.
[68:22] A: Since they really know me, they won't want me.
[68:27] D: Right.
[68:27] B: Poor baby.
[68:31] C: So she just needs.
[68:32] A: Nobody goes through the human experience without adversity.
[68:37] B: Nobody.
[68:39] A: Everybody gets stronger by going through the adversity.
[68:45] B: Yep.
[68:46] C: I wouldn't trade my experiences for anything like the level of empathy that I was gifted. It's out of this world in comparison to people.
[69:00] A: That's just a huge amount of capacity.
[69:03] B: Huge.
[69:04] A: That's what Sefari's gonna get from you.
[69:07] B: Yep.
[69:09] D: Right.
[69:11] C: And seven months is gonna fly by.
[69:13] D: That's right.
[69:14] A: It does fly by.
[69:16] C: Yes, it does. And I'm just.
[69:18] A: We're almost to the end of season.
[69:19] C: Like, what the hell? Where'd it go? I have a few more goals that I'm knocking out of the way before she. Before we go back to court.
[69:30] D: Yeah. Right.
[69:35] A: You're taking the right steps. You're taking the right actions. You're doing the actions, taking the steps.
[69:41] B: Yep.
[69:42] C: And like, nobody could convince me to do otherwise. Even if I would have lost that day, I would have came out of in another direction. And I mean, so there's really nothing to worry about.
[69:58] D: Right.
[69:59] C: And lucky for me, I have a strong relationship with God. And I know that he loves my children more than I could ever imagine.
[70:09] D: Yeah.
[70:10] C: And I always knew in my heart that they would come home when God knew I was ready. I would be the best for them. And I believe that time is now.
[70:21] D: Yeah.
[70:21] C: But ultimately I do trust God's plan.
[70:26] B: I do.
[70:27] C: This isn't going to be easy to walk through these emotions. You know, losing my children was like huge trauma. But they're coming back. Two of them already have. And now the third one.
[70:42] D: Right.
[70:42] C: It's happening, right? It is happening.
[70:45] A: And that doesn't happen.
[70:47] B: No.
[70:48] A: Which is a testament to how much you've changed. It's really cool, Nikki.
[70:56] B: Thank you.
[70:57] D: Yeah.
[70:58] C: My kids want to be around me today.
[71:01] D: Right.
[71:03] C: Got a 21 year old at home that doesn't want to leave.
[71:06] D: Right.
[71:07] C: Normally college age kids, they're like, bye.
[71:14] D: Right.
[71:15] C: It is happening.
[71:17] D: Yeah. She's got a pretty cool mom.
[71:19] B: Yeah.
[71:19] C: I am the cool mom. Yep. My, my 18 year old, couple weeks ago, she's in Palm Beach. She's in extended foster care. They're paying for her college. She's getting through her last year of high school. She has a boyfriend up there. He's a sweet kid. I've already met him. I see her about once a month, once every two months.
[71:47] B: She.
[71:47] C: Either I get her to me or I go see her. Texted me and said, mommy, I want to come home. It's the most beautiful words I could ever hear in my whole life. And she knows it brings her comfort to know that my daughter. Doors open.
[72:05] D: Yeah.
[72:06] C: So she wanted to try. She has her own apartment the state is paying for. She has a therapist, she has tutors helping her get through high school. But she knows that she's not facing homelessness. Should that not work out. She has that level of comfort that her worst case scenario is she gets to come home. Would be home with Mommy. And she. We talk every single day. Every single day. Not one day. Maybe one day. But if we miss one day, it's amazing. She's advocating to get her little sister home to me. So she wrote a letter to the judge, like, my children want to be with me.
[72:54] D: Yeah.
[72:55] A: And again, that says something about you.
[72:58] C: Yeah.
[72:59] A: And how much you've changed.
[73:01] B: Yeah.
[73:02] D: Right.
[73:03] C: And they don't worry about me having a breakdown or an episode. Right. And that's all they knew before.
[73:14] D: Right.
[73:15] A: But again, nobody was asking the question, what happened to you?
[73:21] B: Yep.
[73:22] A: They were all just going, what's wrong with you?
[73:24] B: Yep.
[73:26] A: Well, look.
[73:28] B: Yeah.
[73:29] A: You had that shit happen to you. And try not to have fucking stuff. Go on. You try to maintain your cool after that shit.
[73:37] C: Raise some babies before you get help for all that trauma. No.
[73:43] A: Right. I don't know why I drugged and used shit.
[73:46] C: Right.
[73:46] A: Just to not have to feel for moments.
[73:49] C: Right.
[73:50] D: Right.
[73:51] C: I had to do drugs and drink. Oh, shit. Being abused.
[73:56] D: Right.
[73:57] C: How else am I gonna fucking cope with that?
[73:58] A: Right.
[74:00] D: Right.
[74:00] C: I did the best I could, given the life I had.
[74:05] D: Right.
[74:06] C: Getting the shit kicked out of me.
[74:09] D: Right.
[74:09] C: Couldn't get through that sober.
[74:12] D: Right.
[74:15] C: My changed life.
[74:16] A: Does know that at least 70 to 80% of the guys that went to Vietnam, US soldiers, used heroin.
[74:26] C: Wow.
[74:27] A: In Vietnam. In Vietnam, most of them came back not addicted. You go to fucking Vietnam and try to get through without some fucking heroin.
[74:35] C: Right.
[74:37] A: Man, like, holy shit. Like, duh.
[74:42] B: You can't.
[74:43] A: At a war that nobody wants me at that people are hating me for being there.
[74:47] B: Yep.
[74:48] A: Having to kill people. I don't really understand why I'm there. It wasn't like a. You know, we had a good reason to be there to do that there.
[74:57] C: You needed something.
[74:57] A: You know, it's one thing if, you know, It's World War II. Okay. There's Hitler. There's, you know.
[75:01] C: Right, Right.
[75:02] A: The bombing of Pearl Harbor. We got, like, reasons.
[75:04] C: Right.
[75:04] A: You know, it's like, you know, I mean, just.
[75:06] C: I don't know, what am I doing here.
[75:08] A: Right. Little children, families. Like, I mean, the whole thing is.
[75:13] C: Yeah.
[75:13] A: Yeah.
[75:14] C: They had to turn their feelings off.
[75:16] D: Right.
[75:17] A: And then they came home.
[75:18] B: Yeah.
[75:19] A: And see, this is the coolest part, why I wanted to say that is what we know now about addiction. The opposite of addiction is connection.
[75:30] B: Yep.
[75:33] A: So there's research about that, but in Portugal, they're no longer penalizing addiction issues. Like, United States still has a. You know, penalizing it's a legal. And you get felonies. And Portugal, they don't do that. They rehabilitate. They take to rehab, whatever, but they rehabilitate by. Oh, if you're gonna hire this person, we'll pay half their salary for this next two years. Because they want. Oh, you wanted to start a small. We'll pay the startup cost for your small business. Because, you know, the opposite of addiction is connection.
[76:10] B: Wow.
[76:11] A: So you keeping the jobs, you having a family at work, you bringing your daughters in, you connecting to the Selah family. All of the connection is key, not just in sobriety, but in successful life.
[76:30] B: Yep. Yep.
[76:33] C: The relationships that I've restored with my girls, I wouldn't give them that drunk mother back. Billion dollars. There's no fucking way. It's. I've just built too much the people in my life to even, like, have that be some kind of temptation dangling over my face. It's a miracle.
[77:00] D: Yeah.
[77:01] C: Like, do I want to give them that gaslighting, emotionally abusive parent back? Are you. You couldn't pay me a billion dollars.
[77:10] D: Right.
[77:11] C: No way. I've built so much just in this six months that I've been back in Selah and sober.
[77:21] D: Right.
[77:21] C: Mind blowing.
[77:23] D: Right? Yeah.
[77:27] A: And the people that I know who are most successful in changing their life are those that create connection.
[77:37] B: Yep.
[77:38] A: Because what does the substance look. If I've got trauma, it's the thing that I connect to.
[77:44] B: Yeah.
[77:47] A: So now we're creating connection.
[77:48] B: Yep.
[77:49] D: Right.
[77:51] A: And that's huge.
[77:52] B: Huge.
[77:54] D: Right.
[77:55] C: I finally got there. Like, I heard people in recovery talk about that. For all these years I've been in and out, I finally have too much to lose to trade it for a drug. And I wanted that, but I never really felt that even having my kid in my house, I still. It just didn't connect with me before. I didn't feel like I was worth it. Like, I meant. I really meant something to her. I was important to anyone. And now I finally got it.
[78:38] D: That.
[78:39] C: That one drink, that one drug. I would be trading all of this for that. There's no way.
[78:45] D: Right.
[78:47] A: You're worth it to you.
[78:49] B: Yeah.
[78:50] D: Right.
[78:55] A: Because this, you gets all of that.
[78:58] B: Yep. Yeah.
[79:01] D: Right.
[79:03] A: And that's huge.
[79:04] C: Huge.
[79:05] D: Right.
[79:06] C: I couldn't have even dreamt this up.
[79:08] D: Right.
[79:08] A: That you're able to work at a restaurant that sells liquor, beer and wine.
[79:14] C: And not.
[79:15] A: And be okay.
[79:16] C: Be more than okay.
[79:18] A: Right.
[79:20] C: Like, I don't. Even when I get any kind of emotionally triggered or upset. Never my first thought anymore.
[79:27] D: Never.
[79:28] C: No.
[79:29] D: No.
[79:30] A: That's huge.
[79:31] D: Change.
[79:31] B: Huge.
[79:33] A: Really cool.
[79:34] C: Really cool. Yes, Dr. Q. I have journals upon journals of God. Please take this desire away from me. Please, please, please help me. I wanted it bad. And every time I'd slip, I'd get back up and fight more.
[79:56] D: Right.
[79:56] C: But for it to finally happen is just.
[80:00] A: That's your intention. You make shit happen and you don't stop.
[80:10] D: Right.
[80:11] A: That's unstoppable. That's you.
[80:18] B: Yeah.
[80:19] D: Right.
[80:19] A: Seeing life could be different and better for you and continuing to go after it. That's huge.
[80:30] B: Yeah.
[80:30] D: Yeah.
[80:32] A: You're amazing.
[80:33] C: Thank you. It's like hard to wrap my mind around.
[80:37] D: Yeah. Great. Right.
[80:47] A: And this is how different things are.
[80:49] B: Yeah.
[80:50] D: Right.
[80:50] A: That your 18 year old is writing letters saying how different mom is.
[80:56] B: Yeah.
[80:57] D: Yeah. Right.
[81:02] A: Good job.
[81:03] B: Thanks.
[81:03] D: Yeah.
[81:05] B: Thanks.
[81:06] C: I wanted this so bad.
[81:07] A: Right. And that's why it's been easy. Easier going back to your thing about guys.
[81:12] B: Yeah.
[81:13] A: Because you go. Okay. For the next year. I'm not about relationships with men. What I am about is relationship for me and my kids. And that's enough. I don't need that out there. I don't need it at all.
[81:36] B: Yep.
[81:37] A: If one day I choose to add it, it'll be a side ad. But it's not an all encompassing. And it's not because I need. And the guy is gonna need to know, whoever he is, that he's not one.
[81:53] B: Yep.
[81:56] A: They're one.
[82:00] B: Yep.
[82:01] A: He's a step behind them.
[82:04] B: Yep.
[82:04] D: Mm.
[82:08] C: I didn't even know that six months ago.
[82:11] D: Right.
[82:13] A: But see, that's the key part. That is one of the major things is they're one, he's not one.
[82:20] B: Yep.
[82:23] D: Right.
[82:24] A: He needs to know and be really okay with that. He will not be one, they're one.
[82:32] C: Period.
[82:33] D: Right.
[82:38] A: Because it's a different story.
[82:39] D: Right.
[82:40] A: If you are parents and you come together as a couple and then you have your children, you two are the foundation to grow the kids upon. So you have to nurture each other and be each other's one. And the kids are two.
[82:57] B: Yep.
[82:59] A: When you are already separated in divorce and you have children, they're your dependents.
[83:04] B: Yeah.
[83:04] A: As they get older and out of. So they have to be one. Anybody that you bring in needs to know that they're number one. You might be a 1A or two.
[83:15] C: Right.
[83:16] A: But they're number one and that. That's okay.
[83:18] B: Yeah.
[83:19] D: Right.
[83:20] A: Because again, you're lucky that I'm allowing you to spend time.
[83:22] B: Yep. Yep, yep.
[83:28] C: That loneliness wound has definitely been healed.
[83:31] A: Right. That cool.
[83:32] C: It's amazing.
[83:33] D: Yeah. Yeah.
[83:35] C: I don't feel this, like, need for validation.
[83:39] D: Right.
[83:39] A: And that's why it's been much easier.
[83:41] B: Yeah.
[83:42] A: To say no.
[83:43] C: Even before it, like, I was putting a conscious effort into not needing validation.
[83:48] D: Right.
[83:48] C: But it still was, like, plaguing me.
[83:50] A: Right.
[83:54] D: Yeah.
[83:54] B: Yeah.
[83:55] C: It's not.
[83:56] A: Notice how different it is.
[83:57] C: So different.
[83:58] D: Yeah.
[84:00] C: So different. I've been acting so different at work.
[84:03] D: Yeah.
[84:04] C: Just like.
[84:06] D: Yeah.
[84:08] C: You know, might be a little.
[84:10] D: Yeah.
[84:11] C: I don't know. It's just. I feel completely, completely different.
[84:13] A: Isn't that cool?
[84:14] C: It's so cool.
[84:15] D: Yeah.
[84:16] A: So John that works here found out that you had. He's like, oh, my goodness. She came in. Oh, I'm so happy for her. That is so great. She's like. I know. It was around Kobe time when we. I'm so glad that she's come in.
[84:30] C: That's amazing. I know Covid really.
[84:33] A: He was really excited for how much things have changed and how much better you're doing and all that stuff. So I wanted to make sure you knew that.
[84:39] C: Please tell him I said hi.
[84:40] A: Absolutely. I will.
[84:41] C: Yeah. Covid interrupted our process big time.
[84:45] D: Yeah.
[84:45] C: Because it was like, when I came back for my second one.
[84:48] D: Right.
[84:48] C: We had to do another reintroduction.
[84:50] D: Right.
[84:51] C: You know what I mean? All these months had passed.
[84:53] A: Yes.
[84:54] C: So I'm very fortunate.
[84:56] D: Yeah.
[84:56] C: To see you. I'm fortunate that I came back.
[84:58] D: Yeah.
[84:59] C: Yeah. And completed.
[85:01] A: Yeah. Right.
[85:02] B: Yeah.
[85:02] A: Isn't that cool?
[85:03] B: Yes.
[85:04] A: Good job again. That's because you're unstoppable.
[85:06] B: Yep.
[85:08] D: Right. Right.
[85:11] A: It's that song, you know, I get knocked down, but I get up again.
[85:13] B: Yep.
[85:15] C: Period.
[85:16] A: That's right.
[85:19] D: Yeah.
[85:19] A: Cool. So anything else left for you for today?
[85:22] C: No, I'm just thankful.
[85:24] A: Me too.
[85:25] C: So thankful. So grateful.
[85:27] D: Yeah.
[85:28] A: You did awesome.
[85:30] C: Thank you.
[85:30] A: Really proud of you.
[85:31] C: Thank you for doing what you do.
[85:33] D: Yeah.
[85:33] A: My pleasure.
[85:34] C: It was great to have this session, really. Taking a look at how. How things have changed. Because when you don't really look at it right. You just kind of. I've just been kind of getting through.
[85:47] D: Right.
[85:48] C: But taking a look at.
[85:50] A: Right. It's the greatest thing ever, because I remember working with a guy years ago, and then he left, and it was like, a month off after, and he got back, and I was checking in with him. I'm like, well, like, you know, how are things going? He's like, yeah, no, I don't really notice much of anything. I'm like, really? Huh. That's so weird. I go, well, let me just kind of check. All right. So the stuff about your. No, no, that's better. How about the cheating with the wife? No, no, she's. I don't have that anymore. No. How about this stuff with that? No, no, I don't have that. And he's going through all this stuff. I'm like, listing all this stuff that. And he's like, huh, well, yeah, I guess I'm doing a lot better because it became his new normal.
[86:30] C: Yeah.
[86:31] A: So he didn't notice how much things were better and different until he started going back. Oh, right. Oh, that used. Oh, yeah. No, I didn't.
[86:40] D: Oh.
[86:40] A: Oh, yeah.
[86:41] C: Okay.
[86:42] A: They're a lot better now.
[86:43] B: Yeah.
[86:43] C: That's how it felt talking about the stuff.
[86:46] D: Yeah. Right.
[86:47] C: Yeah.
[86:48] A: You did great.
[86:49] C: It's a miracle. Thank you.
[86:50] A: Awesome.
[86:51] C: Thank you.
[86:51] A: If anything else comes up, you know, can certainly get back.
[86:54] C: Okay.
[86:55] A: I think we're in a good spot.
[86:56] C: I think we're in a great spot.
[86:57] D: Yeah.
[86:58] C: Yeah. I'm excited.
[86:59] A: Cool.
[86:59] D: Cool.
[87:00] B: Yes.
[87:00] A: Awesome.
[87:01] C: You're amazing, doctor. You're otherworldly, Dr. Q. Oh, that's so nice. I bet it is.
[87:11] A: That's nice to hear.
[87:14] D: Awesome.
[87:15] A: Awesome.
[87:16] C: This was great.
[87:17] A: Yeah.
[87:18] C: Thank you so much.
[87:18] A: You're welcome.
[87:19] D: Pleasure.
[91:43] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. At least it's not a leaking roof thing. It's a came in through the French doors, but still not fun.
[92:05] D: Yeah.
[92:09] A: Can you hear me okay? Yes. You can call Elizabeth.
[92:25] D: It.
[92:59] A: I am here. Hi, Elizabeth. Happy Monday. Sure. Yeah. Well, it's not really after hours. I just got done. We're good?
[93:32] D: Yes. Sure, sure.
[94:34] A: How do we know it's him? Do we have video? Oh, great.
[94:47] D: Okay.
[95:23] A: Sure.
[95:24] D: It. Okay. Okay. Yeah.
[96:31] A: Sure. Well, sure. And I guess the question shows up, like, you know, does he. Has he ever asked for permission and you know, when he has, like, do we know when, like, times are that work better for them? I mean, like, if he is going to come, is it going to be on a weekend? When is it going to work best for, you know, Jason and Leanne, who are there and having to take care of the property and all of that stuff? Like, do we know any of that stuff or does he just randomly go whenever he wants to or. Or how has that been working?
[97:18] D: Okay. Right.
[97:30] A: But he hasn't done something where he, like, you know, texted or called Jason like two days before and saying, hey, Saturday afternoon, I want to get out in the kayaks. It's Thursday. He doesn't do that. Right. Because that would be the way that anybody would do it. You know, like, even if I teach somebody about dating, you know, if you. The girl's supposed to say no if she's not asked, you know, at least three days before, you know. So if you want to take her out on Wednesday, you need to ask her by Tuesday at the latest. I mean, if you want to take her out on Friday, you have to ask for a Tuesday at the latest. If you ask on Wednesday or Thursday, no, I'm busy. Even if she has nothing to do. Because it's like the whole. Oh, yeah, you didn't know that? Yes, because you want to train them on, you know, how I want to be treated and, you know, I got stuff going on. It's. So if you're going to ask me out, you need to ask me by Tuesday to go out on Friday. And if you ask me on Wednesday or Thursday, I'm busy, even if I don't have anything going on. So back to William. I would be curious if we can just get it like William. It's not a problem. Truly. It's not a problem for him to come out there as long as he gets notifications. Floynsi asks, you know, several days in advance to go.
[99:14] D: Okay.
[99:38] A: Oh, boy.
[99:39] D: Okay.
[99:48] A: Okay, okay. Because we think he's gonna do something that you don't want him to do. Well, probably doing stuff that you don't want him to do.
[100:09] D: Right.
[100:09] A: And you have, like, cows. So there's going to be lots of, like, cow patties and lots of mushrooms that grow from cow patties.
[100:24] D: Right.
[100:26] A: Which. Those mushrooms are magical. I would imagine that that would be, you know, part of. Part of it and why he may not. Why he's more secretive, why he doesn't want you to know, because that might not be okay with you. That's where they originally got it from. From. Yeah, they're. They're. The psilocybin. That's where they grow from, is from cow dung. Yeah, they're. That's. So they are the psilocybin mushrooms. Those are what they call magic mushrooms. Those are the ones that they're using for research at John Hopkins to deal with PTSD and other stuff. They're using it as microdoses for people who have fear of end of life. That's where they. Yeah, that's why in India, they used to worship cows. Not because of the cow, but because of the poop and the magic mushroom that opened up worlds to them. Isn't that crazy? Right? Holy cow. Exactly.
[102:18] D: Yeah.
