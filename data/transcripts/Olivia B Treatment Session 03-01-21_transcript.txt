[00:00] A: Today is the wow. 1st of March. And Olivia, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable, life changing, transformative, it may be made available in teaching and training other professionals and how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:21] B: Yeah.
[00:22] A: Okay. So then second, what I'm remembering, at least from the last time that we were here, and you had like a whole list of different things that you were gonna go over with me, which is really co. Because you were organized and prepared. But one of the things that you had mentioned is that there's been a long term history, even from when you were really younger, of lots of yucky stuff that's happened along the way. And one of the things that we want to do is get the impact that that stuff has had cleared and gone. So it doesn't like, have any of the discomfort and stuff. What you also mentioned, though, is that there's a tendency for you to become more easily irritated or agitated or aggravated, maybe more defensive, maybe more kind of like, whoa, what is that? All that kind of stuff. So it creates a little bit more of an intense reactivity in you than you would be wanting. We want to kind of settle that down a little bit. You had also mentioned to me that, well, it's hard for you to be, you know, not doing something.
[01:25] B: Yes.
[01:26] A: That when you're left and there's nothing happening, that thing turns on and that's been problematic. So you like to keep yourself busy.
[01:38] B: Yes.
[01:38] A: Okay. So we want to actually extend some range to that so that if it makes sense, you're free to be still. Getting things done. Right, but be still. Yeah, getting things done. Because right now the whole thing has been amped.
[02:01] B: Yeah.
[02:02] A: Right. And then we want to do that. Let me see. Because I wrote down a couple different things that I have. All right, so with the reactivity stuff, sometimes you're more passive about it. So it's kind of like side. And sometimes you're right in. And again, you recognize that the intensity of that has been a little bit too much. And then you had mentioned that based on stuff that you'd gone through, sometimes there are triggers. So certain things, like, remind you of other stuff. And you had mentioned something around like weed or sex or that that kind of stuff also sometimes has discomfort there. Okay, so those are the things that at least I'm remembering and kind of wrote down from what we talked about the last time out of what I said is There anything that I missed?
[03:05] B: No, none that I know of. I really didn't bring my notebooks. I don't remember.
[03:10] A: Well, I don't think that it's in your notebook. I mean, we could have a really smart notebook, but I'm pretty sure you kind of know whether it's been written down in the notebook or not. I mean, it is your life that you've experienced. That's right.
[03:29] B: It's like. But sometimes, like, when I write stuff down, it's hard for me to remember because my brain is, like, fried but working on it.
[03:39] A: Well, sometimes it's hard to remember. Because you wrote it down.
[03:44] B: Yeah.
[03:44] A: And therefore my brain doesn't think I need to. Right. It's kind of like phone numbers.
[03:50] B: Yeah.
[03:50] A: When I was a kid, I remembered everybody's phone numbers. My grandmother's phone number, my best friend's phone. I could still tell you those numbers. Now, I don't know what my daughter's number is. She's 12. She's got a watch phone, but I don't know what her number is. I just press the thing that says Daisy. I don't know what her number is, though. Right. Because we stopped having to remember phone numbers. Yeah, Same thing with addresses or even how to get to places. I just put in the GPS and follow it. Even if I know a shorter cut, I still follow this. Right. Does it? We don't. Yeah, yeah, that kind of thing. Okay. Any other stuff that I didn't say or anything else that you think would be useful for me to know, to understand how things have been for you?
[04:49] B: No, not that I know of.
[04:52] A: Okay. Okay. So then I've got a good understanding of what it is that we're wanting our time to do for you today. One, we want to get the effect that the prior yucky stuff has had cleared and gone so that it doesn't have any attached to it. We want to get the over reactivity to lessen. We want to get things where they get taken personally to kind of be more slide by. We want you to have more freedom at times where this gets to be a little bit quieter instead of when you're not focused on something, it's active. And we want you to be more settled and more comfortable. Your own body. Yes, that would be useful.
[05:37] B: Yeah.
[05:37] A: Okay, cool. So that's where we're headed. So I'm gonna do a little bit of a refresher in terms of some of the setup that we had talked about the last time and understanding how the mind works. Why does it operate in the way it does, how we're able to make changes. And then we're gonna go through some processes that are designed to put your body more in states of rest. Because when we're in states of rest, it accelerates the healing process. And then we're going to do processes that clear out the impact that stuff has had and get it so that you're more. Okay now. Okay, makes sense. Cool. If at any time you want to take a break or need to use a restroom, let me know. We can do that. So we've got a good chunk of time to be able to get stuff better.
[06:26] B: Okay.
[06:27] A: Yeah. Cool. Cool. So what I had said the last time is we're going to look at things through a little bit of an unusual lens. That most of us relate to this stuff in life by looking through the lens that that happening made me feel this way when this person did that thing. I felt like this when that happened made me feel this way. Right. That the stuff causes the feelings. And that I said isn't a problem to look through that lens but gives us about that much power because we're either going to try to change it or. And if I can't, then I'm going to try to get away from it. But as you've already known, there's some stuff in life that I can't change, some stuff I can't fully get away from, some stuff I can't get to have not happened. So we got to do something else. Where I'm coming in is all about adjusting how the more automatic, preconscious, emotional part of your brain has been reacting and responding to stuff past, current, future, so that your brain is more present base, dealing with what is, having access to the resources to maneuver through things in a way that's best for you. Right. We want to, let's say, change faulty programming that got installed in terms of reactions because some of them worked really well at that time. But now that being the default always on doesn't serve you as well. Right. It's kind of like if I learned a really good coping skill when I was 7 to deal with a difficult situation that may have worked really well at 7, but because it worked, my brain went well. This is the way you do it. And now that I'm 37 and I'm still coping with that kind of similar stuff in the same way I was seven, probably might not work as well. You follow me with that? So we want to get those kinds of things adjusted. I gave you this silly example that when a lion approaches a zebra, we tend to say the lion makes the zebra scared. And I said, I don't disagree with that. But if we add another component, we could also say that it's really when the zebra sees, senses, smells, feels, thinks lions coming in, Sieber's brain, not lion, that's making zebra alert, motivated and strong. We call it scared, it runs away. Brain of zebra, though, is doing it in response to lion approaching. It's still zebra's brain that's doing it. Right. And the reason that we're going to look through that lens, Olivia, is that it gives us a hell of a lot more power because when we're looking through the lens that what causes the over reactivity, what causes the discomfort or triggers from prior stuff, is some error in the way that your brain has been working. We have the ability to adjust it. Right. We can't get bad shit that's happened in your life to have not happened to you. Okay. I don't have a time travel machine to kind of pull you out of certain situations. Right. So we can't get this stuff to have not happened. What we're going to do though, is unplugged the emotional effect that the stuff has continued to have on you, so it no longer has any of that discomfort. We want you to be more free from the effect that it's had.
[09:51] B: Yes.
[09:51] A: Yeah. Cool. So then, as we're looking through that lens that it's your brain that makes you feel bad. The first question is, do you really think that your brain wants you to feel bad?
[10:04] B: No.
[10:04] A: No, it doesn't want you to feel bad. Do you think it would want you to feel good? No, it doesn't want you to feel good either. Why?
[10:12] B: Because it's just doing its stuff.
[10:14] A: Oh, because it doesn't. Right. Have a purpose for feeling isn't because it wants you to feel good or bad, it's to get you to solve a problem, to get something to stop. Right. The error is that what it's trying to get us to solve are in time periods that are over. That's the error. I mean, that's really the major error in human beings functioning is that part of our brain is trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. And we can't solve it because it's in a time period that either A hasn't happened yet, that's anxiety, worry, or B is already over. And that's why it glitches. Right? It's because as we talked about, the part of our brain that Directs our emotions is like an animal's brain. And an animal doesn't have feelings because it's concerned about the animal's mood affect, how it feels about itself, whether it's having a good, bad or day. It doesn't care about those things. It doesn't cause it because of esteem issues or it feels like lovable and good enough. No, it causes it to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem that simple makes sense. The error is that our brain is making us feel bad, trying to motivate us to solve a problem that's in a time period that no longer exists. So timing is what we want to get updated for you, how we go about doing it, and we'll do more with that is. I mean, the simple, easy example or saying would be stay emotionally present when you remember something that happened that was awful. Because if you're present with me, because being with me is more fun than something awful. I hope, I hope. Right. Like, being with me is better than the worst moments. Right. So. So. So if we have you stay here with me as you remember it, the brain goes, oh, it's data. Oh, that's just information. Information doesn't have distress. It's kind of like the difference you're seeing in an animal's world, the picture of a lion and the animal having the reaction versus the actual mind. Well, if it's a picture, it's like a memory, so it's not actually the experience. Oh, so then I don't need to be troubled. I still have historical data about it. I still can know what happened, but it doesn't have any disruption inside of me. Right. I told you that. The second thing that happens with our brains is that meanings get attached that make me feel worse. That tends to be the thing that goes on. Something happens, Mind attaches a meaning. But because when we were little, we were trained to believe by culture and everything else that good happens when I'm being good, which was a lie. Good things can happen whether I'm being good or bad. Right. But if I learned when I was little that good happens when I'm good, well, then the opposite has to be true. Bad happens because I'm bad or because there's something wrong with me, or maybe because I'm not good enough or lovable enough or smart enough, or maybe I didn't wear the right clothes, maybe I didn't go to the right school. Any of those messages that get in start impacting me at my identity level, making me feel like there's something not okay in me. It's not uncommon for people to go, well, you know, I probably deserved it. What? Well, like, I should have known better. I shouldn't have put myself in that vulnerable situation. Oh, that's right. You should have known that grandpa, when you went out to see the goats in the barn, was going to go ahead and molest you. What? No. You had no idea that that was going to. But because it was bad. Well, you know, it's kind of my fault. I should have told somebody. Right, But Grandpa said if you did, he was gonna kill your mom. So like. Right, so. So like little kid is frozen. But later on in life I look back on, see, I should have. I shouldn't have put myself. I was being bad. I should have known better. That all gets stuck to that kind of stuff and then is what you've experienced sometimes is that I go through life and stuff happens that reminds me of it or that's similar to it, or maybe it's a look that somebody has or it's a time of year or a tone of voice or. Or. Or some of them I'm aware of. Some of them I'm not aware of. And I'm just kind of in a funky state. I don't even know why I'm in a funky state, but I am in a funky state. You know, that kind of stuff that happens, right? Is all because a program that's running in you and we want to get that stuff adjusted so that your brain is no longer on hypervigilance, that aspects of your brain realize that you've grown up, that a lot of your brain realizes that that stuff's over and you're out of it. Because that would be really useful for it to know and that I didn't need authority, parents, grandparents, foster, whatever, to be okay in order for me to turn out okay. Right. One of the lessons we learn when we're very little is we kind of are trained to believe that in order for me to be okay, I need my supports to be okay. Like, I need my mom, my dad. I need them to be well. But it's not actually true. We need our parents when we're babies or a caregiver when we're babies, because we need them to feed us and change us and bathe us and clothe us and get us places. Right? But as you get a little bit older, do you need them as much? Right? Like, my daughter doesn't need me to put her pants on anymore. She's old enough. She does it herself. Right. Little children at four, they're not like making a nice spaghetti meal, not even going to that. They don't understand how to do all that kind of stuff. But as they get older, maybe an 11 year old certainly could put some pasta on the stove, you know, that kind of thing. So as we get older, because we're growing, we become more resourceful on our own. Which means I didn't actually need them, but that was the message that got installed when I was little. So we want to get that thing situated as well. Does that make sense?
[16:46] B: Yeah.
[16:46] A: Any questions about those components? Your following?
[16:51] B: Yes.
[16:52] A: Cool. So then what we started talking about is in order to get anywhere, we first need to know where we want you to go. Right. If I'm driving to Orlando, I first need to know that I want to get to Orlando. Then I can start organizing, like how I'm gonna go there and which route I'm gonna take. Right. But I first need to know where we're going. So when you were in here the last time, and I bet even right now, you could think about one of those things that. Cause you could just think about it right now and feel just a little bit of the discomfort. Notice how it didn't even take a long time to do it. Right. But you did it on purpose because like, I was asking you to do it. And that wouldn't be a problem if it only happened when you chose it. The problem, Olivia, is that that's been happening to you at times. You haven't been deciding. That's the glitch. Right. So therefore the you that I'm seeing, this you, when we're done, she remembers having had that kind of stuff go on for her. But if you asked her to get those kinds of feelings, she would not get it. It's been completely cleared and gone. The you that I'm seeing is emotionally present. So she's dealing with what is happening without the effect of what has. She's got the wisdom from having made it through it. So she's more wise as she goes into her experiences, but she's doing so from a place of being more at ease and more comfortable in her own skin. The you that I am seeing has the ability, when it makes sense for her to be still not really having to do and feel comfortable as she is still having the energy to be doing when like, that makes more sense for her to do, but kind of has more range and how she handles things. Right. The you that I am seeing, the intensity of her reactions actually match the situation. So it doesn't mean that she doesn't have emotions. Not like she's numb, but she might have emotions. It could be a sadness, it could be an anger, it could be a frustration, it could be a joke. But they all match the situation. Right. And therefore they diffuse much quicker so it doesn't pop so high. Yeah, got it. This is the you that I'm seeing when we're done. My question for you isn't how it's going to happen that we get you here. My question is, would it be okay?
[19:22] B: Yes.
[19:22] A: Yeah. So we've got a green light, and do you remember the symbol we came up with?
[19:26] B: A finger monkey.
[19:28] A: Yeah, like a finger monkey. Right. So we've got powerful symbols symbolizing the future you. Now, we want to do some processes that are designed to get your mind to become more responsive to what the finger monkey symbolizing. Very, very simple and easy. You're going to simply look up, think finger monkey, and take a slow breath in. That's the first part. So go ahead, think finger monkey, and breathe in. There you go. That was pretty easy. Right? Good. Second part is going to be the exact same. Same thing. This time, though, after inhaling, you exhale. So look up, think finger monkey, breathe in and then exhale. Good. Third, exact same thing as that. This time, though, when you exhale, you close your eyes. So look up and out. Think finger monkey, breathing in. And then as you exhale, your eyes are closed. Good. And you can open your eyes. Same thing as that. This time, though, when you close your eyes, you're going to keep them closed for just a few moments as you bring your awareness into your breath. So you're gonna look up and out. Think finger monkey, breathing in. That's right. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. Now that your eyes are closed, bring your awareness into your breath. Notice that as you're aware of your breathing, you're influencing how you breathe. You're altering your state of consciousness because you're now consciously attending to your breath, which is a process that requires no conscious effort at all in order to happen. Take a deep breath in now. And then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. Those few short moments that your eyes were closed, what did you begin to notice within yourself? And we're calmer, feeling more calm. Right. Which is a really good news thing because we're on our way, utilizing brain levers to get your body in states of rest. So one more time, think about those finger monkeys breathing in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. Now, with your eyes closed, they Rest. Because as your eyes are closed, resting, you rest aware of your breath, hearing my voice, maybe background sounds, and how it feels to be seated on the couch. In the way you are able to notice all of it at the same time. Your unconscious is responding and organizing towards what the finger monkey is symbolizing without you having to do anything at all. It's happening from the inside out. Just like a cut heals from the in side out, your mind and body doing it as you rest. Which means the next time you rest with your eyes closed, it'll be even easier to drift down deeper and feel more of that calm and peaceful resting. And then when you're ready, you'll take another deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And again, those moments eyes were closed, what were you noticing within yourself? Isn't that a nice feeling to be having? Right? And see, your body can stay calm even though we'll be dealing with yucky stuff, because you're present in here with me. Next, I'd like you to think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something beautiful like you're looking at it. It's like, wow, what is it that you see?
[23:15] B: Flowers.
[23:16] A: Yeah. And isn't there a moment that as you're seeing those flowers, you are feeling both the sense of like, peace and excitement?
[23:24] B: Yeah.
[23:25] A: And some people would say to you, well, of course, seeing the flowers is giving you those feelings. But again, if we looked at it from a different lens, we could say that seeing the flowers simply drew your awareness to down and in towards your center. Because at your center, you always are peaceful and excited. In the same way, if I take my hands because they're cold, and I move them down towards the flame of the campfire, and then I go, holy cow, this campfire is getting hotter. Is it really that the campfire is getting hotter?
[24:01] B: No, you're just getting closer.
[24:02] A: I'm becoming more aware of the heat because my hands are getting closer to the flames. That's right. And so we know that for you in life, there have been multitudes of times where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Stressors, angers, hurts, guilt, shame, regrets, remorses, pains. But no matter where your awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited in the same way. You know, two of us are in here now. How do you know it? You look around, your senses bring in data, your intellect organizes. Is it. We call that knowledge. Sometimes people call knowledge light, so we'll call it light of knowledge. At your Center. It's an actual brighter light. Light of wisdom. And so now we've got light of knowledge. We've got light of wisdom. And I remember working with all sorts of different people. Lots of people have had really bad, yucky stuff. I mean, one worked with a long time ago. I mean, her older brother, when she was five, used to take Matchbox cars, drive them up her leg, and park them in her vagina. So we had, like, a whole bunch of ugh. And then all sorts of other abuse and yucky things. And so as we worked together, we cleared it all out. Like, all the pain, the hurt, the discomfort, the guilt, the disgust, the sad was like, go on. And she was sitting across from me, and she was fully present and feeling great. And I said to her, I go, you know, all of that discomfort, all that stuff, I go, where was it? And she looked at me and she goes, it's gone. I don't feel any of it. I go, I know. Isn't that cool? She's like, yeah. I go, but my question was, where was it? And as the two of us started thinking, I go, was it at the surface level? And she's like, no, it wasn't an intellectual thing. I said, oh, well, then maybe it was hiding in your center. And she's like, dude, how could that stuff survive in light where I'm peaceful and excited? So I asked her again. I go, well, then, where was it? She says, I get it. It was hiding in the shadows, in between the lights. I said, well, what happened? She goes, the lights, they're now touching. Shadows are gone. I said, isn't that cool? She said, yeah. And then we started talking about how people frequently identify themselves as their body. Like, it's me. But I started telling her. I go, you know, when my mom was young, like 17, she lost the tip of her finger in a snow cone machine accident. And when she goes to visit people now, they don't say to her, susie, I'm glad almost all of you could come over. They don't say that to her. Why? Well, because she's all there. Even if that part of her body was missing, she didn't disappear. So we could say then for you, that you have a body.
[26:48] B: Yes.
[26:50] A: That your body, Olivia, is totally yours. But what if your body isn't? You? Like, there's no cell within your body right now that's the same as it was when you were born. They've all been replaced millions of times. Your feet alone are longer than they were when you were two. Yet despite those kinds of changes. You're still you. Right? Neuroscience would even tell us that if you and I came back one year from today. 99.99999. Meaning almost all of the subatomic particles that are making us up right now wouldn't be here. They don't all leave it once. I would be like Star Trek crazy. But you have a body. Your body's yours, but it isn't actually you. You have thoughts. But did you know that you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? That your brain is, and that you have a brain? It's yours. It's not you. Your brain is like any other organ, like your heart or your lungs. Isn't that weird?
[27:51] B: Yes.
[27:52] A: So we know now that you're not your body, you're not your thoughts. Well, then maybe you're your feelings. Except you feel different ways at different times, so you can't be a feeling. Well, then maybe you are what you do. Except there's lots of things that you've done, and when you stop doing one thing to do something else. Did you stop existing? Hmm. Weird, right? So then you can't even be what you do. So now we're gonna have an even crazier question. You ready?
[28:26] B: Mm.
[28:26] A: Because if you're not what you do, or your feelings or your thoughts or your body, then what the heck are you? Weird question, isn't it? So let's just say, for our purposes today, that who you are is what you became aware of as you see those flowers. Let's just say that who you are is the light at the center. Religions might call it my soul or my spirit or my essence. But instead of us thinking of it as a thing you have, like my soul, like my fingers. Let's think of your fingers as the things you have. Let's think of the light at the center as you. You know what's really cool about light? It can't be touched or hurt or harmed. If there was a monster angry at, like, this ball of light, it could slash its claws through it, and it wouldn't touch the light. It could take a machete and slice through it, and it wouldn't touch harm the light. Even a machine gun, it's not touching the light. The light that is you. It can't be touched in that way. It can't be touched, it can't be hurt, it can't be harmed. It's absolutely whole and complete, Meaning there's nothing missing. And I say that because we walk through life feeling like there's shit that's missing in here. But what if there's nothing missing? Like when a baby is born, they're whole and complete. They're perfect in and of themselves. There's nothing missing. They're useless. You gotta feed them, change them, right, like you gotta do. But there nothing missing. Why do we feel in life like there's things not quite okay or things missing? It's because when we go through experience, it kind of blocks access to us experiencing more of who you are. That light and see people come into my office, you'll never guess. They screw up identity words all the time. They tell me things like they're anxious, they're depressed, they're shy. They tell me that the way they feel is who they are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm upset, and you go, well, why are you so upset, though? You'll never believe what he did. Well, what did he do? Well, first he put me on one of those chairs that get really uncomfortable because my head goes down and my feet come up. You're like, yeah, you're at the dentist. Then he takes this light, he kind of positions it, shines it in my eyes. I'm blinded. I can't see. Yeah, you're at the dentist. And then he takes this cold metal instrument, shoves it right up inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness. And you're what? And I say in my mouth, olivia, I'm at the dentist. But it's the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother in the Matchbox car. I said, when you were little, your brother, he really messed with your stuff. And she looked at me with that glowing smile again, and she said, he did. And for a long time, it screwed up my thinking, hurt my feelings, caused me to do all sorts of. And then she looked again and she goes, but you know what? He might have messed with my stuff, screwed up my thinking and feelings, but he never touched me. Because who I am can't be touched in that way. And I went, whoa, that is pretty powerful. And so one more time, think about those finger monkeys. Take a slow breath in, exhale and close your eyes. Good. With eyes closed, they rest. As they rest, you also rest aware of your breath, my voice, background sounds, how it feels to be sitting in the way. You are able to notice all of that. At the same time, your unconscious is responding towards what's been symbolized by that finger monkey already making changes at a deeper level. And just like with change, it most of the time happens before you're aware of it at a deeper level first. Kind of like if we were to plant seedlings into the soil, cover them up, water the top layer of soil, you and I know that a lot is going on underneath the surface of the ground. Before we ever see anything of those seedlings sprout above the surface, even more is happening below. Your unconscious is doing this for you now as you rest, which means again, the next time that you rest with your eyes closed, it'll be even easier to sink in and experience even more of the calm and peaceful flowing energy. And then when you're ready, you'll take another slow and deep breath in. That's right. And then exhale and open your eyes. And how's your body feeling now? It feels good, doesn't it?
[33:50] B: Yeah.
[33:50] A: Yeah. Which is a nice feeling to be having because things are already healing, changing at a deeper level. See, the unconscious parts of your mind totally want to work in ways that are best for you. In addition, that part of your brain has direct access to the control panels, so it knows exactly what buttons to press and knobs to turn and levers to shift and switches to flip to reorganize, re. Restructure, Rewire your brain so that it becomes more optimized to work in ways that are best for you. And one last little thing. How we're gonna go about changing things doesn't mean that we have to do it in a chronological order. Right. So some people think, oh, it's got to be chronological. I've got to go back to when I was an infant, and then when I was four, and then when I was nine, and then when I was. It doesn't mean that when we're rewiring our brain, we have to understand that our brain is what we call rhizomatic. So rhizomatic is an interesting phenomenon and the opposite of how we normally think about things. Our western culture has put us in a tree root analysis, that things grow from the root up into the trunk and then into the branches and then into the. Or the limbs, the branches and leaves. But they're all connected to the one source, the root. A brain is rhizomatic. So a brain is like the other kinds of plants, different than trees. So they'd be things like mushrooms, dandelions in Florida, the crabgrasses, ginger. What rhizomes are is that there's not a single start or a single end. You can start anywhere and go in any direction. Right. What a rhizome means is everything is interconnected, but not just one plug to one plug with multiplicity. So there's multiple layers and links within our brain that interesting. Yeah, that our brain has the ability of what we call neuroplasticity, which is the ability to ongoingly rewire itself. So what's really cool is that that unconscious part of your brain has direct access to the control panel and knows how to make those adjustments so that it naturally and automatically works more and more the way that you would be wanting it to. So the last little piece. One more time, think about those finger monkeys. Take a slow and deep breath in and then exhale and close your eyes. With eyes closed, you can slightly drop your jaw so that it's slightly lower. You can rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, continuing to breathe in this way way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. So that as you're aware of your breath, my voice in the background sounds all joined together to guide and transport you deeper down and inside towards delight at your center. That calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy. That's right. Your unconscious now is responding towards what those finger monkeys symbolize. Notice that even with your eyes closed, you can begin to sense the space that's all around you. The space that's in between you and me, the space to either side towards the windows or side doors, the space that's underneath the couch, the space that's behind you towards the wall and even the space above you towards the ceiling. And how as you're noticing and becoming more aware of the space, you realize there's more space than there is objects or things in this room. Always more space. That's right. To begin to settle down on the inside and lighten up, becoming more and more okay with you free to be more of who you are. Becoming more. That's right. And then when you're ready once again, taking your time to slowly find your way back up and up and up. And then when you're ready, a big deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Isn't that a nice feeling? Yeah. And see, now we've got brain waves in more alpha waves. Because notice how you can see me. But as you stay looking at me, you. You can expand your awareness and include my fingers out here wiggling. Right. You notice more of the space. When you notice more of the space, it starts to move us into alpha waves, which are more flow states. Being in the zone, they open up the pipeline to deeper level brain processes that happen at theta and delta waves. Delta is normally during deep sleep and when a lot of the internal, both physical restoration and emotional restoration takes place. And see, as we're organizing towards the. You becoming more free and more. Okay, more and more at peace, no longer troubled by what did. The unconscious part of your mind, Olivia, at the same time has been scanning through experiences that have happened, beginning to group and categorize experiences, and then it's going to begin to narrow, pinpoint, and bring to your awareness a negative experience, something that happened that's over for us to unplug and clear out the effect that it's had, whether it be one that happened recently or whether it be one that happened long time ago when I was really little. Your unconscious knows more than you or I on how to heal itself. So it knows which experiences to bring to your awareness. Whether you're consciously remembering or aware of it or not. It knows which order to do it. And so as we're organizing towards what's been symbolized by those finger monkeys, the unconscious part of your mind can scan back through that timeline of experiences in your own personal history, growing you earlier and younger, back younger and earlier, and will bring a particular experience to you. Awareness for us to clear what experience is coming to mind. Now.
[42:30] B: I have a lot of experience.
[42:31] A: In the life I know. So we only want to do one. And of course, it doesn't have to start off with the worst, baddest, awfulest.
[42:50] B: Okay.
[42:51] A: I mean, it can. You got one.
[43:00] B: My dad.
[43:02] A: And a specific thing with your dad that happened when you might have been how old?
[43:08] B: Four.
[43:09] A: Four. Good. When you think about the moment at four that time, the feelings that come up now are feelings of what is it? Anger, hurt, sadness, grief, scared, pain.
[43:27] B: It's not like a feeling. It's like, why? More of like a question, like, why?
[43:33] A: Mm.
[43:36] B: Like, I already. Like, I feel like I forgive him, but it's like.
[43:42] A: Well, it doesn't make it not bad. I mean, you can forgive him, but that doesn't mean that it's not still having an impact on you. Yeah, right.
[43:56] B: Still is.
[43:57] A: Yeah. So first, would it be okay to clear out the impact that it's continued to have on you? Okay, good. So how we clear something really, really simple. One, you're going to intend to emotionally be with me here now. Hi. Because this is what's happening and that isn't. Got it. Two, we're working on the mutual and worthwhile goal, this future you. And three, as I said earlier, I'm more fun than sucking moment, so I want you with me. Second, when you tell it to me, it's going to be as factual as possible and just the facts. So to go just what happened that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, then it was done. If it happened when you were 4, there are many, many things that you've done after that that were more fun than that. What's one thing, anytime from when that happened until yesterday, that was more fun than that. Right. So what's one thing, any time that you've done from then until now that was more fun than that moment?
[45:01] B: Swimming yesterday.
[45:02] A: Swimming yesterday was more fun than that. Good. Something else.
[45:08] B: Dying. Like color dyeing?
[45:10] A: No. Color dyeing. Right. Yeah. Good. And one other thing.
[45:15] B: Drawing.
[45:15] A: Yeah, drawing. All those things have happened after that moment. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond that moment. So we have actually really good news to get in. So that thing happened when it happened. You were like four when it happened. You might have been where?
[45:31] B: In a bad situation.
[45:33] A: Where might you have been? Like, would you have been in a car, in a house, in an apartment? Outside? You were in a house. Good. Right. And was it daytime or nighttime?
[45:42] B: Daytime.
[45:43] A: Daytime. And you're wearing the house, like kitchen, living room, dining room, bedroom. You're in the basement. Right. Good. So you had gone down in the basement? Right. Good. And he had gone down with you? Yes. Right. Before or after you?
[45:54] B: It was before.
[45:55] A: Right. So he had gone down and then you had gone down. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[45:59] B: Everyone went down.
[46:01] A: So there are more than you. So who's everyone?
[46:04] B: My other family.
[46:05] A: So other family members went down to the basement. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[46:10] B: I got tied up.
[46:11] A: So he tied you or another family member?
[46:13] B: My dad.
[46:14] A: So your dad tied you to.
[46:16] B: To the table?
[46:17] A: To a table? Like a chair or like actually at the table.
[46:20] B: A table.
[46:21] A: A table. Right. Good. And then what happened next? And be here. Hi. Notice how you're going there a little bit. I want you to be here. Hi. You're doing good, right? Yeah. So he tied you to the table. Right. And then what happened then?
[46:33] B: Drugs can induce.
[46:35] A: So then he. Drugs got into you?
[46:37] B: No, like, drugs were in the room.
[46:39] A: Oh, so then they had done some drugs?
[46:41] B: Yeah.
[46:41] A: Right. Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[46:43] B: Music.
[46:44] A: Right. Good. And then what happened?
[46:46] B: And then he brought out some toys.
[46:48] A: Right. So then he brought up some toys, but not like. Like cars and Barbie towels.
[46:52] B: No.
[46:53] A: They would have been toys that had sexual toys.
[46:56] B: Yes.
[46:56] A: Okay, good. So he brought out some of those things. Maybe dildo, vibrator, other stuff like that. Right. Good. Then what happened? And be here. Hi. Notice how you're there. Hi. Hi. Here. Hi. Good job. Right. So he brought the toys out. That was weird. Right. Then what happened?
[47:11] B: And then everyone had fun with me.
[47:14] A: So then they might have, like, used the toys on your body in different parts. Might have been put it in your butt or your vagina. Might have been put in your mouth. Might have been put. Right, good. And then what happened next? That was weird.
[47:24] B: And then it's just. Everything just went that way.
[47:28] A: And then they might have put, like, their body parts in different parts of, you know, Just toys. Yeah. Right. Good job. So they put toys all over your body. Right. And then what happened next?
[47:39] B: Do whatever they wanted to do until they were done.
[47:43] A: Well, then. So they kept doing the toy stuff and other things, and then they eventually stopped.
[47:49] B: Yes.
[47:49] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[47:51] B: Then I had to clean up.
[47:52] A: Well, then you are untied.
[47:53] B: Yeah.
[47:54] A: Right. Good. That was better. Right, and then you had to clean up the toys.
[47:58] B: Yes.
[47:58] A: Right. Like wash them.
[47:59] B: Yeah.
[48:01] A: Good job. Right. And then what happened next? So you went upstairs.
[48:03] B: Yes.
[48:04] A: Right. Good number happened.
[48:05] B: Took a shower.
[48:06] A: Right. And then that was over.
[48:07] B: Yes.
[48:08] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun. Like draw.
[48:12] B: Yes.
[48:12] A: Or like, dye stuff with colors.
[48:14] B: Right.
[48:14] A: Or go swimming.
[48:15] B: Yeah.
[48:16] A: Right. Now notice as you're recalling that there was that discomfort, not because that was a yucky moment, even though it was, but because your brain was confusing the yucky moment, thinking it was happening. It was causing the discomfort, trying to motivate you to get it to stop. Good news. It has stopped. Right. So we never go backwards with a memory, but when you do, it literally unplugs the memory. It flattens out the neurons. It takes away the charge. So we're gonna run it backwards. So we got swimming. We've got dyeing, you know, things with color. And then we've got drawing. Right. And then before that, you've gotten out of the shower, and then you went and took a shower, and then you had, like, to clean the toys, and then you went upstairs, and then they had untied you, and then they stopped. And then they were touching your body in different ways with those toys. And then the toys came out. Right. And then he had tied you up, and then they had come down, and you had come down, then he had gone down. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing right now as I ran through it backwards, compared to forward, emotionally, how was it? Isn't that weird?
[49:25] B: Yeah.
[49:25] A: Notice how it didn't have the same Thing, Right? Because what's starting to happen is your brain is getting that it's information, data about something that happened versus happening. Make sense. Second, again, the emotional part of our brain doesn't get logic. It gets patterns of association. And the associated pattern is the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening have been glued together. So they're living as if they're the same thing. But there are things that you know you're not doing that you can remember having done earlier today. Like put your shirt on. You can remember doing it. You can remember which room you were in when you did it. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your shirt on, and then I said, olivia, stop putting on your shirt, you look at me and go, but I'm not putting on my shirt. Because, you know, there's a big difference between remembering doing it and doing it. Got it. So we want to get that news in. So we're going to play a pattern of association game. So you can remember dad tying you up and the toys coming out and the different people touching your body in different ways with the toys. Maybe some of it even felt good. Some of it would have been really weird. Right? You can remember all that happening. You can remember putting your shirt on today. Olivia, stop putting on your shirt. Say, I'm not putting on my shirt. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then you stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants. Well, then stop me from putting on my pants. Say, you're not putting on your pants. Well, then stop dad from tying you up. Say, dad's not tying me up. Well, then stop me from putting on my watch. Say, you're not putting on your watch.
[51:22] B: You're not putting on your watch.
[51:24] A: Well, stop dad from getting the toys out and having the people use the toys. Say they're not doing that.
[51:28] B: They're not doing that.
[51:29] A: Well, then stop it from happening. Say it's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[51:35] B: It no longer exists.
[51:36] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. Right. And as you're realizing it now, what do you notice happening to those feelings?
[51:46] B: I don't really know if, like, eh.
[51:49] A: It's like, eh.
[51:50] B: Yeah.
[51:50] A: Isn't that weird?
[51:51] B: Yeah.
[51:52] A: Notice how that's different than it was? Hmm. What are you noticing?
[52:02] B: More aware, like, how I feel more. I guess it's like, not really a big deal for me right now.
[52:10] A: Oh, it's not, is it? No, no. That's kind of unusual.
[52:14] B: Yeah.
[52:15] A: Yeah. Now the last little piece that you back then again because you were young, would have been thinking that happening had something to do with me.
[52:25] B: Yes.
[52:26] A: And maybe something I did wrong or bad or did that happening though have anything to do with you?
[52:33] B: No.
[52:34] A: Or did it have a lot more to do with whatever was going on in dad? Make sense? See, even if I said to you this kid comes home and he's got two Ds and two Fs on his report card. So his mom is pissed. And mom says, you wait until dad comes home. Dad comes home, dad sees the grades, goes into the kid's room, pulls his belt off, pulls the kids pants down and starts whacking him in the belt. Now the kid is totally feeling like I'm getting hit because I got bad grades. But is he?
[53:05] B: No.
[53:05] A: No. Because you even know that there are more than one way to handle the bad grades. Right? That the hitting had to do with whatever was going on in dad.
[53:17] B: Yeah.
[53:18] A: Not with the kid. So that happening to you back then had nothing to do with. You had everything to do with whatever was off with dad and those other family members. But back then you didn't fully know that. So I want you to repeat these four words. Ready? Here we go. It's. It's not. Not about. About me.
[53:40] B: Me.
[53:40] A: Right? It's not. Say that it's not about me. Right. It's not about me. Right. Now close your eyes. Picture that earlier you back then. Let her know that that moment it's over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists. Let her know that that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with them. It's not about me. So that she gets it then let that you know that it's over. Let her know about drawing and color dye. Let her know about going swimming so that she gets it. And as that earlier your is getting it. What do you notice happening to her face?
[54:22] B: She's smiling.
[54:23] A: She is, isn't she? She's not troubled. You can open your eyes. Isn't that kind of interesting? What's starting to happen?
[54:32] B: You feel more like forgiving of myself.
[54:37] A: Yeah. Because the wrong person. Well, you had been thinking that it had something to do with you. And it doesn't, does it?
[54:46] B: No.
[54:46] A: No. Isn't that a good news thing?
[54:48] B: Yeah.
[54:49] A: Yeah. And we want to do even more so again, think about the finger monkey. Take a deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. With eyes closed they rest. So that as your eyes rest, you also Rest, drifting deeper and deeper and down inside towards the calm and peaceful, easy flowing energy. That's right. Your unconscious is responding towards the future you beginning to rewire. Designed to cause even more healing, more comfortable and ease. Because your unconscious knows so much more than you or I on how to heal from the inside out. It's what's been beating your heart and breathing, sending that oxygenated blood through. Your system knows how to heal. All happening as you rest. Which means it'll be even easier the next time to drift down even deeper and experience more calm and easy flowing energy. And then when you're ready once again, taking your time, find your way back up. And then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. How's your body feeling now?
[56:48] B: More relaxed.
[56:49] A: It is. Right. And as your body's more relaxed, the unconscious part again can scan back through experiences that have happened and another moment will be brought to your awareness to clear what one's coming to mind. Now.
[57:18] B: My ex on Valentine's Day.
[57:22] A: Uh huh. This happened about how long ago now?
[57:27] B: 2018 I believe.
[57:29] A: So 2018, Valentine's Day. You're where?
[57:32] B: Yes, I think it was 2019.
[57:35] A: All right, 2019. So you're where?
[57:37] B: Yes.
[57:38] A: Where were you?
[57:40] B: We were at his house.
[57:44] A: So you're at his house. Good. And it's daytime or nighttime?
[57:47] B: Daytime.
[57:48] A: Right. And you're wearing the house in his room. Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[57:55] B: We were getting ready to go out.
[57:58] A: Right. Good job, good detail. So you're getting dressed, putting on makeup maybe?
[58:02] B: Yeah.
[58:03] A: Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[58:07] B: We leave.
[58:08] A: Yes.
[58:09] B: And we go to the liquor store.
[58:13] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right.
[58:15] B: And then we go. Go to the Chinese food store.
[58:18] A: Yes. Good job, good detail. Right. And then what happened?
[58:20] B: And then we're going to his friend's house.
[58:22] A: Yes. And so you get to his friend's house.
[58:27] B: Yes.
[58:27] A: Right. And then what happened?
[58:29] B: Then we start drinking and smoking.
[58:33] A: Good job with detail. Right.
[58:35] B: And then we start playing a game.
[58:37] A: Yes. Like a board game?
[58:40] B: No.
[58:45] A: Right, right, right. So you're playing a game. Right. Then what happened? And be here. So they're asking questions or they're doing.
[58:58] B: Yeah. And then like clothes being taken off.
[59:03] A: Right, Good.
[59:04] B: And then I was supposed to have a foursome.
[59:07] A: Uh huh. So you took your clothes off? They took their clothes off.
[59:11] B: Yes.
[59:11] A: Right. Good job, good detail. And it's you and your boyfriend and his friend and his girlfriend. Great job, good detail. Right, yeah.
[59:21] B: And.
[59:22] A: And then what happened?
[59:25] B: I get angry drunk, so I tried to fight him.
[59:29] A: So then as you Guys were trying to do sexual stuff with the other couple.
[59:35] B: Yeah. For his friend.
[59:38] A: Right. So you and his friend got in a scuffle.
[59:41] B: Yes.
[59:43] A: And then what happened?
[59:46] B: My boyfriend at the time, he pulled him off of me.
[59:51] A: Yes.
[59:53] B: And tried to throw him over the railing.
[59:57] A: Good job, Good detail. Right, and then what happened?
[60:00] B: I was throwing up.
[60:01] A: Yes. Right. And then what happened next?
[60:06] B: For some reason I was in a tub. Like just sitting in a tub.
[60:11] A: And then you were sitting in a tub. Right. Good. And then what happened? With water?
[60:15] B: No, it was just like with puke.
[60:17] A: Lovely.
[60:18] B: Right, and then I somehow had clothes on. And then I woke up.
[60:27] A: Right. In the tub.
[60:29] B: Yes.
[60:29] A: With puke.
[60:30] B: Yes.
[60:31] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[60:35] B: The next day my boyfriend wasn't there.
[60:38] A: Uh huh.
[60:40] B: The find out that he was arrested.
[60:42] A: Yes.
[60:44] B: And his friend was yelling at me.
[60:48] A: Yes.
[60:49] B: And they kicked me out.
[60:51] A: Right.
[60:51] B: Okay. So I left.
[60:53] A: Right.
[60:54] B: And then I called my chosen mom to come pick me up.
[61:00] A: And she did.
[61:01] B: Yes.
[61:01] A: And then that moment ended.
[61:02] B: Yeah.
[61:03] A: And then later on you did something more fun, like draw.
[61:07] B: Yes.
[61:08] A: Or do the color dye. Or go to the beach. Go swimming. Right. So we got bean swimming. We've got the color dye, We've got drawing. Right. And then you'd been picked up and then you called her, and then they kicked you out. And then they were yelling at you. And then you woke up with puking clothes on. And then you knew that you had been in the tub. And then, well, you had found out that he had been arrested and he wasn't there. Right. And then somehow you got to the tub, and then he got in a fight with his buddy, and then his buddy was on top of you, and then you were in a tussle with the buddy. And then you guys had taken off your clothes and then you had started playing that game, and then you had been eating and drinking, and then you got over there. And then before that you'd stop at the Chinese place, and then you'd stop at the liquor store. And before that you were getting ready. Right. And as we go through it backwards compared to forward again, emotionally, how was was good?
[62:06] B: It's kind of weird.
[62:08] A: Isn't that weird how that like changes it?
[62:10] B: Yeah.
[62:10] A: Because you can remember that happening, right? You can remember putting your shirt on.
[62:14] B: Yeah.
[62:15] A: Olivia, stop putting on your shirt. Say I'm not putting on my shirt.
[62:17] B: I'm not putting on.
[62:18] A: Well then stop that from happening. Say it's not happening.
[62:20] B: It's not happening.
[62:21] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[62:23] B: It no longer exists.
[62:24] A: No. Again, which is what we want to get in. Right. And as you're getting it now, what do you notice?
[62:31] B: More peace.
[62:32] A: You are. Right. And then you can close your eyes again and let that earlier you know that it's over, finished, that it no longer exists. Let that earlier you know that you're okay. That's right. So that she gets it. You're okay. And as that's happening now again, how's your body feeling?
[62:54] B: More relaxed?
[62:55] A: It is, isn't it?
[62:57] B: Yeah.
[62:57] A: Right. So things are are on their way to begin to lighten up and change. Right, Right. And then you can open your eyes. Ah. What's happening now? Like you right now, what do you notice? What's happening now?
[63:25] B: I'm okay. Feeling okay?
[63:29] A: Uh huh. There another moment that just came to mind. Uh huh.
[63:35] B: There's all these moments.
[63:36] A: Oh, good. Would you know that we don't have to clear all of them, even though there's all of them that we want to clear some of them. And then your brain will generalize to begin to clear the other ones. And they work best when they're in the same category. So let's say I worked with somebody and their uncle molested them from like 11 to 14 and it happened 92 times. Do I have to go through every single time it happened? No, no. It would make sense for me to go through several and then the brain will clear out the rest. And that's because it's a structurally similar experience that may not translate to the date rate she had later when she was 27. So that may be a different category that we want to get that one cleared. But what your brain will start doing is it's going to begin to bring moments to mind for us to clear so that it can start to also generalize. Make sense. Yes. Yeah. So this time, as you think about the finger monkey, go ahead and slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower. That's right. And a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. Notice that you can look across and see me. But as you're seeing me, you can see my fingers out here extended wiggly. You can notice more of the space towards the side windows, towards the side doors. You can notice the space between you and me and the space that's beyond me, the space that's underneath the couch, the space that's up above your head and even the space that's behind you. And how you're now aware of more of the space and as you're aware of space, Olivia, isn't it interesting to realize that the space actually moves well beyond the room? That the space actually moves out in all directions and in all ways, and that it's unending? That's right. That there's always more space than there is anything else. And we're opening up the space for you to become more and more okay in you. Thinking about the finger monkey, take a slow and deep breath in, exhale and close your eyes so that as they're closed, they rest. And as your eyes are resting closed, you also rest, aware of your breath sounds, my voice, background sounds, all at the same time. Your unconscious is responding towards the future, you becoming more and more okay in you, beginning to lighten up so that there's more peace and ease and quiet inside, beginning to become more free to transform and become even more of who you are. All of this is ongoingly happening as you rest. And then when you're ready, taking your time, finding your way back, up and up and up. That's right. One more big deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. That's right. What are you noticing now?
[67:43] B: I feel more lighter.
[67:45] A: You do feel more lighter. Isn't that awesome?
[67:49] B: Yeah.
[67:49] A: Yeah. And so again, your unconscious is going to travel back through that timeline in your own history of things that have happened, growing you earlier and younger and younger and earlier. It'll take you down to another moment that would be useful for us to clear what's coming to mind.
[68:10] B: Now, my adoptive mom.
[68:13] A: Uh huh. And that particular experience happened when you might have been how old?
[68:21] B: Like 11.
[68:23] A: Like 11. Right. And again, the feeling that comes up is a feeling of what?
[68:29] B: Hurt.
[68:31] A: Hurt, yeah. So would it be okay to get the hurt gone?
[68:35] B: Yes.
[68:36] A: If the hurt is gone, does it mean what she did was okay? You actually get to be okay even if that wasn't.
[68:44] B: Yeah.
[68:44] A: Isn't that a good news thing?
[68:46] B: Yeah.
[68:46] A: So that thing happened. You're 11 when it happened. You're where?
[68:49] B: Yes, I'm in the apartment.
[68:52] A: So you're in the apartment, Right. Like in the living room or kitchen or bedroom. You're in the kitchen, right. By the stove or by the table? By the table. Right. So you're standing by the table in the kitchen. Right. Then what happens?
[69:08] B: I was on a table because like my adoptive mom when she adopted us, like she had to check us out to make sure, like what was going on.
[69:21] A: All right, so you're standing on the table.
[69:23] B: Yes.
[69:23] A: Right. And you've got a something's going on. Like a pair of pants on, a.
[69:29] B: Dress, a skirt, have nothing on.
[69:32] A: You're naked.
[69:33] B: Yes.
[69:34] A: Standing on a table naked.
[69:35] B: Yes.
[69:36] A: Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[69:38] B: She's checking something out.
[69:41] A: So it's like she's looking between your.
[69:43] B: Yeah.
[69:43] A: Legs. Huh. And that was weird.
[69:46] B: Yes.
[69:47] A: Right. Kind of checking in. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[69:52] B: She calls out my sister.
[69:54] A: Yes. Good. Chocolate detail.
[69:57] B: And she checks my sister.
[69:59] A: Right, Good. So she's on the table. She's looking, checking inside. Right, Good. Then what happened next? She calls our case worker, like, on the phone.
[70:08] B: Yeah.
[70:09] A: Right. And says.
[70:10] B: And says, there's something wrong with Olivia.
[70:14] A: Right. Good job. Right. So she goes, there's something wrong with Olivia. Right. And then what happened?
[70:20] B: They. We go to the hospital.
[70:22] A: So then you get your clothes on.
[70:23] B: Yeah.
[70:24] A: Right. The caseworker comes over.
[70:26] B: Yeah.
[70:26] A: And takes you to the hospital.
[70:28] B: Yes.
[70:28] A: Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[70:30] B: And the doctors are looking at it. Well, looking at me.
[70:34] A: Right. So they're examining. They have your pants down. They're looking between your legs. Well, that's weird. Right, Good. And then what happened.
[70:44] B: Then, like, there's stuff sticking. They were sticking stuff inside of me.
[70:49] A: Right, good. So they were, like, checking by using, like, instruments to. To, like. Good. That was weird.
[70:55] B: Yeah.
[70:55] A: Right. Some of it might have hurt.
[70:57] B: Yeah.
[70:58] A: Yeah. Right, good. Then what happened next?
[71:01] B: Comes back down. I was like. It was nothing bad. Just how I was, like, born.
[71:08] A: Good job. Right. So then they looked and they said. No, well, that there's nothing actually abnormal wrong there.
[71:14] B: Yeah.
[71:15] A: Right.
[71:16] B: It's just going to. They just said, it's going to be difficult for me.
[71:19] A: How so? Because, like, difficult for you for intercourse, difficult for you for orgasm, difficult for you for peeing, difficult for you for.
[71:30] B: No, it's just gonna be difficult for me to, like, breastfeed.
[71:34] A: Difficult for you to breastfeed?
[71:36] B: Yeah.
[71:36] A: Huh.
[71:41] B: Yeah.
[71:42] A: Based on how things were designed.
[71:44] B: Yeah.
[71:45] A: Got it. Which at 11, you know, that's not that much of a concern.
[71:53] B: No.
[71:53] A: Whether you'll be able to breastfeed or not.
[71:55] B: Yeah. No.
[71:55] A: Right. So. So they said all that, and they looked. Right. Good. And then that was over. And then you left the hospital.
[72:06] B: Yeah.
[72:07] A: Right. And then you're back at that apartment.
[72:10] B: Mm.
[72:11] A: And then later on, you did something more fun, like draw or, you know, dye stuff with color.
[72:16] B: Yeah.
[72:17] A: Right. Or, you know, go swimming. Right. So we got swimming, we got dyeing stuff with color. We've got drawing. Right. And then before that, you're back from the hospital, and then they determined. Yeah. I Know that's, you know, normal, but it may be difficult for breastfeeding later. Right. And then they had checked out your body and inserted stuff in different places to see. Right. And then you'd gone to the hospital. Right. Then the case manager person came over, and then she had called. Right. And then she had checked your sister out, and then she had checked you out. And then you'd gotten up on the table, then you'd taken your clothes off. And then before that, she's like, well, I need to check you all out.
[72:57] B: Yes.
[72:57] A: Right. And then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing.
[73:01] B: Yeah.
[73:01] A: And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it you can remember that happening? You can remember putting your boots on?
[73:10] B: Yeah.
[73:11] A: Well, stop putting on your boots. Stop me from putting on my sneakers.
[73:14] B: Yeah.
[73:15] A: Well, then stop tying that in your hair.
[73:18] B: I'm not tying it.
[73:19] A: Well, then stop them from examining. You will stop her from doing that. And so then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[73:26] B: It no longer exists.
[73:28] A: Right. And that you back then again thought that that happening meant that there was something wrong with you.
[73:34] B: Yes.
[73:35] A: Right. As we're looking at it from here, was there anything wrong with you? Now we're getting confused. I don't know, Dr. Q. Was there anything wrong with me?
[73:49] B: I don't know.
[73:51] A: Well, was there anything wrong with you, or were there things that they saw that was different with your body?
[73:58] B: That's different with my body.
[74:00] A: Right. But, you know, when you're 11, you don't distinguish you from your body, just like I don't distinguish me from my hand. But aren't I different? Isn't my hand a part of my body?
[74:13] B: Yes.
[74:14] A: Is my hand me? No, no, It's a thing. I have a hand. Right. So back then, that you was thinking because they saw whatever wasn't working optimally with your body based on what you were born with or without. Right. They thought that there was. That you would have thought that there was something wrong with you.
[74:37] B: Yes.
[74:38] A: Right. As we're looking at it clearly, was there anything wrong with you? Was there something that was off with how your body was functioning? Yes, that's right. And so close your eyes again. Picture that earlier, you letting her know that that's over, finished, that it no longer exists, that it had everything to do with whatever was going on with your body, and that you are so much more than just her body. So that the younger you get that it's not about me, that she would have been doing that whether it was me or anybody else. That's right. That it wouldn't have mattered whether it was me or someone else in the situation with that same thing. That's what they would have done. So that the younger you get. It's not about me. Right. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about dyeing stuff with color. Let her know about going swimming. Right. And as it's getting in, what do you notice now?
[75:45] B: I'm feeling much better. Much Situation.
[75:50] A: Yeah. Great. And you can open your eyes. Isn't that a good news thing?
[75:58] B: Yes.
[76:00] A: Notice how things are beginning to shift. Right. And we know that you have a body. That your body is yours, but it isn't actually you. Which is a weird thing to think. Right. Because I've been in it. But you know what we've learned with lots of people is when the body stops working, it's not that you stop. It's that your body stops. You're no longer in need of it, so you exit it. We don't pick the person up in the same way we did when they were in their body. But it doesn't mean that they're not here in the same way. Radio waves are going through the air. Even though you and I don't feel them. We know that they're there because we can turn the radio on and tune it to a station and hear music. So clearly they're around. But I don't feel it. Do you? No. It's just outside of our range. Our five senses are limited in what they can pick up and perceive. Does that make sense?
[77:05] B: Yeah.
[77:05] A: Yeah. Right. And what are you noticing now in you?
[77:09] B: More peace with myself.
[77:11] A: Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing?
[77:14] B: Yeah.
[77:15] A: Yeah. So again, go ahead and slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit bit deeper. That's right. Than how you automatically breathe. Look up and out. Think finger monkey. Take a big breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Notice that with them closed you can sense even more of the space that's in between and all around you. And you may or may not realize that you are made up mostly of space. That the part of your body that's solid you have to go out five decimal points. It's.00001% of your body is solid. The rest is space. The reason you feel so solid is that it's like a ceiling fan. When it's on high, it feels like a solid disc. That there's no space between the Bolts. But you and I both know that when the fan is off, we get to see in between, the space between. That's right, the fan. All of that is happening within you, becoming more and more okay in you without you having to do much of anything at all. Your unconscious is responding, organizing, and healing more and more as you rest. And then, when you're ready once again taking your time, find your way back up with a really big breath in. That's right. And then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Right. What are you noticing for yourself right now?
[79:35] B: I'm feeling good.
[79:36] A: You are, aren't you? What do you notice up here happening?
[79:40] B: We're like space.
[79:42] A: Isn't that cool?
[79:43] B: Yeah.
[79:44] A: Right, right. Notice how it's quieter up there? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so again, we want to travel back through things that have happened at Byaki, whether they be things that you did or stuff that happened to you. And we want a narrow pinpoint and bring another moment to get clear.
[80:13] B: My dad.
[80:14] A: Yeah, same dad.
[80:16] B: Yeah.
[80:20] A: This one happened when?
[80:23] B: Probably when I was like six.
[80:25] A: Six. All right.
[80:26] B: Yeah.
[80:27] A: So you're six years old and you're where?
[80:31] B: On a school bus.
[80:32] A: You're on the bus. Right. Good. Sitting on a seat.
[80:35] B: Yes. With my sister.
[80:36] A: Next to your sister. Right, Good. And what happened next?
[80:40] B: I was trying to figure out a way for me and her to leave.
[80:44] A: Yes. Dad's house.
[80:46] B: Yeah.
[80:46] A: Right. Because it wasn't a good place to be.
[80:48] B: Yes.
[80:48] A: Right, good.
[80:49] B: And we were sitting on a school bus until everybody left.
[80:54] A: Yeah. Good job.
[80:55] B: Miss her stuff.
[80:56] A: Stop, mister, stop. Right.
[80:58] B: And the school drive school bus driver knew where we were supposed to go.
[81:03] A: That's right.
[81:03] B: So he automatically drove us to our house.
[81:07] A: Good job. Good detail. Right. Drove you back to the house and you're like, shit, not what we wanted to have happen, dude. Now we're gonna. Now it's gonna be worse.
[81:14] B: Yeah.
[81:14] A: Right.
[81:15] B: And my dad and his fiance was outside waiting for us.
[81:22] A: So they were outside. Right. And the bus drove by.
[81:24] B: Yeah.
[81:24] A: Right. And you got out.
[81:26] B: Yes.
[81:26] A: Right. Then what happened?
[81:29] B: He told my sister to go clean up coincide.
[81:33] A: Right, Good.
[81:34] B: And.
[81:34] A: And then what happened next?
[81:36] B: He told me to come over and clean the lawnmower.
[81:41] A: Yes. Right. So he said, go and clean the lawnmower. Right. Then what happened?
[81:46] B: So I went to go get the stuff that I need to clean it with, and I sat down and I was cleaning it.
[81:53] A: Yes.
[81:54] B: And he came up behind me and put my arm, like it was really hot on it. And he was screaming at me.
[82:04] A: Right. So he put your arm on the lawnmower, which was hot.
[82:07] B: Yeah.
[82:08] A: And that was hurting.
[82:09] B: Yeah.
[82:09] A: And then he was yelling at you.
[82:10] B: Yeah.
[82:11] A: Right. Then what happened?
[82:12] B: And I got. I was blacked out from that. And then he stopped, I guess, and then, like, went inside after I was done.
[82:26] A: Well, so you blacked out, meaning you don't remember what happened next?
[82:30] B: Yeah.
[82:31] A: Right. I'll explain that in a second. But then he stopped yelling.
[82:35] B: Yeah.
[82:35] A: And then he walked away.
[82:36] B: Yeah.
[82:37] A: And then that was over. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[82:41] B: Yes.
[82:41] A: Yeah. What's something else you've done that was fun?
[82:44] B: Reading to my sister.
[82:46] A: Yeah. Reading your sister was more fun. Right. Drawing.
[82:50] B: Yeah.
[82:50] A: Right. Dyeing stuff with color and sweater. All of those things were fun. Right? Like swimming in the ocean or a pool.
[82:59] B: I like the ocean.
[83:00] A: Yeah. Right?
[83:01] B: Yeah.
[83:01] A: So we got swimming in the ocean. Right. We've got that coloring. We got reading to your sister. Right. And then dad was back inside. And then he had stopped. Right. And then you then. Well, you came back, too. Right before that he had stopped. Right. Then you were gone.
[83:20] B: Yeah.
[83:20] A: Then he'd had your hand on the hot part of the lawnmower as he was yelling at you. And then he came up behind you. Right. And then you were sitting there cleaning the lawnmower. And then you went to get the stuff. And then he said, you need to clean the lawnmower. And then he told your sister to go in and do the choreography. And then you guys had gotten off the bus, and the bus driver realized that you were on the bus. And then you guys had skipped your stop. Then before that, you got on the bus thinking, gosh, what can we do to get away from him? Right. And again, as we go backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was. Was good, Right. You can remember him doing that?
[83:57] B: Yeah.
[83:58] A: Right? You can remember putting your glasses on.
[84:00] B: Yeah.
[84:00] A: Well, stop putting on your glasses. Well, then stop him from putting your hand on the. On the hot lawnmower. Well, then stop him from yelling.
[84:08] B: He's not yelling.
[84:09] A: Yes. So then where is he saying it no longer exists. Again, him doing that, did that have to do with you or him?
[84:15] B: Him.
[84:15] A: Right. But you didn't know that then. So again, close your eyes. Let that younger you know that it's over, finished. That it no longer exists, that him doing that had nothing to do with you. Right. So that she gets. It's not about me. Let that you know that you're okay, that you got away from that. That it stopped. That's right. So that you're becoming more okay in you when you're ready, take a deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. What's happening now? Calmer you are.
[85:00] B: Yeah.
[85:02] A: By the way, are we thinking dad was a guy who was 100% not only emotionally stable?
[85:06] B: Well, no, he wasn't.
[85:08] A: No, he wasn't, was he? But you didn't know that then. Right now you do. Did you need him to be okay?
[85:17] B: Yeah.
[85:18] A: You did? In order for you to be here now?
[85:22] B: No.
[85:23] A: In order for you to make it through it?
[85:25] B: No.
[85:26] A: Did you need him to be okay?
[85:28] B: No.
[85:29] A: Oh, right. Despite him not being well and okay, you made it through it and you're okay. Right. So one more time, close your eyes. Think back about the younger you. Letting her know that it's over. Finish. That it no longer exists. Letting her know that you're okay now. That's right. So that. That earlier you gets it. And as the earlier you is getting it, what do you notice now?
[86:04] B: Just feeling more calmer.
[86:05] A: Right. Deep breath in. And then an exhale. And then one more deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. What are you noticing now?
[86:29] B: Just calm.
[86:31] A: Yeah. Isn't it weird that you're staying calm even though you're talking about things that normally would trouble you?
[86:38] B: Yeah.
[86:40] A: Right?
[86:40] B: Yeah.
[86:41] A: Notice how that's different and really different than it's ever been for you? Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing?
[86:50] B: Yeah.
[86:53] A: So we're on our way to be healing. Yeah. So any questions for me about what we've been doing so far?
[87:07] B: No.
[87:09] A: When you think about those experiences, the thing that happened with dad with the sex toys at 4, this recent thing that happened with dad and the bus, when you think about the thing that happened with the boyfriend, when you think about those experiences now, what are you noticing?
[87:32] B: Peace with the situation.
[87:33] A: You are, aren't you?
[87:34] B: Yeah.
[87:35] A: Right. Notice how you still remember it, but notice how even as you're remembering it, it's not feeling so yucky.
[87:41] B: Yeah.
[87:42] A: Isn't that cool? Because your brain is getting updated. It's realizing that that stuff is over, which is what we wanted to know. And get that that stuff's over. Oh, and that you made it through. Oh. And that you're okay. Right. On your way to becoming better.
[88:03] B: Yeah.
[88:04] A: Right. Right. And so we're gonna take just a brief break because we've been sitting for a while, and if you want to, you can use the restroom. And then we'll get back. If you need more water, I can get you more water as well. So we'll pause this for a Second. So we're back. Yeah. So just kind of like, you know, now that you had a couple moments or so, just kind of check in with you. What are you noticing? For you now, I feel more like.
[88:37] B: Calmer and not like so tense about the situations that we've been over. So it's better.
[88:48] A: Yeah. You're actually feeling different.
[88:51] B: Yeah.
[88:52] A: Right. You still have the memories of the experiences. It's just not causing the same healing tones, which is pretty cool. And see, we're interested in even more healing happening. Right. Because here's the other part, and I don't think I fully shared this with you, but every time we've gone through a troubling experience that froze the moment. Right. Because all emotionally charged troubling experiences, that moment gets frozen in the brain and stays on. So regardless of whether I'm thinking about it or not, energy is being used to deal with it in an ongoing way. So that energy actually gets to be released. It gets literally unplugged. The energy gets to be released when that memory is unplugged, all the energy that had been used to deal with it is released into the body. It's now energy that gets to be recycled for renewable and restorative healing in you. Isn't that cool? So those things are what's going on. Your unconscious is going to track certain experiences. And see, you and I have talked a little bit about how you have a body, but that you're not your body. And that stuff may have happened to your body that hurt your feelings and screwed up your thinking. But that, that stuff never actually got on you never really touched who you are. And I'm going to show you what I mean by that. So what you're going to do, you're going to take your right arm and put it on the pillow. You're going to take that hand and hold it up so like that, you're going to look, have your fingers together. Good. You're going to look at that spot right there. Now as you're looking at that spot right there, don't do anything at all on purpose to move that hand or the fingers. Just become curious about when you might notice movement happening on its own. Whether the movement is small little vibrations or twitches or jumps or jerks within the fingers of that hand. Just become curious about when you'll notice that move. That's right. Happening without you having to do anything at all to make that hand move. Because when you start noticing, as you. That's right, already are noticing some movement that's not Conscious. That's right. Movement that you're noticing that's not conscious is your unconscious letting you know on an outside way. That's right. That it's responding. That's not right to you. I'm not sure when those fingers will begin to slowly separate. That's right. But as they do, you'll begin to notice. That's right. The little twitches, wiggles, vibrations, jumps or jerks within the fingers of that hand. And see with that peripheral vision, Olivia, notice how you can see my hand over here. And my hand will begin to move in towards your hand. But you'll notice that as my hand moves in towards your hand, that as it gets closer towards your hand, you'll notice that you can feel the energy coming from my hand. That's right. Which means you can feel. Feel the warmth of my hand without it touching your hand. Which means I'm actually coming closer to touching who you really are. That's right. Than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with respect. Love. That's right. And so as you feel that energy from my hand into the fingers and the palm of your hand, go ahead and take a deep breath in, exhale and close your eyes. And as your eyes close, that hand can only drop down, down, down, down, deeper, resting inside more and more of it. Because your unconscious is responding to you. Your unconscious knows what to do to rewire and make adjustments inside. It knows which experiences it shoved far, far away. Primarily because whenever you did think about them, they had a lot of yuckiness. Your unconscious is going to bring those experiences to the forefront of your awareness for us to clear. But only doing so as your body stays in this nice calm and peaceful resting, being still, getting so much more done without you having to do anything at all. Still getting things done from the inside out. You're still. That's right. Getting things done. That's right. And as your unconscious is integrating the learnings that it's already gotten, beginning to realize that stuff may have happened in my body, but never got who I really am. As you slowly begin to find your way back. Up and up and up. When you're ready, you'll take that big deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. What are you noticing within you now?
[96:20] B: I feel great.
[96:21] A: You do. And so again, your unconscious is going to travel back through things that have happened, may be negative things that happen to your body. It's going to narrow, pinpoint and bring a moment to Mind for us to clear. What comes to mind now.
[96:48] B: My trafficking situation.
[96:51] A: Uh huh. What's a specific thing that comes to mind?
[96:57] B: Oatmen.
[96:59] A: Old men.
[97:02] B: Yeah, yeah.
[97:04] A: Uh huh. Yeah.
[97:12] B: Yeah.
[97:14] A: So what's the moment that's coming to mind as you think about it, that has to do with old men?
[97:24] B: Their penises.
[97:25] A: Uh huh. So you might have been where and what happened?
[97:32] B: In a hotel.
[97:33] A: So you were in a hotel. Good. And was it daytime or nighttime? Middle of the day. Isn't that crazy? You know, for the longest time not knowing anything about the world and how that works, that the majority of stuff is happening during the day?
[97:49] B: Yeah.
[97:51] A: Not so much like you would think it would be all at night. Well, no, it's when somebody's like at work or they're on a lunch break or that that stuff happens more during the day than it does at any other time. It's very interesting. So you're in a hotel room, it's daytime. Ish. Right. And then what happened? Guy comes in.
[98:11] B: Yeah.
[98:12] A: Right. And he's an older guy.
[98:13] B: Yeah.
[98:14] A: So he had gray hair or not gray yet.
[98:17] B: Not great.
[98:18] A: But you knew that it was an older guy.
[98:19] B: Yeah.
[98:20] A: Right, good. And he came into the room and the traffickers there or. No, no, just you.
[98:24] B: Yeah.
[98:25] A: Right. And he came in. Right. And then what happened?
[98:30] B: We have toys.
[98:31] A: She had toys out. Right. But you guys had already negotiated, like via text, like what was gonna happen. Right. And he said he wanted toys. Right. Good job. Right. And so there are toys out.
[98:41] B: Yes.
[98:42] A: Some of it would have been dildos, vibrators, butt plugs, other kinds of, like different things. Right, good. And then what happened next?
[98:48] B: He ties me up.
[98:49] A: So he ties you up. Right. And that's kind of weird?
[98:51] B: No, I'm kind of used to it.
[98:53] A: Oh, wasn't scary at all?
[98:54] B: No.
[98:55] A: Okay, so he ties you up. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[98:59] B: I have something in my mouth.
[99:01] A: Right, good. Like a toy in your mouth or a toy. Right, good. And did it make it hard to breathe?
[99:11] B: No.
[99:12] A: No. Okay.
[99:15] B: I'm just laying on a bed.
[99:17] A: Right, good.
[99:17] B: Just waiting for him.
[99:18] A: So you have the toy in your mouth, laying on the bed, kind of spread eagle?
[99:21] B: Yeah.
[99:22] A: Okay. Arms are up. Right, good. Right. And then what happened next?
[99:28] B: He brings out a dildo.
[99:29] A: Right. Good job. Good detail.
[99:33] B: And then tries to put it in me.
[99:35] A: And put it in your vagina?
[99:36] B: Yeah.
[99:37] A: Right.
[99:38] B: And yeah.
[99:41] A: And some of that was uncomfortable.
[99:42] B: I don't really like the nose.
[99:45] A: Okay.
[99:46] B: So it was weird.
[99:47] A: So it was weird and uncomfortable. And you didn't really like It.
[99:49] B: Yeah.
[99:50] A: Right. Good. Then what happened? He put lube on it.
[99:52] B: He didn't have to.
[99:53] A: He did. Okay, good. Right. And then what happened next?
[99:57] B: Well, I told him that I don't want the deal damage.
[99:59] A: Right. Good job. Right. I don't really like this. Right. And then what happened?
[100:02] B: He took it away.
[100:03] A: Right. Good. Then what happened?
[100:04] B: And then I got flipped over.
[100:09] A: Right. Good job.
[100:11] B: And then his penis went in my butthole.
[100:15] A: Well, so then he put his penis. And some of that hurt. Some of that felt good.
[100:19] B: Yeah.
[100:19] A: Huh. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[100:22] B: Man. Just basically.
[100:25] A: So we did that from behind on top. Right. And then what happened?
[100:32] B: He ate me out.
[100:33] A: Then he stopped doing that. Yeah, Right.
[100:36] B: Didn't ate me out.
[100:37] A: And then he did oral. Right. Good. Then what happened?
[100:42] B: That's it. He paid me.
[100:43] A: Well, then he was done.
[100:45] B: Yeah.
[100:45] A: Right. Put his clothes on. Right.
[100:49] B: Paid me.
[100:50] A: Right. And then left.
[100:51] B: Yes.
[100:52] A: And then what happened next?
[100:54] B: You came back the next day.
[100:56] A: Well, that time was over. And came back the next day. Right. Good.
[101:00] B: We did something different.
[101:01] A: Right. Good job. Right. Different, but similar.
[101:05] B: No, totally different.
[101:06] A: Totally different. Right, Good. Which was better or worse?
[101:09] B: It was good.
[101:11] A: Okay. Right. And then that was over. Right. So let me just check, as you're telling me about that particular moment, what were you noticing in you.
[101:23] B: Fun moments?
[101:24] A: Well, some of that was more fun than others.
[101:26] B: Yes.
[101:27] A: Right. Which would make sense.
[101:30] B: Yeah.
[101:30] A: Right. Cuz some people are more appealing than others. Right. So even though it's a job, it's a. It's more appealing based on who it's with.
[101:39] B: Yeah.
[101:39] A: And other times it'd be like, oh God, I don't know. Based on who it's with.
[101:45] B: Yeah.
[101:45] A: Right, Right. So as you're remembering those more enjoyable moments of that. Right. What else are you noticing in you?
[101:59] B: That I miss it.
[102:02] A: Uh huh. Miss that kind of sex play.
[102:07] B: Yeah. I don't want to be boring. I feel like this is gonna be a boring type. But like sex life for me, sex.
[102:21] A: Will only be boring from now on.
[102:23] B: I'm just hoping that it won't.
[102:25] A: Well, why would it be?
[102:27] B: I don't know. Because it would be boring people for me.
[102:31] A: And I'm like, okay, how do you know it would be boring people?
[102:35] B: I don't know.
[102:36] A: Oh, you don't know.
[102:37] B: There's not a lot of people out there like that.
[102:40] A: There isn't?
[102:41] B: No, not that I know of.
[102:44] A: Oh, well, maybe that might be more true. Right. So you're remembering some times that were fun.
[102:56] B: Yes.
[102:56] A: Right. And some experiences. Then you were worried like, oh no, I'm only going to have boring stuff because if I'm not doing. Being trafficked or, you know, doing stuff for money, then it's all boring.
[103:14] B: Yeah.
[103:15] A: Huh. What about the people who are doing that kind of stuff that aren't getting paid for it?
[103:23] B: I mean, I don't think it's gonna be more. I mean, it's not like, all about being paid for. It's just.
[103:31] A: Well, that isn't the fun part, is it? No. Right. That's what I'm talking about. There's people that are doing those same kinds of things.
[103:42] B: Yeah.
[103:43] A: And it's not for compensation. Right. See, there's a really interesting thing that we learned when we were in our PhD program for sexology, and the example was what you do in the bedroom might not be what I do in the bedroom. What I do in the bedroom might not be what you do in the bedroom. If we're consenting adults and both parties are good with what's happening, there isn't an issue with it. Right. Which has nothing to do with whether you're being compensated or trafficked or. Or make sense what you've discovered. So maybe this might be the better thing. Prior to some of those experiences where that kind of sex play was involved, you didn't know that it'd be something that I'd really like or enjoy.
[104:44] B: Yeah, no.
[104:45] A: Right. So prior to knowing it, you didn't know that that was something that I like and enjoy. Follow me with that. It wasn't until you had the experience of it that you went, oh, this is something that I like and enjoy. Right. And I get to use my voice in parts that I don't like. I say, don't do that. Parts that I do like. Okay. Those are fun to do.
[105:09] B: Yeah.
[105:10] A: Got it. Right. So what happened is you didn't know what it could be like with certain play. Make sense. And different people are into all sorts of different kind of play. Right. I mean, there's all sorts of different kind of play. Whether it be the guy who's the cuckold, who likes to watch his spouse or partner. Partner, whatever, have sex with somebody else, or whether people that do all sorts of bdsm, tie up bondage, other kinds of things.
[105:47] B: Yeah.
[105:48] A: Right. Whether it be somebody that's really into a rape fantasy. Does that mean they actually want to be raped in real life? No. Right. See, you got it. Even though they might feel like that's like an impeachment thing, it's not because they want to be raped. Right. It's all about the play. Right. And so you didn't know. So then why would we be thinking moving forward, you know, outside of the life and having a different world, that you wouldn't be getting connected with somebody that might also be in the same kind of play that you are?
[106:25] B: Because it's rare.
[106:26] A: I'm not sure it's that rare.
[106:29] B: I feel like it is. It depends on the person. Like, certain people don't know. Like, like I'm the person that tells. Like, I like this and this and that. Some people that I talk to, they don't like that. So it's like hard for me to be who I am in the room instead of like being like, oh, okay. You know, it's just like, it's not me.
[106:55] A: It's like, well, like, you know, how many like long term committed relationships? Yeah. Have you actually had.
[107:04] B: I had like five in my life.
[107:10] A: Uh huh. Right.
[107:14] B: Cause I really am not a big person on dating because it always ended tragedy, like tragic.
[107:23] A: Oh, how so? Maybe we want to get that taken care of.
[107:26] B: Yeah. Like either I give, I give my all and then they don't give nothing and I'm just like cheating on me.
[107:38] A: Do you think, Olivia, that maybe your picker has been a little bit malfunctioning? Like, you haven't always picked the right kind of partner?
[107:52] B: I. I tend to pick people that has more like that has tattoos or that's doing that. I feel like they'll know how to have fun and not be boring.
[108:06] A: That's right. Because people with tattoos are the only ones that know how to have fun.
[108:10] B: Yes. I don't know. I'm obsessed with tattoos. So like, if I see like, like I notice, like if I was see people with tattoos, like, I'm coming for you.
[108:22] A: Yeah. Yeah. So maybe the criteria, you know, I'm gonna pick a mate based on whether they have tattoos or not might be, you know, not the best criteria for all of what you're wanting.
[108:39] B: Yeah, it depends on how it looks though. So I don't just go off like with everyone that has tattoos. So like, if I see you guys like a cool one, then I might be like, okay, I like you because of your tattoos.
[108:54] A: Right.
[108:56] B: And then like, then I get to know them. Or just be like a one night stand. Just like, do I really want to get to know you? I just really want to fuck you. It's just like.
[109:09] A: Well, probably don't want to do either of those things.
[109:12] B: No. I'm changing my ways now.
[109:15] A: So there's a, there's a little thing that I think we need to do a little bit of education with. Okay. So a gal can pretty much get with any guy that is also interested in her, right. So if a gal is out and she sees a guy that's kind of looking at her, that seems to be interested in her, if she goes up to him and says, hey, you want to come home and fuck, he goes, I'm in, let's go. Right. He's not going to say no to that because guys typically are yeses to that. Right. But a woman is the opposite. So here's the weird thing. Men get turned on by women. Women are beautiful, sensual, provocative, shapely, they smell good. Their body moves in different ways, different parts. Right. Women don't get turned on by men. Women get turned on by being a turn on, knowing that they're an object of desire, but knowing that you can't really have me. So the female panther, even when she's in heat, never chases down a male, ever. She doesn't run after him going, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me. No, she lets him know I'm approachable, but she makes him work to catch me. Right. That's not how it's been for you. No, no. You've been the pursuer. So women who have had early forms of, you know, childhood sexual abuse tend to fuck like men, Right. So women who fuck like men will be women who have one night stands. Because a guy can have a one night stand. Because a guy doesn't have a chemical release of something that has him be endeared towards the person. Right. The example would be the woman who's cheating on her husband isn't having sex with her husband. The guy who's cheating on his wife is having sex with the person that he's cheating with and his wife because he's a never know. You want to right now? Yes. I'm in. Ow. Okay, I'll go. Right. I mean, that's how it works for, for guys. So the problem is that you been the pursuer at times.
[111:37] B: Yeah.
[111:38] A: Follow me with that.
[111:39] B: It's just more fun.
[111:41] A: Well, I don't know. You said every single relationship has ended in tragedy. I'm not so sure that's much more fun.
[111:51] B: It's just another sign of me not telling, like knowing that I'm not good in relationships.
[111:58] A: Oh, I don't know whether you're not good in relationships. I'm not sure you're picking.
[112:04] B: I'm not picking the right people.
[112:07] A: Right, right. That's what I meant by the pickers off. So here, here's another thing to kind of consider for you. Okay, Right. So if women are the ones who. Women who have successful relationships with men are women who hold the keys because they've got the goods, meaning what the guy would be interested in. So they hold the keys. Women are regulators. What does that mean? Women are the ones to determine when and where, how much and how often are we being sexual? Not men. Because men are tending to be. Yes, all the time, whenever. Okay, I'm ready. Right. Women are regulators. Women can have an enjoyable sexual experience with. Without having an orgasm. And a guy can't. For a guy, if it doesn't end in that, he's like, freak the fuck out, right? It's because for men it is the ending, right? It's the crescendo. The guy after orgasm loses the erection, right? Younger guys, it'll come back sooner, but that's what happens with guys, they lose their erection. Women, an orgasm happens along the way, right? So it's not the ending and they can have more than one. So women are regulators. Women determine how much, how frequent, how often, when and where. Because they've got the goods. They hold the keys too often. Women give guys keys, guy drives recklessly, woman gets treated like crap. For a woman, the question is never.
[113:58] B: Do I get to be with that guy?
[114:00] A: It's am I going to allow that guy to hang out with me because I've got the goods? We want the woman to know that she's worth it, right? That he's lucky if I'm going to allow him to spend any amount of time with me. Right? That's not where it's been coming from. From for you, right? So we want to get that reorganized in your own mind. We want to get that reorganized in your body so that that begins to shift so that you have more say, right? Women who have had early childhood stuff fuck like men and they get hurt more. Right? There was a show a long time ago called Sex and the City and one of the lead characters was a news like newspaper writer. And she was saying that now that women are working the same kind of jobs, living in the same kinds of places, making the same kind of money that men are making. Her question was, can women have sex like men? And the answer was yes, but. And the yes but is women have a chemical called oxytocin that gets released when they're being intimate with somebody that has them care. It's the same chemical that's released when they have a baby that gets them to really like care about their baby kind of Thing guys don't have that same chemical. So it's a yes, but. So then there's a woman that came out on TV called the Millionaire Matchmaker. I didn't like everything that she said, but there are two things that I thought were really, really important. One is when guys and gals go out for the woman, it's a two drink maximum drink too much. Right. And then the second one was no sex before monogamy, before we know we're in a committed relationship. No sex. Because the example is why buy the cow if I can get the milk for free? And a woman that wants to the guy is pretty much going to be a never know. I remember teaching this to a woman one time and she goes, you're going to be so proud of me. I went out on a date the other night and I didn't have sex with him on the first date. And I said, awesome, great job. And then she said to me, but I did give him a blowjob. No, you totally missed the point because that's the same thing.
[116:54] B: Yeah, it is.
[116:55] A: If she says to him, I won't have sex with you tonight, but I'll give you a blowjob, he's going, all right, Hallelujah. Right?
[117:03] B: Yeah.
[117:04] A: Even if she goes, you know, I'm not gonna have sex and I won't give you a blow job, but I'll give you a hand job, all right? Right. He's a never no. She is a yes when she wants to, a no when she doesn't. Right. The example goes, a guy sleeping, he's got to be up and at work at 6am and it's 2:30 in the morning. And his woman snuggles up next to him, reaches down, whispers in his ear, I'm really horny, I want to fuck. He's like, okay, I'm in. He tries to do that to her. She's sleeping, she's got to be up early. He reaches over, starts grab. Get away from me, I'm tired. Yeah, right. That's the difference. You follow me with that now. So we want you to be owning your stuff, that it doesn't just get given away.
[118:09] B: I mean, I don't give my. I don't, like if I don't want you, I'll be like, no. And I'll be committed to that, saying, no, you're no. You know.
[118:20] A: Well, if you don't want them, that's different. Yeah, but what if he's got like, you know, a really cool looking tattoo? You kind of think that's A cool looking tattoo, but like, that I had.
[118:31] B: To like, get to like, talking to him first. Like, it's not all about the tattoos. It just plays a good part in it too.
[118:39] A: Yeah.
[118:39] B: It's just like, man, I don't even click with you. So I was like, no, see, I.
[118:46] A: Would be thinking that it would be more about for you. How do you want the guy to be treating you? How do you want the guy to be for you? Not like, can I like him? Because like, I like what his tattoo looks like. Right. For women, it's not solely what the guy looks like. Follow me. For women, it's all the other factors too. For guys, you could tell a guy, this gal has every single quality that you wanted in a partner. Everything that you want. You know what his first question is gonna be? Yeah, but what does she look like?
[119:30] B: Yeah.
[119:31] A: And if that doesn't match, it doesn't matter that you got all those qualities. Not interested. Do that for a woman. She's like, well, you know, I'll meet him. You know, if you say, he's got all the stuff that I'm looking for, well, I'll at least meet him, you know, and then we'll go from there.
[119:49] B: Yeah.
[119:49] A: You follow me? He's not even interested to meet. Even if she's got everything. Yeah. Yeah. So we want to have that set up that you hold the keys. Yeah, follow me with that.
[120:07] B: Yeah.
[120:08] A: And then so going back to that experience, because some of that was good, but then you mentioned old white men and the thing that was causing discomfort had to do with their penises.
[120:20] B: Yes.
[120:21] A: Yeah. So what's that about? I want to understand.
[120:25] B: It just, I feel like penises in general, weird.
[120:30] A: You think?
[120:31] B: Yeah.
[120:32] A: Circumcised, non circumcised.
[120:35] B: It don't matter if they're circumcised or.
[120:38] A: They'Re all weird looking, aren't they?
[120:39] B: Yeah. And like, it's like questionable. Like, it looks like an Amy.
[120:47] A: Mm. Yeah.
[120:51] B: But it, it doesn't. For me, it doesn't like, I guess it doesn't care how it looks. It's more of like how it smells.
[120:59] A: Uh huh.
[120:59] B: Because it just smells disgusting.
[121:02] A: It's like, well, yeah, that would be anything though.
[121:05] B: Yeah.
[121:06] A: Huh. So there must have been an experience with somebody that had a penis that smelled really yucky.
[121:12] B: Yeah. It was disgusting.
[121:15] A: Yeah. Right.
[121:18] B: It's like if a guy tells a girl, yo, your vagina stings, it's like, I can tell you that, you know, your dick smells and you need to check that out.
[121:28] A: Huh.
[121:28] B: So.
[121:31] A: Right but you can remember that experience with that guy, right? And you still had to do whatever you had to do.
[121:38] B: No.
[121:38] A: Then. Oh, you stop.
[121:39] B: Yeah, Right, right.
[121:42] A: You're like, no thanks. Yeah, done. Right, Right. But you can remember that happening, right? You can remember tying your bandana in your hair.
[121:52] B: Yeah.
[121:52] A: Right. Well, stop tying your bandana in your hair. Well, then stop that from happening.
[121:56] B: It's not happening.
[121:57] A: Yeah. So then where is it? That's right. You can remember that happening. You can remember putting your pants on. Olivia, stop putting on your pants.
[122:04] B: I'm not putting on.
[122:05] A: Well then stop that from happening.
[122:07] B: Stop.
[122:08] A: Yeah. So then where is it go. It doesn't exist.
[122:10] B: It doesn't exist.
[122:11] A: Right? That's right.
[122:14] B: Yeah.
[122:15] A: Yeah. And as you're getting it, what do you notice now happening with the feelings?
[122:20] B: I can still smell it.
[122:22] A: You can right now?
[122:24] B: Yeah.
[122:24] A: Uh huh.
[122:26] B: I can see. I can still see everything. And the smell.
[122:30] A: Oh, good. So notice how close it is right now.
[122:34] B: Yeah.
[122:34] A: What happens if we move that way down over there? What do you notice when it's way over there?
[122:45] B: It's far away from me.
[122:46] A: It is. What do you notice happened to the smell as it moves far away?
[122:50] B: It's not as strong.
[122:52] A: Oh, it isn't. What happens if it moved beyond the wall? I can't smell it like way, all the way out there.
[122:57] B: I won't be able to smell it.
[122:59] A: Right. What happens if we like, made it fuzzy? You know, like old TVs used to like have a fuzzy screen. What if we made it all fuzzy so you can't see it?
[123:06] B: I want to know what it is.
[123:09] A: And it's way out there and you're not smelling it as it's way out there. Right. And it's fuzzy.
[123:16] B: Yeah.
[123:16] A: Mm. Right. And see, as you think of that picture, was it in color or black and white? What happens if we move it to black and white?
[123:28] B: Still be the same color?
[123:30] A: Would it that's in black and white? Was.
[123:34] B: Was white.
[123:35] A: Uh huh. Well, it might not be the same color.
[123:38] B: No, it's probably too black and white.
[123:40] A: Probably gray to. Huh? Right, Right. And if it's in black and white, is it more like a photograph or a movie? Like, well, what if it changes just to a photo? What do you notice as it's a photo far away?
[123:56] B: Just staying right there.
[123:57] A: It is just staying right there, which isn't close to you anymore. And what happens to the smell is it's a photo far away. Oh, you can't smell it. That's right. That's right. Right. And see, instead of you now looking through your own eyes. We can see you looking at it. Yeah, Right. And notice how that's changing how it feels. Right. And that weird.
[124:25] B: Yeah.
[124:26] A: That just by changing it into a photograph and moving it way over there actually changes what it smells like.
[124:33] B: Yeah.
[124:33] A: Right. Because try to get the smell as you're seeing it as a photograph way over there. You can't, can you?
[124:39] B: No.
[124:39] A: Isn't that weird or kind of good?
[124:42] B: It's really good.
[124:43] A: It is really good, isn't it? That's right. But see, what we just did is one of the things that our brain codes thing is, is in location and it is in size. And whether it's a video, like a movie or a photograph, whether it's in color or black and white, all of that changes how your brain had it programmed. So now even as you recall that guy's penis, that you're like, no, thanks. Yeah, try to get the smell. Seeing it way out there is a small photograph.
[125:20] B: I can't smell it.
[125:22] A: Right. Good job. See, isn't that a good news thing?
[125:27] B: Yeah.
[125:28] A: Yeah. Right. Because it doesn't have the same feelings.
[125:32] B: Yeah.
[125:33] A: Right. And now we want to clear up another time of something that happened when you were little. Maybe stuff that happened that was like, you know, sexual stuff that happened to your body. Because we know the thing that happened when you were little with the toys, with dad. Right. And see, what you also know is a little bit like, I kind of like different kinds of sex play.
[125:55] B: Yeah.
[125:56] A: That I wouldn't have known that I liked until I had certain experiences. Right. I remember working with a woman who was, like, in a torture situation where they did a lot of, like, physical stuff. Stuff like her crazy. Her mom used to take curling iron that was hot and shut. Like, so, like, really yucky stuff. But one of the things that later on in life, she got freaked out about is that she actually liked her husband putting his arm around her neck.
[126:26] B: Yeah, me too.
[126:27] A: Right. But what she got freaked out by is, like, well, that was a reminder of abuse that had happened to her. So she was like, is it even okay for me to get turned on by this? And what we had to do is we had to shift it that it's on her terms. Because when it was torture, it wasn't on her terms. She wasn't asking for that to happen. They were just doing it. But with her husband, she can direct it. Right. Just like we know that the person who is in control in the bdsm, in the game of sadist and masochist, is not the sadist. The person who's in charge is not the one who's inflicting pain. The person who's in charge is the masochist, the one getting the pain. Because they have the safe word. They get determined when to stop. Right, right. So different people are into different things. That doesn't mean, like I said, the person who's into the rape fantasy, that doesn't mean that they want to get raped. Yeah, right. So the person who likes feeling the arm on the throat doesn't mean that they want to get choked out so that they pass out.
[127:52] B: Yeah.
[127:55] A: Right. They just might like that. And heat of the passion. Yeah, right, right, yeah. So what are you noticing now?
[128:12] B: What's going on.
[128:13] A: Yeah, right now. On you. What are you noticing for yourself?
[128:19] B: That I need to stop judging people off their tattoos.
[128:23] A: Or how about we, like, add more than. Yeah, more than your tattoos as part of the criteria as to whether they're desirable or not. Yeah, right. It's like the person going, you know what? I'm really into a hippie. And you know, the person who is like, you know, a little bit more granoli. But that was their only criteria. They didn't realize that. Oh, well, I got with somebody who's also got major mental illness. They're bipolar. Oh. Oh, shit. That wasn't. But if I only had the criteria of I want to be with like, you know, somebody who's more granola, like a hippie, then I've missed out on the rest of the criteria.
[129:07] B: Yeah.
[129:08] A: That I might want to pay a little attention to. Yeah, that might be important too.
[129:13] B: Yeah.
[129:17] A: Right. So again, go ahead and think of that finger monkey. Take a deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. With eyes closed, they rest. As they rest, you also rest aware of your breath sounds, my voice background sounds, how it feels to be sitting in the way. You are noticing all. All of that at the same time as your unconscious is integrating those things that it's got and learned, beginning to change from the inside out. Healing energy is integrating all the way through so that all the cells within your body are getting the same healing. Even more is underway as you rest, your unconscious responding. And because your unconscious knows so much more than you on how to heal, it's going to travel all the way back to an early experience, whether it be with dad or somebody else that happened when you were much younger. Stuff that happened to your body then so that you can be free now to direct your life in more ways. Lightening up so as you begin to slowly Find your way back up. Your unconscious travels back through those experiences. Experiences when you were younger. Narrowing down to pinpoint and bringing a particular experience to mind. And what is it that's coming to mind now? Yeah.
[131:19] B: That one.
[131:22] A: You might have been howled.
[131:26] B: 16.
[131:27] A: Yeah. And you might have been where?
[131:30] B: At a townhouse.
[131:32] A: So you're at a townhouse and it's daytime or nighttime?
[131:36] B: Daytime.
[131:37] A: Daytime. Right. And you're in the townhouse, like living room, kitchen, dining room, bedroom.
[131:45] B: Living room, kitchen.
[131:46] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[131:48] B: Me and my mom getting.
[131:50] A: Right. So you and your mom get fighting. Right.
[131:52] B: Yeah.
[131:52] A: And then what happened?
[131:55] B: She drags me around the house.
[131:59] A: Right. So she drags you by your hair.
[132:00] B: Yeah.
[132:01] A: Right. And then what happened?
[132:04] B: I was tired of her dragging me around the house. So I hit my head on the counter.
[132:12] A: Right. Good job.
[132:13] B: On the floor.
[132:13] A: Yeah.
[132:14] B: Loose.
[132:14] A: Yes.
[132:16] B: And I got up.
[132:17] A: Yes. And then what happened?
[132:19] B: And I started fighting her.
[132:20] A: Right. Like swinging.
[132:22] B: Yeah.
[132:22] A: Arms.
[132:23] B: Yeah.
[132:23] A: Right, Good. Pulling hair. Scratching.
[132:25] B: I don't pull hair. I just start hitting.
[132:28] A: Okay, so you started punching her.
[132:29] B: Yeah.
[132:29] A: Right. Then what happened?
[132:30] B: Then I grabbed the knife.
[132:32] A: Yes. Right. Then when I went for her throat. Right. Kind threw it at her.
[132:36] B: Slice.
[132:38] A: Sliced her on the throat.
[132:39] B: Yeah.
[132:39] A: Right. And then she was bleeding.
[132:42] B: Like she only had a little slit.
[132:43] A: Right.
[132:44] B: Not that bad.
[132:45] A: Right.
[132:46] B: And she. For next. She got me and then, like, she threw me outside the house.
[132:53] A: That's right. Good job. And then what happened?
[132:55] B: And then I ran around the house.
[132:58] A: Yes.
[132:59] B: Back door where the sliding door is.
[133:01] A: Yes. Right.
[133:02] B: And I try to open it, but it wasn't. And then I busted it open.
[133:07] A: Right.
[133:09] B: Put my hand through it.
[133:10] A: Right. Good.
[133:11] B: And I came in and tried to get my sister from her.
[133:14] A: Right. Good. Then what happened?
[133:15] B: Then the police came.
[133:16] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[133:18] B: And then I got, like, headed over to the hospital because I was bleeding. Glasses in my arm.
[133:23] A: Right. Good job.
[133:24] B: And then I got. I was. Baker acted.
[133:28] A: Right. Good job. Then you went to the hospital.
[133:31] B: Yeah. Right.
[133:31] A: And then what happened?
[133:33] B: Then I was talking to my other therapist.
[133:36] A: Yes.
[133:37] B: And they called DCF and they knew what was going on.
[133:41] A: Right.
[133:42] B: And then. Yeah.
[133:43] A: And then what happened next?
[133:45] B: I just talked to DCF people.
[133:47] A: Yes.
[133:48] B: And then I had a new case worker.
[133:52] A: Right. And then you went back to Mom's.
[133:56] B: Well, basically I actually went back to my chosen mom. I went to my chosen mom.
[134:00] A: Right, you went to the other.
[134:01] B: Kicked out.
[134:02] A: That's right. Good.
[134:04] B: Yeah.
[134:05] A: But sister stayed with mom.
[134:07] B: Yeah.
[134:07] A: Right. And then that moment ended. So even as you're telling me about that one Right. Now, what did you notice?
[134:15] B: Something good came out of it.
[134:16] A: What did you notice as you were talking about it? Was there any discomfort?
[134:20] B: A little.
[134:21] A: A little. But notice how it's a lot less.
[134:23] B: Yeah.
[134:24] A: Than it normally was. Right. Because you can remember mom doing this. You and her getting in the fight, her pulling you around, you getting up, you slicing out of, you breaking through the glass, you getting to the hospital and then bake her out. You can remember all that happening, right? You can remember putting your pants on today.
[134:41] B: Yeah.
[134:41] A: Olivia, stop putting in your pants. Well, stop fighting with mom. Well, stop mom from dragging you by your hair.
[134:48] B: She's not dragging me.
[134:49] A: Well, then you stop putting on your shirt. Well, stop me from putting on my pants.
[134:53] B: You're not playing.
[134:53] A: Well, stop mom from doing that.
[134:55] B: She's not doing it.
[134:56] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[134:57] B: It no longer exists.
[134:58] A: Bingo. And again, what do you notice happening to the feelings coming down? They are. That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Isn't that a good news thing?
[135:11] B: Yeah, it is.
[135:12] A: Things again are beginning to lighten up for you. So it's not so troubling. And the lens is looking outward. So what's a situation that you might encounter even at, you know, the assessment house that normally would cause the think about something that might happen that normally used to kind of trigger you.
[135:38] B: I would keep disrespect people, disrespect me when I give them full respect.
[135:45] A: Like how so somebody might be like what they might say or do.
[135:53] B: Like they like belittled me, like, or just like say something. Like can't say nothing in my face, but they can like act like a certain way in front of me, but then go around like two faced like a snake.
[136:11] A: Huh.
[136:12] B: I don't like those type of people. Fake.
[136:14] A: So let's think of somebody doing that and what do you notice?
[136:19] B: It doesn't give me mad.
[136:20] A: It doesn't. Right. Because who are we learning about?
[136:23] B: Myself.
[136:23] A: Are we? Yeah, what are we learning about you?
[136:26] B: About what I like and what I don't like.
[136:29] A: Okay, that's one thing. But who are we learning about when they're saying stuff about you? Are we learning about you? Are we learning about them then? That's right. Notice how that's really clear now. Notice how it didn't feel that way. Yeah, but it is now. Right. And see, back then when you were little and that stuff was being put in different parts of your body, that little younger you thought that it was happening and impacting you.
[137:00] B: Yeah.
[137:01] A: I wonder what would happen if she realized that there's no cell within your body right now. That's the same as it was when that stuff was happening to her body. And I wonder what would happen if from here you began to let her know that they never touched me. Because you could say these words after me and they'll make a lot of sense. So say these words. I have a nose, I have two elbows. I have 10 fingers. I have 10 toes, but I'm not my elbows, I'm not my nose, I'm not my fingers, I'm not my toes. I have a vagina. I'm not my vagina. My vagina is mine, but it isn't me. So they mess with my stuff. And it screwed up my feelings.
[137:54] B: And it's screwed up my feelings.
[137:56] A: And it hurt my body.
[137:57] B: And it hurt my body and maybe.
[137:59] A: Screwed up my thinking.
[138:00] B: And maybe screwed up my thinking.
[138:01] A: But they never touched who I really am.
[138:03] B: But they never touched what I really am.
[138:05] A: They never touched me.
[138:06] B: They never touched me.
[138:07] A: They mess with my body, but they never got me. But they never got me, right? Because who I am can only be touched. Can only be touched with respect and love.
[138:19] B: Only respect and love.
[138:21] A: So they mess with my stuff.
[138:22] B: So they mess with my stuff.
[138:23] A: But they never got me.
[138:25] B: But they never got me.
[138:26] A: That's right. Take a deep breath in and then a long exhale. Close your eyes. As eyes are closed, notice what happens as you drift down deeper and deeper inside towards that calm and peaceful flowing energy, the light at the center that is you. That's right. Even more is ongoingly happening at deeper and deeper levels. Because your unconscious now is responding, responding towards the future. You present clear light, free, more and more okay from the inside out. You're becoming more okay in you. That's right. Seeing things clearly for what they are. Not about me. And as you're discovering how much more is not about me than you had known before. You're becoming more free to lighten up, to grow, to heal, to change, to direct your life to be moving more and more in the way you want, naturally and automatically. That's happening. Your unconscious taking in what it's gotten and learned. Healing is transpiring, whether you fully realize it or not. At a deeper level. Once those seedlings have been set in the soil and the topsoil has been watered, there's so much more growing happening. So much more healing happening. Things are lightening up for you so that you get to direct your journey even more, becoming more okay in you. Because as one last thing begins to happen, and from here, you begin to educate the younger you about how really resourceful she is, how powerful she is. How you, even back then, when you weren't sure, had what you needed inside to make it through that you didn't need them to be well. In order for you to turn out okay, in order for you to have a chosen mom, in order for you to like drawing and swimming and the ocean dying with color, all those things are happening. You're having what you need, and now you're directing life. That's right. Realizing at the deepest level how worth it you are to you. Aren't you worth it to you? That's right. That's right. And then when you're ready, you can take your time finding your way back. Up and up and up. When you're ready, take a deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Ah. What are you noticing now?
[142:19] B: I feel good.
[142:20] A: You do, don't you? Isn't that a good. You did great today.
[142:24] B: Thank you.
[142:25] A: Yeah. So you have some powerful tools. Anytime you think of that finger monkey, it's just going to continue to reinforce what we've done. Right. And you get to set a new course in a new direction for how you want life to be even more fun for you, even more fun with play. Because you're gonna be a little bit more selective. Because again, the question isn't, do I get to be with that guy? It's am I gonna allow that guy to hang out with me? Right. Because if I do, he's really lucky. That's right. Yeah. And so you're on your way. You did great today.
[143:10] B: Thank you.
[143:10] A: Yeah. And if I don't see you again, which hopefully I will have a great experience in whatever program you go to next.
[143:21] B: Thank you.
[143:21] A: Yeah. It was really awesome getting connected with you.
[143:24] B: It was good.
[143:27] A: Cool. Cool. All right. Well, we will see.
