[00:00] A: Actually when the zebra itself sees, senses.
[00:05] B: Smells, feels, thinks lion is approaching, that it's actually the zebra's brain, not the lion that's now immediately making the zebra alert, motivated and stronger. We call it scared. It runs fast away. Now, yes, the brain of the zebra.
[00:27] A: Is doing it to the zebra in response to the lion approaching, but it's.
[00:35] B: The zebra's brain that's doing it. Does that make sense? So from this same lens we're going.
[00:42] A: To say that there's been ways in which your brain has been working that's been causing you to feel bad. By bad, we're meaning those flashbacks. By bad, we're meaning those triggers. By bad, we're meaning the, the at times feeling like it might be better to be dead. By bad, we're meaning the anxious, unsafe. Your brain of course might do all.
[01:07] B: Of this to you in response to stuff current, future, past.
[01:15] A: But you've recognized that that way of your brain working has been problematic.
[01:30] B: Well, it's great if it's doing it in response to something that enables you to avoid, get away from. It's not so useful when it's happening and it's causing you to do things.
[01:46] A: That later on you wish you hadn't.
[01:48] B: Done or feeling ways like those flashbacks.
[01:52] A: At times that it's not useful to.
[01:54] B: Be feeling that way.
[01:59] A: Right? Like I don't like wake up in the morning and say, you know what, today at 10:00 I'd like to have.
[02:03] B: A flashback remembering this awful thing doesn't go right.
[02:11] A: That doesn't happen. Right. You know. So yes, we want your brain to.
[02:16] B: Be optimized to best handle stressors that currently are ongoing.
[02:23] A: But we also want the impact that the past stuff has had to be cleared and gone.
[02:30] B: So it's not re running that in you.
[02:35] A: So that you actually have space.
[02:37] B: And separation from it.
[02:41] A: Because too often with what you shared with me, that you're not just dealing with what is happening, but you're dealing with the cumulative effect of what has.
[02:57] B: Right?
[02:58] A: So in the world of emotions, let's think of another maybe silly example. But let's think of this man who's.
[03:05] B: Poking a stick at a bear cub and the mama bear sees the man doing it and the mama bear gets angry, which we would want her to, and she ferociously runs at man, right?
[03:21] A: Her emotions are matching the situation. We want that to happen. But let's say the woman, the bear.
[03:30] B: Mauled that guy and now he's dead. The bear later on isn't thinking, oh geez, you think I overreacted I mean, I know he was doing that to my bear cub, but, like, I probably didn't need to kill him. Maybe I overreacted. Bear's not doing that, nor if the guy got away, is the bear getting with all the other bears going, if you see this mother effer, you let me know and we'll get him.
[03:55] A: No. Right. Because the emotions are matching the situation. Does that make sense? That's the same thing that we want in you, so that the emotions match what's happening and are useful for you in that way. What's been problematic is that frequently they've been more than the situation needed or happening at times that you didn't want it to happen at all. Follow me with that. Yeah. So. So. So as we're looking through this lens.
[04:35] B: And we're saying now that your brain.
[04:38] A: Has been doing it to you not because it's out to get you, but.
[04:41] B: Because complicated machines are prone to error. You know, and, you know, think of like a simple thing like a hammer.
[04:48] A: If I took my hammer and I threw it like a boomerang across the yard and it landed on the other.
[04:53] B: Side, I could still pick that hammer.
[04:55] A: Up and pound nails with it. Pretty simple machine. Right. I wouldn't want to do that with.
[05:00] B: My computer or my phone because they're more complicated. And the more complicated a machine is, the more prone it is to error. Does that make sense?
[05:15] A: And so we're going to say that there have been some errors and misfires in the way that your brain has been working, not because it wants to.
[05:24] B: Do that, but because of glitches.
[05:27] A: And what we're going to tune up, Rachel, is just the parts where the glitches are kind of like if I took my car to the mechanic because I needed an oil change, that's what.
[05:38] B: I'm wanting him to do.
[05:39] A: I don't need him to replace my tires because they're fine.
[05:43] B: So we're going to keep all the.
[05:45] A: Aspects that work really well for you in place, and we're going to adjust the aspects where it's been problematic, where.
[05:54] B: Your reactions have been suboptimal for you.
[05:58] A: Does that make sense? Yeah. So by looking at it through this kind of unusual lens, that your brain is making you feel bad. The first question is, do you really think that your brain wants you to feel bad? No, it doesn't want you to feel bad. So the second question, do you think it would want you to feel good?
[06:23] B: Yes, that's what most people say. But what we've discovered in working with thousands of different people. Even though you're a bright gal and.
[06:31] A: I'm a pretty bright guy. The majority of our emotional brain works.
[06:35] B: More like the brain of an animal. And an animal's brain doesn't have feelings.
[06:42] A: Because it's concerned about the animal's mood or its affect, or whether it's having.
[06:48] B: A good or a bad day, its.
[06:51] A: Level of esteem, or its sense of self worth.
[06:54] B: It actually causes them to motivate the animal to do something, get something to.
[07:01] A: Stop, or solve a problem. It's that basic and simple. So when the rabbit sees the fox approach, the brain of the rabbit immediately makes rabbit experience fear.
[07:16] B: Not because it wants rabbit to have a bad day, but instead to motivate rabbit to run really fast away.
[07:24] A: When.
[07:25] B: The squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire.
[07:27] A: The brain of the squirrel immediately makes the squirrel experience pain, but not because.
[07:34] B: It wants the squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid dumb moron because it was careless and got too close to the flames. No, no, no. Just to get the tail out of the fire.
[07:45] A: So this may sound crazy, but all.
[07:48] B: The negative emotions that we experience, the hurt, the anger, the sadness, the sorrow, the grief, the angst, the upsets, the worries, the pains, they're all being caused by the part of our brain that works like an animal and for the same purpose. To motivate us to do something, get something to stop, or solve a problem. Here's where the error comes in for us human beings, Many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to. To solve a problem that we can't solve. Which is why, if you notice, we as human beings have a tendency to feel bad about the same kinds of things over and over and over again. Good news, right?
[08:44] A: Really good news.
[08:45] B: Many of the things that we feel bad about are in time periods that are already finished. So we don't need to actually solve the problem. What we want to do is update the timing. Timing is the malfunction that happens in our human brain. And here's why.
[09:07] A: We, as human beings have an additional.
[09:09] B: Component to our brain that an animal is missing. That being our intellectual and with our intellect.
[09:17] A: Our intellect gives us access to the concept of time. No animals have access to time.
[09:27] B: All animals are always now.
[09:33] A: Which is why the dog is as excited to see you if you've been gone for five minutes or if you've been gone for five hours. That makes sense, right? They're always perpetually.
[09:46] B: Now, that issue doesn't become a problem for us human beings when the experiences are positive. Or neutral. Because when they're positive or neutral, our brain distinguishes the difference between the memory.
[10:05] A: Data, information about it, the experience of it. So let's say somebody's telling us about a great trip that they had a year ago. They got to go to the Florida Keys, and when they were down there, they went out deep sea fishing and they saw a Florida marlin. They wound up going on Duval street and they got a cool T shirt.
[10:35] B: They took their picture next to a sign that said 90 miles from Cuba. They went out and snorkeled and saw.
[10:41] A: All sorts of cool fish. And when they tell us about this.
[10:44] B: Neat experience, you and I both know that they know the difference between remembering being there and actually being there. It's like crystal clear. The problem is when experiences are negative. And it doesn't matter whether the negative experience happened a long time ago when they were a young child or just the other day. And it doesn't matter whether the negative experience happened one time or multitudes of times. And it doesn't even matter whether it was a big, awful, negative experience or little any of those negative experiences. The weird, the bad, the shocking, the sad, the awful, the upsetting, the disgusting, the scary, the horrific, the catastrophic, the traumatic. Our brain will confuse the data, the memory, and the info about what happened. Thinking is happening and cause an emotional reaction. So think of again a different example. But this guy is telling us about being mugged 11 years ago when he was in Chicago. And he gets to the part where the guy has now got the gun pointed at the side of his head, and all of a sudden his face is all contorted, his voice is choked up, his arms are trembling and shaking, and he's got a tear streaming down his cheek. Now, Rachel, you and I were nice people. We were kindly listening to him. What the hell is happening with him?
[12:28] A: Him?
[12:30] B: Do you know what? Most people say he's reliving it. Yeah. But what's actually happening is that a different part of his brain, a more emotional part, is confusing the memory and the data about what happened, thinking it's.
[12:52] A: Happening, causing him to have that emotional reaction make sense. And we notice that it's affecting him as he's talking to us because we can see it. But it was also affecting him over the weekend when he was playing catch with his son in the front yard. Logically, this guy knows that he's safe, that he survived, that it's over, that there's no gun, that he's okay. The problem is that there's another part of his brain that hasn't fully updated.
[13:39] B: Does that make sense? That's the first thing that keeps the prior stuff stuck. And with prior stuff stuck, it makes me more susceptible to present and future stuff.
[13:58] A: Think about a wolf who goes hunting for rabbits, and this wolf happens to step in a hole and hurts her paw. Now that the wolf is aware of.
[14:13] B: Holes, the wolf, being outwardly focused and present, is less likely to step in another hole. Hunter goes out hunting, steps in the same hole that the wolf did. Hunter's pissed, first at the jerk who.
[14:35] A: Put the hole there, second at herself.
[14:39] B: Remembering all the other times that she did stupid, dumb stuff and how Ann Hunter, being preoccupied, is more likely to step in another hole. Follow me. So we definitely want the wisdom like the wolf gets, but we want present.
[15:04] A: So the first thing that keeps it stuck is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening got glued together.
[15:15] B: And they're living as if they're the same thing. Logically, a person can know its data and memory, but the emotional brain is still reading it as happening. Second thing. And that makes sense. Yes.
[15:37] A: Yeah.
[15:38] B: Second thing that keeps all of this stuff stuck and churning is one of.
[15:45] A: The messages that we get when we're little children. I mean, we're lied to, unfortunately, by the adults around us, but it's part of our culture. Little kids are told lies. They're told the biggest lie, which is life is good, which then reinforces that if I'm a good boy or if.
[16:01] B: I'm a good girl, my life will be good. And reinforces that then I get to live happily ever after, which is great if life is always good for people. But I've never met a single person that's gone through life unscarred. I've never met anybody that's been able to make it through the whole existence and have never had a bad thing happen. Right? And again, that's not the big problem isn't that we told kids that life is good and if they're good, life will be good and they get to live happily ever after. It's that the reverse also has to be true. Because if good things happen when I'm.
[16:47] A: Good, then bad things must only happen.
[16:52] B: When I'm bad, which is also not true. You know, that bad things can happen to good people without them doing anything wrong.
[17:06] A: But the problem is, what we learned first still sticks. So what keeps this thing even more active in somebody is the meaning that.
[17:18] B: Somehow it had to do with me, right?
[17:21] A: So I had a woman one time who left work.
[17:26] B: She left work. She was in A very nice, affluent neighborhood where she worked. And she. It was 4:00 in the afternoon, so it was still light outside. And she had walked towards her car. Yes. She happened to text her daughter because her daughter had asked when she's coming home. And she just replied, now put her.
[17:50] A: Phone back in her pocket, went to open up her driver's door, and two men who were in a van next to her jump out, grabbed her, threw her in the back of the van.
[17:59] B: Drove to a secluded area and be raped. Now that is a freaking horrific experience. But if you can imagine what's worse is what she's telling me. Because this is the thing that she said, Rachel, she said, you know what? I am never, ever going to forget myself for that. And I went, for what? And she said, well, clearly being stupid, careless, reckless, not paying attention, putting myself in danger, I went, what? He walked across a parking lot in a nice neighborhood. What the. But you can see that because it.
[18:36] A: Was a bad experience, immediately what gets put in is my fault. Does that make sense? Right? Somehow it had to do with me, even though we know that it didn't have anything to do with her doing anything wrong. So the second thing that keeps it stuck is the meanings that get attached are going to make me feel worse about me. Like somehow there's something wrong with me. So let's say this kid who's not very athletic doesn't get picked for kickball. Now the kid is thinking, well, I didn't get picked for kickball because nobody likes me. No, it had more to do with that. The kids who are picking sides wanted to win, and they knew that you weren't very good at the game. That's why you didn't get picked. But again, because somehow it means something about me. I'm not good enough. I'm not smart enough, I'm not pretty enough, I'm not tall enough, I didn't do the right thing. All of those messages get installed and stuck. Does that make sense? And once these two things are stuck in place, and that's why a lot of times what I know, I can't fully feel. So let's say this guy is 45 and what happened to him happened to him when he was 5. Yucky stuff that happened with his uncle. Now at 45, he's done therapy. He's eloquent, he's a smart guy. He recognizes and realizes at a logical level that what happened with his uncle wasn't his fault, that he didn't do anything wrong. He knows that. He realizes that Even some of what uncle did to him felt good. Not because he wanted it, not because he's gay, but because body parts touched in certain ways are designed to feel good. He's even done the intellectual work of forgiving uncle for what uncle did to him. Why inside, though, does he still feel all the guilt, the hurt, the shame, the pain? Wouldn't we think that once he got it, he'd get it? But unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. Because once that second thing is stuck, of course what's there is somehow it had to do with me. That's why what I know where I'm logical, can't get into where I feel.
[21:29] B: It, because that part stuck there.
[21:35] A: Follow me with that. And then once those two things get.
[21:41] B: Stuck in that way, our brain, really, for our survival, is more hypersensitive, hyper vigilant, and super reactive to anything that might have even the smallest similarity to anything that was painful.
[22:04] A: The problem is that similar gets merged and confused as same, right? So the dramatic example is the soldier who dives on the ground when the firework bursts in the air.
[22:18] B: But not because he didn't know he was at a fourth of July party. Heck, he's the guy that lit the firework. It's because at a completely different level.
[22:31] A: An emotional part of his brain confused the sound and thought it was grenade.
[22:40] B: Right? Or the guy who's filling his car with gas and he gets the whiff of the diesel smell.
[22:50] A: And now he flashes back to being next to the tank where his buddy's.
[22:55] B: Arm got shut off.
[22:59] A: Now we know that the issue for.
[23:01] B: Him back then was not the diesel smell. That isn't the part that bothered him about the experience. What bothered him was what happened to his buddy.
[23:13] A: But because it co occurred, it got merged as if it's part of the problem. Does that make sense? So that's why different tones of voice.
[23:25] B: Sounds, facial expressions, times of day, dates can be triggers for people.
[23:36] A: Because when my brain is in that hypersensitive, super vigilant, always scanning, it will confuse similar and map it as same. I had a woman one time, and.
[23:53] B: I may have shared this with you. She had an aversion to those innocent.
[23:58] A: Cookies, those Nilla wafers.
[24:01] B: She was distraught that her best friend could put them in banana pudding and.
[24:07] A: Bring them over for a dessert for.
[24:10] B: A party that she was having.
[24:11] A: How could she now come to find out? When she was 9 years old, mom and dad sat her and her brother.
[24:19] B: Down to tell them that they were divorcing. And as they told her that she happened to be eating a Nilla wafer. Now, logically, we know that Nilla wafers don't cause divorce.
[24:39] A: But because it co.
[24:40] B: Occurred, it got merged.
[24:42] A: Does that make sense?
[24:46] B: So all three of these components all.
[24:51] A: Have one thing in common. It's distortion. Because if I take my hand and.
[24:58] B: I slam it into the sand and.
[24:59] A: I pick it up, it does leave an imprint. But is the imprint the same thing as my hand?
[25:10] B: No.
[25:12] A: Is the meaning at all? What happened? Was she careless in putting herself in danger? Did she simply walk to her car? Right. And how different is a grenade from a firework? They're really different things. So instead of where therapy, I think missed when it comes to trauma is.
[25:37] B: That they thought that people repressed and buried, and our job is to help them dig out those bad feelings.
[25:46] A: What if people don't have bad feelings trapped inside of them? What if it's actually the reverse? It's about getting the good news in.
[25:58] B: To the part of the brain that doesn't know the negative experience stopped.
[26:05] A: Because the. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? Because the error that's running in most of us is that error that the brain doesn't know the difference between the memory of what happened in the experience of it happening. They're being read as if it's the same thing. So think of that. When we go through troubling moments, that moment gets disintegrated from the rest of the nervous system. So it's separate. But at that level, it's always on. Even though I know that the experience is over, there's a part of my brain that doesn't know. And that part is the part that preconsciously runs all of my emotions and is the thing that I get, you know, that triggers stuff in me. So that's why we want to change it at that deeper level. Any questions? Because I know I covered a whole bunch of stuff in a really short period of time. Any questions about what I've talked about so far? Is there anything that I can elaborate or clarify for you? It makes sense. Cool. Yeah. So then the next thing is, in order to make effective change, we first need to know how we want you to be. In the same way, if I were to say to you, rachel, go ahead and get in your car and start driving, and in three hours, I'm going to tell you where to go. You look at me and go, well, that's stupid. Why would I get in my car? Right. I could drive completely in the wrong direction. Right. So we first need to know how we want you to be, because that also gives directions to that other than conscious, more emotional brain. So we know how we want you to be when we're done. So I noticed, even when you were telling me about the more recent thing and just about other stuff, that there were different emotions that you were experiencing as you expressed yourself. So I bet right now you can think about whatever you need to think about and feel just a little bit of the bad feelings. Notice how it doesn't take long to get there and see, that is interesting because you did it on purpose because I asked you to, which wouldn't be a problem if it only happened when you decided to do it. The problem is that your brain has been doing it to you at times that you're not choosing. That's the glitch. That's the error. So the you that I'm seeing, that kind of feeling, the you that I'm seeing, she remembers having had it. But if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't even know how to get it. It's like, completely clear. It's gone. The you that I'm seeing is emotionally present. She's connecting to what is happening without the emotional effect of what has. She's wise so that she's still aware, but she's doing it with a more of a distanced lens. The you that I'm seeing is free from the emotional effect of the past and is more and more connecting to what is. The you that I am seeing is much more at peace and comfortable in her own skin. She is a lot lighter. This is the you that I am seeing. So my question for you, Rachel, isn't how it's going to happen that we get you here. My question is, would it be okay? Yeah. Is there any downside or anything that you might want to add to.
[31:09] B: That.
[31:09] A: Would make it even better? Yeah. Would that actually be useful? Yeah. Well, I'm not. The you that I'm seeing sees it clearly for what it is. And she's got flexibility in her maneuverability with it. Got it. Because, yeah, that's what we want. We want flexibility with your maneuverability and that you're seeing it clearly for what it is. And then you're free to do what is in your best interest in that moment based on the situation and context that you're in right now. Give you a silly example, but I had a woman one time who wanted to be free to speak her mind wherever she was. And I said, oh, geez, no, that's probably not a good idea. She goes, why? I Go. Well, you know, if you're free to speak your mind wherever you want to be. Like, sometimes you might say stuff in situations that probably aren't good to have stuff said. Right. What we want truly, is the freedom to be able to do it, but the knowledge of where and when, it makes sense to follow me with that. Right. So the you that I'm seeing sees.
[32:56] B: It clearly, but also has the freedom and the wherewithal to do what makes sense based on the situation and context that she's in. Yeah.
[33:10] A: Oh, definitely.
[33:10] B: I'm seeing the you empowered for sure.
[33:15] A: Because the you that I'm seeing is fully directive in how she's wanting life to go. So say that part again.
[33:39] B: The.
[33:40] A: Because I. Yeah, go ahead.
[33:53] B: Mm.
[34:02] A: Right. So think of what happens with that.
[34:05] B: Emotional brain, is that emotional brain doesn't work with logic, but it works with patterns of association. And that's what they did.
[34:19] A: So just like in a Pavlovian sense.
[34:23] B: I don't know if you've ever heard of Pavlov and his dog. You know, he would ring a bell and bring food and then ring a bell and bring food because he was pairing. The sound of the bell means food to the dog. And then he no longer. But he rang the bell and it caused the same salivation response in the dog. Right. What you're telling me is that some of the stuff that happened with you was programmed in a similar way. Yes. So because the brain works with patterns of association, we can disable that process.
[35:14] A: When the brain recognizes, realizes that certain.
[35:18] B: Experiences are over, it can't go back.
[35:22] A: To thinking they're happening.
[35:24] B: And by being able to see them clearly, we're seeing them clearly because we've got distance from them to see. You're so good.
[35:39] A: Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. So that's where the you that I'm seeing, she's present.
[35:46] B: She's clear, she's free. She's directive. As she's seeing things clearly for what.
[35:55] A: They are, she's responding in a way that's best for her, which requires variability because it may be different based on different circumstances. But what's guiding you from the inside.
[36:09] B: Is that higher wisdom to do what's in your best interest naturally and automatically. The you that I'm seeing is free from the effect that the past stuff has had. She's much more at ease and comfortable.
[36:27] A: In her own skin. And again, the question isn't how it's going to happen. It's would it be okay? So would it be okay?
[36:45] B: Yeah.
[36:46] A: Yeah. And with it, okay, we now have A green light.
[36:51] B: So your brain has already begun to.
[36:53] A: Organize towards the future. You. One of the things that our brain.
[37:01] B: Can be powerfully responsive to are also symbols, right? Advertisers use symbols. It's why when you see a big yellow arch on the side of the road, you think of McDonald's. When you see a little swooshmark on somebody's shoot, you think of Mike. But what does this smoosh mark? What the golden arch have to do with sneakers, cheese clippers, anything? No, we don't symbols for the car. So we symbolize you that's free and at peace, who's clear and light and present, who's seeing things for what they are. Has the unique rebuild flexibility in how she handles her. If we think of you in this way and symbolize it as a violin, something out of nature, once that comes to mind, Symbolizing you, who's clear, present, free, light. Oh, no, there's no terror. Not really, no. Because even if you don't have one, that's okay, because it's not a requirement. Yeah, it's not a requirement at all. It's just something that can be an active to get your brain because again, you want your brain to be more responsive and naturally work more in the way you want it to. That's where we're headed, right? So we know that as we move our body more and more into states of rest, that's when accelerated healing happens. It's why when somebody's got a cold or a flu or after surgery, what are you telling them to do? Why? Because that enables the body to do more internal healing. So we have some really cool, silly, neuroscientifically proven brain levers that are designed to get your body into the state of rest. And the first level is really the silliest. It's about slightly lowering your joint. Now, I don't mean completely dropping it wide open like, ah. I mean just a tiny little bit, maybe the width of an index. You slightly lower your jaw. When you slightly lower your jaw, what that does is it activates an error called a veil, which pretty much meanders and wanders through maintaining. So you're going to slightly lower the jaw. Second lever is you're going to rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. So, like, the tip of the tongue can touch against the back of the body. So you slightly lower your jaw and then you rest your tongue. The third lever is you begin to breathe. But how you breathe, Rachel, is in a way that's just a little bit slower and a Little bit deeper than how you might automatically breathe. So go ahead and slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. And now you need to breathe in a way that's just a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you may want to. And as you breathe in this way.
[41:20] A: That'S just a little bit slower and deeper. Check inside.
[41:26] B: How's your body feeling now? Like more tense or more calm? Yeah. Right, so we're on our way. The next lever is also a silly lever, but it's a really interesting one. So I'm going to give you a little bit of background on this so it makes more sense.
[41:52] A: Our brain has different brainwaves in it. I don't know if you've ever heard of that before, but there's beta brainwaves, there's alpha brainwaves, there's theta brain waves, there's delta brain waves, and then there's gamma brainwaves.
[42:08] B: And different bands of information exist at different brain wave states. So we don't access the same information based on the brainwave state in which we're in. So beta waves are the waves that were in for most waking states states.
[42:32] A: So they're really good for focus, concentration, communication, they're really good for conversation and.
[42:42] B: Good for activities like arithmetic.
[42:45] A: And that's beta waves. But when beta waves get elevated, meaning they run at a much higher hertz.
[42:52] B: That'S where all anxiety, agitation, angst, upset, worry, concern, that's where it all lives. The next brainwave state below beta is called alpha.
[43:07] A: Alpha waves are highly correlated with things like what athletes call being in the.
[43:12] B: Zone or what a surfer might call a flow state.
[43:18] A: It's about being alert but relaxed at the same time. It's about having a more expanded awareness.
[43:31] B: Because when we get really stressed and anxious and the beta runs at higher hertz, it narrows our field of vision.
[43:39] A: And we become more tunneled vision. Does that make sense? So we want to have a process.
[43:47] B: That enables us to expand our awareness out towards our peripheral vision.
[43:54] A: So how this one works is you're going to once again, slightly lower your jaw.
[44:01] B: You're going to rest your tongue at.
[44:03] A: The bottom of your mouth.
[44:05] B: You're going to begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. And then I want you to pick a spot on the other side of the room. Maybe it's a light switch or a lamp or a picture or painting. Just focus your awareness in towards that object on the other side of the room. And as you laser your focus in on that object, notice what happens when you allow your awareness to expand out to your peripheral vision. That not only do you see the object right in front of you, but with your peripheral vision, maybe you begin to notice the sides of the room. With your peripheral vision, you can notice the space that's in between you and that object. With your peripheral vision, you can notice the space that's above the object. You can even get a sense of the space that's behind you. And as you're noticing more of the space, check inside once again. How's your body feeling now?
[45:42] A: Yeah. Again, more tense, more calm. Yeah. And then the last lever is also kind of an interesting one.
[45:56] B: Have you ever heard somebody say, or maybe even said it yourself, I'm under a lot of stress. Now, in order for somebody to be underneath stress, where must the stress be?
[46:19] A: Yes.
[46:21] B: So we know that by getting out.
[46:25] A: From under it and rising up above.
[46:28] B: It, we can begin to experience it.
[46:33] A: As underneath and below us. So kind of like the other metaphor.
[46:39] B: Have you ever heard somebody say, I'm having a bird's eye view? Which, of course means a view from above, seeing things underneath and below you. But not just a perched bird. A bird that's able to fly and soar and glide and move freely through.
[47:04] A: The space, through the sky, up above.
[47:07] B: And over it all. So what you'll do once again is you'll slightly lower your jaw, and if you don't already, you can put both feet on the floor, slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, beginning to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower, a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe, so that your exhale can become just a little bit longer than your inhale. As you're breathing in this, look across and see an object on the other side of the room. As you focus in on this object, notice what happens when your awareness expands to your peripheral vision and you notice more of the space that's in between you and the object, the space towards the. The side walls on your right and on your left, the space that's underneath where you're seated, the space that's behind you, and the space that's up above. Noticing that you're more aware of the space and how this space isn't just contained in the room, but it goes well beyond the room, really all the way out in all ways and in all directions. And now, just for a moment, close your eyes and imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body, well beyond the ceiling.
[49:00] A: Well beyond the roof, so that you're.
[49:02] B: Way up above it all in the sky, having a bird's eye view, Seeing.
[49:09] A: Things underneath and below you with distance.
[49:14] B: Being able to soar like a bird and fly like a bird. Free to move through the space horizon out in all directions. Big, wide turns and curves, arching angles. Soaring, flying, moving free.
[49:34] A: Bring your awareness back down and into your body.
[49:38] B: Re associating inside you. When you're ready, take a slow and deep breath in.
[49:49] A: And then exhale and open your eyes.
[50:00] B: In those few short moments that you had your eyes closed, what did you notice within yourself? You're having fun.
[50:11] A: Yay.
[50:12] B: You like having fun. Yeah.
[50:22] A: Yeah.
[50:24] B: And how's your body feeling now? Yeah. And so, as your body's feeling calm and relaxed, that other part of your mind is going to begin to scan back through experiences, negative experiences that left impressions recent or long time ago.
[50:53] A: And it's going to begin to group.
[50:55] B: And categorize different experiences. And then it's going to narrow back, pinpoint, and select a particular experience which.
[51:10] A: May be the worst or the worst or may not be the worst of the worst. Because what we're having your unconscious do now, that, other than conscious part of your brain, is travel back through that timeline, through the Warehouse, in your own personal history of experiences. And that part of your brain will pinpoint and select a particular experience that.
[51:39] B: Would be useful for us to clear.
[51:45] A: What experience comes to mind now. Yes. Good. Now, how we clear something, I'm going.
[51:59] B: To explain it to you.
[52:01] A: So first, as you think about that.
[52:03] B: Experience, the feelings are feelings of.
[52:05] A: What is it?
[52:07] B: Anger, hurt, sadness, grief, guilt, angst, upset, worry, pain. What's the feeling?
[52:11] A: Feelings that show up with that combination. Okay, so first question, Rachel, is would it be okay to get the hurt going? Yes. So if you were no longer hurting.
[52:26] B: Over that, that would be okay?
[52:30] A: Yeah. Cool. Okay. So second, how we clear something is really, really simple. One, you're going to intend, as I.
[52:40] B: Said earlier, to be emotionally with me. And the reason that you want to.
[52:45] A: Be emotionally with me here now is that this is what's happening and that isn't. Two, we're working on a mutual and worthwhile goal that we're both interested in and wanting to get to.
[52:58] B: And three, I'm way more fun than sucking on, so I want you with me. Second, you're going to tell me just the facts, meaning just what happened. And it'll be in a minute or less, so it'll go, that happened, that happened, that happened. That happened. That happened. That happened. That happened. Aha. Uh huh. Yep. So I'm going to give you the example when clearing and when the brain learns.
[53:43] A: The brain learns best by doing one at a time. And then the brain is able to extrapolate and generalize on its own. So for example, when we learn to tie sneakers, we typically learn on one pair.
[54:00] B: And then your brain generalizes to all of the other things that have releases.
[54:05] A: When you learn how to ride a bicycle, it's typically on a bike, but that means you can ride other bicycles or really anything with two wheels. And most of us don't have the same car that we learned how to drive on. So yes, we want to narrow down to a particular time that's got a.
[54:27] B: Beginning, middle, end to it.
[54:31] A: Make sense? So you're going to intend to be with me as you tell me just the what happened, just facts in about a minute or less.
[54:40] B: So it goes.
[54:41] A: That happened, that happened.
[54:42] B: That happened.
[54:42] A: That happened. 3. If that happened when you were younger, there have been many things in your life that you've done after that experience that for you was way more enjoyable than that experience, don't you think? What's one thing anytime from when that happened until heck, yesterday that was more enjoyable than that moment going to the Christmas store. Right, Good. Something else that you've done anytime from when that was over until, you know, just the other day. Well, I don't know whether it is. I mean, you had your kids, that was more fun, wasn't it? Well, no.
[55:41] B: That'S right.
[55:43] A: Although sometimes having them might have been more fun than even though that wasn't so enjoyable. Right, yeah, got it. One other thing that's happened after that particular experience that was, you know, better more enjoyable than that experience. Yeah. Awesome. So all of those experiences happen after the yucky one. Here's the thing. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond the yucky moment because that one got separated. No. Remember, disintegrated from the nervous system. So we have good news to get in. Questions making sense. Cool. So you're going to tell me the what happened in about a minute or less. So when that particular experience happened, when it happened, you might have been where and you might have been how old. First of all, let's kind of get a guesstimate time age range. So you might have been 10 years old and you might have been where? So you would have been at school, would have been morning or afternoon. Huh. And you're in a classroom or in a Hallway or outside of school? Yes. So you were told that you're going to get a ride to go play with the high school team. Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next? Yes. Right. So you got in the car and you thought you were going to where, the high school. And then, like, you got driven to this house in the country, and that was weird.
[58:04] B: Right.
[58:04] A: And then what happened next? Mm. Right. So you got out of the car, went into the house. Right. And that was weird. Right. And then what happened next? Yes. Like a kitchen table. What color? Round table. Good job, Good detail. Right. And then what happened next? And be here. Hi. Notice how you were going there. Hi. Be here. Hi. With me. Hi. Hi. Rachel, get back with me. I'm more fun. Good job. Right? There you go. Now you're coming back with me. Hi. Right, so at the round table.
[58:45] B: Right.
[58:46] A: Good. And then what happened next? Right. So, like, they said whatever they said to you, and you said whatever you said. Right. Good. Then what happened next? Right. So they might have touched your body, may have touched your chest, might have touched your legs, might have touched between your legs. And some of that was weird. Some of it might have felt good, but. Well, weird. Right. Then what might have happened next? Right, Right. Good. And they did that thing, and then you got back in the car with him, and then he drove you, drove you back to school, and then that moment ended. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to the Christmas store or do something with your kids or shout hoops, play basketball. Now, notice, as you were telling me about what happened, there was some discomfort. Less because you were intending to be with me, but you notice that there was discomfort. Yes. And the discomfort wasn't there because that was a yucky moment. The discomfort was there because part of your brain is confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience. It's actually causing the discomfort, trying to motivate you to get that moment to stop. Good news. It has. So here's the crazy thing, Rachel. We never go backwards with a memory, but when you go backwards with a memory, it literally unplugs the memory. It takes away the charge. So we want to go in reverse. So we've got, you know, going to the Christmas store. We got doing something with the kids. We got playing basketball. And then you'd gotten out of the car at school, and then he drove you back to school, and then you got in the car, and then you left that house, and then there was each of the guys that might have touched your body in different ways. Then you'd gone into the house and then he had driven you there, and then you'd gotten in the car, and then you were told that you were going to go practice at the varsity. Then before that you were at gym, and then before that you were doing whatever you're doing. And as I went backwards in comparison to you telling it to me, forward, emotionally, how was it? Yeah, but emotionally, was it same? More or less. Was it the same emotion? More or less. I know, isn't that weird? It's less because your brain is beginning to get that it's data about something that happened versus happening. Third, that emotional brain remember doesn't work with logic, but instead it works with patterns of association. The memory of what happened and the experience of it happening have been glued together. So they're living as if they're the same thing. But there are things that you know that you're not doing. Like even today that you can remember having done. For example, getting dressed. You can remember doing that, Right. And when you got dressed, you put on what today, like a pair of pants. A pair of pants and shirt. Right. And you can remember where you were when you put on your shirt. Right. So if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your shirt on, then I went, hey, Rachel, stop putting on your shirt. You'd say back to me, but I'm not putting on my shirt. Because you know, there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually doing it. They're not the same thing. Right? Right. And I also put a shirt on today. So if I said to you, rachel, stop me from putting on my shirt. You'd say back to me, but you're not putting on your shirt. Because again, there's a difference between the memory of it and it. So we want to play the pattern of association game so that your brain can read it as data about something that happened versus happening. Make sense. So you can remember getting driven there and having to go to each one of those guys and them saying what they said, you saying what you said, and they touching your body in different ways. You can remember all that happening, Right. You can remember earlier today putting your shirt on. Rachel, stop putting on your shirt. Say, I'm not putting on my shirt. Will stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then you stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants. Say that. Well, stop me from. Right, Stop me from putting on my pants. Say you're not putting on your pants. Well, then stop him from driving you there. Say, he's not driving me there. Well, then stop putting on your shirt. Say, I'm not putting on my shirt. Well, stop me from putting on my watch. Say you're not putting on your watch. Well, then stop them from doing that. Say they're not doing that. No, say it like you mean it, because are they right now doing that? No, you're with me. Hi. Right. You know who doesn't know that the earlier you who were really doing a reconnaissance mission for, like, she's stuck in the jungle. She doesn't know that the war is over. We have good news to get into that younger you, don't we? That that moment over, finished, completed. That that experience, that one no longer exists. We're on our way to getting more, but we want to do one, so just stick with this one. You can remember that happening and then doing all that, Right? You can remember putting your shirt on today. Rachel, stop putting on your shirt. Say, I'm not putting on my shirt. Stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt. We'll stop those men from doing that. Say they're not doing that. We'll stop him from driving you there. Say, he's not driving me there. We'll stop getting in the car. Say I'm not getting in the car. Well, stop it from happening. Say it's not happening. Say it's not happening. No, that's not how you say it. We got to be a really. I'm hearing it, Jeff. I'm not not hearing it. I appreciate that. Yeah. Rachel, get back here with me. Hi. Hi. Get back here. Hi. Right. Slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Feel your feet on the floor. Notice that you can control your breathing, that you can make your breathing intentionally happen a little bit slower and a little bit deeper. That we're on our way to be getting really good news in. Right. What's happening now? You're getting back to being more present. Right? Right. We want to get the good news in. We know that we've got lots more to do. But here's the cool part. Do you know what the hardest piece of anything in any kind of change? Do you want to know? It was what Einstein said. Objects at rest stay at rest. Objects in motion stay at motion. And the hardest change is to take something that's at rest and put it in motion. So although this particular moment isn't the worst of the worst of the worst, it is what starts it moving. See, all of you, you Rachel, your body wants this healing to happen. There's not any part of you that's not wanting this change for you, wanting you to be free, present, clear. And so there's the Rachel that knows that moment's over, and then there's a lot earlier, younger you that doesn't know. And there are going to be moments that as we clear them, you weren't sure you were even going to make it through it, survive and be okay. But we know that you're here and you have. And we want to get that good news in that you're on your way to becoming even better, even more free. You're beginning to lighten up, right? What's happening now? You are. How's your body feeling as you're more calm? It is, right? And you can remember that happening that particular time when you can remember earlier today putting your shirt on. What color? Black. Stop putting on your black shirt. Say, I am not putting on my black shirt. Well, stop me from putting on my black shirt. Who knew that I would be wearing a black shirt, too? Say you're not putting on your black shirt. Well, then stop me from putting on my sneakers. Say you're not putting on your sneakers. Well, then you stop putting on your pants. Say, I am not putting on my pants. Well, then stop him from driving you there. That he's not driving me there. Well, stop that from happening. Say it's not happening. Yes. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in to the part of your brain that doesn't know. And is that starting to happen now? Check. What do you notice? How's your body feeling now? A little bit scared. Oh. What's scary about knowing that it's over? That part. Oh, well, let's check. We don't really deal in shoulds or shouldn'ts. We don't. You are right. Because you're getting here. You can remember that happening and then doing that. Them touching your body. You can remember that happening. Did you know, by the way, that there's no aspect of your body right now that's the same as it was then? It's all been replaced. You know how I know that? Not just that, but neuroscience has actually done an experiment and they discovered that if you and I were to come back one year from today and have this conversation 99.9999, meaning almost all of the subatomic particles that make us up, we wouldn't be here now. They don't all leave at once. That's like Star Trek. But all we are is always changing and we're going to do more. Because that stuff may have happened to your body, but what isn't fully gotten yet is that they never got you who you really are. And we're going to do a lot to get that solidified in you. They may have messed with your stuff, but they didn't get you. Right? So you can remember them doing that, having those conversations, them touching your body. You can remember putting your black shirt on. Rachel, stop putting on your black shirt. Say, I am not putting on my black shirt. Well, stop them from doing that. See, they're not doing that. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. That's right. Which is what we want to be getting in. Right. And we want to let that, you know, let her know that it's over, finished, that that experience no longer exists. Let her know about having her kids and playing basketball and going to the Christmas store so that the earlier you gets it, that she's okay. And she's gonna be okay. Because you now are way more than okay. Even if there's been some things that still linger, we're on our way to being even better. Free, clear and empowered to make a difference for others. I mean, that's why you went and spoke, isn't it? Yeah, to make a difference for others. Because you're strong, clearly resilient, don't you think? I don't know if you're still standing or you might be sitting now, but like, I mean, clearly to be and have gone through and deal with what you've been dealing with, if that isn't resiliency, I don't know what is, you know? So take a deep breath in and a long exhale and another deep breath in and another long exhale and then one more deep breath in. And then this time, as you exhale, slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue, continuing to breathe in this slightly slower and deeper way, notice that you can allow your awareness to expand and sense more of the space that's all around you. The space in front of you into either side, the space behind you, the space underneath, and the space up above. And as you're connecting to more of the space again, check inside. How's your body feeling now? It does. And as you're thinking back about that one time happening, then what do you notice now? Yeah, notice how it's already less. Right. Your brain is updating.
[76:15] B: The emotions are only there to try to motivate you, to get the moment to stop. That's right. So you can remember that moment happening.
[76:35] A: And you can remember putting your pants on today. Rachel, stop putting on your pants. Say, I am not putting on my pants. Well, then stop it from happening.
[76:46] B: Say it's not happening.
[76:49] A: Yeah, so then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in now.
[76:57] B: The last little piece to this one. And we're going to do more and more and more of this, you know, the adult, rational, logical, you know, that.
[77:05] A: That happening had nothing to do with. Had everything to do with them and whatever off in them.
[77:21] B: But notice how it doesn't fully feel that way.
[77:25] A: Notice how there's some of it like, I should have known better.
[77:28] B: Shouldn't have gotten in the car. Be here. What'd you just do? You went somewhere.
[77:38] A: Hi. No, be here.
[77:39] B: Hi. Where'd you go? Get back with me.
[77:45] A: Hi.
[77:49] B: Right.
[77:50] A: Lots of times, things. Here's the way that you solve that part, right. If you had known that that's what it was going to lead to, would you have gotten in the car?
[78:02] B: Right. But you didn't know that then, did you? Right.
[78:07] A: Right.
[78:08] B: You didn't know. And again, that thing happening was about what's off over there.
[78:20] A: All right? Think of the kid who comes home. Go ahead, please.
[78:33] B: Well, see, I don't know whether that's fully true then. You might have known that he's not.
[78:40] A: A great guy, but you couldn't have known that it was gonna lead to.
[78:45] B: What it led to. Not then, not like now. You're 10.
[78:50] A: You don't have access to all that. You couldn't have known that that's what.
[79:00] B: Was going to happen.
[79:01] A: You may have not liked getting in the car, but that would have been an uncomfortable ride to the place where.
[79:07] B: The varsity team's playing.
[79:10] A: Right.
[79:14] B: Which I gladly would have taken the.
[79:15] A: Ride, even though it was uncomfortable with that guy, to where the varsity team was playing. Because I wanted to play.
[79:22] B: Right? Yeah, right. That you didn't know what that was.
[79:30] A: Gonna lead to.
[79:33] B: Or any of the subsequent stuff. She didn't know. And it happening wasn't about you, it was about what screwed up in them. See, if the dad. If the kid comes home with two Ds and two Fs, right? Mom is upset.
[79:50] A: And mom says, you wait until your father comes home.
[79:54] B: And dad is even more upset than Mom.
[79:57] A: And when dad comes home, dad takes.
[79:59] B: The belt off and starts whipping the kid with the belt.
[80:03] A: Right? Now the kid is totally thinking, I'm getting hit because I got poor grades.
[80:10] B: But is he? You're a parent, isn't there more than one way to handle that race other than meeting the kid with a doll? So did it have to do with the kid or did it have to do with whatever was off bad? Right. Right. And if the kid is like 12, 13, carrying a tray filled with food in the cafeteria, maybe it's got milk and maybe some tomato soup or grilled cheese and the kid happens to trip and fall and now the soup splatters everywhere. Right. The cafeteria was once really loud with a lot of noise. Now they're all because they heard that big sound. They all turn, they all look and they start laughing at the kid. Making fun of the kid, calling the kid a loser, a moron when he can't walk. Whatever.
[81:11] A: They're all laughing.
[81:12] B: The kid wants hearing powers, invisibility. Put it on me and put that on you. Right. He's totally feeling like they're laughing at me. Which they are. Right. But here's the thing. Isn't it would it matter whether is that kid or any other kid in the school having the same accident? Isn't that what they would have done? Right. So did it have to do with the kid or did it have to do with what happened then? That's right. So it wouldn't have mattered whether it was you or any other girl with that same stuff at that same time as they went down. Make sense? But see that younger Dean doesn't fully know that yet. So we want to get that new skin. So an involvement Mark I have is. You're going to close your eyes. You're going to picture that really repeated. You're going to let her know that that moment is overfinch completely feel that it no longer exists. You're going to let her know that you're okay. You're going to let her know that that happened is nothing to do with you or anything to do with what it happened. Then you're going to let her tore and go to the Christmas store. You're going to let her know so that she gets it that you're okay. So go ahead and close your eyes. Picture that younger you. Let the younger you know that that moment is over, finished, completely defeated at the moment. Let her know that that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what's off with them. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about her kids. Let her know about going to the Christmas store. Let her know so that she gets it. And as the younger you is getting it now, what do you know is happening to her face? Yeah, right. Was she looking scared at all?
[83:39] A: No. Isn't that weird?
[83:45] B: Notice, Rachel, how that's different than it's ever been? Isn't that interesting?
[83:56] A: It's different than it's ever been because your brain is reading it as data info. What's happening now? What are you noticing? Within you, which is also unusual for you to feel calm when you think about that.
