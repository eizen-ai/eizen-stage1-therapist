[00:01] A: Yeah. So today is the. Oh my goodness, 27th of January, Rachel. This is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. You know that. So let me kind of give you the menu because nobody told you about me and what it is that I do that's different than what's out there. So some people come in because they get it, that they're more on edge, they're more irritable, agitated, aggravated, maybe be quick and short tempered, maybe say or do things that later on they wish they hadn't said or done. They don't want to be reactive in that way. They want that toned down. Some people come in because they're more, what we'll call it, uneasy inside, tense, nervous, anxious. They get racy thoughts. Sometimes it affects sleep, sometimes it moves into full fledged panicky stuff. They don't want to be feeling like that. They want that to be better. Some people come in because they recognize that there's stuff that they've gone through, things that have happened in their life, maybe things they've done or things that have happened to them, some of them recent, some of them longer time ago, that even though they're over, they still kind of underneath the surface affect them. Meaning that they think about it at times that they don't want to, are reminded of it and there's still yuckiness attached. They want that going. Some people come in because we'll call it grief issues, seem to be stuck or frozen. Every time they think about the loved one, they feel awful. They don't want to feel like that. Some people are more down, depressed, they lack interest, energy, motivation to do things that they used to like, and they don't want to be feeling that way. Given that you're in Selah, I would be thinking that some of what we're wanting to do has to do with things that you've gone through. That would be just my guess because lots of people have had things that have happened. But see, my take on it is that we all have a bit of post traumatic stress in us.
[01:45] B: Yeah, I agree with that.
[01:46] A: Some more than others, some bigger than others. Some it affects in different ways, but I don't think even in general you can get born and go through the crap that human beings go through and not have a little bit of it. Right? So what's different again, so I get all that stuff better. What's different from what we do than talk therapy is talk therapy is about talking about what was problematic. So for example, therapists who do talk therapy Might say things like, well, let's get a good understanding of why you're feeling the way you do now and how those feelings might relate back to earlier, other stuff you've gone through that. If we got that understanding, then we could work on it, figure it out and change it. It doesn't work that way with emotions. Knowing why I feel the way I feel, knowing what my triggers are, knowing why I have them, never stops me from getting triggered by them.
[02:38] B: Right.
[02:39] A: So I do something different. My job is all about unplugging the effect that the troubling experiences have had. So the person is free, they're at peace, they're no longer haunted, they're not bothered by what's happened. And that's the other thing that therapists think, that people repress emotions. I don't know if you ever heard that before. People repress them, they bury them, they lock them behind closed door, they sweep the. And that the therapist's job is to provide a warm, nurturing, supportive, caring environment to get the person to really emote. I think most therapists are sadists. They just want to see the person in pain to really get those bad feelings out, release them. Thinking that if you do that because, you know, after throwing up, you feel slightly better, but the problem is you get re triggered by the same crap. So we're not going to be doing that. I don't think that people need to relive anything with me in order to get it better. And then the third thing that's very different is most therapists think it's actually your job to get you better. And they're there just to encourage, guide support, but the responsibility is yours. I don't look at it that way either. I figure if somebody knew how to get the kinds of things that they're coming in to see me about better, they wouldn't be sitting with me.
[03:57] B: Right.
[03:58] A: So why is it their job? It should be mine. When I go to the dentist because I got stuff with my teeth, the dentist doesn't expect me to get the cavities out. Yeah, same thing. Okay, so that's different. That being said, what is it that we want our time to do for you? What do we actually want to get better? Right. Like if we could really change for you problematic ways that you think, feel, act or react, what do you want different?
[04:29] B: Okay, well, right off the top of my head, I have issues sleeping.
[04:32] A: Ah, okay. How so?
[04:35] B: I've actually said something to the last two therapists that I've seen about this, and I'm not really sure what to do about the problem because one told me to write down my thoughts and feelings and another, which is hard to do when you're trying to go to sleep and you're laying in the dark. It's more like during the day. As long as my mind is occupied, I'm great, fine. The second the lights go off and I'm laying there in the dark, I'm laying in bed for about an hour and a half every night, tossing and turning, just trying to like shut my brain off. And it can vary what I'm going, you know, what I'm processing through my brain can be. And it's always issues from the past. So it's things that I can't change, things that have already happened, things that I don't understand why at night when I'm laying in bed, I'm dealing with these things because they're already.
[05:26] A: You're not actually dealing with them. You're just thinking about them repetitiously. Right. That's not actually dealing with them because you know there's nothing to be done because a lot of them are already over. You're just finding your. Yourself repetitively thinking about them. And of course writing that down is going to be useless.
[05:43] B: Yes.
[05:44] A: The only time writing something down is actually useful because I want to memorize it. No, no, no, no, no, no.
[05:50] B: I do better writing stuff down to.
[05:51] A: Memorize it is if it's a to do. Like for example, if I, I didn't sign my daughter's permission, whatever, and I don't want to get out of bed to go do it. If I jot it down, then my brain doesn't have to constantly remind me that I'm gonna need to do it, which would keep me up. I can write it down. And then when I wake up in the morning, oh yeah, I need to go do that. So it's good to write something down when it's a to do that my brain doesn't want me to forget to do. But if what you're saying is that you're thinking about thoughts about things that have happened that are already done that were bad and you're overthinking about them, which we really just want you to be over thinking about them so that you stop. Right. Writing it down isn't going to be useful.
[06:54] B: Okay. So I've got one therapist telling me to write it down. I've got another one telling me me that I have detached. But on certain, on certain situations my brain has become stuck.
[07:07] A: Okay.
[07:09] B: And we've worked on replacing the memories.
[07:13] A: What does that mean?
[07:15] B: Rapid eye movement.
[07:17] A: Did that work?
[07:18] B: To some extent, yeah.
[07:20] A: Did you do that assessment? Was that with Wise Man?
[07:25] B: Yeah.
[07:26] A: Okay.
[07:26] B: I like him. He was really cool. Yeah, but.
[07:29] A: But he did EMDR stuff.
[07:31] B: Yeah.
[07:31] A: He's thinking that you just need to replace the memory.
[07:34] B: Right.
[07:35] A: What did you replace him with? Butterflies and rainbows?
[07:39] B: No, I just. Actually, I extended the memory onto, like, a better. Like we use. For instance, one memory was with my grandmother. It was really a not good memory, but most other memories that I've got with her in this particular place were good. So I just extended the good memory. And it did, to some extent, work. Like, I'm not necessarily thinking about that, but I. I think I really have a tendency to, like, I don't know how I pick and choose what situation I draw back, you know, I don't.
[08:11] A: Think you're picking and choosing them. I think your mind is doing it for you, but I don't think you're doing it. You're not putting it. It's not a spinning wheel, you know, let's select this one and this one and this one. Tonight it's just happening to you. Yeah. Okay.
[08:31] B: So, I mean, I don't necessarily feel like replacing all of my memories. Some of these things, like you said, what we go through in our life, I feel like makes you who you are today. I'm very aware that I've been through things that most people haven't been through, but I don't feel like replacing those memories are necessarily going to do me any good.
[08:53] A: Well, Right. I don't.
[08:55] B: I can't replace every, you know, thing.
[08:58] A: The issue, Rachel, isn't about replacing the memory.
[09:04] B: What's the issue?
[09:05] A: It's really about unplugging the memory.
[09:08] B: My brain stuck.
[09:10] A: We could say it in that way. What I think of is whenever a human being goes through a negative experience. So we are never haunted, bothered, troubled by the stuff we went through because it was awful or we shouldn't have done it, or it shouldn't have happened. We're troubled because when it happened, part of our brain short circuited. So what it means is that part of the brain doesn't know that the negative experience stopped. At a deeper level, it stays on. Logically, we know that it's over. At an emotional level, it's still on. Does that make sense?
[09:53] B: Yes and no.
[09:54] A: So let me give you an example. A guy is telling us about how he got robbed 12 years ago. And as he's talking to us, he gets to the part where the Gun was pointed at his head, and his face goes completely white, and his voice gets all choked up, and he's shaking and trembling. He's got a tear. Yes, we're nice. We were kindly listening to what the fuck is happening with him.
[10:16] B: Wow.
[10:17] A: Most people say he's reliving it.
[10:19] B: Yeah.
[10:20] A: But what's really happening is that at a deep level, that emotional brain is confusing the data, memory, information about what happened, thinking it's happening. That's why he's having that physical and emotional response. We notice it as he's talking to us because we see it. But it was also affecting him. Even over the weekend when he was at the beach. It was. Was just underneath the surface. We know that where he's bright, logical, reasonable, and rational. He knows that he's with us and that he's safe. He knows that it's over and there's no gun. But we're also learning that at a deeper level, part of his brain never got the good news. Okay, follow me with that.
[11:11] B: Okay.
[11:12] A: So I would say instead of getting bad feelings out, we really actually want to get good news in that certain things that you've gone through have stopped, which, you know up here, but don't fully feel down here. It's kind of like somebody who knows that what happened to them wasn't their fault and they didn't do anything wrong, but still feel inside all the guilt and shame over what happened. Well, if I know it, how come I don't feel any different? Got it.
[11:45] B: Right.
[11:45] A: So where we want to change things is at that feeling level.
[11:52] B: I like what you're talking, but keep in mind, you're gonna get me in trouble with the other therapists that say that I am detached. Emotionally detached. I like. I'm sorry to not box. I like to emotionally be able to do with things that I go through with my brain instead of here. And I'm told that makes me emotionally detached.
[12:16] A: I don't know what that means other than that you do a. I'm removed.
[12:21] B: I guess they.
[12:22] A: You do a good job most of the time of not thinking about the things that hurt.
[12:30] B: I don't really think of it that way.
[12:33] A: I mean, isn't. I mean, you just said earlier that during the day, when my mind is occupied and I'm doing things, I'm fine. It's at night when I lay down and it's dark and there's nothing going on, that now I start having repetitive thoughts about things that sucked.
[12:49] B: Yeah.
[12:50] A: That I'm trying to process things. Stop thinking. So I Can just freaking sleep.
[12:55] B: Yes.
[12:57] A: Got it.
[12:58] B: Yes. Got it.
[13:02] A: So I would say the ability to be emotionally detached for the majority of your day is very useful. We don't want to ruin that. We actually want to enhance that ability.
[13:14] B: Okay. Okay.
[13:17] A: I'm not doing anything that's going to get your brain to work worse for you. I'm really about getting it to work in ways that are better for.
[13:24] B: Yeah, I like that. Oh, yeah.
[13:28] A: Got it.
[13:28] B: I didn't think it was an issue either. I was actually thinking I was doing pretty good by dealing with most of this stuff.
[13:33] A: Well, the best coping mechanism that human beings have naturally is to learn how to think about things other than what bothers me. Yeah, see, that's the best coping mechanism we have. The problem is therapists come from the.
[13:50] B: Training mindset, and they want you to do it.
[13:53] A: That people repressed it, and so we've got to get it out of them. You don't have it inside. People aren't troubled because it was awful. They're troubled because their brain doesn't know fully that the awful thing is over. You do, but emotionally, you don't fully have it. So what you've learned how to do is be emotionally detached for the most part.
[14:25] B: Right.
[14:26] A: Until there's nothing going on. And it now you're thinking about it. Right. So what we want to do is we want to get the memory not to be replaced, but to be unplugged. Once a memory is exposed, experienced as data about something that happened versus where it's been stuck on reliving happening, the pain of it goes away immediately. Like that light switch turns on. Boom, it's done. It's that fast.
[15:02] B: And how are we doing that?
[15:03] A: Oh, we're gonna get to how?
[15:05] B: Yeah.
[15:05] A: How do you know that we're not already on our way doing it?
[15:08] B: Okay, so good.
[15:12] A: How we. I mean, if you want to know the simple answer to clear any trauma, be emotionally present. When you remember what happened, it unplugs it.
[15:23] B: So think about it intentionally and emotionally deal with it.
[15:27] A: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Here's the difference. Here's what I mean by that. You can know that you're sitting here with me now. You can remember waking up earlier this morning knowing that you were going to go grocery shopping. You can think about something that you're going to do later. Right. So the difference is your body physiology is always now. It's the only place it can be. Your thoughts can be now, can be future, can be past. Your emotions typically will mirror your thoughts about past or future. So if I'm thinking about something that was troubling to me, I will emotionally be in that thought. But physically, I'll be experiencing it now. Yeah, got it.
[16:15] B: Yeah.
[16:16] A: The simple way to clear trauma is to remain emotionally present as you remember the past experience. Here's the cool thing. All there ever is for you to do is to intend to be with me. The reason I'm way more fun than sucky stuff, and I don't even have to be a lot of fun to be more fun than sucky stuff. I mean, that's the simple thing. There's a little bit of skill, and I'm gonna be the one directing it. In the same way that the dentist is gonna need your cooperation if they're cleaning your teeth or if they're getting the cavity out. You can't be like, right. Because they're not going to get anything done. But it's their job to do the work.
[16:57] B: Okay.
[16:58] A: Your job is to just be here. My job is to actually do the work to get it better for you. That's the difference. And we don't want to erase it because, as you put it, we gain. And not that we go through crappy shit to get stronger, but by going through crappy shit, we're definitely stronger.
[17:16] B: Yeah.
[17:17] A: We don't want to erase it and we don't want to replace it. We want to unplug it so that the brain gets that it's data. The other thing for you to know is when it gets stuck, it gets stuck and then there's a gap. So there's a space, and then the rest of the life moves forward. So typically, when somebody's got a troubling moment, it's the worst moment of it that gets stuck.
[17:42] B: Yeah.
[17:43] A: Then you could ask the person what happens next? I don't know. Because it's like stuck at the worst time. Like our brain stops the movie at the worst freaking moment of it. And then it's frozen there, and then there's a gap, and then the rest of the life moves forward. So what we want to do, and this is maybe what you're talking about by replacing. What we actually want to do is connect that moment to other things that have happened later in life that were more enjoyable than that moment. Because people in life have had. Even brushing your teeth might have been more enjoyable than. We don't have to go having a cup of coffee might have been more enjoyable. Right. We don't have to go with big deal things. But what happens is when a memory moves from the long term stores into the present moment. It's moldable and changeable. It's malleable. We can change not just the content, but the structure of how that memory got coded. We can add content from things that have happened after into it. So it all mixes together. So when it goes back into the stores, it's no longer troubling in any way, shape or form. And again, you don't have to know how to do any of it. Only one of us in the office actually needs to know what we're doing.
[19:07] B: Well, yeah, that's why you make the big bug.
[19:10] A: Alright, so I get that there's a bunch of stuff. I don't even need to know what this stuff is to know that it's continued to affect you. And primarily where it's affected you is that you find yourself having repetitive thoughts about it at night. So we want to get that to stop. What else do we want to get done for you?
[19:32] B: I'm pretty emotionally even keel person. I don't really fly off the handle. I mean, I've been through some things that I carry with me, but I don't necessarily think that makes me a bad person.
[19:47] A: You've been through some things that you carry with you?
[19:50] B: Yeah. Like the memories I was telling you about that I keep going.
[19:53] A: Oh, you're thinking that you're actually carrying them.
[19:56] B: What do you mean? You can't forget memories.
[19:58] A: Well, you're thinking that you're actually carrying them.
[20:04] B: You have to watch what I say and how I say it to you, huh?
[20:06] A: No, I just want to point something out. Therapists will tell people if they think that they're carrying something or holding on to something, that the person needs to learn how to let it go. You've heard that before, right?
[20:17] B: Yes.
[20:18] A: So how do you let go of something that you're not holding on to or that you're not carrying? It would be really easy, you know, that I'm holding on to this pen.
[20:27] B: Yes.
[20:28] A: That was not hard to let it go. Why do those emotional wounds feel like they're so hard to let go of? Feel so much that I'm caring. Well, maybe it's that you're not carrying it or you. You're not holding it. Maybe it's the reverse. It's been having a hold of you.
[20:49] B: So how do you get something to let go of you?
[20:52] A: Well, the error is, is that your brain doesn't know that it stopped. See, there's a big difference between you and your brain. You have one, but you're not it. Your Brain isn't you. It's an organ like every other organ in your body. Your heart, your liver, your kidneys, your lungs, they're organs. They're not you. You have one. It's not you. We, as human beings, Rachel, over identify my brain as me. For example, if I've got an upset stomach and I've got gas, I don't walk around saying, I am gas. But if I have a stupid thought, I might go, I'm stupid, stupid. My brain does what it does. It learns things as fast as it can and it puts it in automatic processing so I don't have to think about it anymore. And the problem is that it takes shortcuts to do it, so it's prone to glitches and errors. If your brain is making you feel bad about something that's over. It's not making you feel bad because it was bad. It's causing the bad feeling, actually trying to motivate you to get that bad thing to stop. The error is that it doesn't know that it already stopped. Isn't that crazy? Yeah, it's freaking crazy. But that's the error mechanism in our brain. It's because we have that timeline of data that no other animal does. You can remember past, you can know that you're now. You can think about future. Animals can't do that. When an animal has an emotion, it's to motivate it to do something, get something to stop, or solve a problem.
[22:34] B: Okay.
[22:35] A: Weird, right?
[22:36] B: Yeah.
[22:36] A: Our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to do something, get something to stop, or solve a problem. When it glitches, the error is that it's trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. That's why we feel crappy about the same things over and over, over and over and over. Good news. Many of the things are in time periods that are already finished. Okay, we don't need to solve it. We just need to update the timing.
[23:07] B: So update my brain?
[23:09] A: Yeah, that's what we're gonna do. Your brain, so that it's not trouble because you're not actually carrying it. Your brain doesn't make you feel bad because it's out to get you and want you to feel crappy about things. It's just trying to get bad things to stop. And when it realizes at a deeper level the bad things already stopped, it goes, oh, shit, never mind. That's why I say immediately the feelings go away. It's a crazy thing how it works, but it works in that way, all the time.
[23:37] B: Okay.
[23:38] A: That's the difference.
[23:40] B: Okay, let's see this work.
[23:44] A: Well, yeah. We're on our way. What else do we want to get done for you?
[23:48] B: If you can get me to sleep at night and deal with what I've been dealing with, I'll be happy.
[23:53] A: What is it that you've been dealing with?
[23:55] B: My memories that I said I'm carrying around. The memories that won't let go of me.
[23:59] A: Okay. Which you can remember now.
[24:02] B: Sure.
[24:03] A: And even as you do, there's a little bit of the bad feeling.
[24:11] B: Cute. Good.
[24:13] A: Not.
[24:14] B: Not as bad as it was the first time I told you about it.
[24:16] A: Oh. Oh, you mean it's already getting better?
[24:24] B: Yeah.
[24:24] A: Yeah.
[24:25] B: No, yeah.
[24:26] A: So. So. So I'm gonna give you two different pieces, and then we can actually take apart a couple of the things that have been troubling. So you already leave lighter. Okay. Right. So typically, we relate that it's the stuff that either has happened, is happening, or might happen that makes me feel the way that I feel. So if there's a guy driving down the road, an asshole cuts in front of him and slams on his brakes, he's effing pissed. We go, why you mad? He says, smoker cut in front of me. That's the simple way we relate to stuff. That guy saying that, that thing happening, it makes me feel this way. There's a problem because through that solution, we have two things that we can do about it. We either try to change it. If I can't change it, then I try to get as far away from it, avoid it as I can. But in life, Rachel, you know, there's some stuff I can't change, some stuff I can't completely get away from, right? And then there's all the crap that's happened to me, and I can't get that crap to have not happened, right? So I've got to do something else, which is about adjusting how my body brain reacts to the stuff, right? So the silly example goes, the lion approaches the zebra, and people say the lion makes the zebra scared. And I go, duh, of course. But then we go, wait a minute, no. Isn't actually the zebra's brain, when it senses, feels, sees, smells, or thinks lion approaching, causing it to become alert, motivated, strong, scared, so it runs away. Therefore, it's not the lion that's making the zebra scared. Instead, it's something the zebra's brain is doing to the zebra, even though it's doing it in response to lion approaching. Weird thing. Your brain has Been making you feel bad. It's been doing it in response to stuff you've recognized. That way of your brain working has been problematic. That's what we want to get tuned up so that it stops doing that to you. So the you that I'm seeing, that kind of feeling, this you, she remembers having had it, but if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't even know how to get it. Like, it's gone. It's clear. She's light, she's free. The you that I'm seeing when she lays down at night, she's just peacefully and effortlessly resting with a sense of ease so that she's getting that nice rest. Got it. The you that I'm seeing is at peace with the stuff that has happened. She's got in store all of the resources and strength from having made it through it and that she's better off now. Got it. The you that I'm seeing is then, you know, knowing where she's wanting to go and in action, doing the things that are in alignment with her, getting there so that she's feeling good, both about the things that she's doing and where she's headed and with what she's done. That's the you that I'm seeing. Got it.
[27:11] B: Got it.
[27:12] A: Question isn't, Rachel, how it's gonna happen that I get you there? The question is, would that be okay?
[27:16] B: Right. Who cares how you get me there?
[27:18] A: Yeah. Right. So would it be okay? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we've got a green light. Your brain is already organizing towards. It makes sense. Just by organizing, we can increase your brain's response by just doing a simple thing. If we think about a future you, and we were to symbolize that way of your brain working wild animals, something else out in nature, something up in the sky. What comes to mind?
[27:40] B: What do you mean?
[27:42] A: Well, you know how, like, when you see a yellow arch, you think McDonald's?
[27:45] B: Yeah.
[27:45] A: Right. Our brain responds to symbols. So if we were to symbolize the you who's clear, who's free, who's at peace, who's sleeping, you know, easily and effortlessly, wild animal, something out in nature, something that grows from the ground, a natural formation of the earth, what comes to mind to symbolize you that way? We're gonna make it up.
[28:05] B: We'll make a bird.
[28:06] A: Yeah, Cool. So we got the bird. As you see the bird, is it moving or still?
[28:10] B: We'll make it flying.
[28:11] A: Yeah. And soaring or flapping.
[28:12] B: We want it soaring.
[28:13] A: Yeah. So we got the soaring bird. Powerful symbol. You're gonna do a small little piece for me. Put both feet on the floor. You're gonna look up towards that yellow tap. You're gonna think soaring bird and take a slow breath in. And that's the first part that was simple. Right. Second part, exact same thing as that. This time though, after inhaling, you exhale and close your eyes. So look up. Think soaring bird. Deep breath in. And then exhale and close your eyes. Good. You can open your eyes. Same thing as that. This time though, when they close, you're going to keep them closed for just a few moments and bring awareness into your breath. So look out. Think soaring bird. Deep breath in. Exhale, Close your eyes. Good. Now, with your eyes closed, bring awareness into your breath so that you're noticing your breathing and that it's happening in a way that's slightly different than how you automatically breathe because you're attending to it. That's right. As you're aware of your breath, you can hear my voice, how it feels to be sitting. All at the same time, the unconscious parts of your mind are organizing towards the soaring bird. And then when you're ready, take it. Deep breath in, exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Those few short moments you had your eyes closed, what did you notice within yourself felt calm. You felt more calm and peaceful. Right. Which is a nice feeling because all accelerated healing always happens when we rest. That's why if you get the cold or the flu or even after surgery, we say get rest. So one more time, think soaring bird. Take another deep breath in. That's right. Exhale. Exhale. Close your eyes. Good. With eyes closed, they rest. As they rest, you rest. That's right. Your unconscious now is responding towards the soaring bird, already making adjustments inside at deeper levels. Kind of like if you bought a package of seeds from a garden store. You know that the seeds inside the package don't look anything like the picture. But when you plant them deep in the soil, you know that a lot is happening on underneath the surface without you having to do anything at all. And even more goes on at that deeper level before you ever see it sprout. Your unconscious, whether you know it or not, is doing that same thing within you. And you don't even have to do anything or even believe anything that I'm saying to know that it's all going on. So that when you're ready once again, you'll take a deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Kind of silly, funny, interesting, Neat. Now, you already have particular Ones that have come to mind about particular experiences. So if your brain scans back and brings a particular experience to mind, you got one that happened about how long ago you might have been how old?
[30:51] B: Probably four years ago.
[30:52] A: Four years ago. The feeling that comes up when you think about it is a feeling of what is it? Anger, hurt, sadness, guilt, shame, resentment, Pain. Combination.
[31:00] B: Combination.
[31:01] A: Good. So first question for you is, would it be okay for you no longer have that feeling? That would be okay. Cool. Because you no longer having that feeling, does it mean that what happened was okay?
[31:10] B: Right.
[31:12] A: No. Right. Yeah. See, you being free doesn't make that okay. You can actually get to be free and that not be okay. Cool. So how we get it cleared is a, you're going to tell me what happened, but just facts, really fast. It's going to be in a minute or less ago. This happened, this happened, this happened, this happened, this happened. That was done. Two, when you tell it to me, you're going to intend to be with me because I'm more fun than that was. And again, I don't have to be a lot of fun. So be with me. You just went there. I want you to be here. Oh, right. I actually pay attention. And I knew that you actually went there. And see, now I got you back here with me, so my job is to keep you here with me. Three, if that happened four years ago, haven't there been many things you've done after that that were more fun than that?
[31:47] B: Yes.
[31:48] A: Good. So what's one thing, anytime from when that happened until yesterday that was more fun than that?
[31:52] B: Anything.
[31:53] A: Yeah. Anything in your life?
[31:54] B: Anything at all.
[31:54] A: Right. So one thing this morning.
[31:56] B: Coffee.
[31:56] A: Yeah. Having coffee. Way more fun than that. Something else.
[31:59] B: My kids.
[32:00] A: Yeah. Right. Like doing something with your kids. Like what?
[32:04] B: Two months ago, we went to a playground.
[32:05] A: Yeah. Going to the playground with the kids, that was way more fun than that. One other thing.
[32:09] B: Talking with my sister.
[32:11] A: Yeah. Talking with your sisters. Right. So we got talking to your sisters, having coffee, playing with your kids at the playground, all of those things way more enjoyable than that moment. There's an aspect of your brain, when that moment happened that shorted, that doesn't know about talking to your sisters and playing with your kids and having that cup of coffee. So that's good news for it to get. So you're gonna tell me just facts, what happened when it happened four years ago, you were aware when it happened?
[32:31] B: I was home.
[32:32] A: You were home. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[32:34] B: Daytime.
[32:34] A: Daytime. And you were aware in the house?
[32:35] B: I was in the Hallway in between my guest bedroom and master bedroom.
[32:39] A: Good job. Right? And then what happened next?
[32:41] B: Baby daddy put his hands on me the first time.
[32:43] A: Good job. Like where?
[32:46] B: Took me out, choked. You up against the wall and.
[32:48] A: And then you're up against the wall. And then what happened next?
[32:51] B: Somebody walked in the house. He said, good.
[32:53] A: And I left the house, which was better. And then you left the house. And then that particular time ended. And then later on, you did something more fun, like play with your kids on the playground and talk to your sisters and have that cup of coffee. Now, here's the interesting thing. You noticed as you were telling me about it, that there was discomfort.
[33:07] B: Yeah.
[33:07] A: Not because it sucked, but because part of your brain was confusing the memory, thinking it was happening, trying to get you to get that to stop. We've got good news. It already has. So here's the weird thing. We never go backwards with the memory, but when we do, it flattens out the neurons. It unplugs the memory, it takes away the charge. So I'm gonna run it in reverse. So you're having coffee, you're talking to your sisters, you're playing with your kids on the playground. Then what happened before that is you had left, and then that person came in. Well, no, then he had stopped, and then that person came in, and then he had you up against the wall, and then he had put his arms. And he was choking you. And then you were in the hallway, and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Good. Now, as I ran through it backwards, compared to forward, emotionally, how was it? Same. More or less. All right. Isn't that weird? Yeah, because your brain is getting that it's not happening. Now, here's the other thing. Our brain works with patterns of association. So kind of like, you know that you remember putting your shoes on earlier today. But if I said to you, rachel, stop putting on your shoes, you go, I'm not putting on my shoes. Because you know that there's a clear difference between remembering doing it and doing it.
[34:05] B: Right.
[34:05] A: So remember getting dressed, putting yourself shoes on. Rachel, stop putting on your shoes. Say, I'm not putting on my shoes. Well, stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt. Well, stop him from putting his hands on you. Say, he's not putting his hands on me. Will you stop putting your hair in a pony? See, I'm not putting my hair in a pony. Well, then stop him from putting his arms on your throat. Say he's not putting his arms on my throat.
[34:28] B: He's not.
[34:29] A: Well, then stop that from happening. Say that's not happening.
[34:31] B: It's not happening.
[34:32] A: Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. That's right. Which is what we want to be getting in to. That part of your brain that didn't know. Third thing with that, that earlier you felt, even though you knew differently, that some of him doing that had something to do with you. But as we look at it later, future, we know that him doing that had a lot to do with whatever the hell was going on with him. It's not really about you. Make sense? Yeah. Right. So repeat these four words after me. Here we go. It's not. It's not about me. It's not.
[35:02] B: It's not about me.
[35:03] A: Right. It's not about me. Right. Good. Now close your eyes. Picture that earlier, you back. Then just after it's over and she's left. Let her know it's finished, completed, defeated, that no longer exists. Let her know that him doing that had everything to do with something being off with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it then. Let her know about playing with the kids on the playground. Let her know about talking to her sisters. Let her know about that cup of coffee so that she gets it as she does. What do you notice happened to the earlier used face?
[35:29] B: It's not near as bad as it was.
[35:30] A: Oh, it's not near as bad as it was. Right. Yeah. Because even as you think about that particular time.
[35:37] B: It'S not near as clear.
[35:38] A: As it was either. Oh, it's not near as clear. It's not probably located. So if it actually went further away and became more fuzzy, how does it feel now?
[35:45] B: Better.
[35:45] A: Oh, it does, doesn't it?
[35:46] B: Yep. I like leaving that in the past.
[35:50] A: Well, I mean, there is where it.
[35:52] B: Was, but, like, leaving it in the past.
[35:54] A: See, here's the interesting thing. That no longer exists. And so therefore, we don't have to leave it in the past, because there isn't a place called the past that stuff is contained in.
[36:07] B: Just forget it.
[36:08] A: No watch. No. I want you to get the difference. So if I saw a big yellow square bus earlier when I drove to work, we could say that the yellow school bus is in the past, but the past isn't an actual place that thing is contained in. If I say that something is in the past, my brain hears it the same way it hears I have money in my wallet, which literally, you know, means that there's dollars in my wallet. Right. If I say I saw a yellow school bus, people go, oh, well, you have a memory. That means it's in your head. But check Rachel, do I have a yellow school bus in my head? Right. So what if that experience no longer exists? Do you have a memory of it happening?
[37:02] B: I have a memory.
[37:03] A: You do? Do you like that it happened?
[37:05] B: No.
[37:05] A: Right. But notice right now how you're not troubled. Yeah, I know. Isn't that weird? Yeah. And notice how that's different than it's ever been.
[37:16] B: Yes.
[37:17] A: Right. Because what we just got in is that your brain just got that it stopped and it said, oh, shit. Never mind. It stops causing the bad feelings. It's never been causing it because it's wanted you to feel bad. It just wanted you to get it to stop right now. It got that it stopped because. Oh, shit. Well, then, never.
[37:35] B: Right.
[37:35] A: Right. And that's why, as you think about that particular moment now, there might be other ones that we haven't done yet. But see, the cool thing about our brain is when we start picking things off, it starts to generalize and have widespread activation and change. See, it's kind of like if I said to you, orange, do you know exactly what I'm thinking about?
[37:53] B: Right.
[37:54] A: You could go, wow, you're thinking about fruits. Or you go, wow, you're thinking about color. But if I said to you, orange, apple, banana, you know, it's fruit. Do I have to list every single fruit for you to get it right? So the cool thing about doing this kind of work in this way is, A, you get to be with me because I'm fun. B, we get to get your brain to realize that it stopped. And therefore, if that stopped, it's going to start plugging in information. Well, if that one stopped, and so did that one and that one and that one. One and that one and that one and that one and that one, and then I don't have to be troubled by any of them.
[38:30] B: So you believe my brain will heal itself? Kind of.
[38:32] A: Oh, my goodness, yes. See, the brain. Think of it more not just as healing itself, but think of. Our brain has what we call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity simply means that our brain is constantly in the process of updating and rewiring itself. And that's a. Yeah. And so what we're doing is we're rewiring faulty neural networks. We're making adjustments to the programs that have been running that cause the bad feelings.
[39:07] B: You drinking more coffee in there?
[39:09] A: Mm. Hmm. You'll get to know. I. I am. This is a smoothie.
[39:15] B: Energy smoothie.
[39:18] A: I don't think it's an energy smoothie. It's kind of got, like, kale and protein powder.
[39:22] B: How much coffee did you say you had this morning? Because you are definitely in.
[39:26] A: I know. See, the craziest thing about me is I'm pretty wired and I don't even need coffee.
[39:31] B: That's crazy. Your wife must hate you.
[39:35] A: Hmm. No. My wife says, you know, the first child, she minds. She does what she's asked. She's, you know, sweet.
[39:43] B: Sweet.
[39:45] A: The second child, she's like you.
[39:48] B: I go, that's so cute.
[39:50] A: She's got energy. She can't sit still. She's fidgety. She's all over the place. She, you know, wakes up and is. Right. Yeah. I don't know where she gets it from.
[40:01] B: Can't imagine.
[40:04] A: See, the cool thing is I get really excited when I get to work with people who've had sucky stuff happen, because I know that we can get it so that they're not bothered by it. Right. What's another one of those things that comes to mind because you wouldn't want to, like, you know. Oh, good. The thing that happened a long time ago.
[40:24] B: I just actually talked about this yesterday with another therapist, but.
[40:29] A: So it helped.
[40:30] B: Yeah, it's trying.
[40:31] A: So the thing that happened a long time ago, you might have been how old?
[40:34] B: I was young. Probably like seven or eight.
[40:37] A: Good. So what happened? You were seven or eight. You're where?
[40:40] B: I'm in my grandmother's kitchen, and I was telling her that my grandfather had sexually molested.
[40:45] A: So you told her that Grandpa had touched him. Right.
[40:48] B: Yeah.
[40:48] A: Right. And she said, no, Grandpa didn't do that. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[40:52] B: I don't really remember how the conversation ended. That was just really what stuck.
[40:57] A: Right. That's the thing. Right. So then whatever you said, and then you walked out of the kitchen, and then that particular time was over. And then later on, you were playing with your kids at the playground, and you were drinking coffee and you were talking to your sisters. Good. So we got talking to the sisters and drinking coffee and playing with the kids. And then we got leaving the kitchen, then Grandma saying, oh, Grandpa would never do that. And you said, grandpa touched me in ways that were uncomfortable. And then you'd gone in the kitchen to tell her. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Yeah. Good. Now, as we ran through it backwards again, emotionally, how was it? Same. More or less.
[41:29] B: Well, I've talked about it two days in a row. It might not just be you.
[41:32] A: Oh, yeah, don't, don't, don't actually give me any, you know, pats on the back. I don't actually want to feel good. Right. It is, isn't it? Right. Now, again, you can remember grandma saying that grandpa didn't do it. You can remember saying that, right? You can remember. You can remember putting your shoes on. Yeah, well, Rachel, stop putting on your shoes. I'm not putting on my shoes. Stop me from putting on my pants.
[41:56] B: You're not putting on your pants.
[41:57] A: Well, then stop Grandma from saying that.
[41:59] B: She's not saying that.
[42:00] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we want. Again, Third, Grandma saying that you thought had something to do with you and her not believing you.
[42:10] B: Right.
[42:10] A: But let's check. It didn't have anything to do with you. Had everything to do with her not being able to be with the fact that grandpa would do that to you. See, I'll give you an example. I remember a mom, her son had told her that his grandpa molested him. And the mom said to him, you need to pretend like that never happened. He was horribly pained over that. Now, what came out was later he found out that mom had also been molested. Molested by that same grandpa. Yeah, it was her stepdad. And the way that she was able to cope with it was to pretend like it never happened. That was the way that she survived. Because in her small town that they grew up in, he was a very well known person and it was intimidating. And that was the only way that she could survive. I remember another woman whose son again said, mom, uncle molested. And she said, don't ever say that about my brother. Huh? Right. Now again, come to find out, it had nothing to do with his mom not believing him. It had everything to do with what that would mean about her if that were true. Follow me with that.
[43:31] B: Yeah.
[43:32] A: So what was going on with grandma wasn't that she didn't believe you, but what that would mean about her that her husband would do that to you so that she couldn't even like, be with it. Make sense?
[43:45] B: Yeah.
[43:46] A: Cause check it out, as you think about it from where you sit today, Grandma love you.
[43:51] B: Grandma just passed, but yeah, she did.
[43:54] A: She. Right. Well, she still does, even though she's not in her body. I mean, it's not like her love went away.
[43:58] B: No.
[43:59] A: Right. So you know that. Yeah. Right. So her saying that to you back then had nothing to do with you and had nothing to do with not believing you. Had everything to do with what it would mean about her.
[44:11] B: Right.
[44:12] A: So I have her own husband do that to her own granddaughter. Like, I can't even, like, be with that. Right. But see, you didn't know that information back then. Like, you're getting it now. So close your eyes. Picture that earlier. You back then. Let her know it's over, finished, completed. That no longer exists. Let her know grandma's not saying that. Let her know that grandma acting that way had nothing to do with you and nothing to do with not believing you, but had everything to do with what it would mean about grandma that her husband would have done that to you. So that the younger you gets it. That's right. Let her know that it's over.
[44:44] B: Let her know.
[44:45] A: Let her kiss about her sisters. Let her know about drinking coffee. Right. And you can open your eyes and notice how that's different. Maybe this guy's on to something.
[45:01] B: Yep. Yeah. Kind of amazing, actually. I. Over the last, like, two years, I read in a book.
[45:14] A: Yeah.
[45:14] B: That if you project your thinking, positive thinking, like, how you want things to be in the future, you can actually, like, make those things happen. And I'm a firm believer in, like, picturing what I want to happen in the future. Yeah. So it. This kind of falls along the same lines. Very interesting.
[45:34] A: Yeah.
[45:35] B: I think your brain can be trained. Absolutely. And you can make your future. You just got to think about it.
[45:41] A: Right. But this is the barriers that have been in the way of you causing what. What you want for you in your life. Yeah.
[45:52] B: Right?
[45:52] A: Yeah. So we're on our way to beginning things to be way different. Because the two things that we talked about right now, as you think about them, check anything about them. Troubling.
[46:02] B: No.
[46:03] A: Right. And so they won't be troubling again. I mean, you can try to get. Feel bad about it, but you won't be able to. Isn't that cool?
[46:13] B: That's pretty cool.
[46:14] A: Yeah. Right. We're on our way and we just met. Can you imagine how much more we can get accomplished for you?
[46:21] B: That is pretty cool.
[46:22] A: Yeah. Cause you notice now how you feel is no longer at all how it was.
[46:28] B: No.
[46:28] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[46:30] B: Yeah.
[46:30] A: Yeah.
[46:31] B: Feeling pretty good.
[46:32] A: Yeah.
[46:33] B: About it.
[46:34] A: Yeah. You're a rock star. You're on your way.
[46:38] B: I'm quick on the abswain.
[46:40] A: You are.
[46:40] B: I know.
[46:41] A: So think about that soaring bird. Take a deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Good. With eyes closed, they rest. As they rest, you rest Your unconscious just simply begins to integrate, absorbing all that it's gotten and learned. Kind of like with watering a plant. The work is in the watering, and then the water just seeps into the soil all the way down, down, down, down. That's absorbed in by the seedlings, by the roots, which provides energy and resources for that plant to grow strong, powerful, and have everything it needs inside to be okay. And see, your unconscious is doing that within you, taking what it's learned and absorbing and then integrating it all the way through so that things begin to lighten. And therefore, it becomes even easier and easier to rest peaceful and effortlessly. That's right. And then, whenever you're ready, you'll take another deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Cool.
[47:44] B: You did great work.
[47:47] A: Yeah. We're on our way.
[47:48] B: Pretty good job, Doc. It's pretty nice.
[47:52] A: Yeah.
[47:53] B: I gotta say.
[47:53] A: Did pretty good already, right?
[47:56] B: I gotta say, I haven't been able to think about especially, like, your grandma memory.
[48:01] A: Right.
[48:02] B: A little bit, like, lighter.
[48:04] A: You do feel lighter, don't you?
[48:05] B: Yeah.
[48:06] A: Right? Yeah. Which means it's gonna be a lot easier to sleep.
[48:11] B: No wonder you get excited about this, huh?
[48:13] A: Right. Because how cool is it?
[48:14] B: Oh, I've been carrying that number around.
[48:16] A: Since I've been like, eight or it's been having a hold of you.
[48:18] B: Yeah.
[48:19] A: Not because your brain wanted you to feel bad, but because there's a glitch.
[48:23] B: Right.
[48:23] A: And see, what happened is we took what happened. We got it unplugged. See, you could have known logically that that was Grandma's crap, but it never felt that way.
[48:36] B: Right.
[48:37] A: See, what we did is we unplugged it and then what we know filtered in so that you fully realize that it had nothing to do with her not believing you, but had everything to do with what it would mean about her. She couldn't even be with it.
[48:52] B: I like you.
[48:53] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[48:55] B: I do. I like you. Because I would much rather. I mean, I don't know if it's not. I don't know how acceptable it is to not be so emotionally invested in these past traumas or whatever, but I like to think about things up here, not with this. And if that makes me emotionally detached, that's just.
[49:17] A: What is he saying? Is what we're really wanting is coherence.
[49:23] B: Yeah. Like, who doesn't want a happy so.
[49:25] A: That you have access to all. Yeah, right.
[49:29] B: Exactly.
[49:30] A: Yeah.
[49:31] B: Want to be able to think about it, but not.
[49:33] A: Right. Which is what we're doing.
[49:34] B: Right.
[49:35] A: By unplugging the effect that it's had on you. We don't erase it. You still remember. You remember where you were when you said it.
[49:42] B: Yeah.
[49:42] A: But now as you're thinking about it, not doing anything, isn't that cool? Right, Right. And see what you've learned. Like what most people who are successful to move through things is they learn just to not think about it. Yeah. Think about other things. The problem is we can't always not think about it. Because when I'm laying at night, I'm thinking about the things that I don't want to think about. About, and I don't know how to not think about things that I don't want to think about. Right. So we're just getting it so that it no longer comes up. Because if I'm not getting troubled by it, then it'll cease to happen. It's kind of like the kid that gets picked on, that gets upset when they're being picked on. They pick on that kid more. The kid that gets picked on, that's like, whatever. Well, it's not any fun. We don't do it anymore.
[50:26] B: Right.
[50:26] A: Yeah, exactly. So we're on our way. So we'll just schedule another time for us to get together and do more to get things way better for you. Yeah. Cool. All right. We'll stop.
