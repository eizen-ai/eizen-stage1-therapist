[00:00] A: Cool. All right, today is the 17th of February, Rachel. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. So. Yeah, give me an update.
[00:09] B: Yeah, Doc, can I have that one? Great. I have. It's crazy. Stop laughing at me. I am. I came in here, we discussed a few of my issues that, like, I was habitually obsessively thinking about. And after having you look at me like I'd grown two horns and a tail and go, well, why are you doing that? Don't you know you can let it go?
[00:37] A: Oh, no, not a sudden.
[00:40] B: I'm looking at some of the.
[00:41] A: I said it didn't have a hole.
[00:43] B: Well, it doesn't have a hole.
[00:44] A: You weren't holding it.
[00:45] B: I.
[00:46] A: Well, technically, it had a hold of you either or.
[00:50] B: I just needed to realize that it was something that happened in the past, and that's where I could leave it.
[00:55] A: Oh.
[00:56] B: And it's kind of been a little bit of an epiphany for me. Like, I go to bed and I don't really. I mean, I think about things that have happened, like, during the day.
[01:06] A: Yeah.
[01:06] B: But I'm not obsessively thinking about things that I can't change. Stop laughing.
[01:12] A: It's so awesome, isn't it?
[01:15] B: Yeah, it's great.
[01:16] A: Yeah. What we did is we got your emotional brain to realize that the stuff that did happen is data. See, it wasn't like, when you came in, you already had a good understanding that it was stuff in the past, and there isn't anything for you to do about it. You already knew that. The problem is that emotionally, you didn't know that. So we just got that part of the brain to know it. So when we talked about the grandma thing, that was like, part of your brain was trying to get you to get that to stop or get her to get. Have a different reaction.
[01:47] B: Then it was kind of a domino effect, though. Helped me with two or three issues that, like, I couldn't. Why are you laughing?
[01:55] A: Because that's kind of so cool how your brain generalizes.
[02:00] B: Well. Yeah. I mean, you worked with. We had. What was it? Two or three different issues we worked with. And it was kind of like after getting over the. The learning curve of getting my emotions and my brain on the same page. Yeah. It's actually given me quite a bit of just, like, peace.
[02:22] A: Yeah. Yeah. Notice how you've taken a step back from all that stuff.
[02:27] B: Like. Yeah. I was sitting forward talking with you about it and actually sat back.
[02:31] A: Yeah.
[02:32] B: Yes.
[02:33] A: Yes. Isn't that cool?
[02:34] B: Yeah.
[02:35] A: Yeah.
[02:35] B: It's actually really liberating. Yeah.
[02:38] A: That's how we know that your body got it. Your body is the thing that's most closely connected to unconscious processing.
[02:50] B: Okay. So you could tell by me talking with you about it and sitting back.
[02:55] A: You didn't consciously decide when you were up here to do this, yet you did. That means, like, literally, what you said, it was liberating. And before you said it, you had moved back away from it.
[03:09] B: Yeah.
[03:10] A: Then you said it was liberating.
[03:12] B: It really. Yeah.
[03:13] A: So here's the second part about it. Not only is our body the thing that's most closely connected to unconscious processing, it actually knows things about a half a second before conscious awareness. Awareness. So a lot of times when I'm working with somebody, by paying attention to what their body's doing, I'm gonna know before they do how they feel or.
[03:38] B: What they're gonna say.
[03:38] A: Right. Like, as we were talking the last time, even before we dealt with specific stuff, you were already feeling better about things before we even dealt with them.
[03:50] B: Yeah.
[03:51] A: Because of what we were doing was layering in different understandings in terms of what you had been told. Like, that whole crazy thing that somebody said to you where a, you need to write down things at night, which you said to me, that's really hard to do when you're trying to sleep and it's dark. And I said, the only time that it's good is if it's a to do that, you need to remember the next day so that you're not constantly trying to remind yourself to do it. Like, I had one of those last night. My daughter normally takes an allergy thing at night, but she's going to my mom's house, so I needed to make sure that she did it in the morning. Then I wrote myself a note, and then I slept fine. Then I got up. Oh, we need to make sure. Right. That kind of thing already shifted that whole idea when they were talking about you somewhat. With a lot of things being distanced or disassociated from, and they're like, oh, no. I go, wait a minute. No, that's a really good thing. Right. So a lot of what we were doing was taking things that you were told that was kind of locking it and keeping things feeling stuck.
[05:04] B: Yeah. It was feeling fragmented. Like, things that I found helpful for myself. People were telling me I shouldn't be doing. So I was fragmenting, like, what worked for me and trying to fit in what other people were telling me I should be doing.
[05:17] A: Right.
[05:18] B: And It. It was. I feel like, really weighing heavily on my subconscious, and it was bothering me.
[05:24] A: Yeah.
[05:25] B: So I was carrying around a lot more than I think I feel like I should have.
[05:29] A: Well. But it was all out of the way, wanting it to get better.
[05:34] B: Absolutely.
[05:34] A: Right. What we had to do was go, wait a minute. You're not actually carrying it. You don't have a hold of it. It's something your brain's been doing to you and not because it wanted you to feel bad. That the strategies that they had would be useful if they're geared towards certain things, but not the things that were going on for you. Right. Somebody gets a strategy to go, oh, well, that strategy will work for all things. No, it's a really good strategy for the to do. Not so good if it's the ruminations about shit that's already over. That one doesn't work so well. Instead, what we want to do is unplug it. And you said, I don't want to erase or forget about or even change the memory. We don't have to. All we need to do is unplug it. You can still have the information. You can remember being that young and having that conversation with Grandma and not even liking that it went down that way. But you don't have the emotional charge. And the second thing, it's not making you feel bad about you. Exactly, because that was the second part. It made me feel stuff about me when really it was what was going on with Grandma.
[06:40] B: Right. Right. Which is. I'll be honest. It's been empowering because I'm doing a lot of therapy. I do therapy almost every. Every day. If it's not Allison, we've every other. Or. It's been two weeks since I've seen you. Yeah. But they have us. There are three different therapies we do at the house. We implement it with you, Dr. Wiseman assessment. So, I mean, we're constantly trying to pick and choose between these different. What works for us. And you were the first one to actually make me feel comfortable enough. I was making a lot of sense with Allison this week as far as it. What works for this situation might not necessarily work for this one, but I can still be okay with picking and choosing from each of these to make me, like, feel better about me as a whole.
[07:30] A: Yeah.
[07:30] B: So I've been taking, like, a little of what you said, a little of what Wiseman said, a little of the art therapy with Allison.
[07:37] A: Yeah.
[07:37] B: And just kind of like, mixing it together.
[07:40] A: Cool.
[07:41] B: So I've been feeling pretty good about myself.
[07:43] A: Yeah, that's a really good news thing. When you think about stuff, are there other lingering things that kind of pop that don't feel a hundred percent better?
[07:54] B: As far as specific memories could be.
[07:56] A: Memories could be things that you currently are dealing with that you get.
[08:01] B: Well, actually, I was gonna bring up the art therapy with Allison. She's been having me do. It's like this. She calls it your stitch. Have you. Do you know what I'm talking about? The art therapy where she has you? It's a lot more hands on. And we're doing right now this family tree. So it was. Both my parents are dead, my grandparents are dead. So we're drawing out on this big piece of paper like my parents, my grandparents, me, and then relationships I've had like my two sisters. One of my sisters has both of my children. And we were drawing up for my grandparents. I'm just gonna get real specific here for a second. My. On my mom's side, I received. It was a. What would you call like, it's. It went through like my mom to me for as far as sexual abuse from her.
[09:06] A: Her father.
[09:08] B: And then my. My on my father's side hadn't even thought about and completely forgot the mistreatment from my father came from. I looked just like his mother. And she mistreated him physically. Like abusively. Not sexually, just physically. She. I guess he. She was taking all of her frustration out of my father. And I have a lot of issues with my dad because he just literally couldn't deal with me because I looked so much like her and she's had me. I haven't thought about my dad in a long time. He OD over 10 years ago. And she's got me dealing with all of these different relationships. Like I look at my relationships with these people now. I'm in my 30s, so I'm. I'm looking at these relationships a lot more maturely than I did when I had them. But I didn't even remember having the conversation with my father where he explained to me why he treated me the way he did and dealt with me the way that he did. But I'm wondering, obviously my. I've got the girls at the house. Call it your picker. My right people that I choose to be around me. My picker is broken because it seems to be like the more broken people are, the more that I generate. I generally want to try to fix them or help them in some way. And I'm bringing them into my circle, which is hurting me long term. So what I want to know is, do you feel like there's. In general, mind you, because I'm sure there are a lot of different answers to how you can go about weeding out who's going to be good for you and who isn't going to be. Because I'd like to maintain where I am right now. I've been in the house, the residential house for about a month and a half and I'm going through therapy at least twice a week. But I'm getting ready to. I'm looking into going back to school.
[11:20] A: Nice.
[11:22] B: I would like to start to pick up my life, you know, but I don't want to necessarily pick up a lot of these old habits that I had from, you know, before. So as far as even. Not even necessarily relationships, but just on a friend type, you know, how. How am I going to be able to figure out, like we've talked, we've dealt a lot with the healthy boundaries and stuff like that, but like, where that is like the defining, you know, to be able to bring people in my life and not deal with.
[11:59] A: The first thing is if you immediately find yourself really attracted or really interested, run. So that's the first thing because the first relates back to having that pic. But here's the second piece for you to understand with that. As you become more. Well, as things get more and more clear for you, as you become more and more solid inside, more and more comfortable within your own skin, more and more good with you, it automatically changes the picker. Why you found yourself interested in people who weren't well is because you had your own stuff and you're a bright gal. And if I can make a difference for them. It's why lots of therapists get into therapy. Heal thyself by healing others. So if I can take the limelight off of me and I get to turn it around and be focused on them, yeah. Then I feel like I'm doing something and I don't have to be focused on me.
[13:08] B: So you said exactly what I was thinking. Basically follow my first instinct and if I. If I like a person or am feeling some sort of. Like I might be able to relate. Run. I mean, it's. Excuse my French. It's up that I have to think like that.
[13:24] A: No, it isn't.
[13:27] B: Yeah, it is.
[13:28] A: No, no, it isn't.
[13:31] B: So you're telling me that everyone kind of walks through their life and goes, I've got a fucked up.
[13:38] A: Well, what we, what we're wanting you to be getting is that's the first step. That's not how it's always going to be. So you asked me two separate questions. You said, what do I do now? Yeah, right. And what you do now is. That's the thing you want to be cautious of. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. If it's feeling all those same feelings like, oh, wow, I could really help this person and make a difference for them, and that's what's attracting me to them, then I'm getting attracted to them for the wrong reasons. If you start finding yourself attracted to people who are already. Well, that aren't projects that don't mean fixing. See, we get into relationships where go, well, you know, this guy's got his stuff, but, you know, I could change him.
[14:39] B: Well, yeah, I'm not even talking about. I'm just gonna be honest. I have no interest in a guy whatsoever.
[14:45] A: No, no. Relationship doesn't mean, like, how am I.
[14:48] B: Going to be able to judge? Like, not everyone has. What am I trying to say here? I understand. Sale is going to protect me in the best way they can, and they're going to surround me with as many healthy people as they can outside of, you know, the program. How in the hell do you just. How in the hell do you, like, figure out where that healthy bounty where that healthy, like. Because not everyone is healthy. Everyone's kind of fucked up in their own little way.
[15:21] A: Or if you want to wheel up. Yes. So you've already got it different than you had it before. You didn't know that everyone is a little screwed up. Now you do. That's right.
[15:39] B: Yeah, you're right. I've never. Yeah, you're right.
[15:42] A: You didn't know that everyone's a little screwed up.
[15:44] B: Yeah.
[15:45] A: So therefore what you did, you took them at 50 face value. You took them by just going by their words. So this is the second part, Rachel. What you're going to know is you're going to know by their actions, not by their words. So you'll know by what they do, not by what they say.
[16:20] B: That's gonna be a little. I'm very, very judgmental. Like, I'm hard on myself. And I hold myself to that standard. But I have felt in the past that maybe I judged too harshly on other people. I've even been told that before. You know, I can be a real. Excuse my French bitch. And I don't know if I even tore that apart enough to find out, like, why people thought I was a bitch, but. Or if it was just reality. So basically, what you're saying is it's not wrong to wonder about other people, not only other people's motives, but to judge them on the same scale that I judge myself.
[17:05] A: Yeah.
[17:06] B: Okay.
[17:07] A: You want to be paying attention to what they do.
[17:10] B: Yeah. Absolutely not what they say. Well, that means I'm a big, big, big, big person. As far as I would rather. I'm sorry. People say all kinds of shit. I'd rather have you show me by action any day. That's, you know, the type of person that I am. That's the kind of.
[17:28] A: So what, by the way, what if you were a little softer are easier on you?
[17:32] B: What do you mean?
[17:33] A: And you weren't so hard on yourself.
[17:36] B: I don't feel like I'm that hard on myself.
[17:39] A: Okay. Because you just said that I was really hard. I'm really hard on myself.
[17:42] B: I judge myself a whole lot harsher than I do other people that are.
[17:46] A: How so?
[17:47] B: What do you mean? I hold myself to a different standard than other people because it seems like other people don't have a hard time.
[17:52] A: You would. You wouldn't want to, like, hold people to the same standard that you have.
[17:56] B: For you in general, it seems like people have a hard time with that.
[18:00] A: Like, in general, people have a hard time with that. Then those aren't the people that you want around you, are they, smartass?
[18:11] B: Stop.
[18:12] A: You're so good.
[18:13] B: Yes.
[18:13] A: I tell you, I'd rather be a smart ass than a dumbass.
[18:17] B: Yeah, you're right.
[18:18] A: My wife says to me, you are such a smart ass. You are rather be a smartass than dumbass.
[18:23] B: You are. But it's okay, you do it in a nice way. Sort of. Yes.
[18:28] A: See, you can be a smart ass if you have a smile when you're doing it.
[18:31] B: Is that what it is? Paint a big smile?
[18:36] A: Because if you can do it. See, I remember when I coach girls basketball and I coach these, you know, blackouts that wore like all sorts of fun outfits sometimes to school when I was, like in high school, and they would have these, like, funky shoes and I'd look at them, I'd go, nice shoes. And I'm really being a smartass. But they're like, thanks, coach. But see, because. Just because I had a nice smile on my face and I said it with pleasant tonality.
[19:04] B: Yep, you're right. People have a tendency to. You're right.
[19:07] A: It's okay then. Yeah.
[19:09] B: Okay, well, see, what if you begin.
[19:15] A: There you go. Right.
[19:16] B: If I can get away. If I can get away with holding. I'm sorry, people. To the Same standards as me and not be considered an for it. I'm sure you'll be able to understand. Like people have a problem with the truth. They really don't want your truth. I can't stand that. It drives me nuts. Don't ask me for my opinion if you don't want it.
[19:40] A: Well, sometimes we want to couch things, knowing whom we're talking to and whether we have their permission. See, it's assumed that you have their permission if they're asking for your opinion.
[19:58] B: No, I just assume nobody really wants the truth. You couch. I couch most everything. I've got very few select people that have tough enough skin to handle it.
[20:09] A: Well, sometimes it's how you deliver feedback. So think of feedback. There's what they call the meat approach, right. You just give it to them hard.
[20:22] B: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[20:23] A: You know, no dance. Just really give it to them. Right? That's the meat. Some people are good just getting the meat, right. Some people want some bun, some people need some nicety. Then give me the meat and then need some nicety. And then some people need fluff too. So it's not just bun. They need the lettuce and tomato and the mayonnaise and the mustard and pickle and then meat. And then you can have fun. So it really depends on who you're talking to.
[20:57] B: I don't feel like that's really fair. But yes, you're right, actually, most people are the fluff kind of people. Most people really don't want the truth.
[21:12] A: And I would be thinking of it in this way you've got it identified that there's a thing called the truth.
[21:24] B: That comes that that's like. This has taken me years to develop this understand? You know, every child I can remember my. My mother telling me there was a such thing as a white lie. And it's socially acceptable. It's a white lie. But my father was very black and white about it. The truth is the truth. That's it. If he came to you and said, you need to tell me the truth, you told him the truth. There was no cross cushion, no fluff, no lettuce, no nothing in between. It was.
[21:51] A: Dad wanted me, period.
[21:54] B: So it's taken me years to perfect, like getting over this. The truth is just that it's black and white.
[22:02] A: I want you to consider one other piece. And then let's take apart the thing that's happened with dad. So the thing is, if we walk around thinking that there's a thing called. Called the truth.
[22:15] B: Well, there is. There's. Yep, that's why they have all those sayings about, there's your side, there's my side, and then there's the truth. I'm not trying to argue with you. I'm just. You're licking your lips.
[22:29] A: You're getting ready to lay into me the truth. The belief is what makes it true for me. What's true to you might not be true to me. Your truth might not be my truth. We walk around and we talk about religions and somebody might have their truth is Jesus, God, Holy Spirit. That's their truth. Somebody who has a completely different dogma may have a different truth for them. We go, what's the truth? It's my take, it's my belief, it's what works for me. So when we say I'm going to give somebody the truth, I'm going to tell them how I'm seeing it. And I'll give you the baseball analogy. You get a very brand new umpire and they're talking about with other umpires. You know, how do you call balls and strikes? Well, when I see a ball, it's a ball. When I see a strike, it's a strike. That's the new umpire. When it's here, it's a ball and when it's here, it's a strike. The more seasoned umpire goes, well, yeah, there's a range, and sometimes it's a ball and sometimes it's a strike. And then the real veteran says, it's nothing until I say it. So it's neither a ball or a strike until I say so. It's always up to interpretation. I don't know if there is a full truth. I know that there's lots of strong beliefs that people walk around thinking they're the truth. A belief just means a reinforced thing over and over and over again that for me occurs as true.
[24:25] B: Okay, so see where this is gonna cycle right back around you, then I have to hold you close to a different standard than I hold you myself. Oh, because.
[24:34] A: How so?
[24:35] B: Well, because for me, my truth is just that. It's bare bones. It's the meat of a situation.
[24:42] A: It is, but from your perspective.
[24:47] B: So I have to fluff for a while?
[24:49] A: No, it's not to fluff. You're gonna tell them this is how I'm seeing it, not this is the truth. Because it might not be their truth.
[25:00] B: Doc, I live in a house with 10 other women. I don't know. I guess.
[25:08] A: You do live in a house with 10 other women.
[25:11] B: I deal with a lot of women.
[25:12] A: You do?
[25:17] B: In general, I Feel like I'm doing okay. I think that I have a pretty relaxed personality.
[25:24] A: Right. You're even ke.
[25:25] B: Yeah, my first few weeks, it was a little difficult, you know, because everybody has a little bit of a control. But there's more than one way into a castle. It doesn't make any one way right or wrong. But I'm finding that for me.
[25:39] A: I.
[25:40] B: Don'T necessarily think that I'm not lying to them. I just feel like I can't necessarily tell them my truth. How's that a better wording? Because my truth is just that for me, it's just bare bones. It's a black and white of a situation. And the women that I'm in the.
[25:58] A: Household with, they'd kill me if you're that black and white. Cause life isn't easy or.
[26:06] B: Yeah. And it's taking me. Yep, I'll give you that.
[26:08] A: So I want to give you one other thought process about that, Rachel. Like when we live in life that it's this or that. I'm either up or I'm down. I'm either happy or I'm sad. It's either day or it's night. We live in this dichotomy, and that is what we call Aristotle logic. Because if I'm this, then I can't be that. I can't be this and that. It can't be day and night. It can't be up and down. Aristotle separates things. It's this or that which gives us exclusion. Okay, so even if I say to you, I am a therapist, aren't I more than just that? I equal therapist. I am. I equal therapist. Are they more than just that many other things?
[27:04] B: Yeah. So it wouldn't necessarily be not truthful or not being myself to relate with them on their level, is what you're saying.
[27:17] A: Yeah. Right.
[27:20] B: Instead of what I'm comfortable comfortable with.
[27:23] A: Right. When somebody comes in to me, I'm.
[27:27] B: Having, like, social anxiety over this. Like, even, like, you were there for the graduation, like one on one dealing with people. I do okay. But as soon as it turns into more than a few people in the house, I have a tendency, especially since I've been in this house, I'm having a tendency to like, crash and burn like a computer. Like, over. I think I'm over analyzing.
[27:58] A: Well, we just want you to be over analyzing so you stop doing it. See, only smart people have problems overthinking and over analyzing. You go inside instead of being outside.
[28:14] B: Yeah.
[28:15] A: The world doesn't occur in here.
[28:17] B: It's a scary place.
[28:18] A: The world occurs out there.
[28:19] B: It's a very scary place.
[28:20] A: Right. So how do you want to be? I mean, if you weren't crashing and burning, if that wasn't going on, how would you actually be? How do you want to be?
[28:28] B: Not worrying about how other people are taking things.
[28:30] A: Right. And if you weren't worrying about how other people were taking things, how would you be?
[28:36] B: Probably a lot. A whole lot more relaxed.
[28:38] A: A whole lot more relaxed. And what's it like for you, Rachel, when you're relaxed and even keeled? You know, kind of easy going, stressful.
[28:49] B: Makes me happier.
[28:50] A: Oh, and you're happier. Right. So as we've got you even keeled and less stressed and happier.
[28:55] B: Right.
[28:56] A: And kind of more easy going.
[28:57] B: Right.
[28:58] A: Think about being around all those other people and what do you notice?
[29:03] B: Doesn't make me feel as.
[29:05] A: Oh, notice how it's already less, which is cool. So now because our brain works through the recursion, we want to do more of that. So if we think of you as being even keeled and relaxed and even more outwardly focused.
[29:20] B: Yeah.
[29:21] A: So you're just kind of like going with the flow in general.
[29:25] B: I try to do that.
[29:26] A: Yeah, I know. I get that. So let me give you one other context. Right? If we live in this or that, then I'm stuck. I'm either this way or I'm that way. I'm either confident or I'm not confident. I'm either stuck or I'm not stuck. So I could be confident, I could be not confident. I could be not not confident, which would include being confident, but it would also include everything else other than not confident. See, if we begin to include more, we open up the space and room to be moving through more stuff that's out there. And what we want for you is to have the most amount of freedom, most amount of flexibility, most amount of ease in maneuvering through this stuff. And the best way that you're going to be doing it is by becoming more and more outwardly focused. We only get in trouble when we start thinking about ourselves. And that's when you go, I'm over analyzing. I'm overthinking. Which would be better to just be over it? Yes, that's right. Because if you were already over it down below you, how would it be right. If we got you up above it and out from under it and you're over it. That's right. I notice how much more relaxed you feel. And now think about being around all those girls.
[30:55] B: What did they say a picture is worth A thousand words.
[30:58] A: That's right.
[31:00] B: Yeah. So.
[31:03] A: And what's happening now?
[31:05] B: I just took a deep breath and relaxed.
[31:07] A: You did. Right. As you're thinking about being around all those girls.
[31:10] B: Yeah.
[31:10] A: Right.
[31:12] B: I'm sure you can relate to.
[31:17] A: I've got my wife's dad and stepmom at our house.
[31:23] B: Okay. Yeah.
[31:25] A: And they came in last night and they're here tonight and they're here tomorrow.
[31:32] B: All day and all night.
[31:34] A: And I don't have work tomorrow. Hey. Not nice, Rachel. I'm laughing with you. Not really. I'm laughing at your situation. Let's see. Like, that's part of where the issue is, right?
[31:58] B: Absolutely.
[31:59] A: And just having somebody in your space where when you get up, they're there. And not that I frolic around naked.
[32:07] B: No.
[32:08] A: But it's the fact that I could if I wanted to.
[32:10] B: I did say when I came in, if somebody tells you you can't, you think that you have to.
[32:18] A: Yeah. So notice how much easier it is as you become more and more out and you're relaxed.
[32:25] B: That's right.
[32:26] A: Because you're even killed and easy going.
[32:28] B: I try to be. That's right.
[32:29] A: Well, you are.
[32:31] B: Thanks.
[32:31] A: Yeah.
[32:32] B: Yeah. I have found that this. I like this. I'll be honest, it doesn't do me any good to hold on to. To carry around, to be angry about. If I can find the path of least resistance. It just better for me.
[32:49] A: So given that you've already activated certain things with Allison around, having memories of what you didn't even remember, and then remember how dad actually told you the reason that he treated you that way is because you reminded him of Mom. Which you can get and understand that if we were to travel back, there was a moment early on when dad did something that was yucky, that you didn't know that part of why he was doing or acting the way he was had to do with crap that he had going on.
[33:26] B: Yes.
[33:28] A: So let's travel to that moment. Or one of. Because there were many times that something happened and you might have been. How old? Yeah. Like younger than five. Older than five.
[33:39] B: Older than five. Younger than ten.
[33:41] A: Yeah. And what might have happened? You might have been in the house or you might have been.
[33:45] B: I've actually had. You want specific?
[33:48] A: Yeah. Just make up what you.
[33:51] B: We actually had a. I had a stepsister, you know, who was about my age. And anytime she did anything wrong, I was the one that got blamed. Even if I could prove that I wasn't the one that did it. And one particular instance, she had told me where she'd hid what he was looking for.
[34:09] A: That's right.
[34:10] B: I had told him.
[34:11] A: That's right. Good job. He went and found it. Yes. Good job. And then what happened?
[34:15] B: I still got in trouble.
[34:16] A: Like what? What happened? He did what?
[34:17] B: She actually took one of his work checks. And it was in her shit. That's right, my French. He found it in her shit. And I'm still the one that got blamed for it.
[34:26] A: Yeah, but what happened? What did he do to you?
[34:29] B: That was where he committed me. He called the sheriff and I got a one way ride.
[34:35] A: Yeah, to like a facility.
[34:37] B: Yeah.
[34:37] A: Right. And then what happened next? You were in the facility?
[34:40] B: I stayed in the facility. For a year.
[34:42] A: For a year. And then you got out.
[34:44] B: Yeah.
[34:44] A: Which was better than when you're in there.
[34:46] B: Yeah, right.
[34:47] A: And then later on you did something more fun.
[34:49] B: Yeah.
[34:49] A: Yeah, right. We got those things. Right. So you can remember that happening. You remember being in the facility. You can remember being sent there. You can remember him like sending you there. You can remember telling him where it was. You remember her telling you that she had hit it. You can remember him looking. You remember all that going on? You can remember putting on your pants.
[35:04] B: Yep.
[35:04] A: Rachel, stop putting on your pants.
[35:06] B: I'm not putting on my pants.
[35:07] A: Well, stop putting on that sweatshirt.
[35:08] B: See, I'm not putting on the sweatshirt.
[35:10] A: Well, stop putting on those sneakers.
[35:11] B: I'm not putting on my.
[35:12] A: Well then stop that from doing that. He's not doing that. No, hurry. Stop from doing that. He's not doing that.
[35:18] B: He's not.
[35:18] A: Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. And the third thing is him doing that. Did it really have anything to do with you?
[35:25] B: No.
[35:25] A: No, it had everything to do with him. And what was off with him that you didn't know back then. So close your eyes. Picture that younger you back then. Let her know that it's over, finished, completed. That it no longer exists. That him doing that had nothing to do with you and everything to do with something being off with him. So that she gets it. Let her know, by the way, that she didn't need him to be well in order for you to turn out okay. That's right. So that she gets that. Let her know all the changes that she's making, the positive things that she's doing now, how more even keeled she is. Easy going.
[35:56] B: That's right.
[35:56] A: And as she gets all of that and grows up with that wisdom, what do you notice now happening inside about it? You do, don't you?
[36:06] B: Yeah. Yeah. It's Easier to leave it.
[36:08] A: Well, yeah, it's not there now. It's just data info and it doesn't mean anything about you. And that by the way, as you can open your eyes, is what's going to make it that much easier to be outwardly focused. Because when you go to over analyzing, you're thinking about you in relationship to others as if them being that way means stuff. But as we get these things shifted so that the lens starts looking outward. It wasn't about me in the first place. It says something was off over there. And no wonder why my picker was off because I kept thinking that stuff being off over there meant stuff about me. So why would I be attracted to people that I would need to fix is because of course it's something about me. Oh, right. I'm not saying that we're looping all of this together.
[36:59] B: We are.
[37:00] A: That's right. And because you're bright, you're picking it up.
[37:04] B: Thanks.
[37:05] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[37:11] B: You had a light bulb off for me today. Thanks.
[37:13] A: Yeah, thanks. Yeah. And you notice that that's different already, isn't it?
[37:17] B: Yeah.
[37:18] A: And liberating.
[37:19] B: It's. Yeah, I like it.
[37:21] A: That's right. See? That's right. How's your body feeling now?
[37:26] B: Fine.
[37:26] A: It is, isn't it?
[37:27] B: Yeah.
[37:28] A: Yeah.
[37:28] B: I think I'm gonna have fun with the rest of the day.
[37:30] A: You are.
[37:31] B: Yeah. Kind of an epiphany as far as. You're right. How other people deal with situations probably necessarily might not have anything to do with me.
[37:41] A: That's right.
[37:42] B: Nothing to do with their own issues.
[37:44] A: That's right. And that then gets you freedom.
[37:48] B: Yeah.
[37:48] A: Meaning to respond or not.
[37:51] B: Yes.
[37:51] A: To say something or not based on situation, who it's with and whether it would be useful or not to say it. That's right. That's right. So I don't always have to speak my truth. I just need to live it. And that's louder than words. Yeah, that's right.
[38:18] B: I'm picking up which button.
[38:19] A: Yeah, I know. It's because you're bright. Yeah. There we go.
[38:35] B: By the way, I love your elf shoes today.
[38:38] A: Fun.
[38:39] B: They look super comfortable.
[38:41] A: They are so comfortable. And they used to have this really cool like angel like design and then I walked on them.
[38:46] B: Yeah.
[38:46] A: And now it doesn't have it anymore.
[38:48] B: Except that's usually how it works with favorite things.
[38:51] A: I know, like, but they were really cool design. I'm like, why would they put a really cool design that you would just walk through?
[38:59] B: It's like women wanting the right soles. In the bottoms of their heels. Sometimes I. But next time you see that angel, you'll be like, I want those shoes.
[39:11] A: I don't even think this guy makes shoes anymore.
[39:14] B: That sucks.
[39:15] A: I think he got bought out by Skechers. But they're really cool. I've got this pair, another pair, and a pair of boots. The boots are cool.
[39:25] B: And if you saw the angel, you wouldn't buy another pair of shoes. You've got three pairs of shoes. I think maybe Rachel.
[39:32] A: I'm a shoe horse, though.
[39:33] B: I see this. I'm hearing, I like shoes.
[39:36] A: I have more shoes than my wife does.
[39:40] B: Really?
[39:42] A: I probably do more shopping than she does, too.
[39:45] B: Oh, God.
[39:46] A: I don't fit the stereotype.
[39:48] B: I hate shopping. I don't either.
[39:50] A: You don't fit the stereotype either.
[39:52] B: I hate shopping. So I just can't even imagine. Your wife likes to shop.
[39:57] A: I do, though. I already thought of, like, oh, we're going to the mall tonight for dinner. There's a Lululemon store. I want to get a pair of shorts.
[40:08] B: Holy crap.
[40:09] A: My wife doesn't think that way, but I do.
[40:13] B: Wow. Yay.
[40:15] A: They're blue. I know what they are. They have.
[40:22] B: He would drive me patch it crazy.
[40:27] A: That's why you only get me small doses.
[40:29] B: Doc, you're crazy. You have a pair of scissors.
[40:33] A: I do. Because you don't really want to wear that anymore.
[40:35] B: I really don't, but I just haven't had the chance to get rid of it. Thanks. I appreciate it.
[40:44] A: Sure. All right.
[40:50] B: So am I gonna have to. Well, not have to.
[40:52] A: Am I gonna have.
[40:53] B: Am I gonna get to come back?
[40:54] A: You can. Absolutely.
[40:56] B: How? Your shoes are just killing me.
[41:02] A: And they're not that big. Yeah. I always wondered until I got these shoes, because I always saw women's shoes that were like, those little pointy things. Oh, yeah?
[41:13] B: Yeah.
[41:14] A: How do you get your toes in those?
[41:15] B: Yeah. No.
[41:15] A: And they're like. Oh, no, no, no. The shoe actually ends there.
[41:18] B: Yeah.
[41:19] A: Oh. And then I got these. And I'm like, oh, cool, man. I got shoes that.
[41:22] B: Yep, yep. You sure do. Cockroach chompers, Right?
[41:26] A: Exactly.
[41:31] B: All right. So when can I come see you again?
[41:34] A: Well, let's go figure.
