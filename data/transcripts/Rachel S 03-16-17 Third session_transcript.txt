[00:00] A: So Today is the 16th. It's the day after the Ides of March.
[00:06] B: Okay, I don't know what the hell that is.
[00:08] A: Well, the Ides of March are just like when Julius Caesar got killed.
[00:12] B: Oh, okay.
[00:13] A: Be wary of the Ides of March.
[00:15] C: In the Shakespeare play.
[00:17] A: Anyway, so it's March 16th, first day of March Madness. You're gonna watch non stop college basketball games from noon until midnight night. Right. That's so good. I love that face. You're like. Yeah.
[00:31] B: You can't even turn on the TV until after set.
[00:34] A: I know what you're talking about, so. So give me an update. Rachel. I'm interested to learn how things have been and what we're wanting our time today to be focusing on.
[00:46] B: I really don't. I was actually thinking about that. I didn't even know. I totally forgot I had this appointment until about 10 o'clock last night.
[00:55] A: Yeah.
[00:58] B: So I really don't have anything set to talk to you about. It's been kind of things at the house been a little hairy. We've been making a lot of changes and a lot of the residents aren't very happy with the way things are going.
[01:19] A: With the new changes or with.
[01:21] B: Yeah, with some of the. Yeah, they're completely rewriting the whole makeup. Once you. Okay, well, like any program, once you graduate the program, you're done.
[01:35] A: Maybe.
[01:38] B: The second leg of the program is longer than the first. And a lot of people, like, had some expectations of what it was going to entail due to the fact that they've been there for the last nine months or a year and they completely gone in. It's like three or four people that were expecting to, you know, they graduated from the first step. They're having these expectations of what's going to happen. So there's been a whole lot of descent in the house.
[02:09] C: We.
[02:09] B: We lost Nikki. She went back to assessment. It's just been like a lot of Recently. Yeah, she just went back Saturday.
[02:18] C: Okay.
[02:20] B: So there's just been a whole lot of, like, changes and I can't talk very well. Excuse me. I lost seven teeth on Saturday.
[02:28] A: Seven?
[02:28] B: Yes.
[02:29] A: Just. Somebody pulled them.
[02:32] B: Yeah, we went to missions. Miles.
[02:34] C: Ouch.
[02:34] B: Yes.
[02:35] A: So were you at least put under?
[02:37] B: No.
[02:38] A: You were awake when they did it?
[02:40] B: Yeah.
[02:40] A: Well, I'm gonna talk to my buddy next door because he's an oral surgeon.
[02:47] B: Okay.
[02:48] A: Well, not for you, but for the overall thing with Sayla. He's an oral surgeon. Oh.
[02:52] B: Oh, I gotcha.
[02:53] A: And like, he can go. And you're like. And then he goes and you don't notice nothing.
[02:59] B: Yeah.
[03:00] A: Versus. I remember when I had my two wisdom teeth out twice.
[03:04] C: Right.
[03:04] A: So I had two sides, Right. And I remember going to the dentist's way back then where he kept me awake. I was numbed up. I had headphones on, but I could.
[03:13] B: Hear the tooth cracking.
[03:15] C: Right.
[03:15] A: Yeah. It's a weird freaking experience, isn't it?
[03:17] B: Yeah.
[03:18] A: Yeah.
[03:18] B: She pulled six in the front. Ouch. And then the one molar in the back. And I know exactly what you're talking about because I heard it crack it. Yeah, yeah.
[03:27] A: I'm just listening to, like, acdc.
[03:29] B: It doesn't really help. No, it really doesn't. But it was this one in particular that I got dry socket in. Don't know how. So, yeah, the last week has been, excuse my French, fucking miserable, I bet. But yeah, so, I mean, I'm. I'm doing okay. Like, I gotta be honest, after our first two sessions, um, it's kind of crazy. I read a page or two in my book at night, close the light off. I actually fell asleep with the light on last night. My roommates came in. I didn't even. It's kind of like you gave me a tool and I've kind of run with it. I'm actually surprised at how adaptable I actually made this. As far as, you know, a thought's just a thought or it's in the past and that's where you need to leave it. And it's a. Empowered me as far as stepping forward and being like, yes, some things happened here, but I'm gonna leave those there. My other therapy. You have more freedom. Yeah. With things to make up my own mind.
[04:37] A: Well, and I want to give you two thoughts on that, because part of that is where we change things. Why it's generalizing out more is at a programming level so that as things happen and get put into the program that used to cause that stuff. Well, that program's got now a new way of running. So therefore it's much easier for you to be up here with things because you're already a bright gal. So it's easier for you to go, oh, okay, I can do that with that. But what makes that easier is that as it's coming in, it doesn't have as much charge to begin with.
[05:10] B: Yeah.
[05:11] A: Does that make sense? So then it just makes it easier for you to go, oh, well, just with this. And I'll do this thing there and. Yeah, right.
[05:18] B: Yeah.
[05:18] A: That's awesome.
[05:19] B: I was going to say, for example, this morning.
[05:21] A: Yeah.
[05:22] B: We're we have all kinds of volunteers come in, and I.
[05:27] C: Have.
[05:28] B: I mentioned to you that I was having a little bit of, like, social anxiety. So I'm. I'm sure it had something to do with, you know, from experiences in the past, really uncomfortable with people walking behind me or. Like, we have a lot of people in the house in a closed environment, so there would be 14 to 20 people and, you know, a kitchen, dining room area. And that's a lot of people. Like, even if they don't mean to be in your personal space. It's a lot of people.
[05:56] A: It's a lot of people.
[05:58] B: But I. I've been able to kind of take a step back and go, you know, why is it this situation bothers me?
[06:06] A: What.
[06:06] B: What is it, you know, really, like, physically? Why am I reacting this way to it? And I've actually. It's been a marked difference. Everyone's actually said, you know, we're really proud of you. Because when I first got there, if we had five or six people in the room, I was hauling ass to my bedroom. I mean, I would try to be social, but I. I think it was like an introverted, slash my own fear type thing where I would just revert and freeze up and run. Yeah. So I'm stepping out a little bit more and finding social anxiety not as bad as it was this morning. We had a writing class discomfort. Yes. Where it's actually. It was almost a physical response. I get sweaty palms, so.
[06:52] A: Sweaty palms.
[06:52] B: And I would start to, like, breathe rapidly, so my heartbeat would go up, and it would just make me feel like almost like the room was closing. And it would. Like I said, it was just to the point where I would have to step out.
[07:10] A: And how has it been now? Because we get it. It was causing the sweaty palms and the stuff. And then it felt like things were closing.
[07:18] B: It's gotten better because I've tried to compartmentalize as far as why I'm having. Having this sort of a physical reaction to people. And I've had to, like, I walk, I exercise daily on the property, and we live on a regular busy street, and we've had workers working in the front yard. So I've had to make myself step outside of my comfort. It's not. I'm not gonna say it's 100% cured, but it's definitely better than what it was. I'm not, you know, turning around, hightailing it back to my room and fear at this point, like, this morning, I was able to get up in front of a Relatively large group of people. And read a poem. We're gonna do. We're gonna put on a coffee shop. It's just for us girls and some of our mentors, but poems that we've written in our writing class. They're gonna make us get up and.
[08:16] A: Yeah.
[08:16] B: Read our poems. So we had, like, seven people at the house this morning, and I was okay with it. So I. I feel like I'm kind of taking.
[08:27] A: So that certainly moved. If we could do things that move it even further, that would be useful.
[08:34] B: Absolutely.
[08:34] A: Okay, cool. You were mentioning something about Alison.
[08:39] B: Well, she's. I'm only gonna say this because this week, it really. She's wanting me to dig up my. Okay. I've been in therapy for many, many years. Some of the sale is really big at getting to the root of a problem or the root of why I was where I was. And I feel like they dig up a lot of things that, like, I hate to say them. Questioning how it is these therapy sessions are going, but if I'm okay and have. Don't really have any. Like, last. I don't know, though, maybe she sees something I don't. Just like things that I feel like I've already dealt with.
[09:28] A: When she brings. Has you go digging.
[09:32] B: Okay. For lack of a better term, Excellent.
[09:34] A: Right. And you now bring something up.
[09:38] B: Yeah. She wants to talk about my presence then. And it's not emotional. Well, of course. I mean, your first response on anything is your emotional response.
[09:49] A: Well, when you go to the things that you're digging up, are you finding yourself emotionalized in remembering?
[10:00] B: Yeah.
[10:00] A: Okay, so what that means is. And maybe the means of how she's going about getting it better isn't getting it better all the way. But remember, we are not having an emotional response about things we've gone through because what we went through was awful.
[10:22] B: We're going through an emotional response because.
[10:24] C: That'S how we remember.
[10:25] A: No, we're going through an emotional response because part of our brain doesn't know the difference between the memory about it and the experience of it. The memory about what happened and the experience of it happening is the same at an emotional level. Which is why when I'm recalling it, it's making me feel. Not because it was bad, but reason really trying to get me to get it to stop.
[10:54] B: So can we deal with something about.
[10:57] A: Yeah, absolutely. To get that thing to be clear, because Allison comes from. And I haven't had a conversation with her. We've been playing phone tag. And I do want to mention this because it's kind of come up with different people that are doing individual stuff with her and she's going digging. So the philosophy, and you've done things therapy before. So the philosophy, Rachel, is that when we. What human beings do is they repress, bury, lock, sweep under the rug. And that the therapist's job is to get the bad feelings out, which is like taking a cyst in, slicing it and squeezing the poison. Uncomfortable, both for the therapist and for the person. Unless the therapist is, you know, a sadist and now a voyeur watching the pain while they're eating popcorn. Right. So the idea is that yes, there may be trails, tracers back to earlier other things, but we're not going to get the feelings out. We're going to re educate that part of the brain with what I know from here. A, that it's over, B, that I'm not that and re change how that part got programmed in the beginning. Does that make sense? So that the emotional feelings, the angers or the hurts or the guilt or the shames or the regrets or the remorses or the sadnesses or the pains or the upsets or da da da da, aren't running me and I've got the distance from it. Right. So and in doing that, the purpose in doing any of those kinds of things, when people think about it, I go neurological routes. That doesn't necessarily mean it was the first time, but it means the one that's got the most charge that when you get it cleared, it kind of takes care of a lot of others. In addition, the purpose behind doing all of that isn't so that I have knowledge. Oh, I know that the reason that I did that and did that and did that and did that and that because of that and that and that and that and that. Great, good. Now, I know it's not for the purpose of that because that doesn't do anything in life. What we really want to connect things to is, well, how do I want to be functioning now?
[13:20] C: Right.
[13:21] A: So that I've got more freedom. So that instead of you getting the sweaty palms and the heart thing and feel, feeling closing down, instead it's expanded and you have both A inside emotional separation and distance that you're able to have an expanded awareness so there's more room for you to move. The deal with fear. Fear narrows in and I get frozen. That's the third part of the fight flight freeze response. Right. So I get frozen. So we want you to be open and up because the further emotionally away we are from things the further distance we see things from in a physical sense, even the less intense it is, the smaller that is. If I'm feeling small in representation to them, then we want to shift it so that I'm at the same size or at least seeing eye to eye or maybe a little bit above. But we want to shift how the brain's got that stuff represented. So, yeah. So as we're thinking of things, a, we want to get it so that when you're interacting with others, you're doing so with a sense of freedom and ease of spaciousness about yourself. That's right. See, that's such a good thing, because that breath is your unconscious going. Yes, yes, yes, exactly. Getting it. So there may be useful things, and if Allison and I, correct, collaborate more in that getting to identify them and then doing stuff to clear out the effect they've had. Because really, people get whacked out because we go, no, no, no, no. I have emotion because of the yuckiness of it. No, no, no, really, what's crazy about it is because, remember, the animal brain is the emotional brain. No animal has lingering resistance, resentments. The dog got beat by the belt, dog got adopted by a new family, dog sees belt, freaks out. But it's not ruminating about the other person. It's not. It's the pattern of association that triggered the response, not a memory of what had happened back then. It's belt means getting beat, not all the intricate details of the memories of what happened. So mama bear's not angry after the guy's gone away who was poking a stick at her bear gun, doing something else.
[15:47] B: Why do we have all these introverts?
[15:49] A: Because we have data timelines that animals don't. So the deal is, just like an animal, our body's physiology is always in now. The differences in animals and emotions are also always in now, and their thoughts are always in now. For us, our thoughts can be future, can be now, can be past. Emotions tend to mirror our thoughts. And because we can do that, we can experience the emotion of that now. Because if our bodies are always now and our thoughts and feelings are about, then I'll be experiencing all of the emotion of that now. And that's what we want to get unplugged, so that it's clearly read as data and that those kinds of experiences get put in context to all of the other experiences that I've had in life that weren't that. Because the ones that trouble us most tend to get blown up as big and close, which would make it more Intense and scary. So we want to get that thing adjusted.
[16:57] B: Yeah, I'm definitely guilty of that.
[16:59] A: Well, I mean, that's what happens with all of us. That's why my take on it is I don't think any of us can get out of this world without experiencing some sort of yucky thing that's left us with a certain amount of post traumatic stress. I don't think. I mean, there's people who have worse things than others, there's people have more things than others, but there's not one of us that haven't had shitty things happen to us throughout life. I don't care if you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth. No, you're right. And then the mythology of our culture for little children is, well, the good things happen to the good people and the bad things only happen to the bad people. So therefore, if something bad happens to you, is your right. Awesome. That'll make me feel better.
[17:54] B: Yeah.
[17:55] A: But those messages get what we get reactivated by all the time because the brain's not clear.
[18:04] B: Okay, so let's make this clear.
[18:06] A: There we go. So we know that all you need to do is stay here with me because I'm more fun. Know that that happened then and that you're here now.
[18:13] B: Right.
[18:13] A: And the thing that comes to mind, the feeling, is a feeling of what.
[18:20] B: With the prison, it's a couple different feelings, but more like fear and out of control. You have no control over.
[18:27] A: You're not a control.
[18:28] B: Right, Absolutely.
[18:30] A: And so it's a really good news thing that you're not there now.
[18:34] B: Right?
[18:34] A: Yeah.
[18:35] C: Right.
[18:35] A: And in that situation, it would make sense to be more vigilant on your surroundings in a hyper way. In today's world that you live in now, it'll be fine to be vigilant, mean noticing it in the background. We all have a fire detector because it's monitoring whether there's smoke. And we want it to do that and we want it to let us know as soon as there's smoke and flames. Because the sooner we know, the sooner you can react. Right. And the more ways of dealing with it we have, the closer it is and the later we get, the less ways we have to deal. Right. So as we think of you a being free from the impact that that's had and the you having that expansive space so that she's aware of stuff that's going on around her, but with a distanced lens make sense so that there is more awareness of the space. And I'm going to show you A little exercise. So put both feet on the floor and go ahead and lower your jaw slightly. And then relax your tongue. That's right. And breathe so that the exhale is a little bit longer than the inhale. Just like that, you can focus on this rock. And as you look at the rock, you can also begin to notice that you can see more than that rock. That your awareness can move towards your peripheral vision. And you can notice more of the.
[20:18] C: Space.
[20:20] A: The space that's between you and the rock, the space that's towards the sides of the room, the space that's.
[20:31] C: Up above and even beyond the ceiling.
[20:37] A: And noticing more of the space.
[20:41] C: In all ways, in all directions. That's right.
[20:47] A: And then close your eyes and imagine.
[20:52] C: What it might be like to float up and out of your body, past the ceiling, up into the sky in space.
[21:02] A: That the you up above can simply.
[21:04] C: Glide through the sky, soaring and flying.
[21:07] A: And moving, making big, wide arch, arching curves, turns, angles, moving, soaring in all ways and all directions.
[21:20] C: That's right.
[21:22] A: More and more.
[21:26] C: That's right.
[21:37] A: And then floating back down into your body.
[21:42] C: Take another big, deep breath in. Exhale, and open your eyes. There we go. What did you notice in those moments?
[21:55] B: Relaxed a lot more.
[21:57] C: Yeah. Everything slowed down and everything slowed down. That's right.
[22:02] A: So. So imagine experiencing things with that distance and slowed down.
[22:07] C: Kind of like you're in the Matrix, which would be really cool if the.
[22:13] A: Bullet came and you could go.
[22:15] B: That would be really cool. Or catch it and find out.
[22:23] A: So the thing that happened, like, as we think back about that, there's some times things that happen. So what's one of the moments that comes to mind?
[22:32] B: Are we still talking about the prison situation?
[22:34] A: Well, whatever it is that comes to mind, that if we're thinking of you having that freedom of interacting with others, noticing things in the periphery so that it's just kind of on autopilot, knowing that, you know, the fire detector will let you know if there's any smoke and that you'll have that knowledge at the earliest time for you to have the most amount of flexibility in how.
[23:00] C: You want to be dealing with it. Use it when I need it. Yeah, that's right. That's right.
[23:07] A: Because we don't turn it off. We don't unplug them. We don't take them away.
[23:10] C: Oh, my house will not catch on.
[23:11] A: Fire and vine Let me go and leave my doors open as well, because nobody will ever try to steal anything. Hello.
[23:19] C: Right.
[23:23] B: Some of the things that I learned in prison, I'd like to Keep some of them I'd like to forget.
[23:27] A: Well, don't you think that lots of things you want to take that are useful?
[23:32] B: Yes.
[23:33] C: Yeah. Right.
[23:35] B: I mean, I'm sure with every situation.
[23:37] A: There are useful, but there are moments that come to mind that as we're organizing your mind to be having that.
[23:43] C: Expansive space of travel back and particularly select an experience. Good.
[23:50] A: What comes to mind, you might have been where and what happened?
[23:54] B: I was climbing on. When I think about prison, the first thing that comes to mind, my flight on Conair.
[24:03] A: Yes.
[24:04] B: Being surrounded by 15 U.S. marshals with automatic weapons.
[24:09] A: Yes.
[24:10] B: Shackled to the floor of the plane.
[24:12] A: Yes.
[24:15] B: Just complete.
[24:16] A: Well then what happened? So you're shackled to the floor of the plane, right?
[24:19] B: Yeah.
[24:19] A: They're all around you, they've got guns. Right. And then what happens?
[24:22] B: We take an eight hour flight.
[24:23] A: Take a flight. Right. Good. And then what happens next?
[24:25] B: We land.
[24:26] A: You land. Right.
[24:26] C: Good.
[24:27] A: Which is better. Then what happened next?
[24:29] B: They disembark us.
[24:30] C: Right.
[24:30] A: Good job. And then you got off the plane. Right. And then you got into.
[24:34] B: It's a federal act it the federal holding facility where every inmate gets their number.
[24:40] A: That's right. And so then you went through that.
[24:42] B: And you got your number, stayed two days and then. Good job.
[24:45] A: And then you flew again, shackles and all, guns.
[24:48] B: Second time wasn't as bad as the first.
[24:49] A: Good. And then what happened next?
[24:51] B: Landed again.
[24:51] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[24:53] B: I went to prison.
[24:54] A: Right. And then what happened? Well, you're in prison for a period of time and then you left and then got out. Right. And then later on you did something more fun.
[25:05] B: Like anything, took a car ride.
[25:10] A: So we got going on the car ride and then, you know, leaving prison and then doing your time and then going to prison and then flying and then leaving the holding facility and then getting the number and then going to the holding facility and then landing and then being in the plane with the guns and the shackles and then taking off and then getting put in the plane. And then before that you were doing something, going through processing. Whatever it was, they caught you.
[25:38] C: That's right.
[25:41] A: So good. And again as we run through, what do you notice now as you think about it?
[25:47] B: Much calmer.
[25:48] A: Right. Now close your eyes and let that younger, you know, as she's sitting there in the shackle, how it all turned out and where you are now so that she knows that back then as she goes through it.
[26:07] C: That's right.
[26:09] A: And as she gets that.
[26:14] C: That's right.
[26:14] A: What do you notice happening now?
[26:16] C: There we go, hey.
[26:18] A: And you can open your eyes.
[26:20] C: That's right.
[26:22] B: That was then, this is now.
[26:24] C: Yeah.
[26:25] A: Well, notice what happened. What happened to her face?
[26:28] B: Relax.
[26:28] C: Yeah.
[26:28] A: She did, didn't she?
[26:29] C: Yeah.
[26:30] A: Because she knows. See, the thing that we're getting in is the younger you knows that she's gonna be okay.
[26:37] C: Yeah.
[26:39] A: And imagine, because there was a lot of times during that experience both on your way, getting caught on your way there and staying in, whatever time you had, there was lots of, like, concerns, hey, am I gonna make it through this thing? Am I gonna be okay?
[26:55] B: Yeah.
[26:56] A: Right. So now she's getting. As she's embarking on that part of the journey, she's gonna make it through it, and she's okay.
[27:06] C: Yeah.
[27:08] A: And knowing that. Right. She goes. Right. Exactly. Doesn't mean that it was all peaches and creams and strawberries and candies.
[27:17] B: No. It just means that it doesn't want.
[27:19] A: That's right. That's right. Yeah.
[27:22] C: Yeah.
[27:23] B: Why you always make me stretch? I always feel layer. I love it.
[27:27] A: You do, don't you?
[27:28] B: Right?
[27:29] C: Yeah.
[27:30] B: Yeah. I don't think that I. We truly give, like, our heavy thoughts or our negativity the kind of weight to deserve because they definitely. They weigh a lot.
[27:39] C: Yeah.
[27:40] A: Yeah. And as things lighten up, so do you. Yeah. So again, as you think back to the whole thing with prison, is there another moment that comes to mind? Yeah. Good. Let's get that one cleared. So that one happened. You're in actual prison. Oh, be with me. Hello. Hi. I'm way more fun than that was.
[28:07] C: Yeah.
[28:08] A: So be here. What's the thing that happened? Because you're there, but be here. That was then. Way back then. How many years ago?
[28:21] B: 15 years ago.
[28:22] A: 15 years ago. So that was way back then and this is now. Right. And you're not troubled because it sucked or was yucky or it was bad because your brain hasn't gotten the good.
[28:33] C: News that it stopped.
[28:36] A: So from here, you and I get to educate the younger you, which is going to be really cool when she knows that that's not happening. Don't you think?
[28:46] B: Yeah.
[28:47] A: Yeah. So what's the thing that happened? So you're in prison.
[28:50] C: You're where?
[28:50] A: In prison.
[28:55] B: My first night in prison.
[28:57] A: It's your first night in prison. Good job, right?
[28:59] B: Yeah.
[29:00] A: And, like, are you in the cell at this time? Are you, like, in.
[29:03] B: Yeah. They lock you down.
[29:04] A: So you're in the cell and you're by yourself or with somebody else? I had two roommates and two roommates.
[29:10] C: Good.
[29:10] A: Right. And then what happened? So you're in the cell.
[29:12] B: Did you hear down the hallway somebody getting the shit beat out of them?
[29:15] A: That's right. Good job. So you're hearing that and they're screaming, and you're hearing that the wrong. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[29:21] B: Went to sleep and woke up the next morning.
[29:23] A: Yes. Then what happened went on when they let you out.
[29:29] B: Yeah.
[29:29] A: And then you did whatever. And then they lied back, like. Good. And then that particular time was over, Right?
[29:35] C: Yeah.
[29:35] A: So you can remember that happening, hearing that person? Absolutely. You can remember putting your sweatshirt on?
[29:40] B: Just not putting on that sweatshirt.
[29:43] A: Say I'm not.
[29:44] B: And not spinning.
[29:45] A: Will stop putting your hair in a ponytail.
[29:46] B: I'm not putting my hair.
[29:47] A: Will stop me from putting on my shoes. Will stop you from putting on your.
[29:51] B: Ponies or, like, my ponies.
[29:53] A: I'm not putting on my ponies. Right. Well, then stop them from, you know, beating her.
[29:57] C: I can't.
[29:58] A: Well, stop that from happening. We'll stop her from screaming.
[30:01] C: Right.
[30:02] A: Well, stop them from doing that. Say they're not doing that.
[30:05] C: They're not doing that. Right.
[30:06] A: So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists. No longer exist right now. Not in the past, because that's a container that it's happening in. There's no place that you and I can go right now to watch that happen then.
[30:17] C: No. Right.
[30:18] A: And you might have a memory of it. And that was really scary.
[30:24] C: Right.
[30:25] A: Because that younger you doesn't know what you fully know.
[30:30] C: She's gonna be okay.
[30:34] A: So again, close your eyes and let her know.
[30:42] C: That it's not happening.
[30:45] A: That she's defeated it. And we know that she's defeated it. Because if you're still standing and that experience no longer exists, you've defeated it. And boy, oh, boy, how much more enjoyable is it walking outside on the Property of Selah?
[31:06] C: That's right.
[31:09] A: And let that younger you know about that.
[31:16] C: That's right.
[31:19] A: And what's happening to her face?
[31:25] B: Do you have any more relaxed?
[31:26] C: Yeah.
[31:27] A: And we don't like that that happened.
[31:30] C: Right.
[31:30] A: But we don't ever have to. And you being okay doesn't mean that.
[31:36] C: That experience was right.
[31:42] A: We don't have to get the experience to be okay in order for you.
[31:47] B: We just have to figure out that something happened then, not now.
[31:53] C: Well.
[31:53] A: Right. And as that's happening, what do you notice with that younger you?
[32:03] B: Uh, it doesn't feel quite so much like somebody's got their hands wrapped around my throat.
[32:08] C: Yeah.
[32:08] A: So then let her know that she.
[32:10] C: Made it through it.
[32:12] B: Well, Obviously I did.
[32:14] A: Yeah.
[32:14] C: But she doesn't fully know that yet.
[32:18] B: Well, I told her she should get it.
[32:20] A: Oh, good.
[32:21] C: Yeah.
[32:22] A: And it's lightening up.
[32:24] C: Yeah. Yeah.
[32:25] A: Is there another moment that comes to mind? I mean, good introduction. Welcome, welcome. Right. I mean, alrighty. Wow. This is gonna be a great place to be for a little while. How long?
[33:01] B: I think three years.
[33:02] C: Yeah.
[33:07] B: It was actually that first night that I spent there with that whole, you know, scene on my head. It actually really wasn't bad, but it made me hyper vigilant, very aware, don't you think? And that's. I feel like that's why I don't, like, like the whole big crowd thing.
[33:25] A: Well, didn't it help you to pay attention and to be on the side and to not be in the middle and to not start kind of keep to yourself. You're not like, looking at. You're not doing, like some of the girls you call me. What?
[33:44] B: I'll beat you down.
[33:47] A: You're not doing that. Right. So now I want you to think of the you back then. Right. And I want you to think of.
[33:57] C: Her.
[33:59] A: Becoming so that she's rising up taller and becoming. That's right.
[34:09] C: More and more.
[34:12] A: Because with that up above view of.
[34:17] C: The landscape, she sees things.
[34:21] A: That's right.
[34:21] C: More clearly with distance.
[34:26] A: And we, you know, acknowledge and appreciate your unconscious for steering you out of. Right. There are certain personalities that are, like, looking for that. You talking to me, you looking at me. And then it's like, I'm going to. I get it. You're the big dog, whatever. But I don't care. No matter to me.
[34:58] B: Yeah. Survival.
[35:00] A: Right.
[35:02] C: Right.
[35:04] A: So now think about, you know, standing.
[35:06] C: Up.
[35:08] A: You know, because you're eye to eye with others as you're reading your poetry.
[35:13] B: Right.
[35:13] A: And what do you notice? That you're thinking about that now.
[35:18] B: I'm okay with it.
[35:19] C: Yeah.
[35:19] B: Yeah, that's right.
[35:23] A: And think about, you know, all the different people that are coming to the house that might be in there. And they're all women and they're all in the kitchen and I'm running myself. But as you're standing there, what are you noticing now?
[35:40] B: I'll be fine.
[35:41] C: Yeah.
[35:42] B: If I made it through that and I'm standing here.
[35:45] A: Hell, lolly time.
[35:46] C: Yeah. Yeah.
[35:48] A: And are you the one? Even if, like, one of the other girls does something to, like, really go, all right, like, we are going to throw down now?
[35:54] B: No.
[35:54] C: Right.
[35:55] A: Because, you know, it's a boy.
[36:00] B: No, I'm pretty. How do the girls put it? I have a Very calm energy.
[36:08] A: You do?
[36:09] C: Yeah.
[36:09] B: I'm just making. I'm sure that if I was forced. Yeah. I would stand up for myself. But let's be honest, it's really not that bad. It's not that serious.
[36:21] A: Right. So you've got context. See, that's the thing that I want you to realize from having gone through hard time, we even call it hard time. By having gone through that, it makes other experiences that aren't as hard that much easier.
[36:43] C: Absolutely.
[36:44] A: Right. My buddy James, that's here, he spent time in Iraq, first Gulf War, and one of his duties was to, you know, clear out dead bodies.
[36:57] B: Right, right.
[36:58] A: And he goes. And he's got the best perspective. He goes. There isn't a day that goes by when anything's happening, no matter how shitty it is, that I don't go.
[37:10] B: Hard to be here.
[37:10] A: It's not that I'm sitting in traffic and I'm gonna be late and I'm. It's not that. You know, and he is the most level headed, calm, cool, collected dude. Because here's the thing that you get, and that's the resource you get out of going through that, is that now you've got a bigger perspective. And that's what I mean by being up above.
[37:40] C: That's right.
[37:41] A: You can see the bigger picture and the situation. Right. And that's why you're in that much more calm. I mean, if somebody's really going to go at me, then I'll freaking do what I need to do. But like most of I'll just sit up like Buddha. What would you girls do? Whatever you're doing.
[38:02] B: Yes.
[38:03] A: Yeah.
[38:05] B: Most of it's not that serious.
[38:06] A: Yeah.
[38:10] B: Yeah, you're right. Thank you.
[38:13] A: Yeah, absolutely. Now, as you think about that and what, you know, you and Allison were doing, what do you notice?
[38:19] B: Yeah, it's. I'm fine with it. That's fine.
[38:22] C: Yeah.
[38:22] B: She wants to talk about it again next week. That's fine too.
[38:25] C: Right? Yeah.
[38:29] A: And it's not doing the same thing.
[38:31] B: No.
[38:31] C: Right.
[38:34] B: Obviously it was really bothering me.
[38:37] A: How about now? Not so much or at all. Not so much is what's thrown thing that's lingering.
[38:48] B: It's just something that I went through. I survived it and need to understand that that happened then.
[38:54] A: Well, what's troubling now and I'm here now.
[38:57] B: She wants to continue to pull it apart. Like how so I'm not sure.
[39:02] A: Well, what.
[39:03] B: I don't know what to expect next part. I think that's what it is. It's because I don't know what to expect.
[39:10] A: So she might go. Well, tell me about a day in the life of that. Tell me about what that earlier you was thinking. Did she have remorses, regrets over what she did that got her there?
[39:24] B: Yeah, of course. But I didn't really have a choice.
[39:34] A: You didn't really have a choice.
[39:35] B: I see your face embellished.
[39:37] A: Why?
[39:37] B: I went to prison for my sister.
[39:39] A: It doesn't matter. You went to prison for your sister?
[39:43] B: Yeah.
[39:44] A: Like instead of her?
[39:45] B: Yes.
[39:47] A: So what does that mean?
[39:48] B: It means that my sister was a major importer of marijuana 15 years ago. Here. Her and her boyfriend.
[39:57] A: Thanks.
[39:58] B: And I kind of got. I got caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. They wanted me to, you know, put her name on a piece of paper along with his and they would have let me go. I was just turned 18. I wasn't. Yeah, but I couldn't do that.
[40:13] A: Oh, isn't that cool?
[40:17] B: It made a lot of problems in the family.
[40:21] A: It made a lot of problems in the family that you weren't willing to rat on your sister.
[40:27] C: Yeah.
[40:28] B: My parents didn't understand.
[40:30] A: Right.
[40:30] C: Of course.
[40:31] B: Didn't agree.
[40:33] A: Yes.
[40:36] B: And then the long term, it created issues between me and my sister.
[40:40] A: How so?
[40:41] B: We don't even talk anymore. Like I. I look back on who I was in and I feel like you shouldn't do that, you know, to somebody who's naive and inexperienced. I knew I was taking a risk. You? Yes. But I just turned 18. I didn't realize, you know, what sort of risk I was on.
[41:01] A: Uh huh. Right. So you had her back and now with perspective, it didn't feel like she had yours.
[41:10] B: No.
[41:14] A: So now let's get that better. Right. Because what happened back then is that earlier you did what occurred for her to do based on the knowledge, insight, wisdom, life experiences, stuff that she had then.
[41:34] B: Right.
[41:34] A: Got it.
[41:35] B: Right.
[41:35] A: And she thought when she was doing that that she was doing the right thing.
[41:40] B: Right?
[41:41] C: That's right.
[41:41] B: Yeah.
[41:42] A: Yeah.
[41:42] B: That's what motivated me to do it. Absolutely.
[41:46] A: What she did not is what you know now how she got into that situation and that it didn't feel like her sister had her back. See what that earlier you thought is that you do whatever you can for family.
[42:08] C: Right.
[42:10] A: But what she didn't know back then is that sister not, you know, 100% mentally, emotionally. Well.
[42:19] C: Right.
[42:20] A: She didn't know that she did what occurred for her to do. Parents couldn't quite get it, but the you was like, well, you stick with family. Blood is blood. Blood is thicker than Water and all that kind of stuff. Right. And so what we know about you is that you're somebody that has other people's back. And you, you're loyal.
[42:43] B: Don't become loyal to many people.
[42:45] A: Well, here's the interesting thing. What I want you to realize from this situation isn't about not being loyal. So it's about not.
[42:54] C: Not trusting.
[42:57] B: It's not about not trusting.
[42:59] A: No.
[42:59] B: I don't trust anyone but myself.
[43:01] C: Well, watch.
[43:02] A: I want you to get this right. So trust is a bad idea in the world that we live in because it's a crooked world. And to think that people always have my best interest in mind. Will only feel that way when mine matches theirs. But as soon as mine doesn't match their best interest, then it'll be very different. Got it. So it'll feel that way. So here's the key thing, and this is what I mean by that. In Dances with Wolves, people say that. Kevin Costner, old movie.
[43:37] B: Yeah, I know.
[43:38] A: Got the wolves to trust him. And he didn't get the wolves to trust him. Yes, he became a member of the wolf pack, but not because they trusted him. Because the wolves watched his behavior being demonstrated over and over and over and over and over again. And so being demonstrated over and over and over and over and over again, they allowed him to get closer and closer and closer and become part of the pack. But don't think for a moment that if his behavior changed, they didn't all attack and kill him. And none of them would be feeling betrayed. So here's the coolest thing. What's happening now?
[44:29] B: What's the coolest thing?
[44:30] A: Well, what's happening now?
[44:32] B: You're kind of making me sit back and just like, look at. Yes, my sister knew what to expect from me because that's what, repetitiously I had been raised with. I don't really think I even thought about it, actually. It was how I was raised. That was the life I was living. To me, that was normal. Now, having had other experiences, I realize that that's not right.
[45:03] A: So two things. A, we wanna be getting that younger you and you realizing here that she.
[45:11] B: Couldn'T have not done that based on what she had. It wasn't a choice.
[45:18] A: Got it?
[45:18] B: Yeah.
[45:18] C: Right.
[45:19] A: So you did exactly what occurred for you to do and you couldn't have not done it the sec. Second thing is having gone through that, how much more wise are you? Right? So when people come into me, I'm not. Oh, you need to trust me. No, I don't need your Trust. I want your skepticism, actually, because then I can consistently demonstrate through time.
[45:45] C: Got it.
[45:46] A: And so now close your eyes and think about that younger you doing what she did, going through what she went through, and really appreciate her for what she went through. That's made you that much more wise, that much more able to see things clearly. And even now with an up above and distanced view.
[46:17] C: That's right.
[46:19] A: And as all of that gets in.
[46:22] C: She'S getting that appreciation and acknowledgement from.
[46:26] A: You for how courageous.
[46:31] C: That's right.
[46:35] A: And she grows up with that wisdom inside. All the way up and up and up and up. Within you, lighter and lighter and lighter and up. So that when you're ready, you'll take.
[46:48] C: Another deep breath in and then exhale and open your omniscient. Yeah.
[47:01] B: That's strange.
[47:03] C: What's strange?
[47:07] B: To just acknowledge the role that I played in. That made me feel better.
[47:11] C: It did, didn't it?
[47:12] B: Yeah.
[47:13] C: Yeah. Yeah.
[47:15] A: Because you get to be a person of your word.
[47:17] B: Yeah.
[47:18] A: And, you know, all we have is our word.
[47:21] C: Yeah.
[47:22] B: Yeah.
[47:24] A: And you're also gonna be. That's right. Oh, my goodness. So good. You're awesome.
[47:31] C: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:37] A: So even as you think of Allison.
[47:39] C: Talking about, that's fine, you know, like.
[47:42] A: What led you to do. Why'd you do what you did? Because I knew what I did back then.
[47:47] C: Yeah.
[47:47] A: But I didn't know now.
[47:49] C: Right.
[47:49] A: Would you done the same thing? No, man. I learned shit. I'm not that dumb. Come on now.
[47:56] B: Right. Yeah.
[47:58] C: Yeah. Right.
[47:59] A: Because that's where wisdom comes from.
[48:02] C: Yeah. Right.
[48:03] B: To experience.
[48:04] A: Right. And that's why you have the perspective that things aren't that big of a deal. Because when you do hard times.
[48:11] C: Time.
[48:13] B: I went through a lot of crap.
[48:14] A: That's right.
[48:15] B: Perspective is amazing.
[48:17] A: Yeah. Yours is amazing.
[48:20] C: Than.
[48:23] A: Yeah.
[48:23] B: I appreciate it.
[48:24] A: Yeah. Awesome.
[48:25] B: Feel much better about it. Thank you.
[48:26] A: Yeah, you're welcome.
[48:27] B: I was actually really not looking forward to next week.
[48:30] A: Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's going to be a lot different now.
[48:34] B: Yeah.
[48:34] A: Yeah.
[48:35] B: I flew it.
[48:36] C: Yeah.
[48:37] B: Because she can pick at as much as she wants. It's just. It happened then, right now it doesn't.
[48:42] A: Have the emotional charge. Now you can discuss and talk about it.
[48:45] B: Right?
[48:46] C: Right.
[48:49] B: Yeah.
[48:49] A: And what she's really interested in doing is what we just did.
[48:54] B: Right.
[48:55] A: Even if she doesn't necessarily know how to do that, because therapy goes, oh, it's stuck inside. So we just need to process this. And then if you have a good cry, you'll feel better. You'll get retriggered by all the same crap. But right after crying, you feel a little bit better. Just, like, throwing up. Not that much better, but a little.
[49:15] B: Oh, gross. That's a gross picture.
[49:18] A: Oh, good.
