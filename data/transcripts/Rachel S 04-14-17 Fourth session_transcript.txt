[00:00] A: Today is the 14th of April, Rachel. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. How'd our last session leave you, first of all?
[00:09] B: Fine. Fine. Been doing great.
[00:11] A: Yeah.
[00:12] B: Yeah. What do I notice? I have. Well, I can't believe one. Let me go ahead and start out by saying, can you believe that I've been in Salah five months? Yeah. Time is going by super quick.
[00:29] A: Yeah.
[00:29] B: And I am. I am learning new things about myself and interests that I had absolutely no idea that I might be interested in. I've taken up yoga and meditation and all sorts of things to help quiet these crazy thoughts in my head. It's working. Okay. I have been reading a lot of books by Wayne Dyer.
[00:55] A: You know, he's the guy that says when you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.
[01:00] B: Yes. So I've been really trying to get a firm grip on my intention and being self aware and the energy I put out and what I let back in, all different sorts of stuff that I never thought about before. So how am I? I am surprisingly good. Like, really? You kind of have. You opened up my eyes a little bit as far as. Just because I experienced something in the past does not necessarily mean I have to be trapped by those emotions. Whether it's physically or mentally how I felt going through it then, and I can actually stop and redirect myself. I'm trying to, like, work on these new pathways in my brain, like my knee jerk reaction to some things. Like, you know, you and I discussed the fluff. I'm. It's still a daily. Like, I just got called out about it last night. But I mean, it's better than what it was. It's a marked difference. Yeah.
[02:13] A: Because didn't you talk to me about something where you're gonna have to, like, do more processing?
[02:17] B: Yes.
[02:17] A: With Allison.
[02:18] B: Yes.
[02:18] A: And then you're like, I don't want to talk about that.
[02:20] B: Yeah. Really? Yeah. Yeah. You and I dealt with. You're gonna laugh. You and I dealt with the whole prison issue. And it was like I came in here and was literally, you know, biting my nails off. Like, I. I literally spent three days going over and over and over and pulling apart these situations that had happened in the past that I could not change. You know, the only thing that I was doing was literally making myself physically miserable just at the thought of having to deal with that situation or even talk about it. So I met with Alison. That a lot now. Oh, I'm fine about it. We talked about it. We passed over it. Like, it was no big thing. I couldn't believe it. Like, I fully expected her to say, we need to talk about this for a few months, and said it was like, okay, well, it seems like you and Dr. Q really worked this out and you're okay with it. And I was like, good to go.
[03:20] A: Right. So she thought about the part of, you know, what was it? Being on the flight cuff.
[03:24] B: Yeah.
[03:25] A: And then going in the first night and then hearing the stuff that you heard.
[03:29] B: Yeah. And that has. Yeah. The crystal clear memories. I can objectively look at them and go, yes, that's something that I went through, but it was a learning experience, and I need to try and find that silver lining. You know, what I use now today out of that situation makes me who I am today. Well, what's really don't have to carry that.
[03:49] A: Right. About having gone through that stuff is that when you're hearing the other gals talk about all the drama that's going on in their life, you have a tendency to sit back.
[04:00] B: Yes, I am. I was actually just told that I am. I am a quiet leader of the house. I have no intention. Like, it's unintentional. I just don't get sucked into. Like, to me, I feel like I just have a different philosophy on, like, what is really a big deal and, like, what is, like, really worth getting all worked up for and screaming and crying and all. It's just not that serious.
[04:27] A: Right.
[04:28] B: So, yeah, I have the. More. Like I just told you, I've been really trying to make myself aware of the energy that I put out and the energy that I allow back in. Even though something is happening in the house does not mean that it has to affect me.
[04:44] A: Right. So isn't that cool?
[04:46] B: Yeah. You actually helped me. I'm working on my muscles. You're laughing and I'm laughing. But, like, in all seriousness, thank you so much. Yeah, it's really, really helped me. I live in a house with 10 women. I mean, for Christ's sakes, you see some of them. Holy fuck. It's really, really a powerful thing to pick and choose, like, what energy want to let around me, what I want to let affect me, and what I just don't. It's. It's actually a very powerful thing. And the more that I exercise and see the results from that, the more that I want to do it. So it's something that I work at every day.
[05:28] A: Yeah.
[05:29] B: And it's becoming easier, and I like where it's going. I really do. It makes me it helps make me feel secure with nothing more than just myself, which is awesome.
[05:40] A: Yeah.
[05:41] B: Awesome, huh?
[05:44] A: Yeah.
[05:46] B: Yeah. So that's where, like, you have allowed me to, like, pick up on these intention books and, like, the power of my thoughts and what I project and what I put out as far as if I can really control my response to my memories and be able to deal with the things. Things that I dealt with back then and not compartmentalize them, but understand them and be able to put them away. I can still pull them out and look at them. That doesn't mean it didn't happen. It just means that I don't have to have that strong of a reaction. That means that whatever I'm dealing with in my life now, I should be able to take that step back, take a deep breath, and really try to look at the bigger picture. It's not that.
[06:31] A: Take a step back, take a deep breath and look at the bigger picture.
[06:38] B: Yes.
[06:39] A: Right. There's three different things that that does. The more intense we experience, emotional things, the bigger and closer it is to me. Right. So by taking a step back, I've already removed myself from it. By seeing that in context with everything else, I'm now seeing the big picture, which makes that already smaller. By taking a breath. The breath is the fastest way to change our physiology.
[07:13] B: Yeah.
[07:14] A: And it changes the state we're in.
[07:16] B: Gives you a chance to redirect.
[07:18] A: Yeah. And the cool thing is, nobody goes through adverse situations to get stronger. Nobody sets themselves up to go through crap to become stronger on the other side. But when you are already on the other side, you absolutely are stronger.
[07:37] B: Absolutely.
[07:38] A: Yeah.
[07:39] B: It makes me. I might not word it the way that it should be worded. It just makes me feel better about. I already know. I mean, this is life. Gonna have to deal with some. That being said, it makes me feel better about whatever it is that I deal with or am dealing with or will deal with, to know that there's silver lying, you know, and the situation might suck, but on, you know, the other side of that, I will be stronger or I will be smarter or it won't happen twice, you know, whatever it is that helps me, you know, be okay and deal with it.
[08:19] A: Yeah. Becoming more and more connected to your higher guiding wisdom. Yeah. Yeah.
[08:28] B: Higher power or higher consciousness. Yeah, absolutely.
[08:34] A: Cool. So is there anything currently that's been challenging? Oh, God, I love that face.
[08:44] B: You love that face. Anything that I'm finding challenging? Well, let me go ahead and tell you. We got two new residents in the house, and was I Talking with you about my social anxiety.
[09:04] A: You just mentioned that sometimes when there's lots of people around, you're like.
[09:10] B: I have.
[09:11] A: I love that you call it my social anxiety, as if it's the same thing as your fingers or your arms.
[09:15] B: I know. I claim it. I act like it's me. It's not. It's my body. I understand.
[09:21] A: It's just ways that you feel something.
[09:24] B: Yes.
[09:25] A: Which isn't even your body.
[09:27] B: What is it?
[09:28] A: It's ways that you feel.
[09:31] B: Yes, it is ways that I feel uncomfortable.
[09:34] A: Oh. Well, how much more comfortable do you want to feel in social situations?
[09:41] B: Well, I have.
[09:43] A: And who are the two new people?
[09:45] B: We have two new residents of the house.
[09:47] A: Who are they? What's her names?
[09:49] B: Lily and Rhonda.
[09:50] A: Okay. I haven't heard anything about them yet. You will, I'm sure.
[09:58] B: So, okay, where to start with this? So you and I work together on the fluff, and I'm getting better at it. But notice I said I'm getting better at it. It's something that I have to work at, and I've had to already. They moved me. I spent four months in one room, and they moved me. So 1. My social anxiety really kicked up because I find it easier to deal with other people's emotions rather than my own. And having, you know, come into this program, like I just told you, I've really just started to, you know, look at these different. We'll say, these different interests of mine or these different avenues. And a lot of them have to do with your emotional state. So I'm still trying to come to grips with how I feel about certain things. Like, my emotions will say on a particular situation will surprise me. I'll be like, whoa, you know, where.
[11:09] A: Did that come from?
[11:12] B: I've already had, like. They moved me out of the room that I was really comfortable with, with a resident that was really comfortable with. And they put me in with a new person, which I hear they never do this because I'm still considered new in the program. I believe everything happens for a reason. But they put me in with this new roommate, and I don't know whether that's true. Well, that's what they tell me.
[11:40] A: I don't know if it's a good idea to believe that everything happens for a reason, because then they would think that everything happens because of a higher purpose God somehow intended.
[11:52] B: That is what they.
[11:52] A: So when I was praying really well, God found me the close parking spot. But God was also the person that told me to drop the bomb in Syria.
[12:01] B: You're an asshole. You know that?
[12:03] A: And you know the problem with God is that he's really old and he takes naps. And that's why the bad shit happens, because the dude's snoozing. See, there's a problem if we go that it all happens because of a higher purpose. All things happen for a reason. All things happen because of a cause.
[12:21] B: A higher purpose, a cause. What's the difference?
[12:24] A: Cause. So when we take the car into the mechanic because it's getting poor gas mileage, mechanic puts it on the lift, comes back out and says, there's a really good reason for you to be getting the poor gas mileage. What's that? Well, you have a hole in your gas liner. Gas is dripping. When he said good reason, he didn't mean higher intention. He said that there was an adequate cause. So the difference between cause and bigger reason is bigger reason means that there's somebody up there pointing all the strings. And I don't think that that's how consciousness works. Whether you call it God or not. I don't think that the universe doesn't actually care which direction you go, but whichever one you're going, it'll give you a nudge. So somebody starts traveling down the addiction realm, give them a little nudge towards it. Doesn't matter what direction you go, It'll give you a nudge. And the reason thing always screws. Screws me up. Because that would then mean that God somehow wants little kids to be molested. Oh, well, that doesn't sound like a kind God and a loving God and a caring God or anybody that I want to worship. That guy sounds like a prick.
[13:43] B: Yes, he does.
[13:45] A: Right? You know, there was a religious figure that actually suggested that the Haitians got the earthquake when they got it because they had made a pact with the devil to get the French out. Now, if that's true, that God sounds like a fucking asshole. Yes, it does take a big dump in the middle of the poorest country that was born out of slavery. Yeah, that's cool, dude. Like, don't they have enough to deal with? And do you know why people worship cows? You know the real scientific reason why people worship cows? No, it wasn't the cow the they were worshiping. It's that from the cow poop. They were eating mushrooms that were being psychedelic mushrooms that opened their brain up to higher consciousness and they thought it was coming through the cow. But it was that they had this access to higher consciousness. I swear to God, I was listening to a podcast about this, Rachel. That's where it was. It wasn't that they worked up the cow. Is that the cow? Dung Groom psychedelic mushrooms.
[14:45] B: That's disgusting and twisted, but I'm sure true.
[14:51] A: So get rid of the reason part. Go with the club.
[14:54] B: We'll get rid of the reason part. Cause they moved me into a room with somebody who is newer in their sobriety than my own. And, you know, I'm still, like I said, dealing with this. I've been working at it. It's getting better. Give me some grace when I say this. I am still working with the fucking social anxiety. It's definitely easier to deal with. I no longer feel the need. Like. Like I told you, it's been five months. I can't believe it. When we first had two hour volunteers come and cook us meals, I couldn't sit a half hour without running back to my room and trying to hide. Like, I mean, it's.
[15:38] A: Well, how do you know when to do it?
[15:39] B: Huh?
[15:41] A: How do you know when to do it?
[15:42] B: Know when to do what?
[15:43] A: The social anxiety thing.
[15:45] B: I don't know how I know when to. What do you mean, how I know when to do it? I don't know.
[15:50] A: Well, there are times that you're not doing it, and then there are times that you are. So how do you know when to do it? Where's the context?
[15:57] B: It's still happening. I just make myself stay.
[15:59] A: How do you know when to have it happen?
[16:01] B: I don't know when to have it happen. I just know when it's happening. So I make myself stay.
[16:06] A: You might be where?
[16:08] B: In the dining room.
[16:09] A: Okay. And how do you know that it's happening?
[16:13] B: Because my hands will get sweaty. My heartbeat will speed up.
[16:16] A: Oh, good. So here's the question I have for you. Have your hands ever been sweaty?
[16:21] B: Yes.
[16:22] A: Has your heart ever been beating fast and you weren't anxious?
[16:25] B: Yes.
[16:26] A: Like when you're exercising?
[16:27] B: Yes.
[16:27] A: Oh, okay. What I want you to get out of that, Rachel. And this is the reason why I'm saying it. So there are ways that we remind ourselves to have the problem. An impulse lasts less than 90 seconds. It's really only like a few seconds for any kind of anxiety. But if it is a reminder, then I'm like throwing another log on the fire, which is why it feels like it's on ongoing. So I ask that question and then we go, okay, well, wait a minute. Have you ever had those same things going on and not felt anxious?
[17:06] B: You're telling me that I start to have one or two symptoms and My mind immediately jumps to, this is what I'm supposed to be doing. So.
[17:15] A: Yes.
[17:18] B: So how do I stop my symptoms?
[17:19] A: Well, that's what we're gonna do right now, right? That's why you're.
[17:24] B: I love that you laugh so wonderfully at me. No, seriously, like, I. No, I hadn't really thought about that, but that makes sense. Okay, I'll give you that.
[17:33] A: That's why I asked the question. And it was a weird question. Like, what do you mean? How do I know? But there's something that goes on that's telling me. Yes, it tells your brain. So what you said is, I'm in the situation and I notice my hands feeling sweat in my heart, racing, beating fast.
[17:52] B: Yeah.
[17:53] A: And then what happens?
[17:54] B: Then I started. Like, I have. I am not a very, like, believe it or not, you and I meet them hourly and we talk. I don't like talking. I really. I'm just more of. I read my books. I'm a quiet type person. I don't like feeling like I need to interject or just mindlessly spit, dribble at people just to fill in the blanks when they're staring at you expectantly. Like you're supposed to say something right then. And it makes me feel like you ever. Cliff. Have you ever dove off a cliff or bungee jumped or anything like that? Like that 5 second free fall right before you, you know, realize that, oh, you're actually falling. That like, you know, you're. And then boom.
[18:40] A: So.
[18:41] B: So it's like that.
[18:42] A: Okay, well, if that wasn't going on when somebody was looking at you expectantly.
[18:48] B: Everybody, come on, everybody watch.
[18:50] A: If that wasn't going on for you when somebody was looking at you expectantly, how would you be?
[19:01] B: What are you saying? If I was ignoring people?
[19:03] A: No. If you weren't finding yourself having that thing go on within you when somebody's looking at you expectantly, how would you actually be? Right. So what you just did, Rachel, and what's it like for you when you're.
[19:20] B: Relaxed, Easier to talk.
[19:22] A: Oh, it's easier to talk. Yes, that's right. And when you're relaxed and it's easier to talk, how's your body feeling?
[19:28] B: Well, not sweaty hands and raising heartbeat.
[19:32] A: Right. So how is it feeling if it's not that.
[19:37] B: Pretty normal.
[19:38] A: Pretty normal. Right. So you know, when you're relaxed and it's easier to talk and like, you're like, Pretty normal.
[19:45] B: Yeah, it's amazing when you feel normal.
[19:47] A: Now think of. Watch. Now think about somebody looking at you expectantly. And what do you notice?
[19:53] B: The first thing you do is take that deep breath and tense up.
[19:56] A: Well, did it do the exact same thing that it normally does, or is it already a little less? Because remember, our nervous system learns through repetition, rhythm, rhyme, recursion. So what we want to do is. You already did. You lit up the problematic neural network. Think of that as a container. Now we're going to take you anywhere outside of that. Light up other neural networks, bring it back to the problem. It got to begin to reconfigure itself. Because there's no purpose for your brain doing this to you now. That's right. There might have been at other times. And we also want you to have the freedom that if it makes sense for you to move and go somewhere else, you can. That's right. That's right. And what's happening now?
[20:50] B: Yeah, right.
[20:52] A: So we think of you because we know what it's like. You know, what it's like when you're feeling relaxed. And then, of course, when you're relaxed, you know, it's easier to talk and you're a little more easygoing.
[21:06] B: Yeah, it feels like joy. Oh, it feels like joy.
[21:09] A: And you wouldn't want to, like, you know, feel more joy when you're at the house with all these people, would you? Oh, you would. Okay, good. So we think of you as feeling more joy because you're relaxed and there's that ease inside. And then think about somebody by looking at you. Right. And what do you notice now?
[21:27] B: Not so bad.
[21:28] A: Oh, it's not so bad. That's right. You're so good. I love you.
[21:32] B: You're gonna make me. I'm somebody that you're horrible for me or I'm not.
[21:38] A: See, Rachel, the thing is, you never have to tell anybody that.
[21:40] B: It's different there. Yeah. Because I'm gonna immediately see you staring at me as soon as I sit down for dinner tonight with two hour, you know, volunteer, and somebody's gonna stare at me and I'm gonna go.
[21:54] A: It's not gonna be a problem because you're only doing that with me. You won't actually do it with them. See, your nervous system is doing it with me. Because now it's lightening things up.
[22:06] B: Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Well, because I've talked and you already feel lighter.
[22:10] A: Yes, well, and also because, like, your brain knows how to work with me, and it really actually wants to work in ways that are best for you. And the problem is that you have been thinking of this social anxiety as if it's a part of you?
[22:23] B: Yes. I don't know.
[22:25] A: No, it's like a finger. It isn't, though.
[22:29] B: But that's what I've been thinking about.
[22:31] A: But that's the part that people get confused. What happens with us as we confuse frequently thoughts, feelings and behaviors as attributes, qualities, characteristics, traits, or even worse, identity as if it's me. But you're much more than how you feel. That's right. And how you feel isn't even you. It's just ways that you're feeling at times. And what's been happening is that there are ways that you've been reminded to feel it. And one of the ways that you've been reminded to feel it is like when somebody looks at you.
[23:11] B: Yeah.
[23:13] A: And then when somebody looks at you and you're not sure what to say, and then you notice your palms getting sweaty and your heart's beating faster now. Oh, it must be this thing. Except what we started to do is break that apart because you know that there lots of other times when your heart's beating fast and your hands are sweating and you're not feeling anxious at all. Like when you're like, exercising. Right, that's right. And so now we're just doing exercises to get your brain really tuned so that you have that much more ease because you know what it's like when you're feeling, you know, more comfortable.
[23:44] B: Yeah.
[23:44] A: And more easy going. And that's why you're the quiet leader, because you're more easy going. You're not getting riled up.
[23:53] B: Yes.
[23:54] A: With all the stuff that goes on. Yes, that's right. And that's what makes you the quiet leader, because you're not leading by what you're saying. You're leading by example, which is how people really know. That's right. That's right. And you wouldn't want to be thinking that all the stuff you went through is what's giving you the power to be that quiet theater.
[24:14] B: No, no, of course not.
[24:16] A: You wouldn't mind rethinking of it. That's right. Right.
[24:21] B: So basically, let me.
[24:24] A: You're so good above it.
[24:25] B: Let me run this five year old.
[24:26] A: Yeah, yeah.
[24:27] B: So if I. If you were to say. We'll say, for instance, you know, Rachel, who are you? If I was to answer something like mother, daughter or sister, those would all be wrong. If I identified with what I did as a job, that would be wrong too. You're all of those things, but you're more.
[24:46] A: Yeah. So the key thing is in the conversation isn't to Be. But it isn't to not be able to say those things, but to be able to say those things knowing that you're even more than just that. Right. Because I'll give the example to people. I go, I could say I am a therapist. But see, if I'm frozen, that I am a therapist. What does it mean? I cannot be anything else. Right. But aren't I more than just that? Isn't there a lot more to me than just being that? And that isn't even me. It's something I do. So the idea is, it's interesting to be able to go up and introduce yourself to somebody saying whatever it is that you're saying to them, but also knowing that you're much more than that.
[25:37] B: I like that.
[25:38] A: That's right. And see, we can't have that conversation with everybody.
[25:44] B: No.
[25:45] A: We only start having that conversation as people's minds begin to open to the possibility that they're more than their feelings. Exactly. That's right.
[25:55] B: I like that. I really do.
[25:56] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So now think about you being at the house, you know, being more relaxed and you're just kind of reading and. Or you might be doing whatever you're doing. You know, there's that, you know, sense of comfort that you have inside. Because that's where the comfort is, is inside of you. Yes. Right. And, you know, you might be there and then, like, somebody might be, like they're talking and they go, right. And what do you notice?
[26:23] B: Not the same reaction.
[26:24] A: Not doing the same thing anymore. That's right. That's right.
[26:30] B: You have such a simple way of breaking shit down. I love it. I really do. I don't know why we can't think of this crap on our own, but.
[26:37] A: I guess maybe the connection and the issue is, and I'm going to tell you the really simple thing. In order to do any kind of change work, you first have to light up the problem. That's the neural network. Then. Then you disassociate from the problem. Then you begin to attach resources, get the person in a more resourceful state. Then you bring the resources to the problem and it starts to change it. That's what we did the first time. Then we talked about the loop. And because our brain works with recursion, that's how we learn. Then we bring it back, then we start talking about other things, and then we get more into that state. And then I keep bringing it back to the problem. But what happens? Why we don't get solutions in other areas? Because we're doing it out of this connection. And it's really hard to get those solutions when I'm the one doing it to myself because I'm in the problem and there are no solutions contained in the problem. That's why it's a problem. If there were solutions can contained in it, we wouldn't have a problem. That's the issue. And Einstein, which is the craziest thing, he said that. And this is where people get it screwed up. They go, oh, the definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again, expecting change. But that's not what Einstein said. What he said is you cannot solve a problem at the same logical level in which it was created. You have to go up, down or out levels and cause it to change. So that's why we get the person lit up in whatever the problem is. Then we disassociate them from the problem, Then we get them into the more resourceful state, then we bring the resources back to the problem. Because what that starts to do is even when the problem starts getting triggered, I'm immediately now in the resource, right? And the issue with problems isn't that I don't have the resources, it's that they're just not linked to the problem. So now we think of you. You know, you might be at the house, you might be doing whatever, and somebody might be like, yeah, and see, you started laughing. But what that does is lighten up the nervous system and things start to lighten up. And not that you would laugh there because your nervous system will appropriate to what it is, right?
[29:05] B: Well, it would be appropriate for the situation, but it's just already, yeah, lighter.
[29:10] A: Just like if I was doing something that was about removing cravings and urges, or I was doing something that got somebody who didn't want to eat a certain food because they ate it too much or too often or what have you. Yeah, we might create at first a repulsion so that when they thought about it, they were like repulsed. Made them feel disgustingly gross. But what their nervous system will begin to reset is that they just don't have an interest in. Doesn't mean they're going to get violently ill from it. But at first we might want to make it a repulsive thing for them in particular if it's a really problematic thing that they've been doing too much of, whether it be a certain thing that they've been eating too much, much of our, you know, problematic thoughts to use. Well, let's get that repulsive at first so that it might even have the thought I feel, like, disgusting. You know, and as I told you before, when we do that little silly thing about, you know, I'm not. You're not. It's not. It's that the brain works with patterns of association. So yourself. Can you do that to yourself?
[30:22] B: Yeah.
[30:23] A: Do what is the. That.
[30:25] B: Well, you're talking about if you want to stop yourself from having. We'll say you're doing something too much, and you want to stop yourself from doing it. Can you make yourself repulsed at the thought of doing it? Do you understand what I'm trying to say? Because you kind. You kind of have blundered into. I used to be a smoker. I quit smoking when I came into this program.
[30:51] A: Right.
[30:51] B: I can't walk past an ashtray at this point without being utterly repulsed. Like, even people that smoke stink. And, I mean, I. I quit several times before, but, like, it was never on, like, a repulsive level. Like.
[31:05] A: Right.
[31:06] B: I will actually back away from someone who smoked cigarettes just because they smell like a freaking ashtray.
[31:11] A: Right.
[31:12] B: So can you do that yourself?
[31:14] A: Well, you did, didn't you?
[31:15] B: Well, so it is. I'm just trying to put the two together. You know what I'm saying? Because, like, it didn't even dawn on me.
[31:23] A: Somebody changes that kind of thing. That's what starts to happen.
[31:27] B: So, okay, once. Once you repulse yourself from this, I'll use my smoking as an example.
[31:36] A: Right.
[31:36] B: From that bad habit. Then what happens?
[31:39] A: Well, now you create something else to do.
[31:42] B: Oh, okay. Meaning you go. Yeah.
[31:45] A: Something other than that. Right. The problem with cigarette stuff is that it tends to get attached to other behaviors.
[31:53] B: Mm. Yeah.
[31:57] A: So once you get that. And now it's repulsed, now it stops being attached to the behaviors, and you have the opportunity to do other things.
[32:05] B: Yes.
[32:06] A: Other than that. Anything. Other than that.
[32:09] B: Anything.
[32:09] A: That's right.
[32:10] B: It is sort of. Yeah.
[32:13] A: Yeah.
[32:14] B: Get high. Smoke a cigarette. Go drink a beer and smoke cigarette. And do anything. Go smoke cigarette.
[32:18] A: Right.
[32:19] B: So now do anything else.
[32:21] A: Right.
[32:21] B: Don't smoke cigarette.
[32:22] A: Yes, exactly.
[32:22] B: Go do anything else.
[32:23] A: Exactly. Right.
[32:26] B: Yeah. I was just wondering.
[32:29] A: Not only that, you got yourself into a comp. Completely different environment.
[32:36] B: Yeah. Which is why. Can I talk to you about me being, like, so completely and utterly in love with this idea of, like, recreating myself while I'm in this program?
[32:46] A: Well, that's what you're doing.
[32:47] B: Yes.
[32:47] A: Yeah.
[32:48] B: I'm working hard at it.
[32:49] A: Who you are, even.
[32:51] B: So why would I continue? Old and bad habits.
[32:55] A: You're. You're not just working hard. Hard at It. Because I want you to check. Is it hard?
[33:00] B: No, it's not hard. Right. It's your.
[33:04] A: What you're doing is you're seeing this as an opportunity to become more of who you really are, which is much more than any of those problematic behaviors or actions or thoughts or. Yes, right. You're seeing this as an opportunity to recreate who do you want to be in this world? How do you want to be in this world? And notice that it's states of being which then lend to whatever it is that you do.
[33:34] B: Yeah, yeah.
[33:36] A: That's the whole thing. And that's why I asked the question. Right. If that wasn't going on, how would you be? And you said to me, I'd be more relaxed. Not only did you say that you'd be more relaxed, but when you said be more relaxed, you actually accessed being more relaxed.
[33:58] B: Yeah.
[33:58] A: So sometimes with people, they might say the word but not be the state of it. So then I'm gonna do things to get them to be the state of it. Because the beingness is what then gives and lends to the change. Yeah, yeah.
[34:18] B: Because actually, just talking to you about that, I've sat forward and sat back several times during her. I usually do. Yeah. It's just interesting. You have the little things that, you know, you point out or I can pick up on what you say that. Absolutely. You're right. When I talk to you about relaxing about something, I'll sit back and relax.
[34:36] A: Yeah. Right. And that comes out of our connection and our shared interest.
[34:43] B: Yes.
[34:44] A: And having things work best for you.
[34:47] B: Right.
[34:48] A: Yeah. Which you're doing, all of that. Thanks. Yeah. Oh, it's awesome. I'm so excited for you. Thank you. Well, you're amazing. Really.
[35:03] B: I mean, you are. It's amazing, right. What our brains can do. It's crazy.
[35:08] A: Yeah. Right. And accessing more. And now what you're doing because you're already a reader is now it's not just reading, you know, smutty romance novels.
[35:21] B: That I can burn through or reading Self help or.
[35:24] A: Now you're reading books that are about bettering you. Yeah. Right. And then I might point out little bits that I think. Because a lot of Self Help will talk about that. And I think intention is powerful.
[35:41] B: Yeah.
[35:42] A: So Wayne Dyer has the program on the power of intention. One of his books is the Power of Intention. He did an audio program that I probably listened to, I don't know, a hundred times on all of my.
[35:56] B: I read a Yoke book, said that it's amazing. The Bible was printed like thousands of years ago. And yet we read it over and over and over again. Every time we read it, we get something new out of it. Whereas.
[36:07] A: Do you know why that happens?
[36:10] B: Why does that happen? Because you're different every time you read it.
[36:14] A: Every time you read it.
[36:15] B: I was gonna say, where you are mentally or in your life is different every time you read it.
[36:19] A: That's right.
[36:19] B: You can always get, like, something out of it.
[36:22] A: Right. Like, there's only a few books that.
[36:27] B: You can do that.
[36:28] A: That I have. Well, I don't know whether, for me.
[36:31] B: Personally, thousands of years.
[36:33] A: There's only a few books that I have that I keep.
[36:37] B: Oh, yeah.
[36:39] A: I imagine there's lots of books that I've read.
[36:41] B: The Bible. Yeah.
[36:42] A: And I thought it was, you know, an interesting thing.
[36:44] B: But you don't keep it.
[36:45] A: Right, but there are a few books that I keep.
[36:48] B: Yeah.
[36:49] A: Because I could read them again and I would get something completely different than what I got the first time. And that's why we keep adding to what we're doing.
[37:02] B: Yes.
[37:03] A: The brain keeps learning in a recursive pattern.
[37:05] B: Yes. Because you continually grow.
[37:07] A: Yeah.
[37:07] B: You really don't. I don't care what anyone says.
[37:10] A: Well, it's that we continue to grow and that the nature of it is. And this is the neat thing. So when you talked about if I say I am this. Right. And we talked about knowing that you're more than just that, we also say what happens with human beings is that we nominalize things. What a nominalization is, is it changes a process and makes it a thing.
[37:38] B: Okay, can you give me an example?
[37:40] A: It changes a verb and makes it a noun. For example, I have this belief, but a belief is not a real thing.
[37:53] B: Right. It's not tangible.
[37:55] A: It's a process. Something I'm ongoingly doing. I'm ongoingly believing this. Or when somebody comes in. Because this is common with couples. I hate my relationship as if it's a ship. An actual thing. But see, a relationship is a process of relating ongoingly. So then the question becomes, how do you want to be relating? Not based on how it's been, but how do you want to be relating? So then we go, well, all we are is change, which we denominatorize by saying all we are is always changing. That's right. Yeah. And then I love the other line that I say because I remind myself of this.
[38:54] B: Would that be why you say it?
[38:56] A: I got it from somebody else because I think it was masterful. And that is, no matter what you think you are, you're always more than that.
[39:08] B: Very true.
[39:09] A: And I might say in a counseling session, no matter what you think is going on, there's even more going on than that because our awareness is only going to process a smaller amount of what's actually happening.
[39:23] B: Yeah. All of us. Yes.
[39:27] A: We're going to be paying attention to what we pay attention to. And no matter what we're paying attention to and how much of it, there's even more that we're not paying attention to. Right. And that's where a guy that I learned a lot of stuff from is attention shifting. And that's what we started to use with the sweaty palms in the heart is attention shifting. Because if that's how I know that I'm going to be having it, what is it that you weren't paying attention to that you could. Other than that, that then begins to change what it was that I was experiencing. And that's where Wayne Dyer's thing goes. When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change. Right. And he got that. Because an electron, you can't ever observe one in the wild because your observation of it changes.
[40:27] B: It was a diary. Who said if you see something coiled in a corner at twilight, you might think it was a snake. If you see it in the daylight, it might be a rope. And in the dark, you see nothing at all.
[40:45] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[40:47] B: So depending on. Yeah. What time of day or what state of mind or where it is you are. It depends on what the hell you're looking at.
[40:52] A: That's right. That's right. So now, you know, think about being in the house and somebody's like, I. I'm just.
[41:02] B: Now I'm forever going to picture you just leaning forward. I think I got. But I do appreciate it.
[41:07] A: Yeah.
[41:08] B: Sometimes, I'll be honest. It's the simple things that really work. You know, I have a tendency to really. I've got a monkey mind. I will tear the hell out of some shit. So just having someone sit there and laugh at me and go, why are you doing this? Sometimes is exactly what I need. Because why in the hell am I doing this? I appreciate it.
[41:31] A: Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. Cool.
[41:35] B: I'm sure they will be calling you about. Because you were actually the topic of discussion how much we absolutely love.
