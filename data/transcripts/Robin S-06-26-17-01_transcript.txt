[00:00] A: So today is the 26th of June, Robin. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that you can have access to it. I can send you it as an MP3, but I wanted to make sure that was okay with you.
[00:14] B: Okay, absolutely, yes.
[00:17] A: Awesome. So what is it that you think would be useful for me to know? What is it that we're actually wanting to get better for you? If we could really change problematic ways you feel, think, act, react. Yes. What would be useful for me to know? And what do we actually want our time to do for you?
[00:33] B: Okay. My intention, you know, my intention is to be able to unstick, to heal the traumas that I feel that I'm perpetuating in a hamster wheel. My mind is my worst enemy. My head, my thoughts are my worst enemy.
[00:52] A: Okay.
[00:52] B: I feel. And that scares. You have to excuse my language. I can speak. I scares the shit out of me.
[00:59] A: Yeah.
[01:00] B: Okay. Because I feel like if I can identify my enemy, I can avoid my enemy. You know, if it's a person, I can just avoid that person. If I feel there's a problem, how do I avoid myself? You know, that becomes a lot more tricky, especially, you know, in the middle of the night.
[01:19] A: Well, it would be your thoughts.
[01:20] B: Okay.
[01:21] A: My thoughts are not yourself.
[01:22] B: Okay.
[01:23] A: So I want to get you the difference as human beings just to kind of elaborate, because if I go, I am my own worst enemy.
[01:31] B: Right.
[01:31] A: It's thinking.
[01:33] B: Right.
[01:34] A: So what happens with human beings is we tend to over identify my thoughts as me.
[01:40] B: That's right.
[01:40] A: We don't do that with other body stuff. So if I have an upset stomach and I'm gassy, I don't walk around saying, I am gas.
[01:50] B: That's right.
[01:50] A: If I've got some splotches from skin cancer, I don't go, I am skin cancer. But if I have an ugly thought or I say something stupid, I go, I'm an idiot. We over identify our thoughts as me. You might be having disturbing thoughts.
[02:09] B: That's right.
[02:10] A: That come to your mind at times that you don't want to be having them.
[02:14] B: Right.
[02:15] A: Okay. Different than you are. That's your own worst.
[02:19] B: Absolutely. That's absolutely true. And I. I try to watch what I say too, because the I am is always so powerful and potent. Statements. Sure. And I don't want, you know, my. I don't want it myself, you know, I don't want to, like, create that, you know, just. I'm trying to be as concise as possible. Back in 2016, 2015, rather, I decided to end my marriage of 30 years.
[02:47] A: Okay.
[02:47] B: It was just. I wanted more growth, more intimacy in my life than I experienced with my partner. I had a great life. I've been an entrepreneur since I've been 21 years old. Raised three children. I've had like three or four different businesses at times. All, you know, I consider my life to be extremely successful. And I'm speaking in terms of my heart, not in terms of money, although that came as well. And I decided that, you know, I couldn't grow, I couldn't be me. I couldn't have my needs met. So I ended the marriage of 30 years. It was my choice. I also decided to end a business that I owned and grow created of 24 years. And that had a lot of, you know, parts to it too, because it was like a family there.
[03:36] A: Okay.
[03:36] B: You know, they had been my. All my employees had been with me almost 15 years, and I had quite a few. And, you know, because I. My philosophy is that is to always love. And they felt that and they knew that, I'm sorry, I'm gonna get very emotional, but they knew that I cared about them.
[03:53] A: Yeah.
[03:54] B: And anyway, so I made those decisions. And 2015, I lived in my marital home with my husband, but we were in separate rooms.
[04:01] A: Okay.
[04:02] B: 2016, I was alone in the marital home. And again, I thought I had the strength. I've always had the strength. But I've realized that I think a lot of the traumas too, are that I realized how much I negated my own needs, my own wishes, my own sense of. Throughout my whole life, you know, I was always more giving and thinking about everybody else. And I know that sounds so, like, housewifey, you know, but it's just like I have been reliving a lot of the things, especially writing my book of how I've always buried, buried, buried, that I never thought I could express myself. My husband could not hear what I had to say, and I just shoved it aside and I put all my energy into what I thought was purposeful in my life, which was my business was a service business. You know, I started it because I cared about women. And it was out of that wanting and that desire that I created the business. It wasn't like, oh, this is a great business. Make a lot of money, let's do it. It was because of the feeling that I wanted to impart on other women because I realized I lacked complete self esteem and self worth in myself. And it was a realization I came to when my daughter was 13. So I would have been like. I'd been like, 38 years old, just to give you an idea, and so I can get lost. So I made the decision to open a business. It went like a rocket. After four months, it just went completely black and did wonderfully well. And I say that only to say that I feel like my whole life has been guided. You know, I feel like source, spirit, God, however, universal energy, however you, you know, however you define it or all the words are fine with me. Have always. You know, I've always felt like there's a download, like, what are you supposed to do next, Robin? And it comes to me like that. You know, I'm not religious, but I'm very spiritual. You know, I'm not like a, you know, carry the Bible around with me or anything, but I've always been a person that's wanted to learn, to grow, to expand myself. Very productive. And again, this. There's a purpose of me telling you all this. And, you know, like, I could do a lot of things at one time. I would have my days planned out. Like, I would get up in the morning and say, okay, I got four hours before I go into the store. I take my tea, I go out, I'd read books, I study. At night, I'd go for bike rides, listening to my ipod, my. Whatever that little thing's called, that were popular. And I would download material because I'm also an evolutionary astrologer.
[07:00] A: Okay?
[07:00] B: So I studied that for eight years. So I would study, I would work. And I didn't have to work all the time because of the. I had great employees. So it's not like I was. So I had what I thought was a great life. All missing, though, was my intimate relationship with my husband, you know, sorely lacking. So when I made the decision, I was very. I thought, I can handle this. I can handle anything, you know. And when he. When he. He left the house, the marital home, I lived there for a while. I completely fell apart, like, in January of 2016. And what I mean by completely fell apart is I. I couldn't take care of myself.
[07:44] C: I lost, like, ten pounds. I didn't drive. So I had somebody come in, like a roommate who needed a place to live. And kind of in exchange, she did.
[07:57] B: Cooking, and, you know, she lived rent free, and she took care of me.
[08:02] A: Yeah.
[08:03] B: So I'm saying that all to say.
[08:05] C: That being the person that I quote.
[08:08] B: Was.
[08:11] C: To becoming that person was, like, unbelievable. It was such a humbling experience. And the worst part of it was that my Sleep has been like this for a year and a half. And if I didn't have makeup on, you'd see these big rings under my eyes. But there would be nights that I don't sleep at all. And it was torture. And, you know, that's the past. Oh, but it's still. The sleep is still a big deal because I feel scared. And so About July of 2016, I started writing my book. I was on a plane and I was gonna have.
[09:02] B: I felt like I was gonna have a panic attack.
[09:05] C: So I got my shit together and I said, robin, sit in the seat and pull out your computer. And I did. I just started writing. And that's how it started with the book. And so I spent the rest of.
[09:17] B: 2016 in the marital home, but I was really unhappy there. Just too many memories, blah, blah, blah. So I switched houses with my husband. December of 2016, I went to his little townhouse that he owns in St. Pete, and he went back to the marital home, which is where he lives now, which is up for sale.
[09:33] A: Okay.
[09:34] B: So that's kind of this energetic kind of attachment. It's still exists that I don't want anymore. We're very good. We're good friends. Good. I don't know. There's some stuff, you know, we're both trying to work through, but we're friends. And he's been wonderful with the divorce. It was no problems with that, no fighting, nothing. And so here I am, and I'm thinking, like I said, making this move. And I just. Like I said, I still don't sleep because the. The thoughts come in, and the thoughts are, can you do it? Do you have the energy to do it? Do you have enough energy, you know, physical energy to do it? I hate being alone. I have a roommate. She's been an angel. And I got her because I just did not want to live alone. It was very scary. And when she moved in in December, I mean, I've grown a lot over this last six months. A lot. But when she first moved in, I mean, I'd wake up at like 4:35 in the morning, and I was just crying hysterically. And she, you know, I'd go in, she'd hold me.
[10:42] C: I mean, she was like almost like.
[10:44] B: A mother and just regress for just a moment.
[10:51] C: I think I understand what a lot.
[10:53] B: Of the triggers are, but not all of them. And one I think was a big deal is just that I'm realizing how much I gave myself away in so many instances. And it's the recognition of that that brings up, I think, a lot of trauma that I went through at that.
[11:13] C: Time, but I buried it.
[11:16] B: So it's like when the structures left.
[11:19] C: My business, my marriage, it's like everything.
[11:22] B: I wasn't expecting came up. One of the biggest things was from the age of nine to about 21, I was abused by my stepfather. Now, from nine to 15, it was just more like emotional abuse. And then from 15 to 21, it was sexual abuse.
[11:42] A: Okay.
[11:43] B: So there's a lot of. I feel a lot of shame, a lot of guilt.
[11:48] C: Always felt that. I mean, I always. I think I'm bad.
[11:52] B: There's something. There's something in me that thinks I'm bad. And I think I have felt I'm bad from when I was a little girl.
[11:59] C: I'm very.
[12:00] B: I'm a very sensitive person. I think I'm very extremely intuitive. I think I'm extremely empathic with other people. And I think my family really didn't understand that.
[12:12] C: So I learned, I think, to keep.
[12:13] B: My mouth shut, you know, to be safe.
[12:16] C: Otherwise I wouldn't be loved. And so that's like a big deal to me, is to feel loved. It's like huge, huge. And I feel abandoned and rejected a lot of the time. And so from 9 to 15, like.
[12:33] B: I said, it was more that. And then when I was 21, I was able to get away. I was able. Able to get out of the house. And he kind of threw me out. And so I took them before he changed his mind. I gathered my things together and went in to live with my first husband here, my daughter's father. But before I left, and I was talking to my counselor about this, but before I left, I took a few.
[12:59] C: Minutes to write a letter to my mom to apologize to her, because I thought that I was supposed to take care of her. And by me leaving, I thought she would be left alone with this monster. But I had to go, obviously. And, you know, I went on to start a business. I had my own business at 21 years old. I mean, my own retail store that I was responsible for. So, you know, I wasn't afraid of life. I wasn't afraid of anything. I always thought if I wanted to do something I could do, didn't matter what it was, I could learn it. I knew how to put chimneys and roofs. I mean, whatever I needed to learn, I'd learn. So it's just I want so much to be me again and to live my purpose. And I think this move to California is going to be very helpful. But I'm I feel so scared that physically, I've got to be able to rest. I've got to be able to sleep. And when I do, I'm a different person. I'm so strong, things don't bother me, but that doesn't mean they're still not buried.
[14:21] A: Okay.
[14:24] C: So I just. You know, and I just had a. I. I met a man in my spiritual community the third week of March, and we got close very fast. I mean, there was just this instant, like, soul connection. And I loved him dearly. And we were, like, really tight for about six or seven weeks. My whole demeanor changed. I was happy. I woke up happy. And then he decided that he'd been married twice before. He decided that he didn't want any kind of, like, relationship, although we're still.
[15:11] B: Talking all the time. But he didn't want any more intimacy between us because he said it attached. Attached us to each other, and he.
[15:19] A: Didn'T want that anymore. Sex.
[15:21] C: Yeah.
[15:22] B: Which was amazing with him because there.
[15:25] C: Was so much love. And so I had this. What? I felt like. I felt like. I felt like I'd been starving. And then this buffet showed up, and I'm like, this is good. This is good. Oh, my God, this is amazing. And then all of a sudden, I went back and it was gone. It was just an empty table. And I realized that. I feel that, you know, we create what we need to create in order to grow. And I feel like I just. I created this so that I could be more independent again. But it hurt. And, you know, because of that, of all my past and everything, and I just. I can't tolerate bullshit anymore from anybody. It's like, say it like it is. Be honest or get the fuck out of my life. That's how I feel. And it's just hard for me to look at some of this stuff because I ran from it for so long. You know, I feel like my whole life I ran. I just took it and just buried it and went on because I wasn't gonna be kept down. Nothing could keep me down. And I feel that way now, except I don't have the power. And so I feel like it's just a process I have to go through.
[17:01] A: And how do you know?
[17:02] C: How do I know what?
[17:03] A: That you don't have the power.
[17:04] C: Oh, yes, I don't.
[17:09] A: Oh, you don't know?
[17:11] C: I don't know. I don't know.
[17:13] A: You don't know whether you don't have the power. So then maybe you do, huh?
[17:18] C: Yeah.
[17:19] A: Okay.
[17:21] C: I just don't feel well, because I'm not sleeping. And it's just like this. Last year, I have died. Every modality you can think of.
[17:32] A: What is it that happens at night when you lay down?
[17:38] C: It happens even before then. I start thinking about the night if I'm gonna sleep, because it's so much torture when I don't sleep. It's the thoughts, and then I'm tired. It's like my brain just goes.
[17:51] A: Do you stay in bed thinking the thoughts?
[17:54] C: No, I usually get up and walk or I try to breathe through them. If it's just anxiety, I try to.
[18:00] A: What are the thoughts about?
[18:01] C: Just doubts, fears, and everything that you can possibly imagine that the ego could throw up at you. Oh, you know. You know, you should. You should go to California. When you go to California, you should.
[18:14] B: See your mother and, you know.
[18:17] C: You know, Joe doesn't really love you and, you know, and. And maybe. Maybe you're never gonna be yourself again. Maybe you're just never. Never gonna get there. That you're just gonna, like, wither away or, you know, just stupid stuff like that.
[18:33] A: Just.
[18:33] C: And one after the other.
[18:35] B: Oh, what about this happened today?
[18:37] C: This. You know.
[18:38] B: You know, so maybe something happened during.
[18:40] C: The day that was just a little bit disconnected, you know, My mind will bring that back in. It's like. It's like an attack on myself, you know, it's like. I don't know why I do that or what. That's where I feel like I'm stuck, because why would I do that?
[19:02] A: Well, you're not, are you?
[19:04] C: Well, I'm not what?
[19:05] A: Doing it. You're not doing it?
[19:11] C: My subconscious is doing it.
[19:13] A: I don't know whether it's that.
[19:15] C: Okay, well, you probably know.
[19:17] A: I don't know whether you're doing it or not, but I don't think that you are doing it. It's not like you're choosing. Laying out like you would plan your morning.
[19:27] C: Oh, no.
[19:28] A: Okay, I'm gonna do these things and then I'm gonna go. It's not like you're planning, oh, I'm gonna have these worries and these thoughts.
[19:34] C: No, it's just. I get scared. I don't even know. My days are like my own. I'm recreating my life when the get down. It's scary because I'm used to.
[19:44] B: I'm used to, like, a pattern or.
[19:46] C: You know, or having something I'm going to or.
[19:50] A: So we want you to be thriving through uncertainty because things got thrown out of whack when things that you felt you had certainty about business, marriage, stuff like that, that had those routines that you were used to. All of a sudden those structures aren't there and there's lots of uncertainty. Which, by the way, is the only place that possibility comes from is in uncertainty. True possibility only exists in uncertainty. It's about being able to let go of the form in which it once was. Right? So in the Vedic teachings of the Three Gunas, the being, the doing, the having, the doing is the sustaining energy. And then we're going through the transformation. So that I have. But the having is also the letting go of the form. Because the form never stays the same. The form is always changing to a new being which might include parts of it, but be a bigger container. Because it's not that we get rid of all of the things that work. We just may need to transform how you experience it. And that's what I mean by in uncertainty is where there's true possibility when we start. That's right. Once we start having future worries, there's no reality constraints, which is what makes them a big deal. But here's a key thing. See, in order for you to be experiencing ideas about you not doing well in the future, the only way that you can do that is in comparison to what doing well would be. Which means you have to know what doing well looks like in order to create pictures of not doing well. What we get screwed up in is that we forget that we actually have to. In order to know that I'm not doing well in the future, I have to know what doing well would be like.
[22:15] C: Right?
[22:15] A: Exactly. But that's not where the attention has been brought, Right. So the hidden ability in that anxiety and that fear and that being scared is in order for me to picture myself not doing well in the future. The only way that I can know that I'm not doing well is to be comparing it to something which means I know what doing well would look like. And I'm wondering how you could be using that on the problem so that it gets rid of the problem altogether. If we go too far in the future, that's when we lose predictive accuracy. It's like the weather. Five minutes from now, we can look outside, we can guess, predict what it's going to be. But if we go five hours, the accuracy drops.
[23:08] B: That's right.
[23:08] A: Five days, five weeks, five months, five years. The accuracy.
[23:12] B: Yes.
[23:13] A: So we want to have, like, you having intentions of how you want to be and the widest range in how to get to where you're headed so that you have More ease in doing what is the smallest next step towards where you're going. That's one about future two. I get that what you learned how to do early on and where therapists got it wrong, they would suggest to you, and this would be a post hypnotic suggestion, that you buried it, which means the yucky stuff is somehow deep inside of you. However, I want to give you a different thought on that. What if, Robin, the yucky stuff isn't buried deep inside of you? What if instead you, you learned the best coping mechanism that any human being has when it comes to negative stuff, which is I just avoid thinking about it and I do other things. And again, as you were active and engaged in creating businesses, being an entrepreneur, being a wife, raising a family, doing stuff for your kids, you were engaged, so you were busy mind was active and engaged doing things, which made it a lot easier to avoid thinking about yucky stuff. Then there was a change. Kids were already raised.
[24:49] B: That's right.
[24:50] A: I'm not going to be doing this business anymore. I'm going to step away from my marriage. And now there's this spot. And then what you're noticing is, oh, yucky. Disturbing thoughts are now happening. Some of them are about future worlds, worries and my capacities and capabilities. But some of it has to do with yuckiness about how I felt about me because of what happened. Like you said, there's been like dirty and bad and wrong and shame and guilt and that. That has been more present recently than it ever had been.
[25:31] B: Yes.
[25:31] A: Because there's been more space. In a similar fashion.
[25:35] B: Yes.
[25:36] A: There are many people that have retired who were Vietnam vets, that had no symptomatic post traumatic stress until they retired because they were busy raising families, doing the work.
[25:53] B: Right.
[25:53] A: Living life, that now they retired and they have like, you know, the golden years. Right. Great to remember all the horrors that I've done a really good job of avoiding thinking about. So the other thing is, it's not that they got buried, it's that when we go through particularly troubling experience, it just short circuits the emotional part of the brain. And what that means is that part of the brain kind of gets stuck on a perpetual loop.
[26:24] B: Yes.
[26:25] A: The rest of me moves forward, but at a deeper aspect, it's stuck on a perpetual loop, meaning the memory of what happened and this experience of it happening get merged together. So at a deeper level, it's if the memory is the experience. So the nature of why people are still haunted by the yucky stuff they went through isn't because of how awful it was Isn't because they shouldn't have done it or it shouldn't have happened or any of the other things. It's because at a deeper level, the memory and the experience are locked as if they're the same thing. Meaning that memory is being re experienced as if it's happening every time I think about it or reminded of it. At a deeper level, my mind never got the good news that it stopped. So again, therapy may have gotten it wrong. Is we've encouraged people to process, let's get those bad feelings out of you. Which encourages people to really get into it and painfully emote. Which I go most therapists then are sadists. Because they're just watching the criticism. And the worst thing ever. You eating popcorn. Wow. This is a great horror story, right? I mean, it's a crazy idea where we have the reversal. It's about getting in good news that those moments have stopped. That's right. And when the brain gets that those moments have stopped, it stops causing the bad feelings. Feelings. The thing I'd like you to realize is that your brain doesn't make you feel bad because it wants to get you. Or because it somehow wants to have you feel like crap. Your brain's number one job is all about keeping you alive. It's the thing that beats your heart. It breathes for you when you're driving down the road and the bug spray the windshield, it's blinking your eyes. It's wanting to work in ways that are best for you. Totally. The problem is that a complicated machine got dropped a few times and has some glitches and errors in its functioning. We want to tune it up so that it stops. So then the second thing is we want to get it so that you're free from the effect that those prior experiences have had. So that all of the bad feelings, the hurt, the anger, the guilt, the shame that they're gone. So that you're more at peace and truly connected to who you are.
[29:20] B: That's right.
[29:21] A: That's right. Which is so much more than the stuff that was yucky that happened. There's so much more to you than just that.
[29:30] B: Yes.
[29:30] A: And we want you to be connected.
[29:33] B: Yes.
[29:33] A: Right. So that you are connected to source.
[29:37] B: Beautiful.
[29:38] A: And that you've got more freedom as you're moving forward in this next new adventure.
[29:45] B: Can I ask you a question?
[29:46] A: Yeah, you can ask me whatever you want. Okay.
[29:49] B: That was beautiful, by the way. Okay. I guess that's how I phrase a question. Okay. My belief is. And I want you to know this about me. My belief is that.
[30:07] A: That.
[30:11] B: What I call the dark night of the soul is a necessary thing. You know, when people are out trying to elevate, when. When your soul decides it's time to elevate your consciousness. I think people go through what I refer to as a dark night of.
[30:28] C: The soul, where you refer to it.
[30:30] B: Whatever, But I feel that it serves a purpose to do that. So I guess what I'm saying is, and this is going to sound really goofy, but I'm going to say it because I want to be so honest with you so you can help me. My. My what? My what I tell. I ask myself, is it time for.
[30:50] C: It to be over?
[30:53] B: Have I gotten what I need to learn, what I need to understand about myself? Has it? I mean, I feel so much more empowered. And I am. You know, like I said, the finishing of my book, the decision to move, it seems like it's time, but my fear is that, oh, it's not time. So I'm gonna get to California and I'm still gonna suffer or I'm not gonna be able to sleep or something stupid like that. I mean, does this make any sense, what I'm saying to you?
[31:26] A: Well, isn't that the same thing that's been haunting, is I'm not going to be capable later? What if I'm still going to be troubled later? What you just asked in that question is what you told me about first, which is the problem is I am now questioning, is it okay? Am I going to be ever okay? Or when I go there, am I still going to have all of this stuff? And I follow you, that you're questioning whether it's time. Meaning you're questioning, have I gotten all that there was for me to get in suffering? So I'm wondering if there could be more for you to get and the suffering part be optional. Like, why couldn't you be learning still without the suffering going on? And I'm wondering what else you might be able to learn if you weren't being troubled and suffering from it. You might have access to a whole other window that you haven't been experiencing. Because that's been in the way.
[32:54] B: Yes.
[32:54] A: Yeah.
[32:55] B: Beautiful.
[32:56] A: So that you transcend it and you get out from under it and you're up above it.
[33:00] B: Yes. Yes.
[33:02] A: Yeah. So that you're a lot lighter and clear and free. Right. Part of the purpose. Right. Of you divorcing and it was your decision, was that you didn't feel like you could really be who you wanted to be.
[33:27] C: That's right.
[33:30] A: There was constraints within that marriage that you couldn't quite express things and he couldn't quite hear things. And, And. And that by stopping that, it was to get free.
[33:42] B: That's right.
[33:43] A: But then all this other stuff that you hadn't anticipated got brought to your.
[33:48] C: Attention, and then I'm like, fuck up. And then I'm like. Then I feel trapped because it's like.
[33:56] B: I had no choice.
[33:57] C: My soul had no choice. My soul didn't give me a choice. If I wanted to be true to myself, which is the most important thing in the world to me, this is.
[34:05] B: What I had to do.
[34:07] C: And then I think, wow, you really fucked up. You know, that was one of the. That would be one of the thoughts that would come in. Oh, you really fucked up.
[34:15] B: You thought you were going to make yourself bigger and better.
[34:18] C: And look at you. You have to be taken care of like you're a baby. Horrible. But, yeah.
[34:27] A: So it's really interesting. How long has it been that you've been really, you know, hard on yourself?
[34:36] C: Are you kidding? How about since day one?
[34:41] A: See, I'm wondering if it would be. How would it be for you to be a little easier on you.
[34:46] C: I've been told that a lot. Yeah. Because I'm very compassionate to other people, just not to myself. I expect perfection from myself.
[35:01] A: Was that the only way to get something?
[35:05] C: I think it was the only way I would feel loved, you know, I had to do. Even when I was married, it's like.
[35:12] B: The business was so successful, and I knew that as long as it was.
[35:16] C: My husband would be very, you know.
[35:19] B: Very loving and very happy with me. Because as soon as something went a.
[35:24] C: Little amiss or, you know, there was.
[35:25] B: A mistake made or whatever like that, I.
[35:27] C: You know, he would say, oh, you know, we shouldn't have done that. I was, you know, I would just get a little bit defensive. But it was me who generated everything in our lives.
[35:40] B: He was an attorney and he gave it up.
[35:43] C: And so it was me that really made everything happen.
[35:50] A: Yeah. And you want to be free so much.
[35:58] C: So much that I. Instead of being smart about it, I feel like I'm banging on the doors of the cell.
[36:05] B: Let me out, let me out, let me out.
[36:09] C: Instead of sitting in the corner going, well, let's see, when they open the door at lunchtime.
[36:16] A: Yeah, yeah. So there's a tendency for you to get down on yourself if it doesn't work or you're feeling you haven't done it right.
[36:31] C: Which happens all the time.
[36:33] A: And when you're getting down on yourself. Whose voice is it in?
[36:36] C: Yeah, God.
[36:39] A: I'm not thinking it's God's voice.
[36:41] C: No, of course not. No, of course not.
[36:44] A: Because the only way that you can get down on yourself is to be in second position. Like, I can only yell at myself from being in second position. I have to be looking at me going, you idiot. So I'm in a different position than in my body. First position. I have to be in second position in whose voice? When you're, you know, getting down on yourself, angry at whatever it is that didn't work out because you didn't do what you should have or you did something that you shouldn't have, whose voice do you hear it in? Whose voice do you hear it in? Oh, gosh. And in which side of your head are you hearing it? Is it coming from over here? Is it coming from over there? Is it coming from up and behind? Where is it located? Weird question, I know.
[37:46] C: No, it's not weird. It's not the first time. You know, usually just what comes to my mind is my mother or, you know, or my brother were two big important influences in my life.
[37:57] A: Where do you hear it from?
[37:59] C: Like, what do you mean?
[38:00] A: Like, from which side of your head?
[38:02] B: Oh, which side of my head do.
[38:04] A: You hear it more from?
[38:05] B: Oh, that's interesting.
[38:07] A: Right? So think about when you're being really hard on yourself.
[38:11] B: Yeah. My first initial reaction is to say.
[38:14] A: From this side and notice it's not just from that side. It's kind of up above you. Right, Right. Yeah.
[38:21] C: Right.
[38:22] A: So want to just give you structure. I asked that question because it's going to give us how your brain has certain things coded. Okay. And we know that authority, which would be how I could be yelling at myself, getting down on me, would have to be up above me. There's universals in the world of how we experience things. And all people experience authority figures as being bigger and taller and above me, primarily because all of that comes from the earliest sensory motor experiences of when I'm very little. So the circuitries in our brain that understand things in a physical way are the identical circuitries that have it mapped on emotionally.
[39:22] B: Can you say that one more time, the last sentence, please?
[39:25] A: So what it is, is the circuitry in our brain that understands things in a physical way.
[39:31] B: Okay.
[39:32] A: Is the same circuitry that understands it emotionally.
[39:36] C: Okay.
[39:37] A: So part of the research in neuroscience comes from John Bard, who's a Harvard psychologist neuroscientist, who had people holding warm object, viewing pictures of strangers and had other people holding cold object viewing same pictures of strangers. The people who were holding the warm object, they were viewing the pictures of strangers as being more friendly, more nice, more compassionate, more loving, more engaging, warmer. And the same people holding cold were viewing them as more distant, more closed, more frigid, more obstinate because the circuitry is the same. We also know that in terms of intensity of emotion, the closer something is to me and the bigger it is, the more intense I'll feel it. The further away it is physically, and the smaller it is, the less I feel it. Nobody has spider phobias when they see them as very small and really far away.
[40:50] B: Right.
[40:51] A: The only time that you can have a spider phobia is if in your brain they get referenced as big and close. Right?
[40:58] C: Right. Right.
[40:59] A: And if you want a spider phobia, just hallucinate one this close to your head and make it this big. Right. That's how it works. We know that. And you hear the phrases, I'm under a lot of stress. Well, what would that mean? Stress has to be then above me, represented or swirling all around me. I need to get out from under it and get up above it. We know that part of what's been going on when you feel stuck. We know that's gut related things because gut is about motion, moving, traction, mobility. Right. So there's gut related things. Gut is a brain, by the way. Gut brain also is about well being, stability, a sense of being grounded. 95% of the serotonin in almost all of the benzos are developed in our gut. So it's really about well being. So we know that there's gut related stuff going on when I'm stuck. We also know that we have a container metaphor which is one of the earliest container that's tight and closed in, restricted. I'm in it versus out. I had a guy one time tell me, I can't stand being in this business. I can't stand being in these four walls. I can't stand being in my house. We live inside the gates of hell. He lived in the country club. I mean, it was a pretty place. So he had all this in stuff. But I love to be out now. Some of that was when he was little. He broke both his arms and had to go inside. And when he was punished, he was put inside and down cellar. We know that nobody feels up and depressed at the same time. Up is good, down is bad, light is good, dark is bad, light is good, heavy is bad. So those are universals in the metaphor. So I wrote down a couple different things. What we know is that when you're really into something, you lead with your heart. Heart. Why we do something, what keeps us going through the long haul is my passion, my interest, my connection. Oxytocin developed in the heart, but we can also have heartache, heartbreak. My heart's not in it. Head, creative, brain. Dopamine remembers, thinks about future, remembers past, knows I'm now. All of that stuff goes on. Dopamine is all about novelty and newness. Right? So we want to be changing the form, letting go of the way it used to look to create a new way of being who you want to be. Right? That fuels your doing. Right? And that's where that changes. And I get that you're going through a transformation and that some of it has been really hard and lots of it was way unexpected. You were not thinking that when, okay, I'm gonna stop the business and we're gonna get divorced, that then I'm gonna feel like I've got nothing around me and I can't go outside. I need somebody to take care of me. That was not in the plan. And has that happened? That really freaking shook you to then be questioning, am I capable to do things on my own? Even though I got this long history of having created and done so, I'm following that. Okay. What else would be useful for me to know, to get what's going on.
[44:50] B: With you right now? And it's probably similar to what you described in. I feel the same thing. I need to be out. The townhouse I live in is 1100 square feet, and it's very dark, and the darkness scares the shit out of me. Expression again. I just. I don't like being in the dark. I don't mean, like, when I go to sleep at night, it's dark. I don't keep a light on. But I'm just saying, like, I don't like darkness. I need light. And I was thinking about it this morning, and I was thinking about how many dark places I live and how much it bothered me and I didn't realize it. So it's got to go back to something very early. But I feel like I need to be out. And that's part of the reason why I have to move. Because once the summer came and I had to close my doors because of the air conditioning, I, like, started to freak out. Before that, the winter months, I was much better because both doors were open and I could feel all the light and the air moving, and I was much better. And now it's just like. It's a terror for me to be there. I hate it. So that's one thing I just wanted to tell you. And I feel like I've made some really bad choices in the last year. And so that also had me question.
[46:18] A: Well, do we make good decisions when we feel bad?
[46:23] B: No.
[46:24] A: Oh, no.
[46:26] B: But it also caused me to say, Robin, how do you expect to be on your own if you can't do this, if you can't be by yourself and you can't make good decisions?
[46:38] A: Right? But you were not making good decisions, not because you were by yourself and not because you can't. It's because of the state you were in, which was all about feeling bad. So I want to give you the other metaphor. And by the way, it's literal. So the other thing to be noticing is when I pay attention to what people say, it's more to listen, literally. Because all thought is embodied, meaning, scaring the shit out of me comes from the literal experience that when we're afraid and our bladder is full and our bowels are full, the fastest way to make us less possible of puncture is to have it all go out, right? So if the rabbit sees the fox, it'll immediately empty bladder and bowels. It's lighter, it can run faster, and a balloon is going to be less likely to puncture when it's deflated than when it's inflated.
[47:54] B: So what does that mean to you then when I say?
[47:56] A: Well, it's a literal thing. Literal meaning that. That's why I said there's a gut related thing. Gut has a way to communicate. It'll make noises, but it can only come out one of two ways, that way or that way. Those are the only two ways that that stuff comes out. So when you're saying I'm stuck, that's like confined, not able to move. What is the most fearful moment? When I'm frozen and the predator is moving around me. That's where that comes from. Why do most people originally have a problem with public speaking? Is because all eyes are on me, literally. And when we were in, you know, prehistoric times, when all eyes were on me, that was a bad thing. It meant danger.
[48:56] B: See, I feel so useless. That's the thing. Because I don't like public speaking. You brought that up. I would have no trouble right now getting up in front of 500 people on a stage and speaking. That wouldn't bother me at all. But ask me to stay home alone one day in that townhouse because I feel useless. I Don't know. I don't know why. And I'm busy a lot. And I've been working on my book and doing things. And it's just because I've been so tired. I haven't been able to focus, do the things I normally would do. Read. I love to read. Read. Hardly haven't read, hardly at all in the last year.
[49:35] A: Yeah.
[49:35] B: It's a struggle.
[49:36] A: Yeah.
[49:38] B: So.
[49:38] A: And that.
[49:39] B: And the only other thing is, you said what's important to know. No, it's just that I do feel so trapped. I feel like there's no way. I don't feel like there's any way out. I don't feel like there's any way out because my heart and my soul has chosen what it's chosen to be and do in the world. And there's nothing I want more than to be able to help people again. To be able to help them with their traumas. In fact, that was always a wish I had. And God heard me and said, great, well, we're gonna put you through your own so you can really understand it. That's how I feel.
[50:14] A: Yeah.
[50:15] B: And that's all.
[50:18] A: So have you been put through it enough? I mean, would it be okay for you to be free and out from under it all? Yeah. Right. It would be. You don't have to know how to get there. Only one of us in the office needs to know what we're doing. Truly, only one of us needs to know what we're doing. See, that's the other part. Right. Doesn't therapy say it's your job?
[50:51] B: Doesn't therapy what?
[50:52] A: Say it's your job. Say it's your job to get you better. And they're there to guide, support, encourage. But the ultimate one, who's responsible. Everybody said that.
[51:00] C: And I would cry every time. Every time. Somebody.
[51:03] A: I'd like you to realize that it's not your job. If it was, you wouldn't be sitting here.
[51:11] C: But aren't I responsible for my thoughts?
[51:16] A: So interesting. If I go to get my teeth clean, does the hygienist hand me the scraper and hold the mirror, or does she do it? She does need my cooperation. I need to be there. And when she says, open wider, what have you. But it's her job to do the work. You're not choosing to have the disturbing thoughts. How could you choose to not have them? If you're not deciding to have them in the first place, how can you then decide to not have them?
[51:58] B: But don't you think that the soul just chooses those experiences so that you can learn.
[52:03] A: So it's an interesting thing where you keep saying the soul as if it's.
[52:08] B: Separate from the higher self, as if.
[52:12] A: It'S separate from you, which it isn't separate from you. What if that you are it. And your thoughts aren't you and your body isn't you. And heck, your feelings aren't even you. You have them all, but they're not you. You're more than all of that. Yeah, that is right. And the problem is that we have habits of attention which mean we all walk around with blinders on only paying attention to a small fraction of what's actually happening. So the idea that I'd like to start putting in is that no matter what you think you are, you're always more than that. No matter what you think is happening right now, there's even more going on than that. And that your brain and your body knows how to heal all emotional wounds.
[53:18] C: Yes.
[53:19] A: Just like it does with the physical wounds of having a cut on your arm or a broken bone. Yes. I believe the emotional ones haven't fully healed yet. Not because they can't, but because there's an aspect of the brain, emotionally that doesn't know that the negative experience. Experiences have stopped.
[53:42] B: There's one other thing I want to tell you.
[53:43] A: Yeah, I just thought of.
[53:44] B: Yes, that's right. But one other thing that happens, it's. It's been so, so hard is, you know, you don't sleep. So it's like, okay, well, take a nap, you know? And whenever I would try to lay down to take a nap during the day, it would happen. Not every time, but a lot of times. So I don't try. I don't do it too often unless I feel like I'm going to be successful. Because it scares me is I lay down, I start to fall asleep almost immediately because I was so tired. And within about five minutes of falling asleep, I immediately wake up in a panic. And it was so. And then my head would feel all weird for like an hour or at least an hour, and I'd be in a little bit of a panic. So I just stopped doing it. I just could push myself through the whole day even. No, I didn't sleep, maybe all night, and it was torture.
[54:34] A: We probably have slept some, even if you felt like you haven't slept any, because we tend to delete the times that we do and remember the times that we're not. Even when people go do sleep studies, they're typically getting at minimum three to four Hours of sleep. It's certainly not what we would ideally be wanting. But it's not that we're not sleeping at all. I know that's a hard one to change the belief about. But see, it's a belief which you think of as the truth. See, the idea about a belief is in order to have it, a belief is a nominalization. What that means is we take a process and we've made it a thing. I have a belief, but a belief is a process that I have to ongoingly be doing. So I'm ongoingly believing it about me, which sets up the expectation that the next time it's going to be that way. Yes, that's right.
[55:34] B: And that's why I started.
[55:35] A: See, a belief is a thing that I'm ongoingly doing. It's a process, not a thing. Just like somebody goes, I'm in a relationship, right? As if it's a thing. Right. No, it's a process of relating that I'm ongoingly doing. I'm constantly relating. So what we want to begin to intervene with is the way that you've been thinking about things that's led you to be believing the things that you've been believing about your own capabilities worth whether you can or can't. Because the likelihood of you not being able to. If I'm questioning whether I can goes way up, and if I've had multiple times that that's been the case, then oh, well, that's true. As my mom used to tell me, as long as you get two other people to agree with you, you know, you're right. But see, we live in this thing that it's a process, though not an actual real thing. It's a process that I'm having to un. Ungoingly be believing about myself. That as we make changes, shifts, it's adjusting how your brain has been responding. When the guy wants to be intimate with the gal and he's questioning and worrying whether he will get an erection or not, the likelihood of him actually is very low. And the problem is is that he's thinking about himself instead of her. If he's thinking about her, it happens on its own. So it's about setting an intention, which you already said my intention of being here. But sleep is one of those things about intention and then letting go of control. Just like we had to learn first as young, young, young, young child when to hold it and when to let it go. Sleep is about setting an intention and then letting go. Because the more effort I put into it, the less likely I'm going to get it. The more worry I have about it, the more my body keeps me up. I know. So we can shift that whole thing that's been problematic for you so that it stops running in the way that it has been. Right.
[58:24] C: It just.
[58:25] B: It just scares me so much when the fear thoughts come in. And sometimes it's not even a direct thought. Sometimes it's just I'll be laying there, my eyes are closed and I can feel it's like a wave that comes over me and it's like, oh. And then that it's like, oh. It's not even like a one thought. It's not like a bad thought. It's not even any thought. It's just like all of a sudden I feel like I'm not safe. I think, I guess that's what it is.
[58:49] A: I'm not safe or so did you know that biochemically that feeling scared is on the short end three to five seconds, but on the longest end, 30 seconds. That's all it lasts on its own. Why does it feel more ongoing? It feels more ongoing because we keep putting logs on the fire. That's what's happening. So I have a. And you just said the perfect thing. It's like a wave that comes over me. So I'm wondering what it would be like if you were out from under the wave and you are already up above it feeling light and clear and a little more easy going so that you're a little like nicer to you. What that would be like for you to be a little bit softer with you. Yeah. And how much easier things will be for you. Right. So it's easier and easier for you to rest effortlessly. That's right. That's what we want to be getting accomplished. We want to be getting the effect that this stuff has had cleared so that you're free. We want to put some reality control constraints on those future fears. Worries about whether I'll be okay because what happens is when. And I'm going to give you a couple different again, metaphors and then we'll move forward with getting things changed in order for somebody to feel anxious. Anxious feelings, scared feelings, makes them want to have control. When they grasp for control, they then realize there are more things that are outside of their control, which then perpetuates them feeling more anxious, which wants them to have more control. What that does is it takes the wide angle and it shrinks it and it becomes very narrowed. So it would be as if you're trying to see the big picture. While looking through a telescope, you have to keep moving it around in order to see the whole thing. And everything would look closer big and you wouldn't really be able to have the perspective of being able to see the bigger picture. Right. So that's the first part of anxiety, is wanting to have control. Which is why we tell people in the same silly way, anything less than letting go wouldn't be total control, isn't it?
[62:00] B: Anything less.
[62:01] A: I know, listen to this. It's going to be a really weird way to say something. Anything less than letting go wouldn't be total control, isn't it? When you're feeling free, that is. And aren't you in control? Your feeling free and how much more free do you want to be? Because the surfer, when riding the wave, doesn't control it, but learns how to balance on the edge and move and that's right, and the thing that's been going on for you is that it's gone too far out in the future and there's no reality constraints. And we can make it this big thing, but we want to bring it back because we're much better at dealing with things closer to now. Our nervous system is designed to deal with what's happening now. Our body, by the way, is the only thing that's locked into now. Our thoughts aren't, our feelings aren't. See, we can think about future and we can have disturbing thoughts about future and we can be feeling it all now. We can remember past and have disturbing thoughts about past and be feeling it all now. Because our bodies are the only thing that's locked to now. So anxiety wants to have control. Instead of it being control, we want to have more ease in riding the waves so that we're able to move through them faster. Because if I'm not throwing another log on the fire, it doesn't reactivate the system. So I've got a disturbing thought now I've got this weirdness in my body. Oh no, that means now this wave comes. Oh no, that means and now I'm locked into this thing. Because that's what the future thing does. We want to bring the person back closer to now because that's when you're going to have the most variability in dealing with things. When we have the widest angle and how to deal with it. Right. We all have a fire detector in our house, but not because we think it'll catch on fire. Most of us don't worry about that. Most of us don't think about our fire detectives much at all unless it's 2:30 in the morning and it's doing that chirp thing and it's annoying as hell. And I gotta go figure out which one it is and get on the ladder and try to change things. Battery time. Right. But we're all glad that they're there because the purpose of them isn't to prevent a fire. We can't always prevent bad things from happening in life. The purpose of them is to notify us as soon as it gets smoke. Because I want it to notify me when the oven catches on fire. That way I can do something about it. I don't want it to wait too long where half the house is already in flames. And then I've got to deal with it. Got it. So we want more distance and space so that there's more ease inside. We also want you in the right states, meaning the right frames of mind. When we're in a problem, the thing that makes it a problem is that there are no solutions contained in that state. So we want to get out. What happens too frequent is that's when I start asking why am I feeling the way that I feeling? How does it relate back to other things? What, why is this happening to me now? It would be like I'm in the house that's on fire and flames around me and I'm asking why is it on fire? Good idea or bad idea?
[65:58] B: Bad idea.
[65:59] A: Better idea, get the heck out of the fire. If once I'm out of the fire and I'm safe, I want to go back to figuring out why. Fine, but we got to get you in the right states. There are no solutions. Einstein said people misquoted it, that the. You cannot. So Einstein, the misquote is the definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again, expecting change. That's not what he actually said. What he said was you cannot solve.
[66:26] B: A problem with the same consciousness that.
[66:29] A: Created it at the same logical level in which it was created. You got to go up, down, out in logical levels in order to change it. So we've got to get the person out of the state and be connected more to the resources. Then we can bring the resources in a linkage way back to the problem so that when in nature it gets triggered. I'm now in a resourceful state. And the thing that we already know about you is that you do have all the resources inside that you need. Let me give you an example. Say there's a 13 year old boys with his buddies and at lunch one of the buddies throws A zinger. And it hurts his feelings. And he doesn't have a good comeback. He's just kind of stewing with it. The bell rings, he goes off to math class. This kid is always in mass. He's picking it up, it's good. He finishes his homework, there's 10 minutes left in class, and boom, the perfect comeback comes to mind. And he goes, oh, if I could have only said that back then. Now what happened? Was it that he didn't have the resource? Clearly he does, is that the resource wasn't connected to the problem. So the difference between us and an earthworm is that the linkages, not necessarily the genes, not necessarily the DNA. There's 18,000 that are the same between us and an earthworm, only 3,000 that are different. The difference is that we have a lot more linkages. That's right. So it's just about getting you to have access to those resources and attaching the resources to the problem. It wasn't that the problem wasn't always there. The problem was there. It's that you were full doing other things. And when those other things moved away, the problem came in. I frequently will tell people, think of a room filled with large appliances. We get rid of all the large appliances. People feel that much better. But what they didn't know is that there were small appliances behind him that then now fill the room. So that's what happened, is this just had an emptiness, a space, and that's what came in. And you didn't want it to come in. You weren't expecting it to come in, but it did. And then you haven't known how to get out of that state. That's why you're even thinking of moving to California, which is really far away from Florida. And again, going with the embodied world. Well, distance certainly changes things. I remember this girl that I worked with one time whose grandfather did all sorts of abuse stuff to her. And when she was old enough, she moved to Washington from Florida. You can't get much further away and she didn't have the same problems there. Surprise, surprise. I wonder why. Because you got four away from it.
[69:12] B: So it's a good idea to move.
[69:13] A: Well, the difference. Well, I don't know whether it's a good or a bad idea. I haven't gotten to that point yet.
[69:18] C: Okay. I just. I don't. I don't.
[69:19] B: I've never loved Florida and I hate the summer here. And I don't have anything to hold me here anymore.
[69:24] A: You don't have anything to hold you here anymore.
[69:26] B: I mean, there's no reason to be here.
[69:27] A: That's right. You don't have to be here.
[69:29] B: No.
[69:29] A: Right. That's what had me move to Florida from upstate New York. That's what had me move from Pinellas county to here. I didn't have anything that held me. When I was working in the public school system in Pinellas County. I had something that helped me in Pinellas County. When I decided to do a private practice, I didn't have anything holding me to have to stay there. I could move anywhere I wanted to be. I liked it down on this side of the bridge, so I moved down here. It's a different thing, but it was all out of. I didn't have anything that held me. So you can move, and that's a fine thing. We just want you to be doing it in the right states.
[70:14] B: That's right.
[70:15] A: Yeah, that's right. So that you're feeling good about doing it.
[70:18] B: That's right.
[70:19] A: Yes.
[70:19] B: And I feel it's the right thing.
[70:21] A: Yes. And we want you fully.
[70:24] B: Yes, yes, yes. That's right.
[70:27] A: Yeah. Okay, so we've got that part. Now I want to give you another little piece. So, like, if you weren't feeling so down, so constrained, so constricted, so stuck, if you weren't having all that beating, if that was no longer going on and you were free, how would you actually be as a person? Like, if that was no longer an issue, you were no longer haunted by the stuff. There was no longer any of that. Guilt, shame, resentment, pains, hurts. How would you actually be.
[70:58] B: Powerful? Beyond.
[71:00] A: Powerful beyond. Yeah. And what's it like for you when you feel powerful?
[71:06] B: I'm totally present. I'm totally present in my heart. I'm totally able to help others to be in the rhythm of life, to actually be excited about every minute. Because it's like. It's like. It's like a. It's like your favorite movie or TV show. It's like, what's gonna happen next? This is so awesome because you create your life and you watch yourself create it. Like, I have thoughts now, and I see it manifest like that.
[71:35] A: Yeah, yeah. So when you're powerful and you're present and you're connected to the heart and you're making a difference and you're really in the rhythm and you're excited.
[71:44] B: Yes. Oh, and I'm happy, and I dance and I hula hoop and I smile and I bring love to people.
[71:51] A: That's right. Because we know that this is the thing. Right. Heart is what keeps us sustaining. In the long term, we're also learning that one has been being over utilized and others have been underutilized. What has been so heart, head, heart, gut, three separate brains.
[72:18] B: Okay.
[72:20] A: And when our brains are not in coherence, that's when we feel stuck. I'm saying it's more gut related because there's fear and anxiety.
[72:31] B: Yes.
[72:31] A: And it's still and like. Right, Right. That's where it hurts. Right. And that's where it hurts. Right. And I know that for you, what lights you up, totally lights you up because you go to this place all the time is your heart totally lights you up. Right? Right.
[72:50] B: I used to be. Used to be my affirmation every morning. Before affirmations were cool or before people knew about them. I was saying every morning, may I be a source of love and light to myself and to all others today. Always. That was always the word.
[73:04] A: Love and light. Light. Right. So we want you to be light and powerful and up above and out of all of it so that you're free to be more and more of who you are. Powerful and excited and connecting and passionate and in service so that you're with the rhythm. That's where we're headed. Got it. The question isn't how that's going to happen. That's not my question. It's really, would it be okay with you to be there?
[73:37] B: Oh my gosh.
[73:38] A: That would be okay, wouldn't it?
[73:42] C: This.
[73:47] A: Yeah. Yeah. Any downside to any of that? So we got a green line to organize your mind. It's really connecting. That's right. So then the next little piece is the way that we want to reference things is the lens that we look through is that stuff causes feelings. It's the future. Coulds. It's the past. Dids. It's the stuff that makes me feel how I feel.
[74:11] B: Right.
[74:12] A: When we look through that lens, we've got limited power.
[74:14] B: That's right.
[74:15] A: We either try to change it or we try to avoid it.
[74:17] B: Right.
[74:18] A: But we've learned that there's some stuff I can't change. There's some stuff I can't avoid. Right. And then there's all the crap that's happened in my life. Damn it. I can't get it to have not happened.
[74:26] B: No.
[74:26] A: So we got to do something else. Which is where we're coming in. Adjusting how your brain, emotional, brain, body, mind reacts and responds to stuff. So silly. Example goes lion, zebra. Zebra sees lion approach. We go, zebra. Oh my goodness. Lion is making zebra scared. But if we go, wait a minute. It's not the lion. Isn't it the zebra's brain that as the zebra senses, feels, sees, smells, or thinks that lion is approaching? It's zebra's brain, not lion, that's making zebra alert, motivated, strong. We call it scared, so it runs fast away. Yes, zebra's brain is doing it to zebra in response to lion approaching, but it's something zebra's brain is doing in particular. Because what zebra didn't know 15 minutes earlier, lion finished eating a gazelle. Freaking stuffed. Got no interest in scrawny zebra. But zebra's brain, erring on sight of caution, takes off rather than hangs out. So we're gonna look at it that what's been going on is that there's been some glitches, errors, misfires in a small facet in the way that your brain has been working. We want to tune that up so that it stops doing that to you. Makes sense. One of the ways that our brain has misfires is that we tend to go through negative experiences. Big ones, small ones, long time ago, recent big T traumas, little T traumas. We all have at least a little post traumatic stress in this. We can't get born and go through the crap human beings go through and not have at least a little. Nobody's got a life, you know, of peaches and cream, roses and milk and cookies. We all have had crap. So the deal is, given that what happens when we go through them is they slam. As I was talking earlier, the memory about what happened and the experience of it happening gets stuck and merged together. Once they're merged together, it's the. That's on ongoing. Even when I'm not thinking about it, it's still on. We know it's affecting the person as they talk about it because they get all the emotion. But even when they're not, it's still on. Of course. Second thing that keeps that active is that our brain, we're meaning making monsters. Something happens, meaning gets attached to it. And because when we were little, we were trained to believe from like early on till 8, 9 is imprint phase of life, right? Meaning we believe what we were told as if it's the truth. So little kids are lied to. They're told, you know, you need to be a good boy and a good girl. Why? Well, because we want children to be good boys and good girls. We lie to them. We tell them that if they are, your life will be good. You'll get to live happily ever after. And it's reinforced with everything for kids from Santa Claus to Movies to stories, to TV shows to books, to games, to anything that's engineered for children is how good things happen when you're good. Fine, but what is the hidden message? Bad things only happen when I'm being bad, when I'm doing something wrong. So it's my fault. I shouldn't have put myself in that situation. I should have known better. Kills me, all of that stuff when.
[78:00] B: I hear that and I realize, and I know that, and I know that for myself and I see that in others. All I want to do is go up and hold them.
[78:07] A: Yeah.
[78:07] B: Because it just sucks.
[78:08] C: It's just so much bullshit.
[78:10] A: Well, we want to get the messages installed that sometimes it's really good, useful information. It's that the learnings are in the wrong location. I had a little girl who was 13 years old when she had sex for the first time and got scared that she was pregnant. So she made up this elaborate story and told her mother, wrote a letter that she was raped by this guy and described it thinking that her mom would just take her to get a pregnancy test. Well, of course mom blew it up into, well, then it must have been this boy that you knew. And. And then took her to rape counseling and. And she had tremendous amounts of guilt and shame. Lived with it for seven plus years. Wow. Wow. So all of that went on for her, all of that guilt? Well, the learning was in the wrong location because she was so mad at her younger self for having done that. But see, the learning was in the wrong location because if she had known back then at 13, that that's how that thing would have turned out, would she have written the letter and given it to mom? No. Oh, good. So it's actually useful learnings. It's just in the wrong location. When we put them in the right location, we don't have the same bad feelings. So that's one of the things that we want to be doing with lots of different stuff. So bad means my fault. Second things kidding learn is they cause everybody else around them to feel how they feel because they hear it. And it's first in positive ways. Like when my mom tells my two girls, you make grandma's heart happy. And I have to look at her and go, mom, stop saying that to them. You are putting a lot of pressure on my kids, you know, because if they make her heart happy, they could make it sad.
[80:04] B: They could.
[80:05] A: All sorts of ways we put on kids that they cause the feelings. You make me so happy. You make me feel so good. I love you so much. So joyful I'm so mad at you. You make me so mad. I'm so disappointed. You make me feel over and over and over again. Kids, I cause everybody else around me to feel so we've got bad is only happening because I screwed up something wrong with me. I make everybody else feel great. So if I'm good, the good things happen. Bad, it's my fault. So. So now we've got a bad thing that happened. Of course, somehow it's my fault.
[80:37] B: That's so insightful.
[80:39] A: Somehow it's attached to me. And then because those two things are active, my brain starts searching in a more vigilant and sensitive way to search for anything that's similar. The problem is that my brain, with all that active, confuses similar and maps it is same, right? Because in negativity bias, the sooner I react, the more apt I am to survive. So if I think it's still on and it looks similar to it, is.
[81:14] B: That why I've had. Is that part of why I think so negatively? You know, because people say, just don't think negatively, think positive. Why are you thinking. Thinking negatively? Is it just a. It's a protection so that I can feel? Because if I feel I'm in survival mode. That's how I feel.
[81:33] A: Well, the rabbit who hears the twig snap and takes off, right? That one survived. The rabbit who had the twig snap and thought it was George and it was the fox, that one's dead, right? That's right. So we have a negativity bias that we're going to remember Negative, more intention intensely than positive. And if that's still stuck on, then I'm scanning for it. So the soldier can be sitting in bumper to bumper traffic, but it's gorgeous out. So he's got his windows down, he's got his favorite song on, he's singing along, he's having a great time. Traffic starts moving the tractor trailer four cars up. All of a sudden the smell of diesel gets into his nose and now he's back next to the tank where his buddy got shot. We call him a flashback. Yes, but that was an old what the problem. Of course we know really the problem was not the smell of diesel back in that wartime experience. That was not what was troubling him. He wasn't like, oh man, diesel smell. No, what was troubling him was what happened to his buddy. But because they happened at the same time, mind will confuse it.
[82:47] B: That's right.
[82:48] A: So every time you smell diesel, all of that stays active until we unplug the memory. See, the key thing is, is that that memory is not read as data. It's being relived as happening. Once the memory is unplugged and it's data, the pain that was attached goes away. Then what the person knows they can feel. So think about the guy who's 42. He tells us about what his uncle did when he was 12. And he's all emotional now. He's not troubled because that was awful. It's 30 years later.
[83:33] B: Yes.
[83:34] A: Why is he still bothered by that? He knows it wasn't his fault and he didn't do anything wrong. He went out to the barn to see the car that uncle was working on. He knows that some of what uncle did to him felt really good. But not because he's gay, likes men. Wanted uncle to do that because if the body part is touched in a certain way, it's designed to feel good. He knows all that. He knows it's been over. Why does he still have all of the self hate, the guilt, the shame? That's right. It's because an aspect of his brain never got the good news that it stopped. All of that emotion is actually being caused to motivate him to get it to stop. Not because it's wanting him to feel bad about it. No, of course not. So when the memory gets unplugged and the pain's gone, then what he knows he fully feels all the way through. No longer troubled. Realizing at a deeper level it's not me, which he knew but never felt.
[84:46] B: That's what I kept saying the other day. Kept saying, but it's been so many years.
[84:50] A: And the third thing is that you would think that once I get something, something up here, it would translate to here. Yes, except the emotional brain does not work with logic. It's not the rational, reasonable brain. It works with patterns of association. So for the emotional brain to get that it's not happening, we want to pair it with something else that you already know that has no charge to it about something that's not happening. Like earlier today, you worked out. You know that you did it. You even remember where you were as you were doing it. But if I said to you remember working out and then said, robin, stop working out, you'd go to me, I'm not working out.
[85:40] B: Right.
[85:41] A: Because you know there's a very big difference between you remembering doing it and you actually doing. Right.
[85:47] B: Exactly.
[85:47] A: They're not the same thing. Right. That's what we want to get in. So that it gets unplugged. Makes sense. Once they're unplugged, they no longer reactivate. See, the coolest thing for me is when the brain gets that it's data, it's gone. Excuse me. It never retriggers.
[86:11] B: Wow.
[86:12] A: Because it was only on when the brain didn't know it had stopped.
[86:16] B: Right.
[86:17] A: So it's the inside for children when it happens. The realization that Santa was made up. Once you know that he's real.
[86:26] B: Yes.
[86:26] A: You can't believe in him. And see, there we go. It's a belief that I thought was a real thing. Santa Claus. But no, it was a process that I was believing. Once I'm believing something else, I can't go back to believe that thing. It's no longer real. It was for a period of time in my life, just like the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny and all that stuff. Right. So we want to get free. So a few other pieces we're going to use now. Some, what I'm going to call brain based leverage points. By the way, if you need to use the restroom.
[87:08] B: I'm good.
[87:09] A: Okay.
[87:10] B: I was gonna. I was gonna eat a few nuts.
[87:14] A: You can eat a few nuts. I'm gonna explain to you this whole thing.
[87:17] B: All right.
[87:17] A: No, I'm okay. Thank you very much. I've got my lovely smoothies.
[87:21] B: How did you learn all this? This is amazing. You were in the public school system?
[87:28] A: I worked, yeah. When I graduated. When I graduated with my master's in social work, I got a job in the public school system as a social worker. Because at that time, I said, I want to have the same schedule that I've had since I was five. And where else can you have a job that you've had the same schedule that you've had since you were five, other than working in the school system, which is what I did, and I loved it. It was a great job. But I got to the point where I wanted to do something else. Did you go back to school into private practice? I was going back to school. I got my PhD while I was in the public school system in sexology. And then I thought I was going to be a sex therapist. That would have been really cool. I thought I was going to be a sex therapist. And then I learned three things very quickly. One, it's too narrow of a niche to start off a business with. Two, it's really uncomfortable because when you go to the chamber events with, you know, Dr. Quintel's sex matters. Hey, how are your orgasms? You and your husband, any premature ejaculators out there? Nobody really wants to have a conversation with you. And then three. Because I came from working in the school system, I had a hundred social workers that could have referred people to me. But you can't refer, you know, the kid to the sex therapist, because that's weird.
[88:39] B: You're beyond.
[88:40] A: Well now, right?
[88:42] B: Yeah.
[88:42] C: But you're just like.
[88:43] B: I mean, well, that's now amazing.
[88:46] A: So that was one piece. I thought I wanted to do that. So while I was in graduate school, I got interested in trauma. And then I learned about the new stuff at the time, EMDR and critical incident stress debriefing. And when I was working in the school system, I volunteered at the Gulf coast center for survivors of rape and torture. And I was working with Bosnian refugees, and I was doing EMDR at the time. Emdr, that eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. It's a process that they have to deal with trauma. And it was the worst experience for me because people were having horrific ab reactions, reliving the worst moments while sitting with me. And I didn't have the skill set to know what to do. So I said, I'm never going to deal with trauma again. I start my private practice down here in January of 2006. Things are going really great. There was another office who's not even around anymore that did one thing that I didn't know anything about, and that was hypnosis. So I got a flyer in the mail that said, clinical hypnosis with rapid trauma resolution. But I don't want to do trauma. It's uncomfortable. And a buddy of mine just happened to say to me, goes, well, you know, it's a week, and you want to learn hypnosis, and if you can learn how to do it with trauma, heck, you can do it with anything. Okay. So I went to the training. Felt like I left knowing nothing about hypnosis, but, wow, that was amazing to be able to see people deal with yucky stuff without having to relive it. So then I learned a lot from that guy. And then I added other stuff along the way, learned more stuff, and I continue to go. I just got back in. What was it?
[90:20] B: Well, it's obviously your. It's obviously your calling again.
[90:23] A: It's there, but, yeah, it's right there.
[90:26] B: Yes.
[90:27] A: What keeps me sustained. I go to more training than anybody else I know, and I don't get CES for it.
[90:33] B: I don't know what that is.
[90:34] A: Confiding education, which we're supposed to have a certain number, but you do it.
[90:38] B: You Just do it for your own self.
[90:39] A: Well, I do it because I want to be effective at doing change work. And that's the issue. Therapists, we're not trained in how to do change work. That's the problem with our profession.
[90:53] B: Most stink. Trust me, I've tried a few.
[90:56] C: They're terrible.
[90:56] A: But because we're not trained in how to do change work, what I do is change work. I don't have any question. I know what to do to get people to be better and then I go about doing it. So I take on the responsibility and the ownership for the success. I tend to think for therapists that aren't getting people better, they say the client is resistant. The dentist doesn't get to do that with cavities because if he did, you go, you're a shitty dentist. I'm going to go to a better one. But the therapist, you know, we want.
[91:29] B: To protect my life coach, she's awesome. She says it's like she uses the word ego, but she says it's your. Your ego is job. She studies a course in miracles and she says it's your ego's job to destroy your higher self.
[91:47] A: John's wife has done that, right? Yeah. Course in miracle stuff.
[91:51] B: Yeah, she does it. I mean, she doesn't even compare to you. Yeah, she's not even in the same ballpark. She's in kindergarten.
[91:57] C: You're in like, you know, out in cosmos.
[92:00] A: So what we want to use is we want to use some very specific brain based leverage points to get the right states of mind. Vagal nerve stimulation. Vagal nerve wandering nerve goes from the brain stem and then into the limbic system and then to the frontal corner and then all the way down, connecting to the vital organs in the body. When the vagal nerve is stimulated, it actually bypasses the freeze response and the fight flight. Freeze. How do we stimulate the vagal nerve? We just slightly lower our jaw. Not a lot, but just slightly lower your jaw. So go ahead and lower your jaw slightly and then rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. And as your tongue is resting at the bottom of your mouth, just like you are, begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. Just like that. And as you're breathing in a way that's slower and deeper, notice what happens, Robin, when you allow your awareness to expand so that you can notice that there's space between you and me, but that there's also a space between all around us, you can begin to notice more of the space that goes towards the sides of the room, the space beyond me. You can notice the space up above and even past the roof line, all the space beneath you. That's right. And then begin to be aware of the space behind. How much space. Because no matter how many objects are in the room, there's always more space. That's right. And as you're noticing more and more of this space, just check for a moment. How's your body feeling now?
[93:54] B: Relaxed.
[93:55] A: It's feeling relaxed. That's right. Which means accelerated healing is happening. Because it always happens when we rest. It's why after a cold or flu or surgery, we say get rest. It allows the body to do the inward healing. The next little piece we're going to do is a part that's all about floating up. So imagine like you could float up and out of your body and that you'd be way up above, like way up in the sky in space. And like a bird, you're able to glide and soar through the sky, maybe making these big figure eights, making these big wide turns and curves, Flying, soaring and moving. And as you're way up above, you can notice what's down below. Because we know that the farther and farther we go up, what happens to this stuff beneath us? What's the perspective change as you rise up in a plane and you look out the portal, what happens to this stuff on the ground? It gets tiny. That's right. And we want you up and out. So what we're going to do again is you have your jaw lowered, resting your tongue, breathing in a way that's slower and deeper. That's right. You can close your eyes and rest. As your eyes are closed, you can notice how it feels to be sitting in the way you are. The background sound of music, the rain outside. You can allow your awareness to expand so that you notice more of the space that's all around up above, out in front, towards the sides, even below and behind. More space in all ways, in all directions. Space, that. That's right. Imagine floating way up and out of your body so that you're way up above and you're able to soar through space, maybe moving fast or slowly gliding big wide turns, big arching curves. That's right. Soaring and moving in all ways in all directions. Flying freely, moving, bringing awareness back down and into your body. That's right. Take a big deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. And what's happening now? What are you noticing for yourself? That's Right. Yeah.
[97:14] B: I felt my head trying to come in and question everything that's happening.
[97:20] A: That's right. And it can do say, oh, this isn't gonna work. And the good news is, is that you can. You can now realize that you can observe the thoughts that you're having, realizing they're not you. That's right. Knowing that they're thoughts and we wanted to question. Because it doesn't matter what you're thinking, there's even more going on than what you know. And because we're organizing towards that you, who is light, powerful and free and present. That's right. Riding, moving, the rhythm, all organizing you. The unconscious can scan back through the experiences that have happened in Robin's history, growing her earlier and younger, all the way back and bring a particular moment to mind that would be useful to get cleared. That's right. What's the experience that comes to mind?
[98:35] B: Being left at my grandmother's.
[98:40] A: So you might have been how old? Six. Six. Okay, so let me explain to you how we clear something. It's actually very simple. A, you're going to intend to be here with me. The reason that you want to be here is this is what's happening. And that isn't. Two, we're working on the mutual goal that we're both invested in. Three, I'm more fun than yucky stuff. So watch here with me. Got it. When you tell me the what happened, we're going to go through facts quickly. In about a minute or less. So to go, this happened, this happened. This happened, this happened, this happened. Then it was done. By the way, if that happened when you were six, there have been lots of things that you've done after that moment that were way more enjoyable than that moment. What's one thing anytime from 6 until yesterday that was more fun than that moment?
[99:29] B: I'm sorry, what was last?
[99:31] A: So anything in your life from six until yesterday that was more fun than the thing at six? So what's one thing that you've done that was more fun than that?
[99:40] B: Having sex with Joe.
[99:41] A: Yeah. Having sex with Joe is more fun than that. Good. Something else that you've done in your life?
[99:45] B: Creating my business.
[99:46] A: Yeah. Creating your business. That's right. And opening your store. Right. And one other thing.
[99:51] B: Being with my children.
[99:52] A: Yeah, being with your kids. So we got being with your kids, we got having sex and we've got opening your business in the store. All of those things. Way more important, enjoyable than that moment. Now here's the thing. That's right. There's an aspect of your brain that doesn't know about having sex, that doesn't know about opening the store, that doesn't know about being with your kids, which is useful information to get in. So you're six years old, and what happened? So your mom drove you to Grandma's, your dad drove you to. What happened?
[100:22] B: My dad left. My mom and dad got divorced.
[100:26] A: So mom and dad were divorced. Right.
[100:28] B: My mom took a vacation, and your.
[100:30] A: Mom was gonna go on a trip, and so she drove you to your grandparents, and.
[100:34] B: Yeah, and I had to stay there for three weeks.
[100:36] A: So she drove you to grandparents, and then you stayed at your grandparents.
[100:39] B: Right. Which I never liked to be there.
[100:41] A: But you stayed at your grandparents. Right?
[100:43] B: With my brother.
[100:43] A: With your brother. Right. You and your brother stay at your grandparents. And then what happened next?
[100:47] B: I was just so unhappy. I couldn't wait for her to get back.
[100:50] A: Well, then, what happened next? So you did whatever you did at your grandparents.
[100:55] B: Oh, what happened next? Then my mom came back.
[100:59] A: Your mom came back, and then she picked you and your brother up, and then you went back to where she was, and then that particular moment ended.
[101:06] B: Right. I kept going back.
[101:07] A: And then later. No, that particular moment, but that particular. Yes. Right. And then later on, you were starting your store, opening it in your business. You're hanging out with your kids, you're having sex with Joe. Right. Now, you noticed as you were remembering it, there was discomfort, not because that was an uncomfortable experience, but because part of your brain was confusing the memory about what happened, thinking it was happening. So here's the weird thing. We never go backwards with memories, only forward. But when we do, it actually unplugs the memory. It flattens out the neurons. It takes away the charge. So we're going to run it in reverse. So we've got having sex, we've got hanging out with your kids. We've got, you know, starting the business. And then what happened before that is you were back with mom, and then she had come to get you, and then you guys stayed at your grandparents, and then she dropped you and your brother off, and then she drove you there, and then she was going to go on vacation, and then before that, mom and dad got divorced, and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Good. Now, as I ran through it, backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[102:14] B: Feels farther away.
[102:15] A: It does feel farther away. Isn't that interesting? You can remember her doing that? You can remember working out earlier today. Robin, stop working out. Say I'm not working out.
[102:26] B: Say that I'm not working out.
[102:28] A: Well then stop putting in your hoops. Say I'm not putting in my hoops.
[102:32] B: I'm not putting in my hoops.
[102:33] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you're not putting on your shirt.
[102:36] B: You're not putting on your shirt.
[102:37] A: Well then stop mom from leaving you at grandparents. Say she's not leaving me at grandparents.
[102:40] B: She's not leaving.
[102:41] A: Well then you stop putting on your shoes. Say I'm not putting on my shoes.
[102:43] B: I'm not putting on my shoes.
[102:44] A: Stop getting your nails painted pink. Stop me from getting my nails painted pink. You're not getting your nails painted pink. Well, stop mom from doing that. Say Mom's not doing that.
[102:55] B: Mom's not doing.
[102:56] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[102:58] B: No longer exists.
[102:59] A: That's right. By the way, mom doing that, did that have anything to do with you or her love for you or her interest in you? See, it's weird because you thought it did, but I'd like you to check. Did it have to do with you or did it have to do with whatever was going on with mom? Had to do with her? It did. Right. Had nothing to do with you or your lovability. Had everything to do with whatever was going on with mom. Right, but see, back then that earlier you thought it had something to do with you. See, it would be useful for that you to realize these four words. I want you to repeat them after me. Here we go. It's. It's not. Not about about me. Me. It's not.
[103:47] B: It's not about me. About me.
[103:49] A: It's not about me.
[103:50] B: It's not about me.
[103:51] A: That's right. Now close your eyes. Picture the younger you back then letting her know that that moment is finished, over, completed, defeated. It no longer exists. Letting that earlier you know that mom doing that had nothing to do with you and nothing to do with her love for you. Had everything to do with what was going on with mom. It's not about me. So that she gets it. Then let that younger you know about hanging out with her kids. Let her know about starting your business. Let her know about having sex. Let her know so that she gets it. And as the younger you gets it, what do you notice happening to that younger you's face? That's right. There we go.
[104:27] B: I feel like right here though, that.
[104:30] A: Same discomfort and then you can open your eyes. You do feel that discomfort right there, huh? Right. Well, and if you were to take that discomfort out of the gut and it were to be in front of you, what would the shape of it be? What it look like? Yeah. If we were to take it out and it were being, what would it look like? What would the shape of it be?
[104:59] B: Ugly.
[105:00] A: What would it look like?
[105:02] B: Black tar.
[105:03] A: Yeah, so like black tar. So now we take that black tar, we're gonna move it way down there. Okay. Then you're sitting here with me. We got the black tar our way down there. Got it? And as you're sitting here with me, we're gonna think of a self image of you up here. Like when she's really in all of that. Got it. So you're sitting here with me, we got the black tar down there and then we've got the self image of you up there. When like she's really in all of that. Got it. She.
[105:34] B: She being.
[105:36] A: So there's you, there's a self image of you.
[105:39] B: Right.
[105:40] A: She's. That self image of you is really in the gunk of that.
[105:44] C: Okay.
[105:44] A: Like when she's really, really feeling.
[105:46] B: Yes, that's right.
[105:47] A: And we've got you sitting here.
[105:48] B: Right.
[105:49] A: So we've got you sitting here, we've got that black tar there. We've got a you up above. When she's really liking all of that. Got it. Now go ahead and lower your jaw slightly. Resting your tongue. Breathe in a way that the.
[106:02] B: Exhale.
[106:02] A: Exhale. That's right. Is a little bit longer. Breathing a little slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. That's right. There we go. Allowing your awareness to expand so that you notice more and more of the space that's in the room. All around. Out in front and up above space, towards the sides and below. Space, more space behind you.
[106:45] C: Space.
[106:48] A: That's right. Noticing more space than. See that you out there able to glide and fly freely, moving effortlessly, making those big turns and figure eights and curves. Flying, arching, ankles moving, soaring all around in all ways in all directions. Flying, soaring. Bring your awareness back in. Breathing now a little bit slow. That's right. And imagine you're now breathing from your heart, breathing in. That's right. And out. Breathing from your heart. In and out from your heart, breathing in and out. Bringing your awareness towards your head. Imagine you're breathing from your head, the pineal gland, which is right behind the eyes. Breathing in and out from your head. Expanding consciousness. Breathing in and out. That's right. Breathing in and out. And then bring awareness down towards your belly. Breathing from your belly. In and out. Settled, grounded. Well, being in and out. Slow. In and out. That's right. One more slow in and out now, bringing awareness to your heart again, breathing in. That's right. And then when you're ready, open your eyes.
[109:18] B: Can I share something with you now?
[109:27] A: Well, first of all, let me check. How's your body feeling now?
[109:40] B: I feel very emotional.
[109:42] A: Excuse me?
[109:42] B: Right here. I feel very emotional here.
[109:46] A: And it's like, all right.
[109:49] B: So all it's saying is I want to be well. I want want to be well. I want to be well. I want to be well. I want to be well. I want this to be over. I want this to be over.
[109:58] A: Right. So let's get it to be over. As we travel back earlier and younger, there's going to be another moment that comes to mind for us to clear. That's right. And what's the moment that comes to mind?
[110:15] B: Younger.
[110:16] A: Doesn't matter whether it's younger than that moment. It's a moment where there's yuckiness attached. That happened earlier in your life?
[110:24] B: Yeah. I've been through so many of these questions already. When I was 2, I had two hernia operations.
[110:33] A: Well, as you think about the thing at 2 right now, and you're remembering that that happened then, as you're sitting here with me now, remembering that that happened then, how are you feeling as you recall that then? Now that's interesting, right? That's right. Notice you're recalling it, but it's not having the same feelings right now. That's right.
[111:16] B: I feel like it's never gonna change.
[111:21] A: I don't care. It's okay. I don't care how you feel that, you know, because, you know, you wouldn't want to feel better than you have been in a really long time. Right. So the idea when we go through processes is to go through the process. You can have all the thoughts you have. Right. Because that's a thought. But I want you to check when you remember the thing about the hernia. And I don't want you to give me thought things that you've already dealt with or think that you have. Because when you think about the thing with the hernia, does it create any discomfort within you right now? Right.
[112:25] B: I just remember being terrified.
[112:27] A: You do remember being terrified. Are you feeling terrified right now? No. Right. Because that one isn't troubled and it would have been terrifying. So now you want to close your eyes and let that earlier you at 2 know that she made it through it okay, that she's okay, that she made it through that thing that was unknown for her back then, that she's okay now. She made it through it not only that, she's had kids, she started businesses, she's thinking about moving. Right. She's okay. And if that younger you knows as she's going through it that she's going to be okay. Just check. What do you notice happened to the younger you now?
[113:20] B: She's scared.
[113:21] A: Well, no. Open your eyes. Hello. What does she not have that you do as a resource? What did she not know back then that you already know now?
[113:33] B: I know that it's over and that it happened.
[113:37] A: Oh. And that she's okay.
[113:39] B: She's okay.
[113:40] A: That it turned out okay.
[113:41] B: Yeah.
[113:42] A: So let her know that she stopped not knowing, that it's okay, that she's okay, that she turned out okay.
[113:54] B: That's right.
[113:55] A: So the wrong person was educating. Now close your eyes and educate her. Let her know what you know, that she went through that and that she's okay, that she turned out okay, that she's fine, that she made it through it and that she's okay. Let her know about her kids.
[114:14] C: That's right.
[114:16] A: There you go. Now the right person is getting updated. And you can open your eyes because check her out. Now think about that younger you going through it knowing that she's okay. What happens to her feeling scared then?
[114:38] B: If she knew it to.
[114:40] A: Well, how much easier is it to go through something knowing that you're gonna be okay? Huh? Right. So you just got it right?
[114:48] B: That's what I try to find out now.
[114:51] A: No, you don't actually need to see. It's the resource that's getting installed. She didn't know that it was gonna be okay, but now she's getting that it is. Didn't she turn out okay? Like, even better than okay? I mean, she's somebody that's got a lot of heart, that's really into being in service and making a difference for others, and that's what lights her up inside. That's what lights her up inside. Yeah. Making a difference, being in service. That's right. It is, isn't it? And as she realizes that she went through that thing, okay. As we take her to before the surgery, knowing that she's going to be okay, what happened to her feeling scared? That's right.
[115:37] B: You just know that it's. You're gonna get through it.
[115:40] A: Right. So is she scared now that you back then, knowing what she learned from you? No, she's not. Is she? Right. Cause she's okay. I remember working with a woman who was in a car with a guy when she was like, 17, and he was driving crazy, and now she can't be in cars with other people driving. Because in that moment when she was 17, she thought she was gonna die. But, you know, she's 53, she didn't. So when we re educated the younger self, as she was sitting in the car, do you know what happened? She relaxed and just went. Went for the ride. Because the thing that was troubling is that she thought she was gonna die. So then when she learned that she actually was okay, because clearly she didn't. If she's 53, then when we went back and had her think about the younger self in the car, she was like, you know, relaxed, just along for the ride. I feel like there's Robin. We've got other things to do. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing here. Okay. One of us is in charge of the process. One of us is going through the process. Only one of us needs to know what we're doing.
[117:02] B: I am going to ask for a bathroom.
[117:03] A: Yes. But before you do that, check back. Think back about that younger you at 2 now. And as she knows that she made it through and that she's okay even as she's going into it, what do you notice happened to that? Feeling Scared. Yeah, exactly. Notice how different that is. Right, exactly. So it's all about installing the resources that you already have and connecting them to the problem. That's right. We're on our way. Okay, now you can take that bathroom break.
[117:37] B: Do you have a blanket, by any chance?
[117:39] A: I do.
[117:40] B: I would love that.
[117:41] A: Okay.
