[00:00] A: All right, so we're resuming. So how you doing?
[00:03] B: Okay.
[00:04] A: What do you notice for yourself now?
[00:11] B: I feel hope.
[00:12] A: Well, you feel hope. Good.
[00:14] B: I do. I feel hope.
[00:17] A: Okay, well, that's better than where you were. So at least we're moving.
[00:19] B: That's right.
[00:21] A: Although we don't actually need hope because that would then mean powerless. You know, I hope it doesn't rain when I play golf.
[00:29] B: Right.
[00:33] A: But when you think back about the thing at 2 now, what do you notice?
[00:43] B: Doesn't matter.
[00:43] A: Yeah, it doesn't. She's okay. That's right. And she made it through okay. Right. Even when she was a little bit worried. Worried whether she would. Hmm. I mean, that wouldn't be a really good resource to have, you know, when.
[00:59] B: You move to know that everything's gonna be okay.
[01:03] A: I mean, you wouldn't want to actually be, you know, knowing that you will. Cause she didn't think she was gonna. But now she does. She was scared. Now she's not. Hmm. Right. That's right. We wouldn't want that to get all the way in. We wouldn't want things to lighten up. Oh, there's a good breath.
[01:25] B: We wouldn't.
[01:27] A: We do. And they already are. Which is why you had that breath. Because that wasn't a conscious one. No. Right. But your unconscious did, which means it's listening. See, when I work with people, I'm going to talk to you and you both. I mean, you're conscious and you're unconscious. That's right. That's right. And we want you to be free. So we're organizing towards that. You, the unconscious part scans back and will bring another moment to mind for us to clear. By the way, when you were six and you got left at grandparents house and mom wasn't there, and mom and dad got divorced hand in hand, did you need mom to be there in order for you to be a loving mom for your kids? Oh, that's right. So despite mom not always being there, you, you know, got to be a loving mom.
[02:28] B: Better mom.
[02:29] A: Oh, even better mom. Right.
[02:30] B: I know.
[02:31] A: Oh, there we go. Okay. Yeah. So we want that younger you to know.
[02:35] B: That's right.
[02:36] A: Right. That's right.
[02:37] B: That's right. But I know it.
[02:39] A: You do know it now.
[02:40] B: I know. I always was. I said everything that happened to me in my life, made me who I am today. That's why I got so shocked. Yeah. Because of what you said. Well, we've already been there.
[02:50] A: Yeah. We're on our way.
[02:51] B: This knows it. But this.
[02:52] A: That's right. Well, it's getting in, filtering in. That's right. Yeah. By the way, what do you notice happened to the tar? No, it was up. Where is it now? Yeah. What are you noticing?
[03:14] B: It's much smaller.
[03:15] A: Oh, it's much smaller. Yeah. Okay, that's good. That's right. That's right. And how's your body feeling now?
[03:25] B: Not as relaxed as I'd like, but better.
[03:28] A: Oh, it's on the.
[03:29] B: I'd like to be like. I like that feeling.
[03:33] A: Yeah. Well, we're on our way because things are healing. They are, right? Yeah. And so we want to travel back and another moment's going to come to mind that would be useful to clear.
[03:56] B: My stepfather used to bang on the wall when I was sleeping.
[03:59] A: Yeah. So you might have been how old?
[04:03] B: Nine.
[04:03] A: Because we know that it happened more than once. But here's the key thing. Remember how we learn? We learn by doing one thing at a time. When you learn how to tie sneakers, you don't learn on 15 pair. You're given one pair and you practice it over and over. And you know what your brain is able to do? Take what it's learned and generalize it out to all things that are similar. Wow. That's right. That's cool. That's right. Not many of us ride the same bicycle we did when we learned, and not many of us are still in the same car that we were in when we learned. But it generalizes so your brain knows what to do. So you're nine years old, it's nighttime. Right. You're sleeping. And then what happened?
[04:47] B: He walks by my room because he's angry with me.
[04:50] A: Well, he walks by your room.
[04:52] B: Walks by the wall where my bed was, right?
[04:54] A: Yes.
[04:55] B: And takes his fist and bangs on the wall.
[04:57] A: Good job. So he banged on the wall, and then what happened? Right, and then what happened next?
[05:03] B: I didn't even know. I didn't even realize what happened at a conscious level.
[05:07] A: I just go back to sleep. Then you went back to sleep, which was way better than when he banged. And that particular time ended. And then later on, you had your kids. Right. And you started your business. You had to resource store. And then you're like, you know, having sex with Joe.
[05:20] B: Right.
[05:20] A: So we got having sex with Joe and the kids and starting the retail. And then we've got, you know, being asleep and then being startled, woken up, and then him banging the thing and then him walking by. And then you going to bed. Right. And as we run through it backwards again, what do you notice happening to the feelings you can remember him doing that?
[05:38] B: Oh, yeah.
[05:38] A: You can remember working out earlier today? Yeah. Robin, stop working out. Say I'm not working.
[05:43] B: I'm not working out.
[05:44] A: Well, then stop me from working out.
[05:46] B: You're not working.
[05:46] A: Well, then stop me from putting on my watch.
[05:48] B: You're not putting on your watch.
[05:49] A: Well, stop me from kissing my daughter.
[05:50] B: You're not kissing your daughter.
[05:51] A: Well, then stop him from banging the wall.
[05:53] B: You're not banging the wall.
[05:54] A: Stop him from banging the wall. He's not banging the wall.
[05:57] B: No, he's.
[05:58] A: No. So then where is that? Say it no longer exists.
[06:01] B: It no longer exists.
[06:02] A: Right. Third, which we want to get in. And this is going to get layered in with multiple times iterations, him doing that. Did that have anything to do with you?
[06:14] B: Not now.
[06:15] A: Well, it did it then.
[06:16] B: It did. Then.
[06:17] A: No, it didn't.
[06:18] B: Oh, you mean did it have anything to do with me being. No, no, no.
[06:20] A: It had nothing to do with you.
[06:21] B: No.
[06:22] A: Here's the silly example. Okay? We got a, let's say 11 year old, first year of middle school, walking in, carrying a tray. It's got tomato soup and grilled cheese. Trips, fall splatters everywhere.
[06:34] B: Right.
[06:35] A: Everybody in the cafeteria stands up at unison. They're all laughing at the little kid. He wants to disappear and become invisible. He feels. They're all laughing at me.
[06:41] B: That's right.
[06:42] A: Which they are.
[06:42] B: Right.
[06:43] A: But we look at it as an adult and we go, wait a minute. It wouldn't have mattered whether it was that kid or any other kid in the school having that accident. That's what those kids would have done. Right? Right.
[06:54] B: That's right.
[06:54] A: See, it wouldn't have mattered who was in that situation. That's what that guy would have done.
[06:57] B: That's right.
[06:58] A: That's right. So it had nothing to do with you. Correct. But back then she didn't know that.
[07:01] B: That's right.
[07:02] A: So again, close your eyes. Picture the younger you. Let her know that it's over. Let her know it's not about me. Let her know about her kids. Let her know the business. Let her know so that she gets it. Hello. There we go. And you can open your eyes now. We're getting in. Good news. We want to go to another moment with him of something that happened. That was yucky.
[07:28] B: He told me. That's right.
[07:29] A: So you might have been how old?
[07:31] B: I was 15.
[07:31] A: 15. You're where when it happened?
[07:35] B: At the house. Right.
[07:35] A: You're at the house. Good job. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[07:38] B: Daytime.
[07:38] A: Daytime. And you're wearing the house where? Yeah. Are you in the house?
[07:42] B: I think in the. In the living room or the hallway.
[07:46] A: Right. And if you're in the living room or the hallway, you're standing or sitting?
[07:49] B: I think I was standing.
[07:51] A: You were standing and he was standing. Right. And he was like. Right, right. And then what happened next? He said.
[07:56] B: He said, basically, if you love me, you'll have sex with me.
[08:00] A: So he said, if you love me, you'll have sex with me. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[08:05] B: I cried.
[08:06] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[08:09] B: I said I couldn't do it. Right.
[08:10] A: Good. Then what happened next?
[08:15] B: He started to fall apart.
[08:17] A: He started to cry. I mean, arms weren't, like, dropping off, was he?
[08:21] B: No.
[08:21] A: He wasn't like Mr. Potato Head where shit was actually falling off. So he didn't fall apart. No, that's right. That's right. Right, right. So then he started crying or getting upset.
[08:33] B: Yeah. Right.
[08:33] A: And then what happened next?
[08:36] B: Then I had sex with him.
[08:37] A: Well, then he took you into where?
[08:38] B: His bedroom.
[08:39] A: His bedroom. Right. And then he pulled down your pants and clothes.
[08:43] B: You know what? I don't remember that part.
[08:46] A: Right, you don't remember that part?
[08:47] B: I don't. I don't remember.
[08:48] A: You don't, do you? Right. But he might have done that. And he might have put his penis in your vagina.
[08:52] B: Oh, that he did.
[08:53] A: Right.
[08:54] B: That I remember.
[08:55] A: Right. So he had his penis in your vagina, and that was for a period of time. And then he stopped.
[08:58] B: Right.
[08:58] A: And then he took it out.
[08:59] B: That's right.
[09:00] A: And then you might have put clothes back on.
[09:01] B: Yes.
[09:02] A: And then left the bedroom.
[09:03] B: Yes.
[09:03] A: And then that particular time ended.
[09:05] B: Yes.
[09:05] A: And then later on, you did something more fun, like hang out with the kids and start the business. Right. Do the stuff with Joe. Right. Good job. So we got, you know, starting the business and hanging out with the kids. Right. We've got the being in a different place and then leaving that room and then having your clothes back on and then him stopping and then him having his penis in your vagina and then him putting it there, and then you being on the bed and then you guys going in there, and then him being upset and then you saying, no, and then him saying, if you care about me, love me, then you'll do this. And then you were in the hallway, and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Good. And again, as we run through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it? Right. So interesting, isn't it? 2. You can remember him doing that and that happening you can remember putting on your sweater. Stop putting on your sweater.
[09:52] B: I'm not putting on my sweater.
[09:53] A: Stop getting your nails painted.
[09:54] B: I'm not getting your nails painted.
[09:55] A: Well, stop me from eating celery.
[09:57] B: I'm not eating celery.
[09:58] A: Well, then you stop me from eating celery.
[10:00] B: You're not eating celery.
[10:01] A: Well, then stop him from doing that. He's not doing that.
[10:03] B: He's not doing that.
[10:04] A: Yeah. So then where is it, say, no longer exists? Now, I want to add something, and I don't know whether you've thought of this in this way or not, but we know that you have a body, and your body is yours, but it isn't actually you. There's no cell in your body the same as it was back then. They've all been replaced millions of times. So you have a body. It's yours. You think thoughts, they're yours. You have emotions that are yours.
[10:27] B: That's right.
[10:28] A: There's things you do and stuff you've gone through, but none of that is actually you. So if you're not your thoughts or your feelings or your body, if you're not the things that you've gone through, and if you're not what you do, then we have a weird question. What are you? So I'd like you to do this. Think of a time when you were outdoors in nature and you see something, and it's beautiful.
[10:46] B: I know exactly what it is.
[10:48] A: Yeah. What is it that you're seeing?
[10:49] B: I was hot. I was tripping on mushrooms.
[10:52] A: Yeah.
[10:52] B: And I was laying on the grass in the park, and I was looking up at the clouds, and I had a direct experience. Download experience that everything is one.
[11:02] A: Yes.
[11:03] B: You had that.
[11:03] A: And there was a moment as you're seeing the clouds that you were experiencing peace and excitement.
[11:09] B: Oh, yeah, that's right.
[11:10] A: And some would say it's being on that trip and seeing that stuff that put the feelings in. But let's just say it's when your awareness was drawn in and you experience what we're going to call the capital S self, that light that is you. You. And the key thing about light is that it can't be touched or hurt or harmed. It only experiences love. That it allows in is totally indestructible, absolutely whole and complete. There's nothing missing. Like when you hold a baby, you go, they're absolutely perfect. They're useless because you got to feed the thing, bathe the thing, change the thing, but there's nothing missing. So I'd like to show you something Take that hand and hold it out like this. Look at that spot right there. Now, what's going to happen is I'm going to take my hand, I'm going to bring it to yours. So as you look at that spot, I'm going to bring my hand in. As my hand moves in, you see it getting closer. But before it ever touches your hand, notice how you can feel the warmth right there. It's here that you feel it there. You don't. And you can see my point, that with it here, you feel. Which means, Robin, I'm actually coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body, Than anybody that ever hurt your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with love and respect. So repeat this after me. I have a nose.
[12:37] B: I have a nose.
[12:38] A: I have two elbows.
[12:39] B: I have two elbows.
[12:40] A: I've ten fingers.
[12:41] B: I have ten fingers.
[12:42] A: I have ten toes.
[12:43] B: I have ten toes.
[12:44] A: I'm not my elbows.
[12:45] B: I'm not my elbows.
[12:46] A: I'm not my toes.
[12:47] B: I'm not my toes.
[12:48] A: I'm not my fingers.
[12:49] B: I'm not my fingers.
[12:50] A: I'm not my nose.
[12:51] B: I'm not my nose.
[12:52] A: I have a vagina.
[12:53] B: I have a vagina.
[12:54] A: I'm not my vagina.
[12:55] B: But I'm not my vagina.
[12:56] A: My vagina is mine.
[12:57] B: My vagina is mine.
[12:58] A: But it isn't me.
[12:59] B: But it isn't me.
[13:00] A: So he messed with my stuff.
[13:01] B: So he messed with my stuff.
[13:02] A: And it hurt my feelings.
[13:03] B: And it hurt my feelings.
[13:04] A: But he never touched my essence.
[13:06] B: But he never touched my essence.
[13:08] A: He never touched who I really am.
[13:10] B: He never touched who I really am.
[13:12] A: He never touched me.
[13:13] B: He never touched me.
[13:15] A: Because who I am because who I am can only be touched. Can only be touched with love and respect.
[13:20] B: With love and respect.
[13:21] A: So he messed with my stuff.
[13:23] B: So he messed with my stuff.
[13:24] A: And it hurt my feelings.
[13:25] B: And it hurt my feelings.
[13:26] A: And it screwed up my thinking.
[13:27] B: And it screwed up my thinking.
[13:28] A: But he never got me.
[13:30] B: But he never got me.
[13:31] A: Because who I am because who I am can only be touched. Can only be touched with love and respect.
[13:36] B: With love and respect.
[13:38] A: So he messed with my stuff.
[13:39] B: So he messed with my stuff.
[13:40] A: But he never touched me.
[13:42] B: But he never touched me.
[13:44] A: Take a deep breath in. That's right. Exhale. Eyes close. This wrist drops down, down, down, down, down. In to the light at your center, that column. Easy, flowing energy. That's right. As things begin to lighten up. Connecting to you. Powerful present. Heart in that. Breath out more and more. Clear, free that's right. Becoming more and more free. Out from under and up above. Lightning up. That's right. As that younger you is learning, it's over, finished, completed. It no longer exists. That him being that way and doing that stuff had nothing to do with you and everything to do with something being off with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it, then. Let her know about her own kids. Let her know about starting her business. Let her know about her retail store. Let her know so that she gets it. Let her know about the times that she's choosing. That's right. That's right. That's right. And as all of that filters in, take a big, deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. That's right. Yeah, that's right. And what's happening now? Yeah, that's right. She didn't even know whether she'd get out of that. We know she did. That's right. Cause she's powerful, isn't she? That you? Mm. That's right. We wouldn't want you to be fully connected, right. To who you really are. Light. That's right. That's right. Yeah. So what's happening now? Yeah, that's right. I mean, we wouldn't want you to have tears of relief so that you can start feeling better and better and making really good decisions. Because we always make better decisions when we're feeling good. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. It. What's happening now?
[18:44] B: I'm not sure.
[18:46] A: You're not sure, are you? But how's your body feeling it?
[19:17] B: I feel like my mind's trying to trick me, saying that you knew this before.
[19:25] A: You did know it before.
[19:27] B: I know you told me that you.
[19:29] A: Did know it before. Right. But I want you to just check, first of all. Check. How's your body feeling?
[19:40] B: More relaxed.
[19:41] A: It is feeling more relaxed. That's right. That's right. So we know that it had nothing to do with you not knowing. It's that there's an aspect of your brain that didn't know what you know, which it's now getting. You see, what if this whole thing is just checking? Is it working? And then you know how you're gonna know? You check. You check. But not just here.
[20:29] B: Did you ever hear I know you. Of course you have. But did you ever hear. You seem saying it. Did you ever hear. Of course you have people being afraid of their greatness more than they're afraid of their past or their traumas. Afraid of their greatness.
[20:58] A: Well, that's a good thing to be, you know, Afraid of? I mean, we're not saying you have to do anything with it. See, can't you just be great not doing a darn thing at all?
[21:17] B: I don't know.
[21:18] A: Oh, you don't know. But what if you could?
[21:22] B: Oh, my God.
[21:23] A: See, you keep thinking that this thing is all about what I have to do. See, if I'm great, I have to do all of these things. What if you don't have to do anything at all? Say I'm wondering how great it would be realizing that you don't have to do anything at all.
[21:44] B: That would be amazing.
[21:46] A: It would be amazing to be realizing how great it is to not have to do anything at all.
[21:55] B: I would know. That would be a very new thing.
[21:59] A: It's a very new thing. Because you know how you've always dealt with stuff? By being a doer. That's right. You've been being a doer. See, I'm wondering how great it'll be to not have to do to feel loved. Oh, see, that's the whole thing. We want to go back. Because where this thing is off. Got that. Is that you've been thinking that I need to do something in order to be loved. Check it out. Was that actually being loved? See, that's where the confusion is. Robin, wasn't that guy just fucking your body?
[23:04] B: Well, that's the weird thing. I think he did love me.
[23:07] A: Well, he did love you, but in a fucked up way. But see, the love was the love of being able to do that to your body.
[23:18] B: Yes, that's right.
[23:21] A: That's right.
[23:22] B: Yes, I know that.
[23:24] A: Oh, aren't you more than your body? So much. You are so much more than your body. So what's it like, you know, when you're being loved and you don't have to do anything?
[23:54] B: Oh, my goodness.
[23:55] A: See, I'm wondering what's it like as you're already getting it inside. See, the problem is that what's been going on is that you've been thinking, I need something outside of me.
[24:08] B: Yes, yes.
[24:10] A: In order to feel love. Yes. But as we talk. You have children, right? Yes, three. Wow. So when a baby's born, they're perfect. There's nothing missing. They're whole and complete. They got the whole package, while at the same time, they're useless. You've got to feed them, change them, bait them. They can't do anything on their own. They didn't even know if their hands are their hands. Right. So if we start off perfect, whole and complete. Bite. What is it that makes us Feel like we're not. It's the things that we go through that slam in these images imprints on us.
[25:01] B: That's right.
[25:02] A: That's right. That make us feel like we're not whole and complete. You are so to the extent that you're whole and complete, Loving the light that is you see. And not just in an altered state, but there are other times that you've been out in nature and you see something beautiful.
[25:40] B: Oh, yeah.
[25:41] A: And in the moment that you do, your awareness is drawn in and you experience who you really are. So now close your eyes and let that younger you know that you're so much more than just your body. Loving you. That's right. And that she doesn't need anything outside of her in order to love her kids. Because she's got a heart. That's right. And it's becoming more and more clear. That's right. In the light. Loving who you are so much more than you think you are. Because how wouldn't you not be if you weren't not loving you more and more lighter and free.
[27:09] B: Yeah, the host too.
[27:11] A: I know. On purpose.
[27:12] B: Okay, okay.
[27:15] A: Who wouldn't you be if you weren't not you is a hard thing to stay with. Who wouldn't you be if you weren't not you? And unlike how you've been, how are you not not loving people around you? Unlike how you've been, how are you not loving you now? Because what's not good enough about being who you really are? Light. That's right. And loving you. Loving others. Loving you. Loving others. That's right. You haven't been realizing that as you're loving others, you're loving you. Loving others. Because it feels really good to be loving to others. That's right. Loving you. That's right. And unlike how you've been, how are you not not good enough when you're being who you really are. Loving you. When you're loving others, Aren't you loving others? Loving you. That's right. Being of service. That's right. You are so much more than you think you are. Becoming more and more of who you really are, which is so much more than you think you are Lightening up because we wouldn't want you to feel really good about loving you. That's right. Feel really good about you. Loving you. Loving others. That's right. So much more than you think you are.
[29:35] B: That's what I miss.
[29:36] A: Well, how about now.
[29:45] B: I can love whoever I want.
[29:47] A: Loving you. That's right. That's right. So you can love Others to the extent that you love you powerful.
[30:18] B: I'm loving myself when I love others.
[30:20] A: You didn't realize that, did you?
[30:22] B: Well, that's so much.
[30:24] A: No, I hadn't been thinking of that. But doesn't it feel good to be of service?
[30:30] B: Oh, my God.
[30:31] A: So that's you loving you. Right? See, you didn't realize. You haven't been realizing. That's right. So you can be of service to the extent that you're loving you as you're loving others.
[30:51] B: That's what's been missing.
[30:53] A: And to the extent that that's getting in, you're feeling more peaceful because you already have everything you need. That's right. It's already there. Because you can check. You can think about the thing that happened with stepdad and the different times that it did. And when you think about it now, what are you noticing?
[31:39] B: I've been blaming myself.
[31:49] A: Well, how about now?
[32:06] B: I'm learning what love is.
[32:10] A: Right.
[32:12] B: Truthfully.
[32:13] A: Oh, as you love others, you're loving you. Right.
[32:22] B: What's the most important thing to me?
[32:24] A: See, you didn't realize how you're loving you. When you love others, doing that service is loving you because it feels really good. That's right. And now we wouldn't want to be a little easier on you.
[32:43] B: Yeah. It's very important to me to love others. It's when they don't want me to love them. It hurts.
[32:59] A: But see, loving others is when you're of service without attachment. That's right. See, when you're really loving yourself is when you're of service without attachment. When you're of service is when you're really loving you as you're loving others. That's right. That's right. That's right. Which is different than a love relationship, because why did you start the business?
[33:44] B: Because I wanted women to feel beautiful on their special day.
[33:47] A: That's right. That's right.
[33:51] B: I knew I didn't feel that way, and I wanted to give that gift.
[33:58] A: Right. So being of service. Right. Love. That's right. What you haven't been not realizing is how much you love you. That's right. See? That's right. Right. And you wouldn't want to feel really good about getting that now. That's right. That's right.
[34:42] B: Can it be true? Can it be true?
[34:46] A: I just checked it out. First of all, how's it feeling? See, you never realized because unlike how you've been loving others, being of service is loving you. So to the extent that you've been of service is how much you love you, being of service, loving others, loving you. And has nothing to do with worth or deserving because life isn't, you know, about whether I deserve it or not or whether I'm worthy of it. I mean, all kids deserve to be healthy and all kids deserve to be loved. Even the ones that are getting molested, even the ones that are born with congenital defects. So if health and love has nothing to do with whether we deserve it, neither does anything else. See, what you haven't been realizing is how you've been living life, being of service, and it all coming from the heart. You've just been hard on you. So let's soften that.
[36:29] B: Yes, let's.
[36:30] A: So that we can melt into being easy on you. Right. So you can only be hard on yourself to the extent that it feels really easy to love you.
[36:51] B: I just. I don't like certain things about myself right now.
[36:55] A: You don't like certain ways that you've been feeling or acting different than self. You don't like ways that you've been feeling or acting, Acting. You've been listening to people and therefore you've been believing it's yourself that you haven't been liking. See, when you're in service, loving others is when you're feeling. Loving you. Right? And you've been missing being of service. That's right. See, that's the thing. So you might be upset over ways that you've been feeling and things that you haven't been doing, but that's different than you. You're not things that you do. See, part of what's been problematic is you've been thinking that I am what I do. I am how I feel, I am how I think. But see, the problem with that is all of those are in the realm of changeable. You can change how you feel, you can change how you think. You can change what you do. See, where people get confused. They confuse identity, thoughts, feelings and behaviors with identity.
[38:26] B: Right?
[38:28] A: You see, thoughts, feelings and behaviors are all in the realm of changeable. So if a girl walks in and she says, hi, my name is Sally, I'm five two, and I'm shy. If Sally is thinking about her shyness in the same way she thinks about her height, can she ever change it?
[38:49] B: No.
[38:50] A: No. But her shyness isn't the same thing as her height. It's a way that she feels, the ways that she thinks and affects how she acts, but it's not a part of who she is. Who you are is so much more than you think. So unlike how it's been. You're realizing you are the light and that sometimes you're just disappointed in how you've been feeling and ways that you've been acting or some of the thoughts that you've been having, which what's been problematic is that you've been thinking that's you. Because people get confused. They use the word ego as if there's an actual thing called an ego. It's not real.
[39:37] B: That's what I've been hearing for months.
[39:42] A: Frame that people use to explain things is not real.
[39:46] B: Right?
[39:48] A: Huh? I don't actually have an id, an ego and a superego, they were just a way to explain things. Right. Who you are is the light that you connect to as you see the clouds, that as you feel it when you're in service. And you wouldn't want to be feeling really good about the realizations that you're getting now. Because unlike how you've been, you're becoming more and more at peace with you.
[40:29] B: It's been so long, Doctor.
[40:31] A: Doesn't matter.
[40:33] B: Like over a year and a half.
[40:37] A: And the bigger question to be, I.
[40:45] B: Don'T mind it anymore.
[40:46] A: Well, check it out right now. How are you feeling? How are you feeling?
[40:56] B: It's hard to say right now.
[40:58] A: It is. How's your body feeling? Oh, it's just hard to say. Huh. Well, then you don't have to say anything. That would be easier. Hmm. Yeah. Oh, it's easy to say nothing.
[41:33] B: It's easy to say nothing, right?
[41:35] A: It is easy to say nothing, which is better than hard. Yes, that's right. You want to. Want to feel like, you know, it's softening up so that you're lighter. That's right. See all these breaths? What's going on in your body that you're not always fully connected to because you don't know quite what's happening. But then when you go to check with your body and we're not all the way done, we're on our way, but we're not all the way done. Things are lightening up. That's right. Because I want you to check, think about the things that we've talked about so far. Being left at Grandma's, that two year old you, the banging on the wall, the sex stuff. When you think about that stuff, what do you notice?
[42:59] B: Doesn't matter.
[43:04] A: What do you notice happened to the feelings inside?
[43:27] B: The thing that is tricking me up is I never thought it did.
[43:30] A: What do you notice happened to the feelings? Feelings. When you think about that stuff, what do you notice happen to the feelings, like the bad feelings, the guilt feelings, the shame feelings, the hurt feelings, the unloved unless undoing feelings. What do you notice happening to those feelings, Robin? Right. They're not there. That's the part that's different. That's right. It wasn't what you knew. And yes, for a long period of time, you put that in a small container and moved it far away. And you did your life and you were active and engaged and you didn't realize how much you were loving you as you were in service to others. That's right. That's right. And then you stopped doing those things. And the thing that hadn't been fully cleared because we just put it in a small box, moved into the empty space. That's right. That's right. And now we're bringing light to the darkness so that things begin to lighten up and you begin to feel free. Yeah. And that's where we're headed, is you becoming more and more free to be more of who you really are. Lighter and clear and a lot more easy going and happy. That's right. That's right. And you're feeling it now. Check, check. See, how you're gonna know what's different is you check with your feelings, not what you're telling yourself. You're a really bright gal. You wouldn't have been able to compartmentalize that for as long as you did. If you don't have a really bright mind. That's right. But as I keep bringing you back to checking here, that's how you're really gonna know what's different. Because when you think about it, it doesn't have the same feeling that it once did. Right.
[46:27] B: It's different. I just want it to be all gone.
[46:31] A: Well, we're on our way.
[46:32] B: I know, I know.
[46:34] A: To having it be all gone. I mean, heck, we've only spent a few hours together.
[46:38] B: I know, I know.
[46:39] A: I mean, when you really think about it, we've spent a few hours together now and look at how much farther we are. So think of it this way. If we were making a cake, baking a cake from scratch, we first have to get the instructions, then we have to get the ingredients, and we have to measure out the ingredients and we have to put them in, in the appropriate orders, and then we mix them all together, and now we have this gooey substance that's not cake. But how much closer are we to the finished product than we were when we started? Got it. So we're just not all the way there yet. We're on our way. We're a hell of a lot closer than we were when we started. Things have already lightened up, and you're going to notice a lot of changes for yourself. How you're going to notice the changes is you're going to notice in situations where normally I'd be and I'm not. That's right. Things are going to become more and more quiet inside. That's right. And as they become more and more quiet inside, inside, it's going to be even easier and easier for you. Lightening up and feeling better and on the way to better and on the way to more and more of it and even more than what you used to think you were. Because where it is, is we take that and all of that, but it's. Remember the three gunas. You're going through the third phase of the transformation. Letting go of the form to create a new. Which will include some of it, but be even more than that. That's where we're headed. We're just not all the way there yet. And in doing it so that you're feeling comfortable. An easy, fluid frame. Got it. Okay. You did great work today. And we're on our way. Yeah. Yeah. So.
[49:12] B: Well, when can I see you again?
[49:18] A: Well, let's go find out how we're gonna put that in the schedule and where.
[49:23] B: I hope you can before I go.
[49:25] A: Why wouldn't I be able to? I can do anything that I want to do. Yeah. Yeah. And it doesn't even have to be in person. It doesn't. I do lots of work with people I've never met in person.
[49:50] B: What do you do? What are you talking about?
[49:55] A: On the phone. Yeah. Because it gets the same thing done. Yeah. Right. And you have a powerful practice. Lower your jaw, rest your tongue, Breathe in a way that your exhales and inhale are slower and deeper than they normally are, allowing your awareness to expand, Noticing more of the space and what it's like to fly up above. Ease. Effortless. Fine. Sorry.
[50:33] B: I don't. I. I really don't even. I really don't even know what I'm so afraid of because everything is unfolding beautifully.
[50:43] A: I know that you are not just really anxious, because when my mom says, I'm anxious to see your kids, I don't think she means nervous.
[50:53] B: No, she means excitement.
[50:54] A: Oh, yeah. You wouldn't want to feel really excited about your new adventure. Oh, right. And so you. Maybe you are actually already beginning to feel excited inside about it because we know that you've got all the skills. We know that you have everything you need. And as that younger, you realize that she made it through something that was challenging, that she didn't know how it was going to turn out, and that she's okay. And we wouldn't want to have you take that into whatever it is you doing now, realizing that no matter what you're gonna do, you're gonna go through it, you're gonna be okay. That's right. Because you have everything you need, and things are lightening up, getting you out of the dark so that things brighten up inside. Yeah. Yeah. All right, so come with me.
[51:41] B: Okay. Yes.
[51:43] A: Because I know that somebody else is wanting to, of course. Be in here.
[51:47] B: Of course. Oh, my goodness. You can do this all over again.
[51:50] A: Oh, not me. No.
