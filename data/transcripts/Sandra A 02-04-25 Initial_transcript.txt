[00:00] A: Oh. Today is the 4th of February.
[00:03] B: Yeah.
[00:04] A: Sandra, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. This is our first meeting. Given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:15] B: It's okay with me.
[00:16] A: Cool. So the thing that you said earlier is I got a lot of trauma to get through.
[00:21] B: Yeah.
[00:21] A: And what I said is, you already got through it.
[00:23] B: Yeah.
[00:24] A: So then we want to understand how come emotional wounds don't heal.
[00:29] B: Okay.
[00:30] A: Right. If I broke my foot when I was 11 and I told you about it right now, and I'm as emotional as when it happened, you're going to look at me like I'm crazy.
[00:37] B: Exactly.
[00:38] A: This guy walks all over the place. His foot is fine.
[00:40] B: Yeah.
[00:41] A: However, on the flip side, I tell you about my uncle when I was 11 and what he did to me, and I start to get all emotional about it and you're like, well, yeah, of course.
[00:48] B: Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:49] A: But why?
[00:50] B: Because emotional trauma is weird, Right.
[00:52] A: But it's weird, right? Physical wounds healing.
[00:54] B: Yeah.
[00:55] A: Emotional wounds don't. Even though we have the same that time heals all wounds. So why don't the emotional wounds heal? And it's not because they can't. It's because when I went through the troubling experiences, it literally short circuited my brain and my brain froze it, typically frozen as a short gif of the worst of the worst of the worst moment of it. But it froze it where it froze it. That part of my brain, not me, but that part of my brain doesn't know I made it through it. I survived it. I'm okay.
[01:31] B: Yeah.
[01:32] A: So where therapy got it wrong and what we all learned how to do in life is if there are things that I've gone through that make me feel bad anytime I think about them, well, then I figure out lots of different ways to not think about them. Because whenever I do, I feel awful.
[01:46] B: Be happy thoughts.
[01:47] A: Right. But you also recognize that there are times that you do think about it, even when you're not wanting to. There are times that you're in situations that are similar or reminders of it and you. Right. So even despite my effort, it still happens to me, even though I don't want it to. Right. So therapy thought that people buried in repress, they locked it behind closed doors and that the job is to help the person get the bad feelings out. Because when they were trying to survive it, they weren't able to really fully express how it was making them feel.
[02:18] B: Okay.
[02:19] A: And so they buried that. But what if people didn't bury it? What if you don't have emotions trapped inside of you that we need to get out? What if it's the reverse?
[02:29] B: Yeah.
[02:30] A: What if it's about getting the good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know the awful moment ended? I survived it. I made it through it. I'm okay. What if it's more about unplugging the memory so the brain can experience what happened as. As data about something that happened versus where it's stuck inside is happening?
[02:51] B: Okay.
[02:52] A: Does that make sense?
[02:53] B: Kind of.
[02:54] A: So the reason that we stay troubled by past experiences isn't because they happened. Which I know that sounds crazy, but it's because when it happened, my brain froze it and doesn't know it ended.
[03:08] B: Okay.
[03:10] A: Isn't that weird?
[03:11] B: That is weird.
[03:11] A: Right?
[03:12] B: Yeah.
[03:13] A: But it just doesn't know that it ended. I totally do, but it's why I can have done 40 years of therapy after what my uncle did to me. And I can know that what he did wasn't my fault. It was because of whatever's going on with him. I can know that some of what he did felt good. But it wasn't because I'm gay or like men.
[03:31] B: Yeah.
[03:32] A: Because the body part touched in that way is designed to feel good.
[03:34] B: Yeah.
[03:35] A: Right. I can even have done the intellectual work of forgiving him, realizing that he just wasn't well.
[03:40] B: Yeah.
[03:40] A: I can do all of that work. Why inside do I still feel that guilt, grief, anger, hurt, shame.
[03:46] B: Yeah.
[03:47] A: You would think once I know better, I should feel different. But it doesn't work that way. Because until I get it in here, it doesn't matter what I tell myself up here, until the memory is unplugged, it doesn't matter what I know. I never feel different. Yeah. So it's really cool is what if you don't have to be back in that moment.
[04:07] B: Right.
[04:08] A: That you actually want to be here?
[04:10] B: Yeah. I can be present.
[04:11] A: Right. Present with me. Because I'm more fun than the moment.
[04:14] B: Exactly.
[04:14] A: And I don't set the bar very high. I'm really hoping that hanging with me is at least a little more enjoyable than the worst moments of your life.
[04:23] B: It's only one thing someone could hope.
[04:25] A: Right. You know? So therefore, what do we want to do? We want you to be present. As we recall anything that was troubling that begins to unplug it.
[04:35] B: Okay.
[04:36] A: Right. So. But nobody would care about any of the crap that they've gone through if it wasn't negatively affecting now? Okay, meaning if I was doing life the way I wanted to and feeling and acting and reacting the way I wanted to, and things are going away, I wouldn't give a shit about any of that.
[04:52] B: Exactly.
[04:53] A: The reason I do is that I recognize that at different levels and in different ways, it's still affecting me. So my idea always is, well, how do we want you to be when we're done? Because if that stuff was no longer having the effect that it's been having on you, how would you actually be? And secondarily, what do I need to know in terms of your day to day function that's not optimal for you? Like, you know, some people, they're more edgy or irritable. Some people, they're more nervous, tense, anxious. Right. Like, so what do we want to get better? And then what do you think would be useful for me to know, to understand? And I already got that. There's a whole bunch of that's happened. That although it's over underneath the surface, it's continued to affect you. And one of the things we want to do is get the effect on. I know how to do that.
[05:42] B: Okay, perfect.
[05:42] A: Okay. But what else would be useful for me to know, to understand how things have been? How do we want you to be okay?
[05:50] B: Well, I want to just not be as anxious and.
[05:54] A: Well, how do you know you're anxious?
[05:55] B: I can't sit still. I have that feeling in my stomach. It doesn't go away.
[06:01] A: If you didn't have the feeling in your stomach, would you stop being anxious?
[06:05] B: Maybe.
[06:05] A: Are there other times that you have the feeling in your stomach when you weren't anxious at all?
[06:09] B: Yeah.
[06:10] A: Isn't that interesting? So you've had the feeling and you weren't anxious?
[06:14] B: No.
[06:14] A: Huh. Weird.
[06:16] B: Weird.
[06:16] A: That is weird. Right? Because one of the ways that you've been deciding that I'm. I have anxiety is that I feel the thing. But there are some times that I feel the thing and I'm not anxious at all.
[06:25] B: Yeah.
[06:25] A: Which is weird because I have the memories. Well, you have memories of stuff.
[06:29] B: Yeah.
[06:30] A: That happened.
[06:31] B: Yeah.
[06:31] A: But you're not troubled because you have memories. We're not actually gonna erase memories, we're gonna unplug memories.
[06:37] B: Yeah, I want to unplug them.
[06:38] A: Right. So you can read them as data, historical information about stuff that happened. Okay, I got that. So the anxiety is you have a hard time sitting still. There's some uneasiness inside. There's that there. That goes on. You'd like to get that to stop?
[06:54] B: Yeah.
[06:54] A: Okay. What else?
[06:56] B: Just be happy all around. Happy and healthy.
[07:00] A: Whatever. What does that mean?
[07:01] B: I don't know.
[07:02] A: Somebody punches you in the face and you're like, oh, yeah, yeah, that'd be weird.
[07:09] B: I don't know. I just want to not have the replays in my head all the time.
[07:16] A: Yeah. If you weren't having those replays, how would you actually be.
[07:23] B: More functioning?
[07:24] A: What would that look like? What's a you that's more functioning? How do we know?
[07:28] B: Productive member of society.
[07:29] A: Well, but like, how would we know if we re watching? How do we know that you're being more productive?
[07:33] B: I'm not sure.
[07:35] A: Well, like, have you ever watched a baseball game?
[07:37] B: Yeah. I mean, I'd probably be working.
[07:39] A: Okay.
[07:40] B: Probably be a better mother.
[07:43] A: Like, how so how might you be a better mom?
[07:45] B: I wouldn't have fallen into addiction.
[07:47] A: Well, that's what you did do. Yeah. Oh. So if you're not doing that. No, you're not.
[07:52] B: I would just work and take care of them and be supportive of them.
[07:57] A: By the way, you feeling really guilty over what happened? Yeah. Does that make you a better parent?
[08:02] B: No.
[08:03] A: No. I mean, it's totally coming out of your love for them. Right. Like, you wouldn't be feeling this if you didn't care about them.
[08:07] B: Yeah.
[08:08] A: However, you feeling guilty over that having happened isn't better for you or them. Like, they don't get a better mom when she feels shitty over how she was. So we want you to also lighten up on you.
[08:23] B: Okay.
[08:25] A: And get at a deeper level that all the shit that happened.
[08:28] B: Yeah.
[08:29] A: Couldn't have not happened. So they get to be at peace that it did. Not that it makes it okay, but that I get to be more okay now, even though that stuff wasn't okay because my kids are better off with a me who's okay.
[08:43] B: Yeah.
[08:44] A: Got it.
[08:45] B: Yeah.
[08:46] A: Who's rock solid in her recovery.
[08:48] B: Exactly.
[08:49] A: Who's present? Who's no longer affected by the shit that did. Who's clear.
[08:55] B: Yeah.
[08:56] A: Yeah. Okay.
[08:57] B: Minded.
[08:57] A: That's good. Yeah. I can get behind doing all that. Cool. Yeah. What else? What else do we want to do for you? What else would be useful for me to know, to understand?
[09:11] B: Just not go back to drugs. That's a big thing. Like, I don't want to go back to drugs and alcohol because that destroyed me.
[09:18] A: Oh. It's just the drugs and alcohol.
[09:20] B: Drugs, alcohol, myself.
[09:23] A: What do you mean yourself?
[09:24] B: I destroy myself. I beat myself up emotionally, you know?
[09:28] A: Oh, you do? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.
[09:30] B: A lot.
[09:31] A: Oh, how, How? I mean, that definitely has people perform better.
[09:35] B: Yeah, exactly. It doesn't help at all.
[09:37] A: No, it doesn't, does it? Okay.
[09:39] B: No, I mentally beat myself up.
[09:41] A: Yeah, you lighten up on you.
[09:43] B: Yeah.
[09:43] A: Right. And you're clear. Right. Because that stuff doesn't support who you're becoming. That's where the problem is.
[09:52] B: Yeah.
[09:52] A: Right. For somebody who smokes cigarettes, the question is never do you want a cigarette?
[09:56] B: No.
[09:57] A: Because the answer to that question sometimes might be yes.
[09:59] B: Exactly.
[10:00] A: Right. If you ask somebody who, you know, wants to be done with cigarettes and they do you want a cigarette? They say no, because I don't want to be a smoker because I'm not focused on a cigarette. I'm knowing that that cigarette will be right.
[10:13] B: Like so cigarettes and a carton of cigarettes.
[10:15] A: Correct. Right. You got the whole thing. So. Yeah, that's why I don't focus on. I, I look at the bigger question. Okay, Right. And that's what you want, is you want all of that to be in alignment.
[10:27] B: Yeah.
[10:28] A: Right. Because sometimes drugs, alcohol and other things start off as ways to not feel.
[10:35] B: Yeah. And I like to feel now.
[10:39] A: Well, better. Yeah. But not always bad feelings.
[10:43] B: No.
[10:43] A: So sometimes there are ways to mask bad feelings.
[10:46] B: Yeah.
[10:47] A: Right. Which then forecast later to bad feelings.
[10:53] B: Forecast it here. Here we are.
[10:57] A: Okay. Yeah. So you want to be rock solid in your recovery.
[11:00] B: Yeah, yeah.
[11:01] A: And crystal clear.
[11:02] B: Crystal clear.
[11:03] A: Okay, cool. I can get behind that. What else?
[11:07] B: I want to be rock side of my recovery. I want to be crystal clear. I want to just be able to. I want to be able to feel emotions without having to numb emotions. Like, I want to be able to feel my bad emotions, feel my good emotions and work through them.
[11:21] A: Okay.
[11:21] B: Like that's a big thing for me because emotions and feeling is like, say, why was in jail for 10 months. I self medicated a lot with, you know, the psych drugs that they give us. So I went from not feeling anything to now I downed all of my meds.
[11:42] A: What does that mean?
[11:44] B: I lowered the screen.
[11:45] A: Oh, down. Okay.
[11:46] B: Yeah, I downed them because I can't just instantly not.
[11:49] A: I downed them all.
[11:50] B: Yeah, no, no, no, no, I. I lowered them.
[11:53] A: What? Hold on for a second. We got a different thing going on.
[11:56] B: Yeah, hold on. We got something else going on here. No, but I lowered all my dosages of everything. So now feeling is like, it's like overwhelming at points where it's just like I feel like I am constantly on the verge of tears because I feel Like, I'm feeling happy, I'm feeling angry, I'm feeling. I'm feeling all these emotions and I'm not used to feeling them at all. Like, I. I mean, I went from being a full blown addict with drinking 247 and using drugs to going to jail. And still instead of feeling emotions, I was like, you know, give me 200 milligrams of lamectile on 20 to 30 milligrams of Abilify and taking that every day to Now I'm on 200 milligrams of linitol and 10 milligrams of Abilify. And so now I'm able to take in more feelings than I've ever felt sober as an adult because I was either smoking weed, smoking crack, smoking Molly, or drinking. And now I just want to be able to feel them without constantly feeling overwhelmed.
[13:02] A: Right.
[13:03] B: Because I feel like now I replay everything like a constant videotape. It's like you put that VHS in and you're just rewinding, rewinding, rewinding, rewinding, rewinding. And I'm tired of that. I'm tired of rewinding. I just want to fast forward. Not fast forward, but move forward.
[13:23] A: Yeah. Right. Be done with that. Yeah. Because it's not working.
[13:28] B: It's not.
[13:29] A: And you're not troubled or having those thoughts because what happened was wrong.
[13:32] B: Yeah.
[13:33] A: Or what you did was. Exactly. Or that it shouldn't have happened or that you shouldn't have done it. It's only because your brain doesn't know it's over.
[13:40] B: Yeah.
[13:40] A: Yeah.
[13:41] B: And I want my brain to know that it's over.
[13:42] A: Yeah. So it's easy to get the good news in.
[13:44] B: Yeah.
[13:45] A: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So then how we want you to be is we want you to be much more emotionally present, a lot lighter and easier on yourself. We want your mind to be clear so that you're seeing situations clearly, that you're rock solid in your recovery and much more at peace, much more comfortable in you. So you're able to move through the differing emotions that you've been experiencing.
[14:11] B: Yeah.
[14:11] A: We want the effect that the past stuff has had gone so it's no longer weighing.
[14:16] B: Yeah.
[14:16] A: Yeah. Okay. So this is the you that I'm seeing when we're done.
[14:19] B: Okay.
[14:20] A: You don't have to see this. You just like I do.
[14:22] B: Yeah.
[14:23] A: Right. Because the question isn't how it's going to happen, it's would it be okay with you?
[14:27] B: I'm okay with it.
[14:28] A: Yeah. It's okay with you. Right. So now we've got a green light to organize.
[14:31] B: Yeah.
[14:31] A: Then all we're going to do is do a process that uses brain levers to put your body into a state of rest. And the reason we want your body at rest is that's what accelerates healing.
[14:40] B: Okay.
[14:40] A: It's why colds, flus, and surgery, we tell people to do the same thing.
[14:44] B: Yeah.
[14:45] A: Get rest.
[14:46] B: Yeah.
[14:46] A: Right?
[14:46] B: Yeah.
[14:47] A: So the levers are really simple. The first ones, hold on. Okay. First lever is about slightly lowering the jaw. So not a complete drop like, ah. But a little bit like this. Right. When you slightly lower your jaw, it stimulates the nerve that comes out of the brain called the vagus nerve, that's connected to the vital organs in the body. Starts to down regulate nervous system. Second lever is you relax the back of your tongue so that your tongue rests at the bottom of your mouth like this. Third, you begin to intentionally breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale, and then a little bit longer on the exhale. Right. So your jaw continues to stay lowered, you're resting your tongue, you're breathing in a little bit slower and deeper out a little bit longer. Right. And as you're checking in with your body, Sandra, how is your body feeling now? Like more tense or more calm. Isn't that cool? As your body's more calm. See my nose continuing to breathe in the way you are. A little slower and deeper. As you see my nose, you see my fingers, but stay looking at my nose. When my fingers move out, stay looking at my nose so that with the sides of your eyes, you pick up my fingers wiggling. As you're doing this, notice how you become more aware of the space in the room. Right. Like between us and beyond me.
[16:15] B: Yeah.
[16:16] A: To either side of you, behind you and above, underneath. And how, when you notice the space again, check. How's your body feeling now? It is calm. Right. And then the last little one, you might have said it before or heard somebody use the phrase, I'm under a lot of stress, which means in order to be underneath the stress, the stress has to be on top and above them. So the reversal is to get out from under it and rise up above it, having the opposite metaphor of a bird's eye view, which simply means being a bird above, seeing things underneath and below you. So in a moment, go ahead and close your eyes. And now with your eyes closed, imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling in the roof, so that you rise Way up above it, all in the sky, having a bird's eye view, you're seeing everything is being underneath and below you because you're above and over it. And just like a bird, free to move through the expanse of the space of the sky in any direction with big wide arching turns and curves. You soar, you fly, you glide, you move your frame. That's right, when you're ready, you bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you. Taking a nice deep breath in, you then exhale and allow your eyes to open. Good. Those short moments, eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself felt light. You felt light. Isn't that a nice thing? And so as your body's feeling light, the other then conscious part of your brain which has been listening to what we're talking to, is going to go back down the timeline of those moments that left imprints, those yucky things that we try not to think about. It's going to categorize and group then. And then it's going to narrow, pinpoint and bring one to your awareness that would be useful for us to unplug. And you got one. Isn't that interesting? The one that happened, that came to mind. Happened how long ago?
[18:24] B: A year ago.
[18:25] A: A year ago. Good. So what we want is, we want you to be with me here. The reason. Right, because notice how you're going there for a moment, right. I want you to hear, I'm way more fun.
[18:33] B: Hi.
[18:33] A: Right. Good job. See, the reason you want to be here with me is that this is what's happening and that shit isn't.
[18:39] B: Okay.
[18:39] A: Two, we're working on the mutual goal that we both want for you. Three, Remember, I'm a little more fun than sucky moments.
[18:44] B: Yeah, sucky moments suck.
[18:45] A: Right. Then how we get it better is you're going to go through what happened in a matter of fact way. Way. Just the facts. In about a minute or less. So to go, that happened, that happened. That happened, that happened, that happened, Then it was over. 3. If it happened a year ago, there have been many things you've done later in life that were more enjoyable than that moment.
[19:04] B: Yeah.
[19:04] A: Anytime after that, until yesterday, that was more fun than that. What's something you've done that was fun? Yeah, that was more fun than the thing a year ago.
[19:11] B: I mean everything.
[19:12] A: No. Well, give me one thing.
[19:14] B: I met new people.
[19:15] A: Yeah.
[19:16] B: I went and got help.
[19:17] A: Right, you got help, Right. You met new people. Good. Something else. I mean, you got out of jail. Yeah, that Was way better than that.
[19:23] B: Way better.
[19:23] A: Right. Good. Something else I got.
[19:25] B: I'm proud of myself.
[19:26] A: Yeah. Well. Right. But something you've done.
[19:28] B: Something I've done?
[19:28] A: Yeah.
[19:29] B: I started working out.
[19:30] A: You started working out.
[19:30] B: Right.
[19:31] A: So we're working out. Right. We got out of jail. Right. We're meeting new people. We're getting help. All of those things happen after that moment.
[19:39] B: Yeah.
[19:39] A: There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond it.
[19:43] B: Yeah.
[19:43] A: So we have good news to get in.
[19:46] B: Yeah.
[19:46] A: Don't you think?
[19:47] B: Yeah.
[19:48] A: Yeah. So when that one happened. When it happened, you were where?
[19:51] B: In my car.
[19:51] A: So you're in the car. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[19:53] B: Nighttime.
[19:54] A: Night time. And you're wearing your car, like, in a parking lot? In a driveway, in a parking lot. So you're in a parking lot.
[19:58] B: Good.
[19:58] A: Right. And be here because notice that you're not in a parking lot and it's totally day.
[20:01] B: Yeah. I'm definitely in a room.
[20:02] A: You totally are in a room. That's right. And see, my job is to keep you here.
[20:07] B: Okay?
[20:08] A: That's the partnership. Your job is to intend to be here. My job is to keep you here. So if I notice that you're going, I'm going to do everything I know how to do to get you back with me.
[20:15] B: Yeah.
[20:15] A: Because I'm more fun.
[20:16] B: Way more fun.
[20:17] A: Got it.
[20:17] B: I love it.
[20:18] A: So you're in the parking lot. Right. And then what happened next?
[20:21] B: My son got out to go to the bathroom.
[20:22] A: So he got out to go to the bathroom. Right. And he got out of the passenger seat or the back seat. Right.
[20:26] B: Good job.
[20:26] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[20:28] B: I left.
[20:29] A: So then you drove off. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[20:31] B: I forgot that he was in the bathroom.
[20:33] A: Right. And then you forgot that he was in the bathroom. Right. Good. And what happened next?
[20:36] B: I kept going.
[20:37] A: Right. Until. That's right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[20:42] B: The cops called.
[20:43] A: The cops called you?
[20:44] B: Yeah.
[20:44] A: Hey, by the way, we have your son.
[20:47] B: Yeah.
[20:47] A: You do. Fuck. Okay. Right.
[20:51] B: I turned around.
[20:52] A: Right. Good job.
[20:53] B: Right.
[20:53] A: And then what happened next?
[20:54] B: I didn't exactly know what gas station I was at.
[20:57] A: Right.
[20:57] B: So I had to figure out what gas station I was at.
[20:59] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. Then what happened next?
[21:02] B: I dropped off the person that was in my car.
[21:04] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[21:06] B: And then I kept driving. And.
[21:07] A: Right.
[21:08] B: Followed my Google Maps.
[21:09] A: Right. The detail. Right. And then what happened next?
[21:11] B: I pulled up.
[21:12] A: Yes.
[21:13] B: Back to the gas station.
[21:14] A: Yes. Good job. The Detail. Right. Then what happened next? I ended up the cops were there with your kid.
[21:20] B: Yeah.
[21:20] A: Right. You talked to them.
[21:21] B: And I was talking to them, and I was talking to a DCFS case.
[21:24] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[21:26] B: She was telling me that she was trying to keep me from going to jail.
[21:28] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened next? And be here. Hi.
[21:33] B: Hi.
[21:33] A: Hi.
[21:34] B: Hi. It's so much better here.
[21:35] A: Okay.
[21:36] B: They allowed me to go home with my parents.
[21:39] A: Right. Good job.
[21:39] B: With my kids.
[21:40] A: Right? Yes. Because they said, well, they let you go home. Right. And then.
[21:43] B: Yeah, I just opened up a DCFS case.
[21:45] A: Right.
[21:45] B: And I went home and.
[21:47] A: And then that moment was over.
[21:48] B: Yeah.
[21:48] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[21:50] B: Yeah.
[21:51] A: Like get help or get out of jail.
[21:52] B: Yeah.
[21:53] A: Right. Or meet nice peeps. Or start working out. You're working out right now. Notice as you were telling me about it, there was discomfort.
[21:59] B: Yeah.
[22:00] A: Not because that was such a sucky moment, but because your brain was confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience.
[22:05] B: Yeah.
[22:06] A: It's actually causing the yuckiness, trying to motivate you to get that to stop. Okay, good news. It has.
[22:11] B: It has.
[22:12] A: Right?
[22:13] B: Yeah.
[22:13] A: Right. We never stopped. Right. We never go backwards with a memory.
[22:16] B: Okay.
[22:17] A: But when we do, it unplugs it. It takes away the charge, so we're gonna go backwards.
[22:20] B: Okay.
[22:20] A: So we got, you know. You know, meeting good people.
[22:23] B: Yeah.
[22:24] A: Right. We got. Getting help. We got. Start working out.
[22:26] B: Got out of jail.
[22:26] A: Right, Got out of jail. Right.
[22:28] B: Yeah.
[22:28] A: And then they started the investigation, and then you drove home with your folks, and then they let you drive home with the folks. And then she's like, I don't want to see you get arrested and go to jail. And then you had gotten there. Right. And then you were driving back, and then you dropped the guy off.
[22:42] B: Yeah.
[22:42] A: Right. And then they had called you, and then you had been driving.
[22:46] B: Yeah.
[22:47] A: And then before that, he. You took off, and then he had gone to the bathroom. And then you guys are at the gas station.
[22:53] B: Yeah.
[22:53] A: And then before that, you driven there, and then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing.
[22:56] B: Yeah.
[22:57] A: Right. As I go backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was.
[23:02] B: Was fine.
[23:02] A: Isn't that weird?
[23:03] B: Yeah.
[23:03] A: Right?
[23:04] B: It's like, why was I so upset?
[23:06] A: Isn't that weird? Yeah. Because your brain is beginning to read it as data.
[23:10] B: Yeah.
[23:11] A: About something that happened, not happening. Okay, got it. Third, the emotional part of your brain doesn't get logic, but it does get patterns of association. And the Error is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening have been glued together.
[23:25] B: Yeah.
[23:26] A: So those two things are living as if they're the same thing, whatever the different things. Yeah. Just like today, you can remember putting on your jacket.
[23:33] B: Yeah.
[23:34] A: Where you were when you did it.
[23:35] B: Yeah.
[23:36] A: Right. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your jacket on, then I went, sandra, stop putting on your jacket. You'd say, I'm not putting on my jacket. Because, you know, there's a difference between you remembering it and you doing it.
[23:49] B: Yeah.
[23:49] A: They're not the same thing. Right. You can remember taking off, leaving your son, getting the call, the police, driving back, tcf. You can remember all that happening.
[23:58] B: Yeah.
[23:59] A: Right. You can remember putting on your jacket.
[24:00] B: Yeah.
[24:01] A: Yeah. Sandra, stop putting on your jacket. Say, I'm not putting on my jacket. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. So you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then you stop putting on your sneakers. Say, I'm not putting on my sneakers. Well, then stop driving off. Say, I'm not driving off. Well, stop them from calling you and say, hey, we've got your kid. They're not doing that. Well, stop them from start. Right. Say, that's not happening.
[24:19] B: Yeah.
[24:20] A: So then where is that moment? Say it no longer exists. Right, Right. As you're getting it, what do you notice now?
[24:27] B: I don't feel emotional about it.
[24:29] A: Right. Because we know that thing happening then at everything to do with what you were on.
[24:33] B: Yeah.
[24:34] A: Right, right, right. Which had you go, I'm just driving.
[24:40] B: Yeah.
[24:40] A: Oh, right. Oh, there's a kid.
[24:43] B: Oh, wow. Yeah.
[24:45] A: Right. Not that I don't care about my kid. Not that I was, you know, trying to leave him so that, you know, he could go to foster care.
[24:50] B: Yeah.
[24:51] A: Right. Do you follow me with that? Like, none of it was that.
[24:54] B: Yeah.
[24:54] A: It was because of what you were on.
[24:56] B: Yeah.
[24:57] A: Right.
[24:58] B: Drugs.
[24:58] A: Right. You didn't know that then. Oh, right. And you've been feeling really guilty. Right. Right. That's because you can conceive of having not done it. Yeah. Right. But we can't get you to have not done that. Yeah. Because I'm already.
[25:15] B: It's already done.
[25:16] A: Right. So what we want to get in is, one, that that experience is over and that it no longer exists. Two, that it had nothing to do with your lack of love or concern at everything to do within that moment. You were using.
[25:32] B: Yeah.
[25:33] A: Right. We're gonna let that earlier, you know, that you're clean and sober.
[25:37] B: Yeah.
[25:38] A: Right. That you spend 10 months in jail, that you're out that you went for help.
[25:44] B: Yeah.
[25:44] A: Right. We're gonna let her know about the help that she's getting. Yeah, Right. We're gonna let her know about starting to work out.
[25:50] B: Yeah.
[25:51] A: We're gonna let her know about how she's repairing her life for the better.
[25:54] B: Yeah.
[25:54] A: Got it. So go ahead and close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You let the earlier you know that that moment is over, finished, that it no longer exists and that your son's okay. Right. Let that you know that it had nothing to do with your lack of love and everything to do with. At that time you were using. Right. So that she gets it. Let her know that you're clean and sober. Let her know about having spent the 10 months. Let her know about getting out and choosing to help herself. That's right. Let her know how she's changing her life for the better. How she even started working out. Let her know so that she's getting it. Right. As the earlier you is getting it. What do you notice now?
[26:40] B: I feel like I'm embracing myself.
[26:43] A: Yeah, right. Because you've been really down on yourself about that. We want you to lighten up because based on what had been going on that you got hooked on. Yeah, Right. That's what led to that happening. Right, right. Because you weren't in your right mind state.
[27:03] B: Loving myself, like. Because whenever you put it like that, like going back and like, telling myself, it's like there was that broken person, and now it's like as I continue on and I got out of jail and I'm getting the help, and I'm like, right. You go back and tell yourself, like, it's all gonna be okay.
[27:21] A: That's one thing. But we want that part to know that that moment's over. And he's okay. Yeah, Right.
[27:29] B: It's okay.
[27:30] A: Right. That that moment is on the way to you, helping you.
[27:37] B: Yeah.
[27:39] A: Right. By choosing to get help. Right. You did. And you are.
[27:48] B: I am.
[27:49] A: Right. And that's why we lighten up on that earlier you. Because we know that she was at the effect of using. Right. And that based on what was going on with her back then, she couldn't have not been using then.
[28:09] B: Right?
[28:10] A: Right. Right. As this starts to get inside even more, what's happening in your body? How's your body feeling now?
[28:25] B: More relaxed.
[28:26] A: It is more relaxed, isn't it? Right.
[28:29] B: You don't feel as shaky.
[28:31] A: Right. And you're starting to lighten up on you. That's a good breath. That's right. Notice how it's still not okay that it happened, but you're more okay. Even though what you did then wasn't okay. Right. But we know you're not that you. That you was at the effect of substance abuse. Right, Right. Right.
[29:11] B: Which is no longer who I am.
[29:13] A: That's right. It never was who you are. It was just something you'd been doing.
[29:17] B: Yeah.
[29:18] A: Right. Wasn't a part of you.
[29:20] B: Not at all.
[29:20] A: Right. Yeah. And as it all starts to get in again, checking inside. How's your body feeling?
[29:28] B: Open.
[29:29] A: Yeah. You can open your eyes. Good job. Right. Notice how it's feeling different. Yeah. Right. We want to do another. Because you're here.
[29:39] B: Yeah.
[29:39] A: That your brain is going to travel back down the timeline of other experiences.
[29:44] B: Okay.
[29:44] A: Ones that we try not to think about, because whenever we do, we feel awful.
[29:48] B: Okay.
[29:49] A: Right. And you got another one. Yeah, I know. So good. Right. You're. You're. Your brain is super responsive and wants to work in ways that are best for you. It's an error in the way that your brain's been working. Not you. We're tuning up the glitches. Got it.
[30:06] B: Got it.
[30:06] A: Yeah. So that one happened how long ago? You might have been how old?
[30:10] B: I was 18.
[30:11] A: 18. Right. Good. And you were where?
[30:13] B: At the pool.
[30:14] A: So you're at the pool.
[30:15] B: Good.
[30:15] A: Was it daytime or nighttime?
[30:16] B: Daytime.
[30:17] A: Daytime. And you're like, in the pool or out of the pool? So you're laying out.
[30:21] B: Yeah.
[30:21] A: Like on your stomach or on your back?
[30:23] B: On my back.
[30:24] A: On your back. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[30:26] B: I was with my friend Pete.
[30:27] A: Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[30:30] B: We became really good friends.
[30:31] A: Well, you and Pete were there, Right. Together. Right. And then what happened?
[30:35] B: He was gone.
[30:37] A: What happened?
[30:37] B: He died.
[30:38] A: Oh. How? So you and Pete were there, and then he died while you were laying in the sun. But, oh, what's the moment that happens with Pete? Because Pete is how you met when you're at the pool.
[30:47] B: Yeah.
[30:47] A: And he liked the pool. And you liked the pool. And then you two became good friends.
[30:50] B: Yeah.
[30:51] A: Right. Right. And then how did Pete die? Well, at least how did you find out about it?
[30:59] B: I found out on the phone.
[31:00] A: So you're where?
[31:01] B: At my home.
[31:02] A: So you're at your house.
[31:03] B: Yeah.
[31:04] A: Right. And you got your cell phone. Not like a landline. Yeah. Right. You got your cell phone. And was it a phone call or was it a text?
[31:10] B: I had called his wife.
[31:12] A: So you called his wife. Hey, just checking in on Pete.
[31:15] B: I'm coming over.
[31:16] A: Coming over. Right. And then what happened? Next.
[31:18] B: She told me he died.
[31:19] A: She said he died. Right. Good. Then what happened next? Be here. Hi.
[31:22] B: Hi. Hi.
[31:22] A: Hi.
[31:22] B: It's better here.
[31:23] A: It is better here. Right.
[31:25] B: I tried to start my car to go to his car.
[31:28] A: Right. And then you couldn't start the car?
[31:30] B: No.
[31:30] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[31:31] B: I Be here.
[31:33] A: Hi.
[31:33] B: Hi.
[31:33] A: Hi.
[31:34] B: I kept trying to start the car.
[31:35] A: Right. And then start. Did it finally start?
[31:37] B: Yeah.
[31:38] A: Oh, it finally started.
[31:39] B: It finally started.
[31:39] A: Yeah. And then you drove over to Pete's.
[31:41] B: Yeah.
[31:41] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[31:43] B: I was with his wife.
[31:44] A: Right. And you guys talking about his dad. Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[31:48] B: I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
[31:50] A: Yeah. Here.
[31:52] B: I ended up seeing, like, the.
[31:55] A: You saw the body?
[31:56] B: No, the coroner van.
[31:58] A: You saw the van?
[31:58] B: Yeah.
[31:59] A: After they took the body.
[32:00] B: Yeah.
[32:00] A: Right.
[32:02] B: And I just started drinking.
[32:03] A: Well, and then you started. Well. And then that was over. Well, then you started drinking.
[32:06] B: Yeah.
[32:07] A: Right.
[32:08] B: And that's.
[32:10] A: And then that moment ended.
[32:11] B: Yeah.
[32:12] A: Right. Eventually, you went to bed.
[32:14] B: Yeah.
[32:14] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like get out of jail.
[32:19] B: Yeah.
[32:19] A: Right. Make new friends, start exercising.
[32:21] B: Yeah.
[32:21] A: Right.
[32:22] B: I got a job.
[32:23] A: Choosing out. Oh, got a job. Right. So getting a job, we got. Choosing to help yourself.
[32:27] B: Yeah.
[32:28] A: Right. We got exercising, getting out of jail.
[32:30] B: Yeah.
[32:31] A: Right. And then you'd finally gone to bed, and then you were drinking, and then you'd seen the corners. Right. And then you were over with his wife. And then you had gotten over there. And then it took a long time to get the car to go. And then you're like, I'm coming over. And then she's like, he died. And then you're like, how's Pete? And then you'd called her.
[32:48] B: Yeah.
[32:49] A: And then before that, you guys had met at the pool.
[32:51] B: Yeah. Right, Right.
[32:53] A: So as we go backwards again compared to forward, what are you noticing?
[32:57] B: I feel okay.
[33:00] A: Notice how it's lessening.
[33:02] B: Yeah.
[33:02] A: Right again. Because your brain is reading it as information.
[33:06] B: Yeah.
[33:07] A: Right. We're gonna do two pieces with this, because grief is one of those things that my pain is proof positive of my love.
[33:16] B: Okay.
[33:17] A: Right. Because I wouldn't be hurting if I didn't love him. I didn't care. Right. You've told me that. So it's proof positive that I care about him, that he matters to me. Except my hurting is not serving him.
[33:28] B: No.
[33:28] A: Meaning Pete's not better off knowing that every time you think about him, you're upset and hurting. Right. He's not going. Yeah.
[33:34] B: Yeah. Let her Cry every time.
[33:37] A: Yeah. Right, Right, right. It's not serving him and it's not serving you. You're not better off.
[33:42] B: No.
[33:43] A: Right. But it's become. Because what are all of the other ways that you could be loving?
[33:48] B: I can think of happy memories.
[33:50] A: You could think it bright, but you haven't been able to because the shock of having known, found out about it in the way you did, is blocking access to the rest.
[33:59] B: Yeah.
[33:59] A: So we want to get that moment unplugged.
[34:01] B: Okay.
[34:02] A: Because you can remember her call. Or you can remember calling her, telling you. You going over there, you've seen the. You can remember all that happened. You can also remember putting your jacket on.
[34:11] B: Yeah, right.
[34:13] A: Sandra, stop putting on your jacket. Say, I'm not putting on my jacket. We'll stop me from putting on my shirt. So you're not putting on your shirt. We'll stop her from telling you that. Say she's not telling me. Well, then you stop calling her. Say I'm not calling. Well, stop putting on your leggings. Say, I am not. We'll then stop that from happening to him. See, it's not happening to him. We'll stop it from happening, though. It's not happening. So then where is that moment? Say it doesn't exist.
[34:32] B: It doesn't exist.
[34:33] A: And then you've been thinking that when Pete's body stopped, he stopped and was gone. Because you've been thinking that Pete was his body.
[34:41] B: Yeah.
[34:42] A: That that's all he was, is his body. And when his body stopped, then he stopped and then he was gone because his body stopped. But what if Pete isn't his body, never was. What if he has a body? It's totally. But it's not him. Yeah, Right. If my mom lost the, you know, tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident, and she visits people now, they don't say to her, I'm glad almost all of you could make it. She's all there, even if that part of her body's missing. So he has a body. Was. Totally his body, but it's not actually him. Just like you're not your thoughts. Heck, you're not even the thinker of them. Your brain is.
[35:15] B: Yes.
[35:15] A: And you're not your brain. Your brain is an organ.
[35:17] B: Okay?
[35:18] A: Not an organ, but an org. You know, like your heart, liver, lungs. Yeah, right. It's yours, not you. Okay, Weird. You have thoughts, feelings. There's things you've done, but you're not any of those things, either your thoughts or your feelings, because you feel different ways at different times.
[35:37] B: Yeah.
[35:37] A: So the weird thing goes. If we took a glass of ice and we put it out on the patio, and an hour goes by, and somebody walks over a little kid and says, oh, my goodness, somebody stole the ice and replaced it with water. We would chuckle to ourselves and explain to the child that it simply melted.
[35:50] B: Yeah.
[35:51] A: And he goes, what's that? Well, it went from liquid, the solid to liquid, but the molecule H2O is the same.
[35:58] B: Yeah.
[35:58] A: How we experience it is different because, okay. We leave it out on the patio. Week goes by, now the water's gone. He's like, somebody drank it. It's gone. They stole it. Nobody stole it. Nobody drank it. It evaporated. What the heck is that? It went from liquid to gas, but the molecule of H2O is the same. And he's looking at us really confused, and he goes, but if I don't see it, how can I feel it? We go, right. You're in Florida. It's all around you. And then we put him in the desert of Arizona, and we go, you don't feel any of it here, do you? And we bring him back to Florida and we say, see? Don't you feel it? And we show them the rain cloud, we capture the water we put in the freezer, and we discover it's all the same thing. So what if when people's bodies stop, it's not that they stop, it's that their body stop?
[36:39] B: Yeah.
[36:39] A: Because they're no longer in need of it. They exit it.
[36:42] B: Yeah.
[36:42] A: We don't pick them up in the same way we did, but it doesn't mean that they're not here.
[36:45] B: Yeah.
[36:46] A: You follow me with that?
[36:47] B: I follow you.
[36:47] A: Right, Einstein. Super smart dude.
[36:50] B: Yeah.
[36:50] A: Do you know how I know he was super smart?
[36:52] B: How?
[36:53] A: Everybody after him who's really, really smart is called an Einstein. Dude had to be brilliant, right? Right. He said two things that are real important for us. One, energy plus matter equals this physical, touchable, tangible existence.
[37:07] B: Yeah.
[37:08] A: And then what became the second law of thermodynamics is that energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. Right. It transforms. So what if when the body stops, it's not that he stops. The love hasn't stopped your love for him hasn't stopped his for you. He feels yours, you haven't been feeling his. Not because it's not here, but the shock of knowing him the way you did.
[37:30] B: Yeah.
[37:31] A: Has been blocking it.
[37:32] B: Yeah.
[37:34] A: Got it. Got it. And that's why we want to just think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something beautiful. Like the moment you see it, it might capture your attention and you're like in the. Wow.
[37:46] B: Yeah.
[37:46] A: What is it that you see?
[37:48] B: Sunset.
[37:48] A: Right. And isn't there a moment that as you're experiencing the sun setting, you're feeling that sense of all wonder, peace, excitement? And some people would tell you, of course, it's seeing the sunset that's giving you the feelings.
[38:00] B: Yeah.
[38:00] A: But if we looked at it from another way, we could say that seeing it and being there drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what if at your center, you're always peaceful and excited in the same way? We're outside at a bonfire, I'm freezing, and so I move my hands towards the flames. And now I say to you, holy shit, the fire's getting hotter, hot. And you go, it's not getting any hotter at all. You're just becoming more aware of the heat. Yeah, Right. You're just becoming more aware of the heat. So when the body stop, what if who you are, that light at the center, the awareness, what you become aware of when you see the sunset, that that light is you. And that light doesn't go anywhere. Right. There are things that we can't pick up only because our senses are limited in scope. We both know that the dog can sniff out the drugs, but you and I can't. Yeah, we know that we could turn the radio on in the van and all of a sudden music will be playing. Yeah, but the radio waves are here. I don't feel them. Tune in to 933. Right. Do you follow me? Yeah. So there are things that are outside of what our head says enables us to see or experience or feel or hear because our senses are limited. Got it. So the love hasn't gone anywhere. It's about the moment.
[39:24] B: Yeah.
[39:24] A: Right. You can remember getting that call.
[39:27] B: Yeah.
[39:27] A: You can remember going over there, seeing the corners. You can remember putting your leggings on. Yeah, well, stop putting on your leggings. Well, then stop that from happening if that's not happening. So then where does it say no longer exists?
[39:38] B: No longer exist.
[39:39] A: Right. That earlier you thought that when his body stopped, he stopped.
[39:45] B: Yeah.
[39:45] A: But he was never his body in the first place. No, that's right. And your pain has been coming because of your care, but not helping him or you. So what are all of the other ways that you can be carrying?
[39:59] B: I can.
[40:00] A: What are all of the other things? If you think about, like, I wonder what it would be like the next time you're out in the sun?
[40:05] B: Yeah.
[40:05] A: You know, like laying out, maybe to feel him with you. Right. Because it's something you both love to do.
[40:11] B: Exactly.
[40:12] A: That's right.
[40:12] B: Sitting at the pool.
[40:14] A: Sitting at the pool. It's something you both like to do. Right? Right? Yeah.
[40:21] B: Yeah.
[40:21] A: So again, go ahead and close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You. And let her know that that moment is over. Finished. That it no longer exists.
[40:29] B: Moment is over. It no longer exists.
[40:31] A: That's right. That he was never his body and the love hasn't gone anywhere.
[40:35] B: He was never his body and the love hasn't gone anywhere.
[40:37] A: That's right. Let her know that your love hasn't stopped. And neither is his.
[40:41] B: My love hasn't stopped, neither has his.
[40:43] A: Right. So that she's starting to get it. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about positively changing your life. Let her know about going for help. Let her know about getting out of jail.
[40:52] B: Let her know I'm okay.
[40:53] A: I went people.
[40:55] B: I got out of jail. I got a job.
[40:57] A: Right as that you is getting all of this. What are you noticing now?
[41:01] B: I feel good.
[41:02] A: Yeah. Right.
[41:08] B: I love me.
[41:09] A: Yeah. And you can open your eyes. Right. That's emotional, right? It is.
[41:14] B: It is.
[41:15] A: Yeah. So think about Pete.
[41:17] B: Yeah.
[41:17] A: Right. Because you can't lose all the experiences you've acquired.
[41:23] B: Yeah.
[41:24] A: But you also can't lose experiences that you never acquired in the future are experiences that you've never acquired. So. That's a weird thought. If I can't lose what I've acquired and I can't lose what I don't yet have, then where's the loss? What if when people's bodies stop, it's not that they stop, it's their bodies. They're no longer in need of it. They exit it?
[41:48] B: Yeah.
[41:48] A: We don't pick them up the same way we did. But it doesn't mean that they're not right here.
[41:52] B: Yeah, they're still here.
[41:53] A: That's right. And I'll show you one other thing that's cool because everybody I know has played ping pong before. Yeah, but this one doesn't work like that. This one's weird because if you put your fingers on the metal pieces, it makes a noise.
[42:03] B: Okay.
[42:04] A: Right.
[42:05] B: Yeah.
[42:05] A: But if you take that index finger and touch the ball. Nope, the other one. Notice how it doesn't do it? Keep your index finger there. Take your other index finger. Touch my hand over here.
[42:16] B: Oh, that's cool.
[42:17] A: It is cool.
[42:18] B: That is really cool.
[42:19] A: It's spooky.
[42:20] B: It is spooky. How does that Work.
[42:22] A: Right. So notice. How does it work?
[42:25] B: Yeah.
[42:25] A: What did Einstein say? Who we are is energy.
[42:30] B: Yeah.
[42:30] A: Plus matter.
[42:32] B: Okay.
[42:32] A: Equals this physical existence.
[42:34] B: Okay.
[42:35] A: So why is the ball making noise? It makes noise when I connect the circuit. Cuz I am energy. Like a light switch when it's off, isn't open. When it's on, it connects the circuit, the energy flows. So as I connect the circuit, the energy flows. As we touch, but it's open, the energy doesn't flow. When we touch again, the energy flows.
[43:00] B: Yeah.
[43:02] A: Isn't that interesting?
[43:03] B: That is interesting.
[43:04] A: Yeah. Right, Right, Right. So who we are is energy.
[43:11] B: Yeah.
[43:11] A: Plus matter.
[43:13] B: Plus matter.
[43:14] A: Right. Equals this existence.
[43:16] B: Equals this existence.
[43:17] A: And that's what you have. But he wasn't his body.
[43:21] B: He wasn't his body. No, no.
[43:23] A: And as you're getting it now, what are you noticing?
[43:26] B: I feel happy about the thought.
[43:28] A: Right. And more connected to him. Because you can think about experiences. Right? Ones that you've had and ones that you'll do where you can feel him with you.
[43:39] B: Yeah.
[43:40] A: Right. Because you know he'll like it too.
[43:42] B: Exactly.
[43:43] A: Right, Right.
[43:46] B: I love that I got sober.
[43:48] A: That's right. He does love.
[43:49] B: He does love that I got sober.
[43:51] A: It's not that he will. He knows.
[43:52] B: He knows.
[43:53] A: He's excited for you. He's really glad that you're here.
[43:56] B: Yeah.
[43:56] A: He's been doing better with what happened to him than you have for a while.
[44:00] B: A long time.
[44:01] A: He's crystal clear that it couldn't have not happened. Even though none of us like it, that it did.
[44:06] B: Yeah.
[44:06] A: You follow me with that?
[44:07] B: I follow you.
[44:09] A: He's been at peace with it for a lot longer.
[44:11] B: Yeah.
[44:12] A: And he's excited about you becoming more at peace with it.
[44:15] B: Yeah.
[44:16] A: Yeah. Right, Right. And as you're getting this, what do you notice?
[44:24] B: Feeling.
[44:24] A: Letting go of the pain. That's right. One more time. Close your eyes and think of the earlier years. You. And as you think of the earlier, you let her know this last part that you just got right. That he was never his body in the first place.
[44:39] B: He was never his body in the first place.
[44:41] A: That's right. That the love hasn't gone anywhere. And he loves you better than you have. He's not hurting.
[44:48] B: He's not hurting.
[44:49] A: Right. He's really excited about you getting clean.
[44:52] B: He's excited about me getting clean.
[44:54] A: He is, isn't he?
[44:55] B: Yeah.
[44:56] A: That's right. Yeah. And again, as all of this gets in, what do you notice now?
[45:05] B: I can breathe.
[45:06] A: You can, can't you?
[45:07] B: Yeah.
[45:08] A: Yeah. Isn't that A good news thing.
[45:12] B: It is.
[45:13] A: It's great. Yeah. Right?
[45:14] B: It feels good to breathe, right? It doesn't feel tight.
[45:17] A: It doesn't, does it? No, no. Isn't that cool?
[45:20] B: It is cool.
[45:21] A: Yeah. Yeah. So we're on our way and this is our first meeting.
[45:25] B: Exactly.
[45:26] A: Isn't that crazy?
[45:27] B: Yeah.
[45:28] A: Right. We just met. We're already on our way. Right. Isn't that cool?
[45:33] B: Yes.
[45:34] A: Yeah. Yeah. So I'll show you something because we want your brain to integrate what it's just gotten and begin to spread the good news.
[45:43] B: Okay?
[45:45] A: Right. Good news is that the war ended and we won.
[45:47] B: Yeah.
[45:48] A: We won because we survived.
[45:49] B: Yeah.
[45:50] A: And we're here. That's right.
[45:52] B: Yeah.
[45:52] A: Right. And you're positively changing your life.
[45:55] B: Yeah.
[45:56] A: Right. So take this in like this. Just like this. Turn it up like this. Turn it down like that. Look at that spot right there.
[46:03] B: Okay.
[46:04] A: Okay. Don't do anything at all on purpose to move that hand or those fingers. Just focus on that spot. As you focus on that spot with the sides of your eyes, you'll pick up the fingers and then get a little bit curious about when you're going to notice spot small vibratory or twitches happening within the fingers of those hands.
[46:24] B: Yeah.
[46:24] A: Get really curious when you'll notice unconscious movement, involuntary movement happening within. That's right. The fingers of the hand. That's right. And each time you. That's right. Notice it and think. Yes. Your unconscious responds to you responding to unconscious twitches. That's right. That's right. So that the next time you notice. That's right. You can close your eyes because you won't need to see that hand or fingers to notice. That's right. What you're noticing within that hand and fingers while at the same time beginning to realize that your unconscious is doing more in the background, always doing more underneath the. The surface and healing is happening so that as your brain truly integrates what it's gotten and learned, that hand can begin to drop down. But only at the same rate and speed at which you drop down and fully integrate the learning at the deepest. That's right. Unconscious level. All the way down. That's right. Down and inside. That's right. Towards the light at your center. All the way in more clear, calm, peaceful and easy flowing energy. Delight is you at your center, integrating what you've gotten and learned so that things lighten up even more free on the way to feeling better and better and better. So you can take your time finding your way back up and up and up, getting ready to notice that it'll be at first to where your eyes can almost, but not quite open. Right. And then you'll take a nice deep breath in, and then exhale and open your eyes. There you go.
[49:21] B: That was very relaxing.
[49:22] A: I bet it was.
[49:23] B: That was so relaxing.
[49:24] A: You did great.
[49:25] B: Thank you.
[49:25] A: Because think about that stuff now, those two moments.
[49:29] B: Yeah.
[49:29] A: What do you notice? Just a moment. It's just a moment, Right? That's right. We still don't like that. They happen.
[49:37] B: No.
[49:38] A: But you're okay?
[49:39] B: I'm okay.
[49:40] A: Mm.
[49:41] B: And I'm here.
[49:41] A: That's right. So we're on our way. You did great today. Thank you. You're welcome.
[49:47] B: I love this. Yay.
