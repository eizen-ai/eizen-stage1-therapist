[00:01] A: So it is March 3rd, Sandra. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:16] B: That's fine.
[00:17] A: Cool. So first, how did our last session leave you? When you think about those two moments that we talked about, both with the gas station kid and Pete, when you think about those things now, what do you notice?
[00:31] B: I don't get emotional. I don't tear up and cry.
[00:35] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool? Okay.
[00:38] B: It's nice.
[00:38] A: Well, that's a good news thing.
[00:39] B: It is a good news thing.
[00:40] A: Yeah.
[00:41] B: Great news thing.
[00:42] A: Yeah.
[00:42] B: Cuz those two things had held me back for so long.
[00:45] A: Yeah, they. They were. Yeah, for sure. They were weighing. Weighing on you, right?
[00:49] B: They were definitely weighing down on me.
[00:51] A: Yeah.
[00:51] B: So now it's like, I look back at those moments and I'm like, all right, it's just a memory. Like, my brain was able to, like what you said, it was able to let go of that moment, wasn't stuck in that moment anymore.
[00:59] A: It wasn't stuck in the moment anymore. Right. The. It stopped the feelings. Because that's the weird part. We only feel bad about things that are over if our brain doesn't know they're over. And whether the bad feelings be anger, resentment, whether it be grief or guilt or shame or sadness or hurt or pain.
[01:26] B: Yeah.
[01:26] A: It's because part of the brain doesn't know it ended.
[01:29] B: Yeah.
[01:30] A: Not because I didn't process it enough. Not because I didn't release it or let it go or, or. Or. So it's a different thing.
[01:39] B: It is.
[01:39] A: Yeah.
[01:40] B: It is. Way different.
[01:42] A: So what kind of. So that's been between then and now? When we've had a period of time, what kind of comes to the surface? What do we want today to do for you?
[01:51] B: Okay, so honestly, what I noticed is I have a lot of trauma with the father and my children. I can't really.
[02:00] A: What does that mean?
[02:01] B: He was very abusive. Very abusive.
[02:04] A: So how do you have a lot of trauma?
[02:07] B: Well, I didn't notice that anything triggered me until like, as I just kind of like, dealt with it. I didn't know that there was things that would bring back emotions from it until one of the residents was. She was upset and she would slam things into the trash can, emptying the fridge and then throwing it onto the table or like the counter. And I was like, man, like, all of a sudden I got this panic feeling.
[02:32] A: Ah, reminder.
[02:33] B: Yeah. I was like, oh my gosh. I was like, I'm in trouble. And I'm like, well, why am I in trouble? And she's having these emotions and I'm able to bring myself back to the moment. But it's like whenever it was happening, it got very emotional for me.
[02:46] A: For you?
[02:47] B: Yes. Like, like I started crying.
[02:49] A: Yeah.
[02:49] B: And I wasn't expecting it at all.
[02:51] A: Cause I'm like, she's.
[02:52] B: She's having her moment. Why is this affecting me so.
[02:55] A: Yeah. Because her moment was structurally similar to moments.
[02:59] B: Yeah. So I was just like, what in the world is happening?
[03:01] A: So then we want the effect that those experiences have had cleared and gone so they're no longer doing that.
[03:08] B: So whenever people are in their own emotions and just having their moments, it's not affecting me so negatively. Because just because somebody's angry, it doesn't mean they're angry with me. It doesn't mean that they're here to beat me up.
[03:20] A: Right.
[03:21] B: Like they're just having a moment. And it's a non violent place that we stay at, as you know. So it's like, for me to like, I literally had to get up and go outside and sit because.
[03:31] A: Good job.
[03:32] B: Thank you. Because I was just so overwhelmed in that moment. Like I put, like I had to really ground myself again because I was really going through it.
[03:41] A: Even right now, as you're thinking about it. Yeah. So we want that to all go away.
[03:44] B: Yeah.
[03:44] A: So that you're at peace.
[03:46] B: Yeah.
[03:46] A: And free from the effect that. That's.
[03:48] B: Yes. Because I'm tired of dealing with. I'm tired of constantly living in the past. Like you said, like, you know, be awful. There's so many good times in the past too.
[03:57] A: Right. We just want the ones that continue to run programming in you that sucks.
[04:02] B: Yeah.
[04:02] A: We want those adjusted so it stops. We want you to be free from the effect that.
[04:07] B: That stuff. So I'm not so upset when like talk about it. Like I can talk about Pete. I can talk about my instance with my son and you know, stuff like that. Like, I can talk about those things without getting super emotional now. But I can't talk about the father of my children.
[04:23] A: We haven't done that yet.
[04:24] B: Yeah.
[04:24] A: And whatever it was that happened with him.
[04:26] B: Yeah.
[04:27] A: Okay. And was he also somebody that had you go out and do other things with other people?
[04:31] B: Yeah.
[04:32] A: Oh, okay, cool. So not only does he get to be the father of your kids, he's also the guy that does that.
[04:37] B: Yeah.
[04:37] A: The traffic. Okay, awesome. Fine.
[04:40] B: For my children.
[04:41] A: Well, only four.
[04:42] B: Only four. Thankfully, I only had four. Great. Only four.
[04:49] A: Okay. So there's that.
[04:50] B: Three boys and a daughter.
[04:51] A: Yeah. And we want the impact that that's had lifted so that you're more free.
[04:56] B: Yeah.
[04:56] A: And whatever's tied there, we want those things free. Yeah. Okay, cool. What else?
[05:04] B: That's really. All that's really been surfacing is with him. Because that's where a lot of like. Or just the abuse that I gave to myself, like. Because after I left him, I still lived in that lifestyle where I was selling myself and I didn't have, like, a pimp at that time anymore. I was doing it to support my own habits.
[05:23] A: Habits like going to the gym and. Oh, no, no, no. Not those kind of habits. Oh, you mean like using.
[05:29] B: Yeah, like using Horrible habits. Not good habits. Not going to the gym.
[05:34] A: No, no, no, no. Going to the gym. In my, you know, love for Chipotle.
[05:38] B: Yeah.
[05:38] A: I was doing those things for.
[05:40] B: Yeah, totally. You got to keep it a half medium.
[05:47] A: Okay. So. So then for you, there's also bad feelings over what you did after.
[05:53] B: Yeah.
[05:54] A: Like some anger or disdain or resentment toward myself. Oh, okay. So we'd like that to go away.
[06:01] B: Yeah.
[06:01] A: So that you can be more at peace in you.
[06:03] B: Yeah.
[06:04] A: And more comfortable in your own skin.
[06:06] B: Better.
[06:07] A: Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
[06:09] B: I'm mad at myself.
[06:10] A: You are? Okay.
[06:12] B: Yeah. A lot.
[06:12] A: How well does that work?
[06:14] B: Not well at all. Because I want to love myself.
[06:16] A: Does it motivate you to do better when you're really mad at you?
[06:19] B: No.
[06:19] A: No, it doesn't. That weird.
[06:21] B: Yeah. That it holds me back.
[06:22] A: Huh. Okay.
[06:24] B: Right.
[06:24] A: So we'd like you to lighten up on you.
[06:26] B: Yeah.
[06:27] A: So that you're easier on you and free from the past. And also clear that although we don't like that it did. Whether it be the stuff that happened to me or held the stuff I did.
[06:39] B: Yeah.
[06:39] A: That. That stuff couldn't have not happened.
[06:42] B: Yeah.
[06:43] A: So that I'm, you know, it's done, it's over. Yeah. And get that fully all the way through.
[06:49] B: Yeah.
[06:50] A: So then I'm free from that.
[06:51] B: Exactly.
[06:52] A: And now I get to direct my.
[06:53] B: Life wherever I want it to go.
[06:55] A: Yeah.
[06:56] B: In a healthy way.
[06:57] A: Yeah. You get to direct legally. Well, yeah.
[07:01] B: That's gonna be great.
[07:03] A: Yeah. Okay. So there's that.
[07:05] B: Yeah.
[07:05] A: And the bed. Yeah. And then those are the things that you said have surfaced. What about any of the things that haven't?
[07:13] B: I don't know.
[07:14] A: You don't know, do you? But I bet your unconscious does.
[07:17] B: Yeah.
[07:18] A: Know the things that haven't surfaced that might still be having an effect on you?
[07:22] B: Yes.
[07:22] A: So we'd want those things gone too. Whether you are. Whether. Whether they've come to the surface yet or not.
[07:27] B: I want it all gone.
[07:28] A: Yeah. Right. So that you're much more. Okay.
[07:31] B: I don't have such bad anxiety all the time. Yeah. Because that's a big thing.
[07:36] A: How do you know when to have, you know, the anxiety? The bad kind that is. I don't know.
[07:41] B: I gotta get anxiety.
[07:43] A: Some kind's a good kind. Yeah. But I don't. Like when my mom's like, I'm really anxious to see your girls.
[07:47] B: And I'm like, that's the good kind.
[07:49] A: Yeah.
[07:49] B: Or my mom's, like, coming, but it's like, even then, like, the anxiety is so bad that it's almost bad.
[07:54] A: Like how. What do you mean by bad? How so?
[07:57] B: Like, I can. It just gets to the point where I almost want to throw up.
[08:00] A: Oh. Where are you feeling it?
[08:01] B: In my stomach.
[08:02] A: Oh, right there.
[08:03] B: Yeah.
[08:03] A: Okay.
[08:04] B: And I don't.
[08:04] A: How do you know when to do it?
[08:06] B: When do I.
[08:07] A: When do I. Weird question. I know.
[08:09] B: I'm gonna ask it again.
[08:10] A: How do you know when to feel anxious? Feel that stuff in your stomach.
[08:14] B: Oh. Whenever I think about it.
[08:16] A: Think about what?
[08:17] B: Anything.
[08:18] A: Like what might be a thing that you think about and you can make that happen.
[08:21] B: Like today I'm already anxious because I'm like, I didn't do my chore before I left.
[08:25] A: Okay. Right.
[08:28] B: But it was. It's okay because I still have the rest of the day, but now my body is just like, no, it's not okay. Or like, I've had a cut back on coffee because I noticed, like, coffee was giving me anxiety.
[08:41] A: Oh, coffee is making you jitter.
[08:43] B: Yeah. I was like, ah.
[08:46] A: Is it buzzy? Wired. Yeah, wired.
[08:50] B: Everything is awesome. And my body's like, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, it's not okay.
[08:55] A: So if it gets a little too. This is all uncomfortable.
[08:58] B: Yeah.
[08:59] A: Okay.
[09:00] B: Or if I get too excited.
[09:02] A: What does that mean?
[09:03] B: Like, if I get too happy, my body gets anxious.
[09:07] A: If you get too happy?
[09:08] B: Yeah, like if I'm really happy, then my body's like, are you sure? Yeah.
[09:14] A: How so? How's your body?
[09:15] B: Because it doesn't. It's expecting the bad.
[09:18] A: Oh, because you're feeling the same kind of feelings. Yeah, it's just reading it all as bad. Oh, Isn't that weird?
[09:24] B: It is weird.
[09:25] A: Right? That's why we say some anxious is good.
[09:27] B: Yeah.
[09:27] A: I should Be feeling some of it before I'm about to perform. Because that means my body's getting me primed to perform.
[09:36] B: Yeah. And my body just doesn't know how to differentiate.
[09:39] A: You haven't known how to differentiate.
[09:41] B: Yeah, I don't. Mentally. I don't know how to.
[09:43] A: Yeah. So when it starts happening and you start feeling it, it's all that same thing.
[09:47] B: Yeah.
[09:48] A: Got it.
[09:49] B: I go if I'm nervous.
[09:50] A: Yeah.
[09:51] B: I guess that's a good anxiety. But it's like cuz it's nervous.
[09:53] A: It all reads the same thing. Yeah.
[09:55] B: It all reads, this is going to end badly.
[09:58] A: Okay.
[09:59] B: I don't know why that happens.
[10:01] A: Well, I'm not sure you need to know why.
[10:03] B: Okay.
[10:04] A: In order to get it better.
[10:05] B: Yeah.
[10:06] A: You know, because the why is a simple answer. Glitches and errors in your brain causes that to happen in you.
[10:12] B: Yeah.
[10:13] A: Not because your brain wants you to have that, but because it's a complicated machine that doesn't work all the time.
[10:19] B: Yeah.
[10:20] A: Because it got dinged and kicked and pushed and shoved and banged and yelled at and.
[10:25] B: Yeah.
[10:25] A: Like it's got errors.
[10:26] B: Yeah.
[10:27] A: That's all.
[10:28] B: It's like an old computer.
[10:29] A: So we like some distinctions.
[10:31] B: Yeah.
[10:32] A: So that we can begin to change the relationship to the sensations.
[10:36] B: Yeah.
[10:36] A: So it doesn't keep sending you down memory lane. Yeah. The track.
[10:41] B: Yeah.
[10:41] A: Yeah. And freaking out.
[10:42] B: Yeah.
[10:43] A: Right. Because we want you to actually feel the good feelings as you're like experiencing something, you know, fun.
[10:48] B: Yeah. And that's why I. Whenever I was in jail, I over medicated.
[10:52] A: Oh, what does that mean?
[10:53] B: Like I was taking way too high of medications to make sure that I wasn't feeling what was going on. So after I got out, I lowered all my meds.
[11:02] A: Okay. So you could feel more.
[11:03] B: Yeah. Because I wanted to feel.
[11:05] A: How's it been feeling?
[11:07] B: Feels good. But a lot.
[11:09] A: Oh.
[11:10] B: Like I get overwhelmed so easily. I'm like, what is going on?
[11:13] A: What?
[11:13] B: I also have to. And I also remind myself I haven't been sober in 20 years. You know, I started using drugs and alcohol whenever I was like 12 to 13.
[11:23] A: Yeah.
[11:23] B: And I'm good.
[11:24] A: Time to start.
[11:25] B: Yeah. It's great. Right. Whenever your brain's developing, your body's developing, you're going through puberty. Great time to start. Terrible time. But now it's just like I am 32 and I'm just like, wow. Like I literally am just now feeling emotions head on. Whether it be excitement, whether it be anger, whether it be joy, whether it be frustration, happiness, love.
[11:48] A: Yeah.
[11:49] B: All of that I'm actually feeling for the first time. Like, even with being a mother, like, I'm feeling it for the first time. Like the true love that I have for my kids, the longing that I have for my kids. It's overwhelming at points. Like, it's a good overwhelming, but it's overwhelming.
[12:07] A: So. So then maybe what we want, Sandra, is for you to have more fluidity.
[12:14] B: Yeah.
[12:15] A: With the ways you feel when you're feeling it. Because what I'm understanding is when it gets too much, it's all similar to bad.
[12:26] B: Yeah.
[12:26] A: And gets experienced and read as bad.
[12:29] B: Yeah.
[12:29] A: So even if I get. And I'm like, too happy, then it's like, oh, no.
[12:33] B: Yeah.
[12:34] A: I've gotten the things out and it's all being experienced as that same bad loop. Yeah.
[12:40] B: Like, I cry over everything.
[12:43] A: Yeah.
[12:43] B: Like now. And it's like nothing's. Like nothing hurts, nothing's bad. But I cry. No matter what emotion I feel, I cry.
[12:54] A: So we would be wanting you to, you know, be crying in with tears of relief.
[12:59] B: Yeah.
[12:59] A: And sometimes tears of happiness.
[13:01] B: Yeah.
[13:02] A: And even. Sometimes tears of sadness.
[13:04] B: Yeah.
[13:05] A: But that you're able to have a fluctuation with the range and even no matter which one you're in, you're okay.
[13:11] B: Exactly.
[13:13] A: Right. Because that's where it's been off, is that you haven't been feeling when you're in it, that you're okay.
[13:20] B: Yeah.
[13:21] A: Or it's going to be okay.
[13:22] B: Yeah.
[13:22] A: Right. Notice what you said, it kind of goes. And it's going to end badly. Right. Isn't that the feeling tone? Right. And when you're in that feeling, it doesn't feel like that feeling is ever going to go away.
[13:35] B: Yeah.
[13:36] A: Right. When you're in it, we know that you're not. We know that it does go away, but you're not aware of it when it does.
[13:46] B: Yeah.
[13:46] A: Right. Because when you're in it, it feels like it's ongoing forever.
[13:51] B: Yeah.
[13:51] A: Does that make sense?
[13:52] B: It does.
[13:53] A: And that's the thing that happens when you get triggered, internal or external, that sends you down memory lane. Yeah.
[14:04] B: Yeah.
[14:05] A: We want to get that to stop. We want to change the relationship to the sensations.
[14:12] B: Okay.
[14:14] A: So that they're not sending you down that track.
[14:17] B: Okay.
[14:17] A: And that you're able to be more in a resourceful state.
[14:20] B: Okay.
[14:21] A: Right. We want you to be free from the effect that the past stuff has had, whether it be the stuff that you remember that's been, you know, coming up or not. We want the effect that that stuff has had gone so that you're much more emotionally present and much more at peace and comfortable and settled in you. Okay. So that you experience other people's stuff with distance and with the internal emotional feeling as it's info about them.
[14:57] B: Yeah.
[14:57] A: Even if they're saying something to me, it's still info about them.
[15:01] B: Okay.
[15:02] A: Maybe what they're thinking or feeling about what I did or said, but it's still info about them.
[15:07] B: Yeah. It's not about me.
[15:09] A: Got. Right. It's not about me. That's how that's inside. Got it. So that you're much more settled and grounded. And as you are, you've got more traction for movability.
[15:23] B: Okay.
[15:23] A: And with the emotions and the feelings, there's a fluidity with it in terms of how you are. Okay. No matter what you're feeling.
[15:34] B: Okay.
[15:35] A: And that not everyone. That instead we stay more here.
[15:40] B: Yeah. Instead of elsewhere.
[15:42] A: Right.
[15:43] B: Yeah. So I tend to travel all the time.
[15:46] A: Well, that's what happens.
[15:48] B: Yeah.
[15:48] A: Right. That's part of our superpower. But we, even when we travel, want to harness it so that it's more on purpose.
[15:55] B: Okay.
[15:55] A: Because some of yours just goes without you deciding.
[15:58] B: Yeah. And I'm like, wait, come back, come back.
[16:01] A: Right. So we want it to be on purpose, and that's okay. To have it happen.
[16:05] B: Okay.
[16:06] A: When it's on purpose.
[16:07] B: Yeah.
[16:08] A: But other times it's easier for you to be present.
[16:11] B: Yeah.
[16:12] A: And clear and happy. Right. And peaceful and measured.
[16:18] B: Yes.
[16:19] A: Right.
[16:20] B: Right.
[16:20] A: So that my brain stops confusing similar as identical.
[16:27] B: Okay.
[16:28] A: Because that's part of where this has been off. Right. Ones I'm aware of, ones that come up or ones that I'm not aware of. If I encounter anything in my life circumstance that has even the smallest amount of similarity to any of those painful experiences, similar gets mistaken as same.
[16:55] B: Definitely.
[16:56] A: So what, you found your logical brain going, well, that's her. That's clearly her stuff. That has nothing to do with me.
[17:06] B: Yeah.
[17:06] A: It's not my thing. I'm not even in that. She's not him. Like, my logical brain is trying to go, no, no, no, no, no. And my emotional brain is going, there's loud noise.
[17:17] B: Right.
[17:18] A: Right. They seem to be angry, which means I. I'm gonna get hurt. Got was confusing similar as same.
[17:32] B: Yeah.
[17:33] A: Right. We want similar. To be experienced is different.
[17:37] B: Yeah. For sure.
[17:38] A: Yeah. So that you're present and clear and stay present. Right.
[17:43] B: And if I choose to go somewhere else, I can choose that.
[17:46] A: Right. When it's intentional on purpose.
[17:49] B: Yeah. Because right now my body just goes same. Like how you said, like, it doesn't know how to differentiate it.
[17:57] A: Right. And the reason it doesn't know is that there are moments that you've gone through where those experiences, I call it, are still active. Meaning aspect of your brain doesn't know. Negative moment ended. You made it through it. You're okay. There were lots of times when bad things were going on that you weren't sure you were going to be okay. Got it.
[18:27] B: Yeah.
[18:27] A: There's lots of times where that you back then had no idea how you're going to be a year clean now.
[18:34] B: Yeah.
[18:35] A: Do you follow me with that? So the problem with most problems that we go through where it gets stuck.
[18:41] B: Yeah.
[18:42] A: Is that it ends at the worst spot.
[18:46] B: Okay.
[18:46] A: So typically with the moments kind of like what happened in seeing the ambulance or in getting right there are the moment that kind of loops as an ongoing. So that anytime I think about it, that's the one that I. Yeah. But it froze it at the worst time.
[19:06] B: Yeah.
[19:08] A: Does that make sense?
[19:09] B: It does.
[19:09] A: So it didn't move it forward.
[19:11] B: Yeah.
[19:12] A: It froze it at the worst spot.
[19:13] B: And it just stayed stuck.
[19:15] A: And it just stayed stuck. Make sense?
[19:18] B: Yes.
[19:19] A: So that ending, though, was arbitrary. It was just decided. There's no, like, real ending. It just decided it. And what we do know is that that isn't the ending. Because life went on.
[19:34] B: Mm.
[19:36] A: Got it.
[19:37] B: Yeah.
[19:38] A: So where this gets stuck, we want that part of the brain to know about later.
[19:46] B: Okay.
[19:47] A: So that that part of the brain can understand that that was a moment and that moment ended.
[19:54] B: Now we can move forward.
[19:56] A: And when that part of the brain realizes that that moment ended as you experienced it is as immediate as a light switch turning off. Pain goes away. Because the pain isn't there. Because my brain and body want me to feel bad about it.
[20:18] B: Yeah.
[20:18] A: It's there to motivate me to get it to stop. It doesn't know it stopped.
[20:27] B: Yeah.
[20:28] A: That's the error.
[20:29] B: Yeah. And it needs to compute.
[20:32] A: Right. And we're gonna update that part of the brain.
[20:35] B: Okay.
[20:36] A: So that it gets that it's done.
[20:37] B: Okay.
[20:38] A: That it's data about stuff that happened and that you made it through it and that you're okay.
[20:44] B: I'm still laughing.
[20:46] A: Yes. Whether that be recent stuff or long time ago stuff, whether that be stuff that happened to you or stuff that you did that you felt bad that you did. We want all of that cleared and gone so that you're present and peaceful and okay.
[21:04] B: Yeah.
[21:05] A: And connecting to more of who you really are, which was never any of that. Stuff that was, stuff that happened and maybe stuff you did, but it was never who you are.
[21:18] B: Yeah.
[21:20] A: Right. Because you're not what you do.
[21:22] B: No, no.
[21:24] A: Even though we introduce ourselves that way all the time.
[21:26] B: Yeah, that's true.
[21:30] A: Right. But you're not actually what you do. There's much more to you than that. Right, Right. Cool. So this is where we're headed.
[21:37] B: Okay.
[21:38] A: Right. And the question again isn't how it's going to happen. It. Would it be okay?
[21:42] B: Yes.
[21:43] A: Yeah. And we've got a green light. So your brain is organizing.
[21:46] B: Okay.
[21:47] A: Then what we do is we get your body into the right states.
[21:49] B: Okay.
[21:50] A: And we did that before. We're going to use a thing called the alpha sequence.
[21:53] B: Okay.
[21:54] A: So you slightly lower your jaw. Okay. Right. You relax the back of your tongue so it rests at the bottom of your mouth.
[22:01] B: Okay.
[22:02] A: And then you breathe intentionally. Right. A little slower and deeper in. And then a little bit longer on the way out. And just notice what starts to happen, Sandra, as you're aware of your breathing and you're causing it to happen. And it's happening now because you are doing it slower and deeper than what it was doing just before.
[22:23] B: Yeah.
[22:24] A: What starts to happen in your body?
[22:26] B: It relaxes.
[22:27] A: It does relax. Isn't that cool? And as your body's relaxing, you know that you can see me and you can see my fingers. You're going to stay looking at my nose when my fingers move out, as they move out with the sides of your eyes, way out here, pick up my fingers wiggling. And notice what that does to your body as you're becoming more aware of the space. Right. That's in between you and me and the space towards the side windows and doors, the space that's beyond me, underneath you, behind you, right above you, there's space. And just notice the space right in between you and the objects. And as you are again, just notice. How's your body feeling now?
[23:19] B: Relaxed.
[23:20] A: It is relaxed. As your body relaxed, think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something that's just beautiful. Right. What is it that you see?
[23:35] B: The sun. Butterflies.
[23:37] A: Yeah. And isn't there a moment that as you're seeing the sun and the butterflies, you're feeling that sense of, like, awe and wonder and peace. And people would tell you, of course, it's the sun and the butterflies that are giving you those feelings. But the other lens says, no, wait, what if it's not the sun and the butterflies? But instead, in the experience of seeing draws your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what is at your center, you always are peaceful and excited, right? Kind of like if I'm cold and we're out at the bonfire, and so I take my hands and I move it towards the flames, and I say, holy cow, this. This fire is getting hotter. And you look at me and you go, it's not getting hotter at all. You are becoming more aware of the heat because your hands have gotten closer to the flames. And see, that's the weird thing, is that we all look at it, that it's out there and over there. But what if in seeing, it drew awareness down and in toward your center? And what if at your center, it's a light? Right? You know, two of us are here. We look around, there's two of us in the room. You know that your senses bring in that data. That's an intellectual knowledge or light of knowledge. At your center, it's a brighter light of wisdom. And we've got knowledge, and we've got wisdom. And, you know, I work with all sorts of people about awful stuff happen. And I remember working with this one girl whose older brother's best friend was over, and he decided to take, like, a GI Joe figure and march it up her leg and park it in her. So there was a lot of, like, yuck around all of it. And we worked together and cleared it out. So the hurt, the anger, the pain, the shame, it's gone. And I'm asking her the question. I go, where was it? And she looks at me and she goes, it's gone. I don't feel it. I said, I know. Isn't that cool? And she's like, it is.
[25:52] B: It is.
[25:53] A: I go, but where was it? And the two of us started thinking. I go, was it surface level? And she said, no, it wasn't. I said, oh, maybe it was hiding in your center. She's like, dude, really? How could that stuff survive in light? Or I'm peaceful and excited. I said, oh, right. Well, then where was it? And she thought. And she goes, it was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I said, what happened? She says, the lights are now touching. The shadows are gone. And I said, whoa, that is pretty powerful. And then we started talking how you and I did just a few moments ago, about how people screw up identity all the time.
[26:32] B: Yeah.
[26:32] A: Thinking the way that they feel or act, what they do is part of who they are. People over identify their bodies as me. Like, people walk around like, my body is me. But what if your body isn't you? It's yours. Totally yours. But not you. And we know that because my mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident. And when she visits people now, like, 50 years ago, they don't say to her, hey, I'm glad almost all of you could come over.
[27:06] B: Yeah.
[27:08] A: So clearly, right? She is not her body. Yeah, but she has a body. Yeah, it's totally hers, but not who she is. Weird. So if you're not your body, then people go, why? Must be my brain. But your brain is simply an organ. Not like, you know, you hear at the lightning games, but an organ. Right. Like your heart and your liver and your lungs. Your brain is not you. It's an organ filled with neural networks. You're not even the thinker of your thoughts. Your brain is. And your brain isn't you. Weird.
[27:45] B: Weird.
[27:46] A: So I'm not my body, I'm not my thoughts. Oh, you must be how you feel, yet you feel different ways at different times. So you're not a feeling. Oh, clearly, I'm what I do. Yeah, but I did all that stuff. Stuff. I'm not doing any of that stuff. And when I stop doing that to do this, did I stop existing? No.
[28:04] B: No.
[28:04] A: Weirder question becomes, if you're not what you do, and if you're not your feelings, and if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not your body, what are you? Weird. Right?
[28:17] B: Weird.
[28:17] A: Weird. So we're gonna.
[28:19] B: Extra weird.
[28:20] A: It's extra weird, but we're gonna say something. We're just going to try it on. What if who you are, like the capital S self is what you became aware of as you see the sun and the butterfly? What if in that moment, as your awareness was drawn in and down, you became conscious of capital S self, which people call light or religions call soul?
[28:51] B: Okay.
[28:52] A: And people frequently say, my soul.
[28:54] B: Okay.
[28:55] A: We even have prayers now. I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. Yeah, my mom and I would say that at night when I was a little kid. And then she'd kiss me on the forehead, walk to the door, turn the light off, shut the door. Night, sweetie.
[29:13] B: I know. My mom did the same thing.
[29:15] A: Paranoid.
[29:16] B: Yeah. Wait, what about. What do you mean about two hands.
[29:19] A: Breaking through my window, ripping open my dead body?
[29:25] B: I'm sorry, it's not funny, but.
[29:26] A: Right. It is. So that's why I said, when I got older, I'm like, maybe the soul is not something I have. Maybe my Fingers and my toes are things I have. Maybe the light at the center is me. And then what if the light at the center, that is, you can't get touched or hurt or harmed, only has the capacity to allow the love in that it's wanting can only be interacted with respect. And I say that because, again, people screw up identity all the time. They say things like, I'm depressed, I'm anxious, I'm shy. They think the way they feel is who they are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm really upset when I get back, and you're like, why are you so upset? What did he do? And I go, you'll never believe this. The first thing he does, he puts me on this chair where immediately my head is going down, my feet are coming up. It's pretty uncomfortable. You're like, you're at the dentist. Yeah, yeah. But then he takes this thing, positions it right in front of my eyes, flips it on. Now bright light is in my eyes. I can't see anything. And you're like, you're at the dentist. And then I go, well, then he takes this cold instrument and shoves it right up inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness. In your what? I go, sandra, my mouth. I'm at the dentist.
[30:48] B: I'm at the dentist. Right, right, right.
[30:51] A: But that's the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother when she was little, her brother's best friend. I said, when you were little, he really messed with your stuff. And she looked at me and he said, he did. And then she said, and for a long time, it screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings and impacted a lot of what I did. And then she looks at me, she goes, but you know what? I go, what? She says, he never touched me. He messed with my body. It screwed up my thinkings and feelings, affected a lot of what I did, but he never touched me. And I went, whoa, that's deep. That is deep. That he never touched who she really is. That's right. And I'm going to show you something that's kind of interesting.
[31:45] B: Okay.
[31:46] A: Okay. So take that hand just like it is. Hold it like that. I'm going to inch a little bit closer. And then what I want you to do is look at that spot on your hand right there. As you look at that spot on your hand, you're going to notice my hand out and over here.
[32:00] B: Okay.
[32:01] A: I'm going to move my hand in towards your hand, and you'll be Seeing it, moving it in. As my hand moves in and it gets a little bit closer to your hand, you're going to begin to notice something within the tips of your fingers, within the palm of your hand. As my hands getting closer. Notice how you can feel the energy and the warmth from my hand within your hand. Isn't that interesting?
[32:27] B: That is interesting.
[32:28] A: And you know that you feel it because you notice that it's. You can feel it when it's here. Different there. You notice. You feel it here.
[32:38] B: Yeah.
[32:38] A: Isn't that cool?
[32:39] B: That is cool.
[32:40] A: As you're noticing that, you could also begin to think that I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body or screwed up your thinkings and feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with mutual respect. That's right. Isn't that interesting?
[33:03] B: That is interesting.
[33:04] A: Yeah. And so now just notice what happens when we take that hand like this. We'll just move those fingers closer together like that. And again, look at that spot right there. And don't do anything at all on purpose. Purpose to move that hand or those fingers. Just begin to breathe as you have been in a little bit slower and deeper way and get curious about what you can begin to notice within that hand and within those fingers. And see what might be interesting is that what's developing in that hand, Sandra, is a thing called catalyst epilepsy. Which means it becomes more wax like and flexible. Right. That you can simply move it in different ways and it stays. Isn't that interesting? Right. And just notice what you notice within your body. That's right. And then become curious about when you'll notice vibrational movements happening within that hand. Right. Within those fingers. Get really curious about when you'll notice one of those twitches within the fingers. That's right. Within the hand. That's right. As you notice those slight metal twitches, you can go deeper and deeper inside. That's right. Towards more of that calm and peaceful, easy flowing energy. That's right. The light that is you at your center. A calm and peaceful easy flowing energy inside your healing. Your unconscious. That's right. Is organizing towards the future you. That's right. Present. That's it. Peaceful, clear. And what's really cool is as you're noticing the movements. That's right. That are not on purpose. Purpose. That's right. Within that hand you're becoming aware of movement that's not conscious movement. And when you're consciously. That's right. Aware of what's not conscious, you become more Responsive. That's right. To your unconscious becoming more responsive to you. That's right. As we're organizing. Yes. Towards. That's right. The future. You light, fluid free. Clear present. That's right. Just like the butterfly in the sunlight. Present. Free flowing movement. That's right. Is happening in even more ways than you know. Because your unconscious is listening to what we're doing and knows which moments you've gone through. Past experiences that have happened will categorize and group all the way back to earliest. And then whichever order it thinks would be best for us to bring to your awareness. Moments to unplug so that the brain rewires and heals those emotional wounds. So that you're functioning more and more in the way that you and I are intending and collaborating on. That's right. That's right. That's right. And then take a deep breath in a long exhale. And this can do those rest.
[38:25] B: Ras Ras Ra.
[38:27] A: Right, Right. And just check. How's your body feeling now?
[38:31] B: Peaceful.
[38:31] A: It is peaceful, isn't it? And as your body stays in this nice peaceful resting, your unconscious is going to select the experience that it thinks would be best to bring to your awareness for us to unplug. Whether it be one that was coming up or not, whether it be way long time ago or recent, your unconscious knows. And that moment will come to awareness now. Right. What experience comes to mind.
[39:11] B: Whenever you got it?
[39:14] A: That one happened how long ago? Yeah. And the feelings, as you think about it are feelings of what? What is it? Hurt, sadness, anger, grief, guilt, shame, regret, remorse. Combination.
[39:26] B: All of it.
[39:27] A: Okay. So would it be okay to get the feelings gone? If the feelings are gone, would it mean what happened was okay?
[39:33] B: No.
[39:34] A: Right. You get to be okay even though that wasn't. If that happened at 18, we know that there are other things later. What's something recent you've done that was more fun than that?
[39:43] B: Everything.
[39:44] A: Yeah. Give me one.
[39:45] B: I had kids.
[39:46] A: Right. That was more fun. Right. Good. Something else.
[39:50] B: I got to go to the circus this weekend.
[39:53] A: Yeah, Going to the circus. Way more fun. Good. One other thing.
[39:55] B: My mom.
[39:56] A: Saturday you got to see mom. Right. All of those things happen after. There's a part that doesn't know any moment beyond. Right. So that moment happened. Thinking of one time. You're 18. You're where?
[40:07] B: At my brother in law's house.
[40:09] A: So you're at your brother in law's house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[40:11] B: Nighttime.
[40:12] A: Nighttime. And you're wearing the house in the living room. So you're in the living Room. Right. And, like, are you sitting, standing, sitting, sitting, like watching tv, playing cards?
[40:21] B: We were drinking.
[40:22] A: So you're drinking. Right. Why? Nothing was on. Just drinking and chatting.
[40:26] B: Music.
[40:26] A: Yeah. Music was on. Right. Good. Right. So you're drinking.
[40:29] B: Music on.
[40:30] A: Music on. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[40:32] B: He says, just let it happen.
[40:34] A: He says, just let it happen. The drinking?
[40:36] B: No.
[40:37] A: Oh, kissing me. So you were drinking. Right. And then he came over to you. Right. And then he started kissing you. Right. And some of that was weird, and some of it felt good. And then he said, well, just let it happen. Yeah, Right, Good. Then what happened next?
[40:49] B: I don't remember a lot of it.
[40:51] A: Well, right. Because our mind. Right. Was in and out. But what might have happened is he might have taken your clothes off. Yeah, Right. He might have taken his clothes off. He might have put his penis in different parts. Right. He would have done that for a period of time.
[41:03] B: Yeah.
[41:03] A: Right. And then he would have stopped.
[41:05] B: Yeah.
[41:05] A: And then after that, you would have gotten your clothes on. Yeah, he would have gotten his clothes on. Right. And then that time would have ended.
[41:12] B: Yeah.
[41:12] A: Right. And then later on, you did something else.
[41:16] B: Yeah, I went to my friend Andrea's house.
[41:18] A: Right, you did? Or, you know, you got kids.
[41:21] B: Yeah.
[41:22] A: Or to see your mom.
[41:23] B: Yeah.
[41:23] A: Or go to the circus.
[41:24] B: Go to the circus.
[41:25] A: Right. So we got going to the circus. We got seeing Mom. We got having kids. We got being at Andrea's. We got leaving. We got clothes being on. Right. Yours, his. We got him stopping. Right. And then he was doing that stuff to your body.
[41:38] B: Yeah.
[41:39] A: Right. And then he might have taken your clothes off and taking his clothes off. And then he's like, let it happen. And then he was kissing you, and then he'd come over close to you, and then you guys had been drinking, and then you'd gone over there. Right. And then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing.
[41:54] B: Yeah.
[41:55] A: Right. And as we go backwards compared to forward, what are you noticing?
[41:59] B: I don't know.
[42:00] A: You don't know. But how's your body feeling?
[42:03] B: Anxious.
[42:04] A: It is. Oh, right. Isn't that interesting? You can remember that happening?
[42:11] B: Yeah.
[42:12] A: You can remember putting on your jeans?
[42:13] B: Yeah.
[42:14] A: Sandra, stop putting on your jeans. Say, I'm not putting on my jeans.
[42:18] B: I'm not putting on my jeans.
[42:19] A: Well, stop getting your weave.
[42:21] B: I'm not getting my weave. Right.
[42:23] A: Well, then stop him from doing that. Say, he's not doing that.
[42:25] B: He's not doing.
[42:26] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt. Well, Stop that from happening. Say that's not happening.
[42:31] B: That's not happening.
[42:32] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[42:34] B: It no longer exists.
[42:35] A: Right. Bingo. As that starts to get in, what do you notice?
[42:39] B: I feel less anxious.
[42:40] A: You do, don't you? Right. Because, again, that thing happening, was that about you or him? Check it out. That thing happening, was that about you or him?
[42:54] B: That's about him.
[42:55] A: It was, wasn't it?
[42:56] B: Yeah.
[42:57] A: Right. And when he said let it happen, was that on you or him?
[43:02] B: That was on him.
[43:03] A: It was, wasn't it? Right. Because it was confusing.
[43:06] B: Yeah.
[43:06] A: For you.
[43:07] B: Yeah.
[43:07] A: Right. With him. Right. Because he's somebody that, like, was older.
[43:13] B: Yeah.
[43:13] A: Right. And like, older cousin.
[43:15] B: Yeah.
[43:16] A: Right. So there's, like, no threat with older cousin.
[43:19] B: Yeah.
[43:20] A: Right. And then that was weird.
[43:21] B: That was weird.
[43:22] A: Right. But some of it felt good. Right. Even some of what he did felt good.
[43:27] B: Yeah.
[43:28] A: Right. Which was confusing.
[43:30] B: Yeah.
[43:30] A: Because how could something that I know is bad and wrong and we shouldn't be doing it also feel good?
[43:36] B: Yeah.
[43:37] A: Got it. So then it goes, well, my body must be betraying me. Does that make sense?
[43:42] B: Yeah.
[43:42] A: Yeah. Except your body's not betraying you, because that wasn't feeling good. Because you wanted that with him.
[43:49] B: Yeah.
[43:50] A: That was feeling good. Because different body parts touched in certain ways are designed to feel good.
[43:55] B: Yeah.
[43:56] A: Follow me with that.
[43:57] B: I follow you. All right.
[44:02] A: That's why that was that way.
[44:03] B: Yeah.
[44:04] A: Right. You didn't know that then?
[44:06] B: No.
[44:07] A: Right. Some of it felt like, oh, well. Because it was. Some of it felt good, then like, some of it's on me and maybe we shouldn't and.
[44:14] B: Yeah.
[44:14] A: Do you follow me with that?
[44:15] B: I follow you.
[44:16] A: Right. She didn't know that it was feeling good. Not because it was him and not because you wanted it from him. It's like the kid who, you know, his grandfather blows him. He knows that's a weird thing. But some of what Grandpa did felt good. Does that mean he's gay?
[44:33] B: No.
[44:34] A: No. Just means body part touched in certain ways designed to feel good. Makes sense. Makes sense that earlier you didn't know that.
[44:42] B: No.
[44:42] A: Right. We want her to know that.
[44:45] B: She knows that now.
[44:46] A: Yeah. So close your eyes. Picture that earlier, you let her know first that it's over, finished. That it no longer exists. That some of it feeling good had nothing to do with you or you wanting it or wanting it with him had everything to do with body parts being touched in certain ways or designed to feel good. Right. Let her know that him doing that had nothing to do with you. And everything to do with what was off with him. So that she gets it. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about her kids. Let her know about being clean for a year. Let her know about going to the circus. Let her know so that she's getting it. Right. What do you notice happening to the earlier you?
[45:24] B: She's lighter.
[45:25] A: She is lighter, isn't she? Right.
[45:27] B: She's happier.
[45:28] A: She is, isn't. Right. Feels good. It does feel good, doesn't it? Right. It feels really good to get the good news in.
[45:40] B: It does.
[45:41] A: Yeah.
[45:42] B: Because I've done so good.
[45:45] A: Right.
[45:46] B: Now she can know that she doesn't have to be that broken girl.
[45:50] A: Well. Right. And she wasn't really ever.
[45:55] B: No.
[45:57] A: Right. Because who you really are couldn't be touched by any of that.
[46:01] B: No.
[46:03] A: Right. She didn't know that. Right. Who you are can't be touched with any of that. Right?
[46:15] B: Right.
[46:16] A: Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[46:18] B: It is a great news. Yeah.
[46:19] A: And as you're checking in with you, what are you noticing now?
[46:22] B: I don't feel so anxious.
[46:24] A: You don't, do you? Isn't that cool?
[46:27] B: It's really cool.
[46:28] A: Yeah, it's awesome. It is awesome. And we're on our way for you being free and present and clear and peaceful. And peaceful. Right. Right. Peace. Fully integrating. And you. Right. And again, your unconscious is going to travel back and bring another moment to mind.
[46:59] B: Okay.
[46:59] A: That one happened when you might have been how old?
[47:02] B: I was 22.
[47:05] A: Yeah. And you're where and what happened?
[47:07] B: I was at home.
[47:08] A: So you're at home. Good. Was it daytime or night time?
[47:10] B: It was daytime.
[47:11] A: Daytime. And you're wearing the house?
[47:12] B: I'm in the dining area, yeah.
[47:15] A: So you're like in the dining room. Are you sitting, standing, walking around?
[47:18] B: I'm standing, calling my dad over and over again.
[47:21] A: So you're calling him on the phone?
[47:22] B: Yeah.
[47:22] A: Right. And he's not answering?
[47:24] B: No.
[47:24] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[47:26] B: I finally called so many times. The nurse answered. A nurse answered the phone.
[47:30] A: The nurse answered the phone. Right. And said, hi, your dad's been in.
[47:35] B: A really bad accident.
[47:36] A: Your dad. Oh. Nurse said, hi, your dad's been in a bad accident. Be here. Hi.
[47:39] B: Hi.
[47:40] A: Hi.
[47:40] B: Hi.
[47:41] A: Hi. I had more fun than that was.
[47:42] B: Yeah, I was. It was terrible.
[47:44] A: So she said that.
[47:45] B: And she said, you need to call your mom.
[47:47] A: You need to call mom. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[47:49] B: I called my mom.
[47:50] A: Right. Good. And then what happened?
[47:51] B: She says, I'm already here, I'll call you back.
[47:53] A: Good. Right. Then what happened next?
[47:57] B: My dad was. Hi.
[47:58] A: Hi. Hypy here.
[48:00] B: What happened next? I. My dad. My mom came and picked me up.
[48:03] A: So mom got you?
[48:05] B: Yeah.
[48:05] A: And then drove you to the hospital? Yeah. And then you and her waited?
[48:08] B: No, we were. We went up to the icu.
[48:11] A: Right, Good.
[48:12] B: She went in.
[48:13] A: Right. Then what happened next? Be here. Hi. Hi. Hi. Right. No, here. Hi.
[48:18] B: Next. Hi.
[48:19] A: Hi. Right.
[48:21] B: We ended up finding out he was in a very severe scooter accident.
[48:24] A: Right. So he's in a scooter. Right.
[48:26] B: Yeah.
[48:27] A: And so he was in icu. Right. Then what happened next?
[48:31] B: He lived.
[48:32] A: Oh, and then he lived.
[48:33] B: Yeah, he lived.
[48:34] A: Then he got out of the hospital.
[48:35] B: Yeah. He had to relearn how to walk.
[48:37] A: And then he had to relearn how to walk, and then he did.
[48:39] B: Yeah.
[48:40] A: And then that was over.
[48:41] B: Yeah.
[48:42] A: And then later on, you did something more fun.
[48:44] B: Yeah.
[48:44] A: Like have kids.
[48:45] B: Like have kids.
[48:46] A: Right. I go to go to the circus.
[48:48] B: Yeah.
[48:48] A: Be clean for a year.
[48:49] B: Yeah.
[48:50] A: Right. So I got. Being clean for a year. We got. Going to the circus. We gotta have some kids.
[48:53] B: Yeah.
[48:53] A: We got dad, you know, learning how to walk. And then he had to learn how to walk. And then he got out.
[48:57] B: Yeah.
[48:58] A: And then he was okay.
[48:59] B: Yeah.
[48:59] A: And then he. You would learn that he was in a really bad accident.
[49:02] B: Yeah.
[49:02] A: And then you. She had gone in the icu, Then you guys had went up there, and then you got to the hospital, and then she come and got you.
[49:07] B: Yeah.
[49:07] A: And then you had gotten off the phone with her, and she said, I'm already here. And then you had called her. And then the nurse said, you need to call your mom. And then the nurse said, your dad's been in a bad accident. And then you're trying to call dad.
[49:18] B: Yeah.
[49:18] A: And then before that, you've probably gotten home.
[49:20] B: Yeah, I was mad at him right before the accident.
[49:26] A: Yeah.
[49:26] B: You're imagining home on time to take.
[49:28] A: Me to do something, but you're mad because he should have been home already.
[49:31] B: Yeah.
[49:31] A: You're like, where the is he?
[49:32] B: Yeah.
[49:33] A: Right.
[49:33] B: So I feel guilty for that.
[49:35] A: Oh, right. But you're mad. You stop being mad when you realize that he was in a bad accident. He had a good reason for not.
[49:42] B: Yeah, exactly.
[49:43] A: Do you follow me with that?
[49:44] B: Yeah.
[49:46] A: Makes sense. It's like the parents who are worried sick, where's their kid? Where's their kid? Where's their kid? Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.
[49:51] B: Oh, my goodness.
[49:52] A: They're really scared. And then the kid comes home and all that scared turns into being Angry at him.
[49:57] B: Yeah.
[49:59] A: But before it was all scared, it was all worried. Right, Right. Same thing.
[50:04] B: Yeah.
[50:05] A: Right. You weren't mad at him for getting in an accident. You were mad because you needed to be somewhere and you were dependent on him to get you there. And this wasn't the first time.
[50:16] B: Yeah. It was like the millionth time.
[50:20] A: Right. That dad was not on time or timely to get you somewhere.
[50:24] B: Yeah.
[50:24] A: Follow me with that.
[50:25] B: Yep.
[50:26] A: Right.
[50:26] B: Thought he was not getting drunk.
[50:28] A: Right. And he might have been.
[50:30] B: Yeah. Well, he wasn't.
[50:31] A: No.
[50:32] B: He was just getting home, leaving work.
[50:34] A: On a scooter.
[50:35] B: Yeah.
[50:37] A: Right. No, it is kind of funny. Well, it is because he's okay.
[50:41] B: Yeah.
[50:42] A: Kind of funny. No.
[50:43] B: Yeah.
[50:43] A: It wasn't then.
[50:44] B: No.
[50:45] A: No. But you weren't angry at him because you wanted to just be angry at him? Him?
[50:50] B: No.
[50:51] A: Right. And that was based on having had other experiences where dad maybe stopped and got a few drinks that stayed longer than he. Oh, just stopped for one. I got plenty of time to get her. And then he's like 20. Right? Yeah. Got it.
[51:07] B: Yeah.
[51:08] A: Right. And that you didn't know that he was going to be okay and learn how to walk.
[51:11] B: Yeah.
[51:13] A: Right.
[51:14] B: Or live.
[51:15] A: Right. Live. Right. So you can remember all that happening?
[51:18] B: Yeah.
[51:18] A: Right. Getting, trying to reach him, talking to the nurse, calling mom, I'm coming to get you to find it out. You can remember all that happened? Yeah. You can also remember putting on your jeans today. I know. We'll stop putting them on. Say I'm not putting them on. Well, stop putting on your shirt.
[51:33] B: I'm not putting it on.
[51:33] A: Well stop me from putting on my shirt.
[51:35] B: You're not.
[51:35] A: Well then stop that from happening.
[51:37] B: I can't.
[51:38] A: Right. Well then you stop being mad.
[51:39] B: I'm not being mad.
[51:40] A: Right. Well then stop that from happening. It was not happening.
[51:42] B: Not happening.
[51:43] A: Right. So then where is it? Satan no longer exists.
[51:45] B: It no longer exists.
[51:46] A: And what does that you need to know? That's okay.
[51:50] B: That's okay.
[51:51] A: That's right. That's right.
[51:55] B: Dad lived.
[51:56] A: Right. So close your eyes, picture her and let her know what you know now. That he wasn't late. Cuz he was drinking. Right. Which is what she assumed. Right. And that he's okay. That he made it through it. That he relearned how to walk, that he's okay. So that she gets it. Right. And even realizing that him being late all those other times had nothing to do with you. Right. And everything to do with the part that was off with him and his drinking. That's right. She didn't know. She thought that if she mattered more, he wouldn't stop at the bar. Yeah, Right. As we're looking at it, clearly you mattering had nothing to do with whether he stopped at the bar or not.
[52:35] B: Yeah.
[52:35] A: Had everything to do with what was screwed up with him. Right. You didn't know that then. And what happens is the earlier you starts to learn it. It's not about me. Had to do with dad and dad's affliction and dad's problem. Yeah, right. Not about me. So that she gets it. Right. As the earlier you is getting it. What do you notice now?
[53:00] B: I feel relief.
[53:02] A: You do, don't you?
[53:03] B: Yeah.
[53:03] A: Isn't that cool?
[53:04] B: I feel bad for that little girl.
[53:06] A: Oh, you do? Yeah. You only feel bad for that little girl because you can conceive of it having not been that way for that little girl. Yeah, that makes sense. You can conceive of having had a dad who didn't do that kind of stuff. Yeah, right.
[53:22] B: I just feel bad for her because I know how she felt and I know it's just feeling.
[53:30] A: But what if she's not feeling that way now?
[53:34] B: Yeah, because she doesn't.
[53:37] A: I know. Right. So is there anything to feel bad about for her? She's not feeling that way now.
[53:43] B: No, there isn't.
[53:43] A: There isn't? No. Isn't that cool?
[53:46] B: It is cool.
[53:47] A: Right? You're actually not feeling bad for her.
[53:50] B: No.
[53:50] A: Because, you know, although we would have desired it to be a different way.
[53:55] B: Yeah.
[53:55] A: That was the only way it could have been for her then with that dad.
[54:00] B: Yeah.
[54:01] A: And his affliction. Yeah, and had nothing to do with your lovability. She just felt back then that it had everything to do with you. And that's because when we're little, we're trained to believe that the good things happen when I'm being good. And therefore the bad things only happen if I've been being bad.
[54:16] B: Yeah.
[54:17] A: Which is not true. Bad things can happen to good people without them doing anything freaking wrong. But that's not what we learn when we're little. And because that's what we learn when we're little, everybody's behavior feels like it means something about me. And because I'm the most important person in my own life, I think I'm the most important person in everybody else's life too. So I actually think that they're all thinking about me when most of them are just thinking about themselves.
[54:48] B: Yeah.
[54:49] A: Right. Weird.
[54:51] B: Weird.
[54:52] A: Right?
[54:53] B: True.
[54:54] A: Right. So that earlier you is getting it. It's not about me. Oh. And that I didn't need him to be more present and around.
[55:03] B: Yeah.
[55:04] A: In order for me to love my own kids. Right. In order for me to get clean.
[55:08] B: Yeah.
[55:09] A: And be clean for a year and enter a program, tip me to be.
[55:13] B: Better and have multiple years clean.
[55:16] A: Right.
[55:17] B: There's the future for me now.
[55:18] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[55:19] B: That is awesome.
[55:20] A: Yeah. That you're doing and see. Close your eyes again and let that earlier you know all that you know now so that she's getting it had nothing to do with me or my lovability. Had to do with what was off with him. That I didn't need him to be any other way. In order for me to be a loving mom, to get myself clean. Right. To be working towards more and more of what I want. Right. And as this gets in what's happening.
[55:53] B: Now, I feel more at ease.
[55:55] A: You do feel more at ease. Isn't that cool?
[55:58] B: That's awesome.
[55:59] A: Yeah.
[56:04] B: Definitely feel more at ease.
[56:05] A: You do? Yeah.
[56:08] B: Feel less emotional about it.
[56:10] A: Yeah. Well, is there emotion about it now?
[56:13] B: No.
[56:14] A: Isn't that weird?
[56:15] B: That is weird.
[56:16] A: Notice how it was there?
[56:17] B: Yeah.
[56:18] A: And I was not there and I was just crying. Yeah.
[56:20] B: Yeah.
[56:21] A: And now like you're not just relieved, but you're like, okay.
[56:24] B: Yeah, I'm fine.
[56:25] A: And she's okay.
[56:27] B: Yeah.
[56:29] A: Right?
[56:30] B: She's okay.
[56:31] A: She is, isn't she? Yeah. And as you're checking in your body, how's your body feeling now?
[56:37] B: Relieved.
[56:38] A: It is. Yeah. On the way to being peaceful.
[56:42] B: Yeah.
[56:42] A: Or peace filled.
[56:43] B: Yeah.
[56:44] A: Right.
[56:46] B: I like that. Peace filled.
[56:47] A: Yeah. So that you're more okay. In you.
[56:49] B: Yeah. My soul feels lighter.
[56:53] A: It does. Right? You feel lighter.
[56:56] B: I feel lighter.
[56:57] A: Right. Because you might be just the soul.
[57:00] B: Yeah.
[57:00] A: Is you.
[57:01] B: It is me.
[57:02] A: It is you.
[57:03] B: I do feel lighter.
[57:04] A: You do feel lighter, don't you?
[57:05] B: I do.
[57:06] A: Right. Because you're getting free. I bet. Because it's allowing your body, brain to become more present. That's all data. I'm not having to read everything that's similar is identical.
[57:20] B: Yeah. Which is nice.
[57:23] A: Yeah. I still have the wisdom from what I made it through. So I'm more wise than somebody who didn't go through it. Right. There's a reason that we want somebody who's made it through the war to lead people in battle. Right. We don't pull the book smart dude out. Okay.
[57:46] B: You figured this out like Merry Christmas.
[57:50] A: Right. Read it in a book and tell us how to do it.
[57:52] B: Exactly.
[57:53] A: No, no.
[57:54] B: We don't want that at all.
[57:56] A: We want the guy who's done it. Right. So you gain from what you go through, but nobody signs up for adversity to become stronger except the Navy seals. Again, those people are a different breed.
[58:11] B: Different breed.
[58:12] A: But the rest of us go through a lot of adversity. Right, right. And going through adversity and making it to the other side makes me stronger.
[58:23] B: Yeah, it does make me stronger.
[58:26] A: Yeah. Right. So again, that unconscious part is going to travel back.
[58:31] B: Okay.
[58:31] A: Down the timeline of moments and things that have happened and will bring another moment to your awareness. Yeah. What's coming to mind now?
[58:52] B: My mom and dad fighting.
[58:53] A: Yeah. He might have been how old?
[58:57] B: Probably like 13, 14.
[59:00] A: Yeah. And you would have been where, as this was happening?
[59:03] B: In my room.
[59:04] A: So you would have been in your room and they would have been like, where in the house?
[59:07] B: They were in the living room.
[59:08] A: They were in the living room and, like, they were screaming and yelling.
[59:10] B: Yeah.
[59:11] A: And table broke and banging.
[59:15] B: Yeah.
[59:15] A: Right. Glass.
[59:16] B: Table shattered.
[59:17] A: Table shattered. Right. What happened next?
[59:20] B: I came out of the room.
[59:21] A: Right. As you heard that loud noise?
[59:23] B: Yeah. I told my brother to stay in the room.
[59:25] A: Right. And you went out?
[59:26] B: Yeah.
[59:27] A: Right. Then what happened?
[59:29] B: They kept fighting.
[59:30] A: Right. They were continuing to scream and yell at each other.
[59:32] B: And my mom told me to stay in the room.
[59:33] A: Go back to your room. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[59:36] B: I called my uncle.
[59:38] A: You went back in the room?
[59:39] B: Yeah.
[59:40] A: Called your uncle?
[59:41] B: Yeah.
[59:41] A: He came over?
[59:43] B: Yeah.
[59:45] A: Then what happened?
[59:46] B: He kicked us out.
[59:48] A: Uncle kicked you out?
[59:49] B: He kicked my whole family out.
[59:51] A: So you guys gotta get out of.
[59:52] B: This house because we were disturbing the neighbors. Oh, well, my parents were.
[59:56] A: Right.
[59:57] B: Yeah.
[59:57] A: So you guys all gotta go.
[59:59] B: Yeah.
[60:00] A: Then what happened?
[60:02] B: We lived in a motel.
[60:03] A: We left that house.
[60:05] B: Yeah.
[60:05] A: Right. And went into a hotel that night.
[60:08] B: Yeah.
[60:08] A: Right. Then we might have stayed in the hotel for a little bit.
[60:12] B: For the 45 days?
[60:14] A: Yeah. For 45 days. Right.
[60:16] B: Yeah. Two dogs.
[60:17] A: Right. And then you left.
[60:20] B: Yeah.
[60:21] A: Right. That particular time ended.
[60:23] B: Yeah.
[60:24] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[60:27] B: Yeah.
[60:27] A: Like have kids.
[60:28] B: I went to the circus.
[60:29] A: Go to the circus. Saw mom and her.
[60:32] B: Be proud of me.
[60:33] A: Got clean. Got clean for a year, right? Yes. 365 days clean.
[60:40] B: Yeah.
[60:41] A: Going to the circus. Seeing Mom.
[60:42] B: Yeah.
[60:43] A: Right.
[60:43] B: Had kids.
[60:44] A: Had kids. Right. And you guys left the motel, and then you're at the motel and then uncle had you guys leave, and then he came over and then you'd call them.
[60:52] B: Yeah.
[60:53] A: And then you went back in the room, and then she told you to go back in the room, and then they continued to Argue. And then you had heard the. You came out and then you heard the loud noise and then they were arguing.
[61:03] B: Yeah.
[61:03] A: And then you and your brother gone in the room.
[61:05] B: Yeah.
[61:06] A: Right, right. And as it goes backwards compared to forward, what do you notice?
[61:10] B: It's over.
[61:11] A: It is. You can remember them doing that?
[61:14] B: Yeah.
[61:14] A: You can remember putting your watch on. We'll stop putting it on your watch.
[61:18] B: Not putting on my waist.
[61:19] A: Stop putting on your sneaks. We'll stop them from yelling at each other. We'll stop them from breaking the table. We'll stop that from happening.
[61:27] B: It's not happening.
[61:28] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[61:29] B: It no longer exists.
[61:31] A: And again, just check in. What do you notice?
[61:36] B: I feel like I still feel anxious about it. I don't know why.
[61:39] A: Just check. How do you know that you're feeling anxious? Where are you feeling it?
[61:44] B: In my stomach.
[61:46] A: What if you were to just notice the sensations in your stomach right now without having to do anything with them, about them or even try to understand or describe them? Just notice them. Notice what you can notice and how they're changing. Because the sensation is a wave. It's in constant motion. So it has to be changing. But we never pay attention to how it's changing. So what do you notice is you're noticing that the sensations are changing.
[62:10] B: It's excitement.
[62:12] A: Oh, now it's becoming more exciting.
[62:13] B: Yeah.
[62:14] A: Isn't that weird?
[62:15] B: That is weird.
[62:15] A: Huh? How do you know it's more excitement?
[62:18] B: Because I don't feel like upset.
[62:20] A: You're not feeling upset.
[62:21] B: Yeah.
[62:23] A: Well, I wonder what would be exciting about getting that cleared.
[62:27] B: I don't have to deal with it.
[62:29] A: You don't. That's right. That's pretty exciting.
[62:32] B: It is exciting.
[62:33] A: Yeah. So remember them screaming and yelling and breaking the table? Remember uncle coming over?
[62:39] B: Yeah.
[62:40] A: When you guys got to go, you can't live here anymore.
[62:42] B: Yeah.
[62:43] A: You guys having to go with two dogs and stay in some crappy motel.
[62:46] B: Yeah.
[62:46] A: And it was a motel, not a hotel.
[62:48] B: It was a motel.
[62:49] A: Cuz it had doors like that open into the parking lot.
[62:52] B: Yeah.
[62:52] A: Yeah. That's when. That's how you know.
[62:54] B: That's how you know the difference.
[62:55] A: Right.
[62:55] B: You got a halt, they smoking in the rooms. That's how you know there's a big.
[63:00] A: Difference between, you know, ones that are motels. Those are the ones that women don't want to go to.
[63:05] B: Yeah.
[63:05] A: Cuz no woman wants a door out to the parking lot. Right. You can see that she just went into that door. You like to at least Have a hallway.
[63:12] B: Right. I like the hallway.
[63:13] A: Yeah. Much better, isn't it?
[63:15] B: Way better.
[63:15] A: Way better. Yeah.
[63:16] B: Way better.
[63:16] A: That's right. Don't need no door opening up to the party. That's right.
[63:21] B: Or to let go railing with, like, people standing at it.
[63:24] A: Exactly. I don't need that. Right, Right.
[63:27] B: Not at all.
[63:27] A: No.
[63:28] B: That was horrible.
[63:29] A: Right.
[63:30] B: But it's not there anymore.
[63:31] A: No. Check it out. Remember it now?
[63:33] B: Yeah.
[63:33] A: Right.
[63:34] B: We left.
[63:35] A: You did?
[63:35] B: Yeah.
[63:36] A: And then you finally got out of the hotel.
[63:37] B: Yeah.
[63:38] A: Right, right, right. And see, that set you up to be able to go through other hard things because I didn't have to be so concerned with where I slept sometimes. Mm.
[63:54] B: I had to be concerned about where I slept a lot.
[63:56] A: Oh, you did?
[63:57] B: Yeah.
[63:58] A: No. What's happening now? See, you're doing it. You're so good, Sandra. I love it. So, you notice how a moment came to mind?
[64:05] B: Yeah.
[64:06] A: Yeah. Let's be here. Hi. Hi. Because I'm fun.
[64:09] B: You are fun.
[64:09] A: Right. Because that part of your brain doesn't know that one's over.
[64:12] B: Yeah.
[64:12] A: Right. We want the good news to get in.
[64:14] B: Yeah.
[64:15] A: So think of a time where it was really hard. We had to be really, like, concerned with where you were, how old? What happened?
[64:22] B: I was 31.
[64:23] A: Yeah. Right. And you're where?
[64:25] B: In my car.
[64:26] A: So you're in your car. Right. Good. And you had been driving, or you parked it somewhere.
[64:31] B: Parked.
[64:32] A: Right.
[64:32] B: At Caddy's in Bradenton.
[64:34] A: At Caddy's in Bradenton. Right. And then what happened?
[64:37] B: I'm trying to sleep.
[64:39] A: Right.
[64:39] B: But I can't sleep.
[64:40] A: Right. Cuz you're in your car.
[64:42] B: I have nowhere else to go.
[64:43] A: They're really not meant for sleeping.
[64:44] B: Yeah, but I have nowhere else to go.
[64:46] A: Right. So you're in the car, laying there.
[64:50] B: I call somebody.
[64:52] A: Uhhuh. Right.
[64:52] B: To make money.
[64:53] A: Right. So you're like, hey, I need some. Right. So got a john. Whatever.
[64:57] B: Yeah.
[64:58] A: Right. They come over to the car. I drive there.
[65:00] B: I drive there.
[65:01] A: Right. Good thing I had a car.
[65:02] B: Right. And I slept with him for a motel room.
[65:06] A: Right. So you did that, and then you got to sleep in the motel room.
[65:09] B: Yeah. Take a shower. Been a couple days.
[65:12] A: Right. So you. Right. So you got to take a shower. Right.
[65:15] B: Sleep in a bed.
[65:16] A: Sleep in a bed. And had to do the sex thing with him.
[65:18] B: Yeah.
[65:18] A: Right. And then got up the next day.
[65:21] B: Yeah.
[65:21] A: Right. Then that was over.
[65:24] B: It was over.
[65:24] A: Right. And then you got back in your car.
[65:27] B: Yeah.
[65:27] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun like go to the circus.
[65:30] B: I go to the circus.
[65:31] A: Right. Or see mom.
[65:32] B: Yeah. And get clean.
[65:33] A: And get clean. Right.
[65:34] B: The whole year.
[65:35] A: Whole year. Right.
[65:36] B: Never have to do that again.
[65:37] A: Right. I know you don't have somewhere to sleep. Right? That's right. You do. It is a really good feeling. Right. Because that you, of course, back then, when all that was going on, wasn't sure you were ever going to be okay.
[65:50] B: Yeah, I'm okay.
[65:52] A: You are okay. Better than okay, aren't you?
[65:54] B: I'm awesome.
[65:55] A: You are awesome. That's true. 100% way better than okay.
[66:00] B: Way better than okay.
[66:02] A: That's right. Right. So close your eyes and picture her and letting her know that's over, finished. That no longer exists, that you're okay. Let her know all the positive changes you're making in your life. Being clean for a year.
[66:16] B: Hello.
[66:18] A: Let her know about entering programming. Let her know about rehabilitating. Let her know about creating. Let her know about the opportunity to have a completely distinctive, different life than she did.
[66:32] B: Yeah.
[66:32] A: Right. Let her know how much you value you. How much you're worth it to you. So that she's getting how worth it she is to you, isn't she?
[66:44] B: I am worth it.
[66:46] A: Really Worth it to you.
[66:47] B: I'm definitely worth it.
[66:48] A: That's right. So that she's getting over, finished. No longer exists. I'm okay.
[66:55] B: I'm okay.
[66:56] A: Right?
[66:57] B: I'm okay.
[66:58] A: You are okay.
[66:59] B: I'm great.
[67:00] A: Yeah.
[67:01] B: I have such a better life now.
[67:03] A: You do. Isn't that cool?
[67:04] B: It is so cool.
[67:05] A: Yeah, it's awesome. So as you check in, thinking about her, you know, having had slept in the car or if she's not sleeping in the car, she's got to find a place for.
[67:14] B: Yeah. Or I can at least lock the door.
[67:17] A: Right. But I got to exchange a service for.
[67:20] B: Yeah, Yeah.
[67:22] A: I got to pay for the hotel room somehow.
[67:23] B: Somehow.
[67:24] A: Right.
[67:25] B: It wasn't even a hotel room. It was a hotel. Exactly.
[67:29] A: We weren't going to the high dollar place.
[67:31] B: Yeah. 64.46 a night. I know the price.
[67:40] A: Free breakfast. Free breakfast. Well, for that much, you definitely got to get breakfast.
[67:45] B: Gotta get breakfast.
[67:46] A: That's the craziest part. You go to any of the. The motels, hotels, things like that?
[67:51] B: Yeah.
[67:51] A: That you're not spending a lot of money for the room.
[67:53] B: Yeah.
[67:53] A: They give you free breakfast.
[67:54] B: Exactly. You go to a neighbo cereal too.
[67:57] A: You go to a fancy hotel, no breakfast, no breakfast.
[68:01] B: Unless it's the Ramada. The Ramada does give you.
[68:04] A: You have to. I'm talking about Fancy.
[68:05] B: Fancy. Oh, you're talking about, like, the hill.
[68:07] A: Like, I'm talking, like, even a step above that. Like, you're talking, like, fancy, fancy brands, like the Ritz or, you know, the JW Marriott.
[68:17] B: Okay, see, I've never been to one of those. I have to go find me one.
[68:21] A: You gotta pay for breakfast when you go there.
[68:23] B: Oh, yeah, I bet. Probably have to pay to, like, flush the toilet.
[68:27] A: Yeah. Free Internet at these places. You can pay for Internet?
[68:30] B: Oh, do you?
[68:31] A: That's crazy.
[68:31] B: Really?
[68:32] A: Wow.
[68:32] B: Yeah.
[68:33] A: Free parking. Got paid for parking.
[68:35] B: Probably a valet service, though.
[68:37] A: You still have to pay for that. That's only like, if you park your own car. It's only, like, $45. You do the valet, it's $65 plus.
[68:45] B: Really? That's crazy.
[68:48] A: That's just for the valet. You were 64. Night 49. Come on.
[68:51] B: I know. That's for the whole. The whole spiel. That's the room and that's the two beds and a tv. Free WI Fi. And breakfast. What?
[68:59] A: Yeah, right.
[69:00] B: Can't believe it.
[69:00] A: It's a better deal.
[69:01] B: No deposit. It's great. Now, it did smell like bleach at least. So, you know, it smelled. It smelled clean.
[69:07] A: Got clean.
[69:09] B: There was no way they had to.
[69:10] A: Use that much bleach. I'm not sure what was in here before, but I'm glad they did.
[69:14] B: Yes.
[69:15] A: I had the bleach smell then and fresh laundry smell.
[69:17] B: So, you know, they changed the sheets. Yeah. That's always a positive. Hey, I had to find the little things.
[69:24] A: That's right. So even as you're thinking about that now, remembering that you didn't have a place to go when you were, you know, living out of your car.
[69:32] B: Yeah.
[69:32] A: What do you notice?
[69:33] B: I feel better.
[69:34] A: You do, right?
[69:36] B: I can laugh about it.
[69:37] A: You can, can't you? Yeah.
[69:40] B: Definitely wasn't the Marriott.
[69:43] A: No.
[69:45] B: Got free breakfast.
[69:46] A: Yeah. Right.
[69:48] B: So it's definitely better.
[69:50] A: Right. And it felt safer. Right?
[69:53] B: Yeah.
[69:53] A: I didn't have to, because that was a person that I'd been with before.
[69:57] B: Yeah.
[69:58] A: Right. And I just did that thing, and I knew how that was. Go. So that felt safer that I could lock the door than just being in my car by myself.
[70:04] B: Yeah.
[70:05] A: Right.
[70:06] B: And, like, having to have the windows up with the car off so you don't waste gas. Because it was like, gas is expensive.
[70:13] A: Right.
[70:14] B: Right.
[70:14] A: Yeah.
[70:16] B: So having the room was better.
[70:18] A: It was, wasn't it?
[70:21] B: Now it's like, I don't have to do that.
[70:23] A: Not at all. No.
[70:25] B: Because every year, clean.
[70:27] A: That's Right.
[70:28] B: I went to the circus yesterday.
[70:30] A: You did?
[70:31] B: That's something that I would have never been able to do a year ago.
[70:33] A: That cool.
[70:34] B: That is awesome.
[70:35] A: Did you see Nick Wainda?
[70:37] B: I don't know which one that was.
[70:38] A: I had to be the trapeze guy.
[70:40] B: Yeah.
[70:40] A: Not trapeze guy. The guy who walks across the.
[70:42] B: The tightrope.
[70:43] A: Yeah. Tightrope guy.
[70:44] B: Yeah. He was cool. He was so cool. He did like a somersault. He did a front handspring, back handspring. He did all kinds of cool stuff. Yeah, for sure. Awesome. It's the first time I've been to the circus since I was, like, five.
[70:55] A: Yeah. See, there you go.
[70:56] B: Yeah. Like, the last time I went to the circus, they still had elephants.
[71:00] A: They don't have them anymore.
[71:01] B: No, they don't. Not at all. They don't have elephants in the circus anymore.
[71:10] A: Cool.
[71:11] B: Cool.
[71:11] A: Yeah. So as you're checking in, what are you noticing?
[71:15] B: I feel better.
[71:17] A: Don't you?
[71:17] B: I feel happier.
[71:20] A: Yeah.
[71:20] B: Smart. Peace.
[71:22] A: Yeah. Right, Right. And body's okay. And notice how those things are getting cleared quickly. Right.
[71:31] B: Fast.
[71:32] A: Yeah.
[71:33] B: Straight to the point. I'm just kidding.
[71:36] A: That's right. Yeah. And that's why your brain unconscious is going to bring another moment to your awareness to clear. Yeah.
[71:50] B: Sleeping with another John.
[71:52] A: Yeah. That one happened when. Well, what's. The feelings, by the way, when you think of that?
[71:58] B: Shame.
[71:59] A: Shame.
[72:01] B: Just gross.
[72:02] A: Yeah. There were certain guys that were a little bit better to do it with than other guys.
[72:07] B: Yeah. This one was disgusting.
[72:09] A: Yeah.
[72:10] B: Yeah.
[72:10] A: Yeah. And again, we're not troubled because of what we did or even what they did.
[72:15] B: Yeah.
[72:16] A: It's because the brain doesn't know it ended. So we have good news to get in. So that one, you're how old? When.
[72:24] B: 31.
[72:24] A: Yeah. Right. So after you gotten away, huh? After you'd gotten away.
[72:30] B: Yeah.
[72:31] A: From the ex.
[72:32] B: Yeah.
[72:33] A: But you were still not having a way.
[72:36] B: My ex was more of like, he. He made me sleep with him for things.
[72:40] A: Yeah. Right.
[72:42] B: I wanted to leave him. He wouldn't let me leave.
[72:45] A: Right. For a long time.
[72:47] B: For a long time.
[72:48] A: And then you got away. You did.
[72:51] B: I did, yeah.
[72:51] A: There's a part of you that doesn't know you fully got away.
[72:54] B: No. She's still crying.
[72:56] A: We want to get that in. Right. We want the good news to get into the part of the brain that doesn't know. But this one, you had already gotten away.
[73:04] B: Yeah.
[73:05] A: Right. She doesn't even know about that. No. That you'd already gotten away. Not.
[73:10] B: I already got away.
[73:10] A: Right.
[73:11] B: Yeah.
[73:11] A: And then you were doing this thing with that other guy.
[73:13] B: Yeah.
[73:14] A: Right. Who wasn't a guy. That was like a. It was a grossed out guy.
[73:18] B: Yeah.
[73:19] A: But I couldn't not do the thing. Right. Because I needed to fuel the addiction.
[73:25] B: Yeah.
[73:26] A: And gas calling how to get a.
[73:28] B: Room for my kids.
[73:29] A: You had to get a room for your kids. Right. At this point. Right, right. So you're like, I got no other options. Here's this guy, he's going to pay me X. That'll get us a room for the night.
[73:39] B: Yeah.
[73:41] A: Right. A lot of like, you know, how am I going to make it to the next Thinking back then.
[73:47] B: Yeah.
[73:48] A: Isn't that interesting?
[73:49] B: A lot of survival.
[73:50] A: Yeah. A lot of survival. But a lot of like, you know, also like, how am I going to get this in like two days?
[73:55] B: Yeah. How am I going to get food?
[73:57] A: Right. Because that's where my planning is not, oh, I'm thinking about the week or I'm thinking about the.
[74:04] B: About the moment.
[74:05] A: I'm thinking about. Okay. I need to get through this to make sure I've got that for this.
[74:10] B: Yeah. You have to plan ahead.
[74:12] A: Yeah. But it's not planning ahead. It's only planning ahead by a few days.
[74:17] B: Yeah.
[74:17] A: Or a week maybe. Do you follow me with that?
[74:20] B: Yeah.
[74:20] A: It's not like, oh, well, I'm doing this thing and scrunching some money over here so that later on I can get this thing.
[74:26] B: No, it's just for the moment.
[74:28] A: It's just for the moment. Or I need to make sure that I got enough money to be able to get us a room in two nights.
[74:33] B: Yeah.
[74:34] A: I know. I've got enough to cover this night. I got to figure out what I'm going to do to cover the next.
[74:38] B: Yeah.
[74:39] A: Do you follow me with that? We say that that's planning, but that's not planning. That's I'm in the weeds.
[74:46] B: Yeah.
[74:47] A: And I'm not seeing the big picture.
[74:49] B: Not at all.
[74:49] A: And that is a poor mindset.
[74:52] B: Yeah.
[74:53] A: A wealth mindset. Knows why am I doing what I'm doing. I've got my bills, but I'm also putting certain bits of it away for savings, for investment, for emergency fund, for like, there's two views that I'm doing.
[75:14] B: Yeah.
[75:14] A: Not just about I got to get, you know, enough money to pay this bill. I'm gonna get paid next Tuesday. And yeah. They have a different way that they start thinking which we want to get that installed in you at some point too.
[75:26] B: Yeah, for sure.
[75:28] A: Got it.
[75:29] B: Yeah.
[75:29] A: So I Feel like now we're not gonna run our lives paycheck to paycheck.
[75:34] B: Yeah. I don't want to live paycheck. No.
[75:36] A: Right. And that's how it was in that world.
[75:38] B: Yeah. It wasn't even a check, Right.
[75:42] A: No. But everything I got got spent.
[75:44] B: Yeah. At that moment, if it wasn't paid for already, for me, it had to be paid.
[75:51] A: Pretty much everything got spent.
[75:53] B: Now with my kids, I. It was a little bit more like it was a hallway. It wasn't a parking lot.
[75:58] A: See, isn't that good? Right. Because I care about my kids.
[76:01] B: Yeah.
[76:01] A: Right. And we got that room. But then I had to do that stuff with that guy. Right. And you can remember having had to do that stuff with that guy.
[76:09] B: Yeah.
[76:10] A: And some of the grossness about that. Right. You can also remember, you know, getting your hair done.
[76:15] B: Yeah.
[76:16] A: Well, stop them from doing your hair.
[76:18] B: They're not doing my hair.
[76:19] A: Well, then you stop putting on your sneaks.
[76:20] B: I'm not putting on my sneaks.
[76:21] A: Well, then you stop doing it with that guy.
[76:22] B: I'm not doing it.
[76:23] A: We'll stop him from doing those things.
[76:25] B: He's not doing that.
[76:26] A: We'll stop it from happening.
[76:27] B: It's not happening.
[76:27] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[76:29] B: It no longer exists.
[76:30] A: Right, Right. And what do you notice happening?
[76:33] B: I feel good.
[76:34] A: You do? Right. What do you notice happening to the feeling of disgust?
[76:38] B: It's no longer there.
[76:39] A: Right. Because you weren't doing that because you wanted to do that. You were doing that because I needed to make sure I got a room for my kids.
[76:46] B: Yeah.
[76:47] A: Right. Nice.
[76:49] B: Yeah. It wasn't just opening up to a parking lot.
[76:51] A: Right. That actually had a hallway.
[76:52] B: Yeah. And no smoking inside.
[76:55] A: That's right.
[76:58] B: That was nice.
[76:59] A: Right, Right. And again, as you're checking in, what are you noticing?
[77:04] B: I feel happy.
[77:05] A: You do?
[77:06] B: I feel much better.
[77:08] A: I bet.
[77:09] B: Yeah.
[77:09] A: Lots of things are getting lifted and light.
[77:11] B: A lot of things. Yeah.
[77:13] A: So that you're gonna be better. Okay. Yeah.
[77:17] B: Yeah.
[77:18] A: And free.
[77:19] B: And free.
[77:19] A: Yeah. So this guy who we'll call the father of your kids.
[77:27] B: Yeah.
[77:28] A: Who is also, like, trafficker. Who also was transactional.
[77:32] B: Yeah.
[77:33] A: Right. So you would have to do certain things to get certain things from him.
[77:39] B: Yeah.
[77:41] A: Right. So thinking about that, how did you guys get connected work?
[77:47] B: I was actually working a job at Winn Dixie in the Florida Keys.
[77:50] A: Ah, so you were living in the Florida Keys and you were working and he was working there.

[78:29] A: Yeah.
[78:29] B: And then he was like, you want to help me stop my aisle? And I was like, yeah, I'm off work. Why not?
[78:33] A: Yeah.
[78:33] B: We started just talking at work.
[78:35] A: Yeah. And that's how it started. Right. And then what happened?
[78:41] B: We moved in together. In a trailer?
[78:44] A: Yeah.
[78:45] B: Yeah. And we actually had a good couple years. It was nice.
[78:50] A: So you moved in the trailer, both continued to work at Winn Dixie.
[78:54] B: Yeah, I started drinking. That's when my drinking started.
[78:58] A: Okay.
[79:00] B: Because everything was fun. Everything was a party.
[79:03] A: Right.
[79:03] B: So we just partied a lot.
[79:05] A: Right.
[79:06] B: And then we lost the trailer because we partied too much.
[79:09] A: Okay. Didn't pay the bills.
[79:11] B: Yeah.
[79:11] A: Yeah.
[79:12] B: And then we moved up to. Back up to Bradenton with my parents.
[79:16] A: Yeah. He moved in with your parents?
[79:19] B: Yeah.
[79:19] A: And you.
[79:20] B: Yeah.
[79:20] A: They love that.
[79:21] B: Oh, they did that.
[79:22] A: They totally love that. They were so happy to have you and him back.
[79:29] B: They were thrilled. And now. And we lived with them, honestly, we lived in my mom's house for a long time. On and off. We'd move out, but we'd always lose the place.
[79:44] A: Yeah.
[79:45] B: So at 23, I had my son.
[79:47] A: Yeah.
[79:48] B: And we were living in the hood at Bradenton.
[79:52] A: Yeah.
[79:52] B: Yeah. That's whenever the abuse started.
[79:56] A: That's when he became physical.
[79:57] B: Yeah.
[79:58] A: Okay.
[79:59] B: And he would.
[80:00] A: You got a time, huh? You got a time?
[80:03] B: Yeah, he had a time.
[80:05] A: No. You have a time when he was physical?
[80:07] B: Oh, yeah.
[80:08] A: You just thought of it?
[80:09] B: Yeah.
[80:09] A: Oh, yeah. Let's go through that one.
[80:11] B: Okay. He slapped me in the face.
[80:12] A: So you're where at my mom's at this point? So you're at Mom's. Right. And you got a little baby with you?
[80:18] B: No, the baby was in the room.
[80:19] A: So baby was in the bedroom. Right. And it was nighttime. And you guys were talking or drinking?
[80:25] B: I was drinking.
[80:26] A: You were drinking. Right. And he was there.
[80:28] B: Yeah.
[80:29] A: Right. And mom was in bed.
[80:30] B: Yeah, mom and dad were in bed.
[80:31] A: They're in bed. Right. Good.
[80:33] B: Yeah.
[80:33] A: And then what happened?
[80:34] B: I was outside and I started calling him names.
[80:36] A: Right. You're calling him names?
[80:38] B: Yeah, Because I was mad at him. Because he was. I felt like he was flirting with My sister.
[80:41] A: Right. Good. Probably.
[80:43] B: Yeah. So then I start calling him names.
[80:46] A: Right.
[80:46] B: And he hit me in the face.
[80:48] A: Right. So he smacked it.
[80:50] B: He punched me.
[80:50] A: Oh, punched you. Good.
[80:52] B: Good.
[80:52] A: Nice little.
[80:53] B: Yeah, yeah.
[80:55] A: And you're like.
[80:59] B: Honestly? Yes. And I was like, that's all you got? I swear I asked her because I'm drunk.
[81:05] A: Right. And that is.
[81:07] B: Yeah. And then he punched me again.
[81:10] A: Of course. No, not all I got.
[81:12] B: Yeah.
[81:13] A: Right.
[81:14] B: And after that, he was. Then I started crying.
[81:17] A: Right.
[81:17] B: And then he said he was sorry.
[81:19] A: Right.
[81:19] B: And then he apologized over and over again. And he was like, please don't leave me.
[81:23] A: Right.
[81:24] B: And I didn't.
[81:25] A: Right. Well. Right. And that was over.
[81:27] B: Yeah.
[81:27] A: And then later on, you did something more fun.
[81:29] B: Yeah.
[81:30] A: Like actually get clean. Yeah, I got clean for a year.
[81:32] B: For a year.
[81:33] A: Right. Today.
[81:33] B: For the first time in 20 years.
[81:34] A: Yeah. How cool is that?
[81:37] B: That's awesome.
[81:37] A: Right?
[81:38] B: Feels great.
[81:39] A: That's right.
[81:39] B: I went to the circus and you.
[81:41] A: Went to the circus. Right. So I got going to the circus.
[81:43] B: And I'm working on getting my kids back.
[81:45] A: That's right. You are, aren't you?
[81:46] B: Yeah. And without him.
[81:48] A: Well, that's probably a good idea.
[81:50] B: Yeah. Like, I'm doing it a lot.
[81:52] A: Right. You don't actually need him to get your kids back. No, you don't, do you? Right. Isn't that cool?
[81:58] B: That's awesome.
[81:59] A: It's really awesome. I get to do it and you are doing it.
[82:03] B: Yeah.
[82:03] A: Right.
[82:04] B: And it's not like. It's not a problem. I feel like he wouldn't let me.
[82:12] A: Get your kids back.
[82:13] B: Yeah. He kept calling DCFS on me, which is well deserved, honestly. I wasn't in the best place, and I wasn't doing the best things.
[82:22] A: Neither was he.
[82:23] B: Yeah. No, he was not doing the great things.
[82:27] A: Right.
[82:27] B: He was doing horrible things.
[82:29] A: Right. But you can remember him, you know.
[82:32] B: Yeah.
[82:32] A: Punching you, and then you're like.
[82:35] B: Yeah.
[82:35] A: And then punching you again. And then you're calling him names, then being outside and then seeing him flirty with your sister.
[82:41] B: Yeah.
[82:41] A: Right. You can remember all that happened. You can remember putting your sneaks on.
[82:45] B: I'm not putting my snakes on.
[82:46] A: Well, then stop him from doing that.
[82:47] B: He's not doing it.
[82:48] A: Well, then you stop saying that.
[82:49] B: I'm not saying it.
[82:50] A: Well, stop it from happening.
[82:51] B: It's not happening.
[82:52] A: Right, so then where is it? Scott no longer exists. And again, him doing that, was that about you or him?
[82:56] B: It was about him.
[82:57] A: Right. And in that moment, you didn't know how unwell he was at all. No. You Didn't.
[83:04] B: I had no idea right now.
[83:08] A: Right. It was that I'm like, nah, cool. He made a mistake. Right. I was drunk. I probably shouldn't have said the things I said. I, you know, pushed him.
[83:17] B: Yeah, right. Jeez.
[83:20] A: Isn't that weird?
[83:21] B: It is so weird. Weird, weird. The justification.
[83:25] A: Yeah.
[83:27] B: Okay. I have another one.
[83:28] A: Oh, see, there you go. Okay.
[83:32] B: And I got pregnant with my son.
[83:35] A: Third son. Third. So you're aware what happened?
[83:40] B: Yeah. What happened?
[83:42] A: Yeah.
[83:45] B: He got. He gave me ecstasy.
[83:47] A: Right, so he gave you ecstasy. That felt good.
[83:51] B: Yeah. And then he told me I was gonna have sex with him.
[83:54] A: Right.
[83:55] B: And that's why he gave me the ecstasy.
[83:57] A: Right.
[83:57] B: I didn't know he gave me ecstasy.
[83:59] A: Oh, you didn't? No, no, you just like somehow he.
[84:01] B: Put it in my ribble.
[84:03] A: He dropped a pillow.
[84:05] B: He said it was in the Red Bull. Afterward he told me because I was like, I feel really weird and I started throwing up and that's when her. He was going to give me ecstasy.
[84:13] A: Oh, okay. Not a good kind.
[84:15] B: Not a good kind. No, no. And he told me I was gonna have sex with him and I didn't want to.
[84:22] A: Right.
[84:23] B: Still. Because I felt sick.
[84:24] A: Right.
[84:26] B: But he made me do it anyway.
[84:28] A: Right. He said, you're going to anyway.
[84:29] B: Yeah.
[84:30] A: Right. And then he like forced you.
[84:32] B: And then he made me. Well, no, I fell asleep because I kept.
[84:35] A: Well, he was doing it. Yeah, Right. That's how enjoyable it was.
[84:39] B: Exactly. Terrible.
[84:45] A: See, isn't that weird?
[84:46] B: Yeah.
[84:48] A: See, no gal would continue if the guy fell asleep on her. She'd be like.
[84:52] B: But he's just like, that's cool.
[84:54] A: Well, because you know the guy motto.
[84:56] B: Yeah.
[84:56] A: Even a bad blow job is better than no blow job at all.
[85:01] B: Exactly. Yeah.
[85:06] A: I don't need you to be actively involved in order for me to do whatever I need to do.
[85:10] B: Like, I just need to do what I need to do. Precisely.
[85:15] A: Right. So then you're falling asleep. He's doing that. Right. And then what happened next?
[85:21] B: I woke up and I was really sore.
[85:22] A: Right.
[85:24] B: And like two weeks later I found out I was pregnant.
[85:26] A: Oh, lovely.
[85:27] B: Yeah, right. Yeah.
[85:30] A: Right.
[85:30] B: Cuz I kept getting sick and I was like, man, this is like, this is weird.
[85:33] A: This ecstasy is awful. I never do an ecstasy. I know.
[85:37] B: Honestly, I didn't even have the chance to do drugs. I was like, not ecstasy.
[85:41] A: Not doing ecstasy.
[85:42] B: Yeah. I already talked about how great it is. Terrible, terrible. Who does this?
[85:48] A: Somebody sneaks it in your drink. What the.
[85:50] B: A Red Bull at that. Like, what are you trying to do? Give me a heart attack.
[85:53] A: Yeah.
[85:53] B: Wow.
[85:55] A: So as you're thinking about that now, what are you noticing?
[85:58] B: I can laugh about it.
[85:59] A: I know. You told me. Right. About it. And it wasn't troubling.
[86:02] B: Yeah.
[86:03] A: That weird.
[86:05] B: Cuz I'm realizing that it's not me. He didn't touch me.
[86:08] A: Right.
[86:09] B: He touched my body, but not me.
[86:11] A: Right. That's right. He did that stuff to your body. Right. He never got you.
[86:19] B: No.
[86:21] A: Right.
[86:22] B: I mean, he tried to hurt me emotionally, but I feel like.
[86:26] A: Well, he probably did hurt you emotionally, but again, you're not your feelings either.
[86:30] B: Exactly. So what he says is who you.
[86:36] A: Are is the light at the center.
[86:39] B: Mm.
[86:40] A: Right. Right.
[86:43] B: I'm happy.
[86:44] A: Yeah. So think about him and one of those things that he might say that hurt your feelings.
[86:51] B: Say it.
[86:52] A: Try to have your feelings be hurt by it.
[86:54] B: You're a stupid pitch.
[86:55] A: Yeah.
[86:56] B: No, because I'm not.
[86:58] A: Right. Try to get really hurt. Try to like, really feel bad about you. Like somehow. Oh, what he's saying is true about me. I must be a stupid because he said it.
[87:10] B: No.
[87:11] A: Right. You know, he's going, oh, you're a stupid. And you're a. Oh, and you're a could even better. Stupid and a whore. All right, good. So try to. Yeah, Right, Right. Good.
[87:24] B: And a horn.
[87:25] A: And by the way, do you want to have sex with me later?
[87:27] B: Yeah. No.
[87:28] A: Right. It's so weird that you wouldn't want to after I called you a stupid and a that you don't want to be intimate with me. I want to hate you. Right. I would think you totally want to be with me.
[87:37] B: Yeah. That's how it was.
[87:39] A: Yeah. Right. So check it out. Right now, what do you notice?
[87:43] B: I feel fine.
[87:44] A: You do, right? Hey, cuz, he's saying that, you know, you're a stupid or and you're going, I'm rubber, you're glue. Whatever you say, bounce off means to you. But notice how it's not sticking to you.
[88:00] B: Guess it's not my fault.
[88:02] A: Yeah. It's not about you.
[88:03] B: That's him.
[88:04] A: We are not learning about you from him. We're learning about him. And heck, maybe his thoughts. Right.
[88:15] B: Ms. Thoughts are tripling for him.
[88:18] A: He's not. Well, not at all. Right, right. Because just think about the situation. There's your role in there. There's his role. Would you trade?
[88:33] B: No.
[88:33] A: Would you rather add his role than yours?
[88:36] B: No.
[88:37] A: But you know, like, what comes to mind is to slug the gal that you're with. I wouldn't want to force her to be Drugged up so that you can do stuff with her body.
[88:49] B: I wouldn't want to be that.
[88:51] A: No. Right. Or you got to go and get this done with that guy to get us.
[88:59] B: Our rent.
[89:00] A: Right.
[89:04] B: Pay for diapers.
[89:05] A: Right. Just check it out.
[89:07] B: Like he continuously gets me pregnant.
[89:10] A: Uh huh. Well. And he contributed a lot. I mean, during that time that you were out, you know, having to work. He was working hard too. Yeah, right. He wasn't barely working.
[89:23] B: Was working hard.
[89:25] A: That's right. He wasn't working at all.
[89:27] B: He wasn't doing anything.
[89:28] A: No. Right.
[89:33] B: I had to do whatever it took to make sure that our kids are fed.
[89:36] A: That's right.
[89:36] B: Make sure our kids had diapers. That's right. Wipes. Whether it meant beg, steal, sleep with somebody, whatever it took.
[89:45] A: Right.
[89:46] B: Well, he would do things to me and refuse to wear protections. And I ended up pregnant three times, back to back. Which I love my kids, but the way it happened wasn't good.
[90:02] A: Right.
[90:03] B: And it was more stress for me because then I had to be pregnant trying to make the money because a.
[90:10] A: Lot of guys are into, you know, pregnant women.
[90:12] B: Right.
[90:14] A: Too bad we didn't have, you know, all that stuff with the. What is it they call it? Fans only.
[90:20] B: Only fans only fans. Right, right.
[90:23] A: You're just like, take my feet and put them out there.
[90:25] B: I like those people who fart in jars.
[90:27] A: Oh God. Right.
[90:30] B: $5,000 a jar.
[90:31] A: There are some bizarre and unusual people fetishes that are out there, right? There are some there. Yeah. Yeah. Some people are into some different stuff.
[90:42] B: Like farts in a jar.
[90:43] A: Yeah. Nice.
[90:45] B: Yeah. Not my, not my forte.
[90:47] A: No.
[90:48] B: No.
[90:51] A: What do you do with that? You just like wait for it and that one day where you're really gonna open it up and.
[90:56] B: Yeah. Pink eye. Right. Like I don't understand what they're doing with it either.
[91:02] A: But certain people are into certain things.
[91:05] B: Hey, no shame.
[91:06] A: Some people like balloons, you know, whatever.
[91:08] B: Hey, that's. Hey, as long as it's safe.
[91:13] A: It's where we all know what you do in the bedroom might not be what I do in the bed bedroom. What I do in the bedroom might not be what you do in the bedroom. As long as it's consenting adults and we're all on board with what's happening. There's, you know, do whatever you want.
[91:25] B: Exactly. Hey, Consenting adults and it's safe. I'm content with it.
[91:30] A: That's right. Make sure anything that you stick in the hole, number two definitely has things to be able to pull it back out. Cuz Things can get lost in there.
[91:39] B: Oh, man, I can't even imagine. Now I'm pulling things on hole number two.
[91:49] A: You got to make sure you got a base on the bottom to make sure that you're able to pull it back out. Because it could get lost in there.
[91:53] B: It could get lost in there.
[91:55] A: Emergency rooms.
[91:57] B: I know. My mom's a nurse, so she's told me stories.
[92:02] A: Good stuff.
[92:04] B: Terrible stuff.
[92:05] A: Terrible. Terrible, terrible, terrible, horrific. Right. But even think of him now, having done that, what do you notice? Right. Notice how the anger's not there.
[92:17] B: Yeah.
[92:18] A: Right.
[92:19] B: Just relax.
[92:20] A: Right. Think about him and the stuff that he did. Try to get really angry.
[92:30] B: So that's what he gets. Isn't.
[92:32] A: Right. Right. Notice how. Has no energy to it.
[92:37] B: Yeah.
[92:40] A: See, people like to have and encourage others to be angry. Have perks for what they did. But that keeps it alive.
[92:49] B: Yeah.
[92:50] A: Because it's still energy at it.
[92:52] B: I don't want it to be alive.
[92:53] A: Right. That's why you're like, it don't matter. It's got no energy.
[92:59] B: None.
[92:59] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[93:01] B: That is cool.
[93:01] A: Right. And notice how you're becoming more okay in you.
[93:07] B: It's nice.
[93:09] A: Right. And none of the cells in you right now are the same as when you were using. They've all been replaced millions of times.
[93:17] B: Yeah.
[93:18] A: Right. Neuroscience would tell us if you and I were to come back one year from today, 99.9999, meaning almost all of the subatomic particles. Particles that are making you and I up right now.
[93:33] B: Yeah.
[93:33] A: Would no longer be here.
[93:34] B: Oh.
[93:35] A: They don't all leave it once at Star Trek. Beam me up, Scotty.
[93:38] B: Yeah.
[93:39] A: But we're constantly changing. So as you've had a full year, there's no single cell within your body that's the same as it was when you were using.
[93:48] B: That's cool.
[93:49] A: It is cool.
[93:50] B: That's really cool.
[93:51] A: Right.
[93:53] B: I like that.
[93:54] A: Right. You're different than you were then.
[93:58] B: Now whenever people like, have you smoked a cigarette in a year? I'm like, no. Have you smoked. Have you had any sexual partners in a year? No.
[94:03] A: No. Right.
[94:05] B: Have you used any drugs in the last year?
[94:07] A: No. And that's where the cool part is. The question is, never anymore. Do you want a cigarette?
[94:14] B: No.
[94:14] A: No. But that's not the question because it's a different question. The question to somebody at one point in one time, they might say, yes, but the question isn't, do you want a cigarette? It's do you want to be a smoker? That's where you're more clear. Got it?
[94:35] B: Yeah.
[94:36] A: So that's why, when you ever hear the question, do you want one? It's not do I want a, it's do I want to be a smoker?
[94:44] B: Yeah. I guess it's never just one.
[94:46] A: And people don't say things like I can't. So people do that with diet all the time. Like I shouldn't have cheesecake or I can't have the cake.
[94:55] B: Yeah.
[94:56] A: And if I say I can't have it, that means I'm restricting myself from doing it. Right. I can't. Yeah. So I'm withholding it from me. Which of course at some point is going to make me want to.
[95:09] B: Yeah.
[95:10] A: Right. Because I'm withholding it.
[95:11] B: Okay.
[95:12] A: Does that make sense?
[95:13] B: Yeah.
[95:14] A: If I change, I can't to I don't. There's nothing that I'm withholding myself from.
[95:21] B: Just I don't want it.
[95:23] A: Right. So if somebody said to me, do you sm, do you want a cigarette? I would say back to them, I don't smoke.
[95:28] B: Yeah.
[95:29] A: They don't keep asking me, oh no, come on, have one. I don't say, well, I can't smoke. Because then I go, well, why, why can't you smoke? How come you just have one or half.
[95:35] B: Yeah. And they'd be like, why can't you smoke? I'm like, oh, I'm in a program. They're gonna be like, oh, if you just have one.
[95:40] A: Right, right. So I don't smoke, I don't smell. Oh, right. And I use that a lot when I was doing plant based eating. So I did that for a period of time and I still love cheeseburgers. I just said, I just don't eat meat. That didn't feel like I was withholding myself from not being able to have one. I can't have a cheeseburger because I'm a veggie. No. I just don't eat meat. And then I flipped the whole thing around and I stopped eating any plant based stuff and I just ate meat.
[96:06] B: No. Like I just don't eat plants.
[96:09] A: Yeah. I just, only I'm just carnivore. I just. Right. And I didn't feel like I was withholding.
[96:15] B: Okay.
[96:16] A: So when you change it from I can't to I don't. The resistance to it goes away.
[96:24] B: Right, right.
[96:25] A: Yeah. So think about, you know, that X.
[96:31] B: Okay.
[96:31] A: You know that slugger.
[96:34] B: Yeah.
[96:35] A: Right. The different times that you know you gotta go do. Yeah, right. Other times where you know he's gonna do what he wants to with Your body but not wear protection because it was definitely about your pleasure and your enjoyment. I mean, that's why he, you know, didn't wear a condom. Because it's better for you.
[96:56] B: Exactly.
[97:00] A: Heck, the penis wasn't even designed for her pleasure.
[97:04] B: Yeah.
[97:04] A: The penis was designed to make the baby.
[97:06] B: Right.
[97:07] A: She got a body part. Sole purpose sexual pleasure has nothing to do with insertion.
[97:12] B: Yeah.
[97:13] A: Right.
[97:14] B: Facts, right?
[97:15] A: Woman needs man about as much as fish needs bicycle, right? Not at all. Right. So as you check in with that stuff, think about having been out on the street. Think about, you know, the times that you had to stay in your car or stay in the car with them. Or even times that you had to go do the thing with the gross guy to get the, you know, hotel that we actually had hallway. Because I, you know, care about my kids. Feeling safe.
[97:40] B: Yeah.
[97:41] A: Huh. What do you notice?
[97:44] B: Feels okay.
[97:45] A: Think about mom and dad yelling and breaking the table. Think about uncle. Uncle. No, cousin. Just let it happen.
[97:51] B: Yeah.
[97:52] A: No, let's get it on.
[97:55] B: Just let it happen. Oh, my gosh.
[97:58] A: Come on, baby.
[98:00] B: Right? That's horrible. Like, could you imagine? That's. That's the phrase. Just let it happen.
[98:06] A: Yeah.
[98:07] B: Wow. Terrible. What a. What a pickup line.
[98:12] A: That's good one.
[98:13] B: I guess that's what happens when you're 18.
[98:17] A: Yeah.
[98:19] B: I can laugh at it.
[98:20] A: You can, can't you? Notice how it's not hurting?
[98:22] B: Yeah.
[98:23] A: Notice how it's not making you feel bad about you. Right? Yeah.
[98:30] B: It's nice.
[98:31] A: It is nice, right? Yeah. Was that the first sexual thing that ever happened was with him?
[98:36] B: My second.
[98:37] A: Second. What was the first one?
[98:39] B: With the guy I was with four years.
[98:40] A: Oh, but that was on purpose.
[98:42] B: Yeah. That one was nice. I was. Well, not nice.
[98:46] A: But he wasn't nice the first time.
[98:50] B: I mean, it wasn't a horrible situation. It was as good as I feel like the first time can go wasn't trauma. It wasn't traumatizing.
[98:59] A: Yeah. It wasn't that you were forced to have to do it. You were both wanting to.
[99:04] B: Yeah. It was consensual.
[99:06] A: Yeah. And was he in the right age range to have it be really consensual?
[99:10] B: Yeah. Yeah. He was 17. I was 16.
[99:12] A: Okay. So we're perfect. Yeah. That time was okay.
[99:16] B: Yeah. That time was okay, right? Well, actually, no. I broke up with him afterwards.
[99:20] A: Right. Afterwards.
[99:21] B: We were together for four years.
[99:23] A: We were together for four years and finally do that thing, and then you're like, I'm out.
[99:26] B: Yeah. I don't know why. I was like, not my forte oh.
[99:32] A: Because it wasn't very good, was it?
[99:34] B: No.
[99:34] A: It wasn't very enjoyable. No. Because he didn't know how to do it.
[99:38] B: No.
[99:38] A: And you didn't know how to do it. And he thought it was about penis vagina. And it's never about penis vagina for her.
[99:45] B: No.
[99:45] A: That's fine to do afterwards.
[99:47] B: Yeah.
[99:47] A: It's why a buddy of mine when I was in my sexology program, he wrote a book, and it's called she Comes First. Because if she doesn't, then she probably won't. Because if he comes, it's over.
[99:58] B: Yeah.
[99:59] A: Right. And he doesn't take very long. No. So he wrote that book because he had a problem with premature ejaculation.
[100:07] B: Oh, did he?
[100:08] A: Yeah.
[100:09] B: Oh.
[100:09] A: But it took all the pressure of having to last away.
[100:13] B: Oh, that is true.
[100:14] A: When she comes first.
[100:14] B: Yeah.
[100:15] A: Because now it's no longer about him having to last long enough to her to have an orgasm. Because guess what? There's only about 20 of women in the world that are going to have an orgasm just through penis vagina sex. All women will have an orgasm with clitoral stimulation facts. And not all women where it sits is going to get stimulated when it's penis vagina sex.
[100:35] B: Mm.
[100:36] A: So the guy could last forever. And all she's gonna do is be raw, not orgasmic.
[100:43] B: Not at all.
[100:44] A: No. Right.
[100:44] B: Not. Yeah.
[100:46] A: Right. So that's where he came up with she Comes First. Foreplay is how you treat the woman before you get in the bedroom. Core plays. Doing all of the stuff that has her have an orgasm first. Oral, manual use of toy, whatever.
[101:01] B: Yeah.
[101:01] A: And then you can have intercourse.
[101:03] B: Yeah.
[101:04] A: Venus vagina.
[101:06] B: That makes sense.
[101:06] A: Yeah. Works better that way. All right. We open the door for her, Right?
[101:11] B: Yeah.
[101:11] A: Because if it goes the other way around, it doesn't work very well. No, guys. Not long lasting. It's not over.
[101:17] B: Yeah. A minute, man.
[101:19] A: All right. Drag racer. That's what I think of it. In the. In the. In the world of sex, it's. Guys. The drag racer, where you go to 0 to 100 miles an hour as fast as you can, and then the race is over in 100 yards.
[101:29] B: Yeah.
[101:29] A: And a woman is NASCAR.
[101:31] B: Yeah.
[101:32] A: Which the first thing they do is they turn the engine on and they let it sit in idle for a while, and then they slowly follow the pace car around until they start to build up speed.
[101:42] B: Yeah.
[101:42] A: And then finally they build up speed and they're at race speed and the pace car goes off the race. And then 500 freaking laps later, they're done. Right. That's women.
[101:57] B: It is two T. Right, right.
[102:01] A: So if the guy goes, you know, that's where the Austin Powers movies were fun. Because he would say things, you know, he goes to a lot of vaginas. Penthouse. And she says, austin, in my country, men come first and women come second. And he says, or not at all, baby.
[102:14] B: Yeah, Yeah. I love those movies.
[102:19] A: That's right. You're so stupid.
[102:21] B: I know. Oh, my gosh. The thing he ended up being Shrek.
[102:26] A: The whole thing. Right. He's got.
[102:27] B: How did that even happen? How'd he go from Austin Powers to Shrek? It's a real question.
[102:33] A: Austin Power, Shrek, Wayne's World.
[102:37] B: Oh, yeah, Wayne's World.
[102:39] A: Wayne and Garth.
[102:40] B: Yes. I always forget about that one.
[102:42] A: So I married an ax murderer.
[102:44] B: He's in. So I married.
[102:45] A: Oh, my goodness. Yes.
[102:46] B: I haven't seen that.
[102:46] A: Oh, silly, stupid, silly, stupid.
[102:49] B: I love silly, stupid movies like Napoleon Dynamite. I laugh so hard. Yeah. And then I actually watched an assessment, and they were like, I don't know. When does it get funny? And I'm over here crying, laughing. I'm like, it hasn't stopped being funny since it started.
[103:05] A: The whole thing?
[103:06] B: Yeah, the whole thing. From start to finish. I'm laughing.
[103:10] A: Vote for Patron.
[103:11] B: Yeah. Vote for Summer. Vote for Pedro.
[103:17] A: Right, Right. So just check. What are you noticing?
[103:20] B: I feel good.
[103:21] A: You do? Yeah.
[103:23] B: I feel light.
[103:23] A: You do feel light and more present.
[103:26] B: Definitely more present and peaceful.
[103:28] A: Yeah. And that's nice. Yeah, it's cool. So how do you know when to get anxious when something bad's happening? Well, think about, you know, there might be times when you might feel anxious. What do you need to think about? See, envision, imagine to feel some of it.
[103:50] B: Okay.
[103:51] A: Right. And you're thinking about it. And are you feeling it in your body?
[103:54] B: I love it.
[103:55] A: And is it in your stomach? Oh. And then what happens if you notice the sensations and get curious about them and just use the sound of curiosity, Notice how they're changing and go, hmm, go. Right. Or I notice happening as they're changing. Hmm. And what do you notice?
[104:15] B: I almost laugh.
[104:17] A: You almost laughed. Oh, it went away.
[104:19] B: Yeah.
[104:19] A: And you almost laughed.
[104:20] B: Yeah.
[104:21] A: Oh, good. Right. So think about that thing again, whatever it was that you just thought about, that normally when you think about it, you feel anxious. Right.
[104:30] B: Okay.
[104:30] A: And as you're thinking about it now, try to get the feelings.
[104:38] B: Anxiety, rhythm.
[104:39] A: Oh, you got a little bit.
[104:40] B: Not really.
[104:41] A: Oh, you don't even have a little.
[104:42] B: No.
[104:43] A: Isn't that weird?
[104:43] B: That's weird.
[104:45] A: And what was it that you were thinking about?
[104:47] B: The day the father and my children left.
[104:48] A: Yeah. That was good.
[104:50] B: Well, kinda. I still loved him.
[104:52] A: Oh, then yeah. Yeah. That's because you didn't know that he was trafficking you.
[104:56] B: Yeah, I didn't realize.
[104:59] A: And you didn't know that it wasn't okay to get hit. Mean you might have known that. But then you like.
[105:03] B: But it was my fault.
[105:06] A: Do you follow me with that?
[105:07] B: Yeah.
[105:07] A: So when you were in love with him that you didn't know a lot of what you know now, didn't know how unwell he was, didn't know that him and being physical and causing you to do those things and him doing what he wanted to do with your body, that that had everything to do with him. Right. That earlier you thought that if he was having a bad facial expression and slamming things forcefully that meant he was upset at you and you were gonna get. There was gonna be something that would happen. Got it.
[105:41] B: Got it.
[105:43] A: Right. That you didn't know any of that.
[105:45] B: I didn't.
[105:47] A: No. So what happens when you close your eyes and think back to that earlier you, the day that he left. Letting her know that that was a really good thing even though she didn't know it then. Let her know what you know now about how unwell he was and that him doing all that stuff to you was about him, not you, not your worth fault was about him not being well. Let her know how much you value you and therefore value her and are thankful. How she got away even though he left, you got away. Right. Let her know about choosing programming. Let her know about six, 365 days clean. Right. Let her know about dramatically changing the trajectory of her life. That's right.
[106:40] B: I went to the circus.
[106:42] A: Right. And as all of this gets into that earlier, you, what do you notice now?
[106:52] B: I don't feel anxious about it.
[106:53] A: You don't, do you?
[106:54] B: I don't feel emotion about it either.
[106:56] A: No. Right. Because that happening was on the way to you becoming free and peace filled and more content and okay in you. You and lighter and more present. That's right. That's right. It's all getting in. Feels good. It does, doesn't it? Yeah.
[107:35] B: And all this, it's so neat to just be at peace with it and not have to feel anxiety about it.
[107:45] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[107:47] B: It is cool.
[107:48] A: So what's something that you tend to worry about that could or might happen?
[107:52] B: I love that I don't complete the program.
[107:54] A: Uh huh.
[107:55] B: That's really my main worry.
[107:57] A: That's your main worry? That you won't complete the program?
[107:59] B: Yeah, that I'll leave.
[108:00] A: To go where?
[108:01] B: I don't know, back to the streets.
[108:03] A: Just for shits and giggles.
[108:05] B: Yeah. Because I want to use drugs again sometimes.
[108:09] A: Do you really?
[108:09] B: Yeah, sometimes I have that desire.
[108:11] A: Well, no. Right, right. Do you want to be an addict?
[108:15] B: No.
[108:16] A: You got the difference? Yeah. That's what we're talking about. The question isn't do I want to? Because every once in a while, the answer to that might be yes.
[108:24] B: Yeah.
[108:25] A: So the question isn't do I want a cigarette? Because the answer to that might be yes. The question is, do I want to be a smoker?
[108:30] B: I'm not a smoker.
[108:31] A: Do I want to be an addict?
[108:32] B: I'm not an addict.
[108:33] A: Right. What we know is that if you use. I'm just using that one time. So I'm choosing to be an addict. Do you want to be an addict?
[108:43] B: I'm not an addict.
[108:45] A: Right, right. So sometimes you have thoughts abusing, but not actually because you want to use.
[108:52] B: No.
[108:53] A: Right, right. And isn't it common, you know, for sometimes. For somebody to have a thought.
[109:04] B: Yeah.
[109:05] A: Right. Of wanting to.
[109:06] B: Yeah.
[109:07] A: Right. But not because they actually want to. No, because that's what's been conditioned.
[109:12] B: Yeah. So my brain just.
[109:15] A: Well, it's just been conditioned.
[109:17] B: Yeah.
[109:19] A: Right. What are all the other conditioning we can be doing to your brain?
[109:23] B: Coping skills.
[109:25] A: Yeah. Already getting that. You know, you're a year sober, and that's without healing emotional wounds. Right. Because one of the things that triggers us is the unhealed emotional wounds. And the trigger is I'm feeling ways I don't want to feel and I don't know how to not feel. Feel that way. If I used, I'd stop feeling.
[109:51] B: Yeah.
[109:53] A: Got it.
[109:54] B: Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
[109:56] A: So now check it out. Try to think about one of those things that normally when you thought about it, you'd feel really, really bad and not know how to not feel bad. So then the thought would be, well, you know, if I used it, stop feeling bad.
[110:09] B: Yeah.
[110:11] A: What do you notice?
[110:12] B: I lost my kids.
[110:14] A: You did lose your kids.
[110:17] B: I feel guilty and shameful.
[110:19] A: No. For having lost them. But isn't that what you needed?
[110:24] B: Yeah, but I can't even talk to them.
[110:28] A: Not yet. Do you know why?
[110:30] B: Yeah.
[110:31] A: Why?
[110:32] B: Because I was driving drunk with them.
[110:34] A: Oh, well, no, that's not why. That's not why you can't talk to them yet.
[110:42] B: Well, that's why there's no contact order.
[110:45] A: Right. That's A part of it. But that's not why you can't talk to them yet.
[110:49] B: Yeah.
[110:49] A: Do you know why you can't talk to them yet? No.
[110:53] B: Because the courts haven't lifted the no contact order.
[110:55] A: They haven't experienced how different and better you are.
[111:01] B: Yeah.
[111:03] A: Right. Because out of that and finally losing them, what did that have you do, get better? Not right at first, though. No.
[111:15] B: At first I was.
[111:16] A: Got worse.
[111:17] B: Way worse.
[111:18] A: Way, way worse.
[111:19] B: Because way, way worse.
[111:20] A: Not only did I not have my kids, I was still out using.
[111:24] B: Yeah.
[111:25] A: Right. And I was feeling shitty that I lost my kids. That made it worse.
[111:28] B: Yeah.
[111:29] A: Right. And then something happened.
[111:34] B: I got incarcerated.
[111:35] A: You did, didn't you?
[111:36] B: I did.
[111:37] A: And then helped you stop using?
[111:39] B: Yeah, I did.
[111:41] A: And then while you were incarcerated, I got clean. You did. And then got introduced to Selah. You did? I did.
[111:51] B: And now I have a program that's helped me.
[111:53] A: And in getting introduced to Selah, you saw it as an opportunity.
[111:57] B: Yeah.
[111:58] A: For you. To change your life for the better. Maybe even stuff with Tyler.
[112:02] B: Yeah.
[112:02] A: Maybe even a way to possibly get my kids back.
[112:05] B: Yeah.
[112:05] A: Right. And since you've been at Salah, there have been changes.
[112:09] B: Yeah.
[112:10] A: With what's happening with your kids.
[112:12] B: Yeah.
[112:13] A: Right, right, right. Because what were they doing and what are they waiting for now?
[112:19] B: They're just waiting for my next court date.
[112:21] A: Right. But what were they intending?
[112:24] B: What were they intending?
[112:25] A: Yeah.
[112:26] B: I mean, before Tyler.
[112:28] A: Right.
[112:29] B: Never to talk to them. Like they were gonna do adoption.
[112:32] A: Right. They were giving up parental rights and you were not gonna have contact.
[112:36] B: Yeah.
[112:36] A: Right. Now what do we have?
[112:37] B: Options for reunification? Isn't that exciting?
[112:44] A: Isn't that exciting?
[112:45] B: It is so exciting.
[112:47] A: Right?
[112:47] B: Yeah.
[112:48] A: Right. And what's more exciting is a U that's more and more emotionally. Okay. That's more and more at peace and comfortable in your own skin. That's lighter. Got it.
[113:03] B: Got it.
[113:04] A: Because it wouldn't have been good enough, right. To just get out of jail.
[113:12] B: Because I wouldn't have been doing anything good with my life.
[113:15] A: Right. Because the wounds continued to reactivate. Right. So what you didn't know in getting arrested for driving drunk with your kids and then losing your kids, which was an awful moment that sent you into an awfuler time that got you incarcerated for 10 months. For 10 months that helped you get clean, that opened up your eyes to an opportunity to change your life for the better that you stepped into, that opened up the possibility to reunify with your kids. So the you that lost the kids.
[114:03] B: Yeah.
[114:03] A: Doesn't know all of this no. Right.
[114:09] B: So we can tell her.
[114:10] A: Yeah. Close your eyes and let her know what you know. Now that that happening, although that was awful and she's felt bad that it did, is the thing that sent her down, that got her incarcerated, that got her clean, that got her the opportunity to be a clean and sober and well and healed mom for them to reunify with. That's right. Because it was not out of a lack of love for them. Is that she was screwed up with using it. Right. Right. So that she's getting it and how much better at you. That's healing and clean and sober for your four kids. How much better is it for them? Right.
[115:30] B: Feels good.
[115:31] A: It does feel good, doesn't it?
[115:32] B: It feels so good.
[115:33] A: Yeah. Notice how it's different.
[115:38] B: I don't feel guilty.
[115:40] A: You don't, do you? No.
[115:45] B: Because if I didn't go to jail, I wouldn't be where I'm at today.
[115:48] A: That's right.
[115:48] B: If I didn't lose them, I wouldn't have learned.
[115:51] A: That's right.
[115:52] B: I wouldn't be better. I wouldn't have a year clean.
[115:54] A: Yeah. That's right.
[115:56] B: I wouldn't have gone to the circus.
[115:58] A: No.
[115:58] B: I wouldn't have made my mom proud.
[116:00] A: No. And I wouldn't have been no longer troubled by the fucked up shit that I had to do.
[116:05] B: I wouldn't be getting help with you.
[116:07] A: All of that stuff. Right, right, right.
[116:14] B: Yeah. Feels nice.
[116:17] A: I bet.
[116:20] B: So much guilt and just shame gone.
[116:22] A: Yeah. Right. Because they're not better off with you having it.
[116:28] B: Yeah.
[116:28] A: Because having it doesn't make you a better mom. It makes you a worse mom.
[116:32] B: Exactly. When I had so much guilt and shame, especially after I had my daughter.
[116:37] A: Yeah. Is she number four?
[116:39] B: Yeah.
[116:40] A: Yeah.
[116:42] B: She's the boss.
[116:43] A: Of course she's the boss. Yes.
[116:48] B: Yeah.
[116:49] A: Yeah. Right. So they're getting an opportunity to have a parent who's clean, sober and healthy. Mentally healthy. Right. Isn't that cool?
[117:07] B: That is so cool. Because that's something I didn't even have.
[117:10] A: Right, Right. That's awesome. Mm.
[117:18] B: Say, that's really helping me a lot. So it's like I don't even know why I have that fear of leaving.
[117:23] A: Well, just check it out right now.
[117:24] B: Yeah. I don't really have that fear.
[117:29] A: Right. The fear wasn't there because you were scared of leaving.
[117:33] B: Yeah.
[117:33] A: The fear was there because leaving would be bad because it gets in the way of me having what I want.
[117:41] B: Yeah.
[117:43] A: Right, Right. So the angst was, I don't want to do something that prevents me from Having what I want. And sometimes I have thoughts of doing it.
[117:54] B: Yeah.
[117:55] A: Because I had ways that I'm feeling that I don't know how to not feel. Feel. And my brain was used to bringing this thing to my awareness to do to stop me from feeling.
[118:04] B: Yeah. I don't have that.
[118:08] A: You don't, do you?
[118:09] B: No.
[118:09] A: Notice how that's different?
[118:11] B: That is different.
[118:12] A: And better.
[118:13] B: Way better.
[118:14] A: Way better.
[118:15] B: Way better.
[118:19] A: Right. Because they get a way better mom.
[118:21] B: They do. They get a happy mom.
[118:23] A: They do.
[118:24] B: Mm. A mom that doesn't have to do random things like sleep with men.

[118:30] A: Right. Or, you know, blow jobs or whatever.
[118:33] B: Yeah, exactly.
[118:34] A: She doesn't have to do any of those things. Right, right, right. Very true. Right. And you're creating a new network of support around you. Right. A whole team with other, say less survivors, with advocates, with mentors, volunteers, with people.
[119:00] B: Yeah. I have a sponsor and a sponsor. Right.
[119:04] A: How cool is that?

[119:56] B: Right, Right.
[119:58] A: Which is beyond budgeting.
[120:03] B: Because you don't want to rob Peter no more to pay Paul.
[120:05] A: No. Right.
[120:08] B: That's. Robbing Peter was not fun.
[120:09] A: No. Well, that puts us in a bad situation all the time.
[120:12] B: All the time.
[120:13] A: All the time.
[120:13] B: All the time.
[120:15] A: Because we're one thing away from crisis every time. See, that's the issue with the paycheck to paycheck world is I'm one crisis away from losing it all.
