[00:00] A: Okay, so today is the second, I think, of April. Pretty sure it's Good Friday. I don't know why they call it that, but they do. Anyway, Trish, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful and may be made available in teaching and training professionals and how to do this kind of stuff, I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:22] B: Yes.
[00:22] A: All right, cool. Well first, the last time I saw you, you were headed to go steal pay tribute to dad.
[00:30] B: Yes.
[00:31] A: You, I'm imagining, did that already and it was probably a while ago.
[00:35] B: Yeah.
[00:36] A: Okay.
[00:38] B: That was February.
[00:39] A: How was all of that for you?
[00:40] B: It was good.
[00:41] A: Yeah?
[00:42] B: Yeah.
[00:43] A: You feel like you got any kind of like closure, completion, connection, peace?
[00:49] B: Yeah.
[00:50] A: Any of the other things that you would be wanting?
[00:52] B: Oh my gosh. Peace.
[00:53] A: Okay, good.
[00:55] B: And three baby cows came right up to me.
[00:58] A: Wow.
[00:58] B: Yeah. Because he crash into like a pasture.
[01:01] A: Yeah.
[01:02] B: And the farmer let my family put a big cross there. So I just went there and I was eating lunch, my back to the cross, and these three little tiny cows came right up to the fence. It was so cute.
[01:13] A: That's cool.
[01:14] B: Yeah, it was cool.
[01:16] A: Awesome. Yeah. So that happened. Then you went back. You're in what with programming now.
[01:26] B: I'm in. What phase am I in? I'm in action.
[01:31] A: You're in action. Woohoo.
[01:32] B: Action. Two.
[01:33] A: Two.
[01:34] B: The last one in the house.
[01:35] A: The sequel of Action.
[01:36] B: Yeah.
[01:37] A: Yes. Right. Is the sequel as good as the original? That's what they always try to figure out.
[01:42] B: No, sometimes it's not. No, it's not. The first one was a little bit lighter than this one.
[01:50] A: Okay.
[01:50] B: There's a lot going on.
[01:51] A: Oh, there is, yeah.
[01:54] B: Yep, I got it.
[01:55] A: Because you need to be in action too.
[01:58] B: Do I?
[01:59] A: Well, that's why you're in action too.
[02:01] B: Yeah, I'm in it right in the middle of it.
[02:04] A: Okay, so what would be useful for me to know? What do we want our time together today to be doing for you?
[02:12] B: So I'm pretty sure that we were scheduled today because we are in the midst.
[02:17] A: It doesn't matter what we were scheduled for. It's really more about what's actually going on now.
[02:23] B: Oh, there's so much going on, Dr. Q.
[02:28] A: Okay. All really good stuff, I can tell.
[02:31] B: Yeah, it is. It's okay. So the first thing that came up for me last weekend, which has been like the biggest thing I think that's come up for me, but I did sort through it a little bit myself, but I'm still, like, the point system in the program. Really irks me. Like, it irks me. It irks me so bad because I love first. I lost my first point, the first one. I know the first one.
[03:15] A: Thank goodness. Now you're like the rest.
[03:18] B: Yeah, I know now. Now I'm not different. No. But my motivation, like, behind a lot of the things that I do has been, like, because I know that, for one, I have a choice. I'm either gonna do it or I'm not gonna do it, and I'm gonna lose a point and whatever. But I know that losing a point could potentially keep you in a phase for two weeks longer, which ultimately adds two more weeks on to the program. And I don't want to stay two weeks longer. I want to go home and be with my family. So I. I lost a point last weekend, and I was like, for one, I was given a choice. How am I gonna deal with this, or do I even have to deal with it? Yeah. And I mean, I played it through, and they didn't take an arm or a leg or my life or anything like that. It's just a point. And it's the first point that I've lost throughout the entire program. And it's really not that big of a deal.
[04:44] A: Except you're the straight A student who always gets straight A's, and you came in with a. Not a straight A.
[04:49] B: No, I've never been a straight A student.
[04:51] A: No, actually, in this, you are the straight A student. See, that's the funny part. How it's operating in you is like, how it operates in a straight A student. That it's not okay to not have an A. Like, I'm not okay. Like. Like I had it all, like, perfect, and then.
[05:12] B: I don't know.
[05:14] A: No. You don't think so?
[05:16] B: No, I think that. That would. That would be. I don't know. I don't speak very highly of myself or put myself anywhere where I need to be.
[05:28] A: Okay, so why was it other than I want to leave at the earliest opportunity I can after completion of things?
[05:36] B: I think it's a prison thing.
[05:40] A: We love fucking prison things.
[05:43] B: Yeah, but that's how it makes me feel, because they have a point system in prison, too.
[05:48] A: Not the same one.
[05:49] B: No. They only take two days. They only add two days onto your sentence if you get in trouble. This is two weeks.
[05:57] A: Yes, but you had a. How long of a sentence?
[06:00] B: Ten years.
[06:01] A: Right?
[06:04] B: Yeah, I know.
[06:04] A: To add two days to that is, like, nothing.
[06:07] B: Right. To add two weeks to that is Nothing.
[06:10] A: Yes.
[06:11] B: But for some reason, it's like, now that I'm out of prison and I'm like, I'm living a semi normal life even. You know, I know I'm in a program, but it's still, like, as normal to normal.
[06:28] A: Well, way more normal than present.
[06:29] B: Yeah. As I could get. But it's. I don't. I don't want to make decisions or choices that's gonna hold me two weeks longer away from. You know, I still haven't met my nephew, and he was born in January. And like, these are all things that I been through over and over again in prison. Not. I have six nieces and nephews that I'm like, this is the first year that I'm being able to spend their birthdays with them. And the oldest one has just turned 10. And so I just want to be able to be in a position or a place in my life where I can. My sister just had a baby, so I can go up there and meet this baby or hang out with my family on my off time. That sometimes doesn't happen on Tuesdays, Saturdays, or Sundays. And those are our past days in the program. So that's what the point system does for me.
[07:42] A: Okay.
[07:43] B: And that's why it's been important for me to just, you know, reach expectations and do what I'm supposed to do.
[07:54] A: Maybe there's a learning lesson.
[07:56] B: Yeah, well, what could it be?
[07:58] A: I'm open for feedback how to deal with having a plan. And monkey wrenches get thrown in the plan. You know, it's like somebody goes on a diet, and they're on the diet and then they're out, and somebody offers them a cookie and they don't really feel like they can refuse it, so they have it. Then I go, well, because I already have the cookie, I'm already off the diet. Might as well just have another one or another one. Or I can have soda. Right. They totally go off rails. Right? But if you have a cookie and then you don't do anything else, are you really screwing up a diet? I mean, I get it for that, like, moment, but, like, you're still on track.
[08:46] B: Yeah. And I. I process this with the advocates because I know that it's like two weeks longer. I wouldn't get anything bad out of it. You know, it's not gonna be anything detrimental to the rest of my life. It's like, not like those are the last two weeks of my life or anything, but it still. It still bothers me.
[09:10] A: And only bothers you because you have to stay longer.
[09:12] B: No, I mean, I'll do it if I have to, but that's the thing. Like, I'm so sick and tired of just doing things that I have to do because I have to. Like, when can I set the standards for myself? Can I not? Can I not? Because I lost a point now. Can I not?
[09:33] A: Part of the problem is thinking that they're all things that I have to do.
[09:39] B: Yeah, I know.
[09:43] A: Remember, you don't actually have to do them. You're doing them because you don't like the consequences that come along with not doing them. There are multitudes of people that have come through programming that, you know, left. I know, but because they didn't have to, it's not an option for you. It is an option that you don't like just because there's liver on the menu, which I'm clearly not going to eat ever. Right? It's still an option on the menu. Yeah, but it's not an option for me, so I'm. No, it doesn't. It's still a fucking option on the menu.
[10:40] B: Yeah. Okay, so it's an option, but it's not desirable. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's not gonna be the option that I choose. Like, I'm going to stay. I'm staying. I'm here for the follow through. Like, so if it's two weeks longer, it's two weeks longer. But I still, like, I hate that thought.
[11:03] A: That is two weeks longer.
[11:05] B: Yes.
[11:08] A: Okay, well, how do you want to be about it? I mean. Cause we get that you hate it, but how do you actually want to be about it?
[11:22] B: I don't know.
[11:26] A: Like, if you weren't hating it and if it wasn't so, like, to you.
[11:32] B: I mean, do I want to be okay about it being like, just add more. Add two more?
[11:39] A: Well, that's not what I'm saying. That would be the opposite. Okay, you know what? I hope I can stay fucking for as long as I can. What else can I fuck up to make sure I stay even longer? Right? Like, that's not what I'm saying. Right. I think that we're stuck at time. Yeah, Right. Versus moments. Right. The two weeks in 10 years with that, you know, little nephew that got born. Well, you know, you could have been here two weeks earlier, but.
[12:19] B: He probably should have been born two weeks earlier.
[12:21] A: Right. Like. Like, what the hell? Like, he didn't show up because you. Right, so time gets condensed, Right. When you've been at something for a long time. Right. The longer I'm at it, the farther I feel away from the end. So if I'm in a car ride and I'm two thirds of the way there, that's when I start feeling, are we ever gonna get there? Like, I don't feel that in the first hour. Even though it's like, are we ever gonna. Like, I got eight more to go. Right. So this has parallels to having been in jail. Even though you and I both know it's very different than jail, right? So, but there are parallels. Like I have people that I have to be accountable to. There's people that are monitoring me and watching stuff that I do and having conversations with me about it or writing things down or. Right. Like, so, like there's some of that, that's got some parallels, right, but it's not the same. So we want to unplug the similar, same aspect of this. Not that, hey, that means I want more, but that it's okay if I get more. No, that I got what I got. Right, because you're gonna be doing your darndest to make sure that that doesn't happen. But the problem is systems. So I don't know how much I've talked to you about this, but I want to kind of give you an idea. Our conscious mind, so our intellectual mind part that we think of typically as I me is very logical and linear. So it goes well, I do this thing and then I do this thing and then I do this thing and then I do this thing and then I do this thing and then I'm at the right. So it's a very much of a step by step. A goes to B goes to C. Right, that kind of linear fashion. And that part of our brain loves linear and it loves to try to predict future. The rest of our brain is good with non linear. So non linearity would be things like the weather, the stock market. Right. Past prediction cannot indicate future. Whatever. We can know where the hurricane is. We don't know where it's going. I could give you the weather report on Monday that on Friday it was supposed to be right now, rainy and cold. And we could open up and go, wow, really clear. So it's non linear and with future. So the farther I'm away from right now, the less accurate my predictions are. Right. Like so you and I could predict, okay, what do you think the weather is going to be like five minutes from now? And you'd look outside and you go pretty much like this. And you'd probably be right, right, but we can't be so right 50 minutes from now or even five hours or five weeks, right? The accuracy goes out the window the farther we go away. So there's a problem with the world that we live in. And the problem with the world that we live in is we have an intellectual brain that sets a timeline, that sets the table, that sees what I need to do, that knows, here's the step, step, step, step. And as long as I do these things, I'm gonna get to where I'm gonna be and that's how it's gonna work.
[16:41] B: That's how science predicts the universe.
[16:45] A: Well, science also predicts the universe by talking about chaos theory, nonlinearity, right? Somebody asked me a question one time. They go, if there's a plane flying from Arizona to Atlanta, what percentage of the time is the nose of the plane pointed at Atlanta? I don't know. I know nothing about aviation. I sit in the thing and they fly. I go, nothing, right? And I go, I don't know, maybe like 70% of the time they look at me like, no, it's totally wrong. Was it more? No, they go, it's 2% of the time, like, how the fuck does the plane get there? Right? And then they explained it to me. They go, okay, well, a plane is going around the earth like so it's a curved. So clearly can't be going in a straight line. It's dealing with the weather, tailwinds, trade winds, different things. Even the radio tower that they predict they're going to be near. And they give the coordinates of what they think they're going to be at as they go. They're never exactly where they said they were going to be. Crazy, right? Like that's crazy. The time that the plane is pointed most at Atlanta is when it's headed down at the Runway. And even then it's. So if only 2% of the time they get there, they're planning for all the non linearities. So we have a wider range of getting to the goal versus a tightrope. If I have to go A to B to C to D, that's one road, single lane road. Well, if somebody's coming the other way, what do I have to do? Stop, pull over. They get through. Like you can't move real quick on that, right? On an interstate, seven lanes, we can get past things faster, right? So you have in your mind a mental model of, okay, so I'm getting out of jail, I'm going into this program. This program lasts this amount of time. They have these things. I know about this, okay? So I'll be done. And here's my done programming date. Right. Because that's linear. Right. So I do this and then this and then this and then this. And then you get in this thing. You're like, okay, well that's different. But I'm going to continue to plug along and do the things right. And then something happens. Like what happened? How'd you lose a point?
[19:21] B: Are you asking? Because you want to know?
[19:23] A: I'm just curious. I don't care.
[19:24] B: But I swept the hell out of this porch. But this tree keeps dropping its leaves and it sticks on the ground. And so come Sunday night when chores are checked at 9pm There was like a couple sticks and a couple leaves on the ground and a flipped over beetle. So I lost a point. That is not awesome. Because two weeks ago, you know what's.
[19:56] A: So awesome about that is like, that is like the small thing for you to have that happen. Because I'm the one that gets it done. And I do. So beautiful. It's beautiful because what does it bring up? Let me just get you the last part of the thing. There's a saying in life that says how you do anything is how you do everything. Right.
[20:24] B: Yeah, that's my saying.
[20:25] A: Great. What's the likelihood in life that things are going to go exactly as you planned?
[20:31] B: Well, not likely at all ever.
[20:33] A: Right. So wouldn't it be useful. Yeah. To go through some experiences where things don't go as planned and you have to learn how to be a Marine.
[20:44] B: Yeah. But look at the span of my life and overcome. That's all I've ever done, is adapt and overcome. And do I think it's gonna change or stop? No. No, I don't. I know that there are gonna be all these things in life that are just gonna be like, okay, I know that that's gonna happen. But being in a program that like I believe in and then something like that happening and then taking a point for that, for the tree dropping its leaves and. And I lose a point which is potentially two weeks longer in space. No, I mean I'm not.
[21:29] A: Potentially.
[21:30] B: No, I don't.
[21:31] A: I.
[21:32] B: Yes, this is how the points work. Okay, I'm gonna tell you how the point.
[21:36] A: Let's go ahead and have a lot of worry about it before it ever happens.
[21:40] B: Well, because the point system works to my knowledge, this is how it works. If you're which in action phase, the phase update lands on an advocate meeting. So if you lose one point, it adds one day. And if that one day goes past the advocate meeting, you have to wait two weeks until the next Advocate meeting. Okay. So my day is lined up perfectly on the advocate meeting day. So one point puts me one day past the advocate meeting, which means I have to wait two whole weeks until the next Advocates meeting. So I give myself hope that maybe it's not a possibility. But I'm pretty sure that my calculations are on point and I'll be in this phase for two weeks longer.
[22:39] A: What's it like being on a tightrope all the time? Wobbling? Yeah.
[22:46] B: A little thrilling sometimes.
[22:47] A: Can't take a misstep.
[22:50] B: No. I mean you could, but you better be quick and grab onto the line before you drop.
[22:57] A: Right. But you're kind of like on that.
[22:59] B: Yeah.
[23:00] A: To finish.
[23:00] B: I feel like I've been on it. I've never got off of it from the last tightrope. I was walking in prison to get all my time there too, so. So that I could go home.
[23:14] A: Well, this isn't about giving all your time.
[23:16] B: No, but it feels like it.
[23:18] A: What if it didn't?
[23:19] B: What if? That's what I've been saying.
[23:22] A: What if it didn't?
[23:23] B: What if it didn't?
[23:24] A: Right. If it didn't feel that way, how would you actually be?
[23:29] B: I don't know.
[23:30] A: You don't know?
[23:31] B: No. I've been walking this road for nine years.
[23:34] A: How might you be if you were no longer walking the rope and it no longer felt like this whole time thing and no longer was doing that to you? Like how would you actually be?
[23:48] B: I don't know. Time freaks me out.
[23:52] A: Time's a distortion. I know.
[23:57] B: I mean, I know.
[23:59] A: So we really don't like listening to the Pink Floyd song.
[24:05] B: No.
[24:06] A: All the clocks ringing?
[24:08] B: No. Time freaks me out.
[24:10] A: How so?
[24:11] B: Because I lost so much of it Or I just gave away so much of it. Eight and a half years like that and now here I am.
[24:23] A: And I'm still putting your time in.
[24:26] B: Yeah.
[24:26] A: Uh huh.
[24:29] B: Yep. And I want to do my best and be my best.
[24:33] A: Because you don't want to lose any more time?
[24:35] B: No.
[24:38] A: Okay.
[24:42] B: I lost a lot.
[24:44] A: Did you know that time is only a man made concept?
[24:50] B: Yeah. But even if it wasn't made, it's still flying by. Even if there was no time, I.
[24:56] A: Don'T think it would be flying by. I mean, the dog has it better than you. Cause you leave and say, I'll be back in an hour. And then stuff happens while you're out and you wind up staying out for three hours. Your dog's not looking at you like Trish. What the fuck? Where the hell were you? No respect. Like you told me, an hour like this. Bullshit. I did bite the end of the couch there. And I shit over there too. So. Hey, like me now. But you know, like, dog doesn't have that relationship. Right? The rest of our body doesn't have a relationship to time. It's a left hemisphere. Do you know that time can go by fast, but time can also go by slow? I'm sure you do.
[25:52] B: Yeah. That's what happened in prison.
[25:54] A: Oh. Time went by slow and fast. And fast. Like with kids. The days are slow, the years are fast. So the same goes.
[26:09] B: Yeah.
[26:10] A: Yeah. Are we ever gonna get them out of diapers?
[26:16] B: Yeah.
[26:18] A: Remember when they used to be nightmares? Okay, so you don't want to lose any more time. Time has become a very precious commodity. Because you burned up time in prison.
[26:37] B: Well, yeah, but I also. I lost a lot of people.
[26:46] A: Like people who died?
[26:48] B: Yeah.
[26:49] A: Not like they are in the woods and you haven't found them yet. Well, I had that one that I was walking with and then they walked away and I haven't seen them since. Totally lost them.
[26:59] B: No, not like that.
[27:00] A: Okay, good.
[27:01] B: And it's not like I think everybody's gonna die around me, but it's just that I wanna be able to just spend time with the people that I still have.
[27:15] A: So maybe we want to gain access to moments. Yeah. Do you know that a lifetime can happen in a moment?
[27:23] B: Yeah, it has.
[27:25] A: Do you know that moments are timeless?
[27:28] B: No.
[27:30] A: Oh. See, when I'm in a moment timeless, there have been experiences that I've been in connection with somebody. We might be doing different things, whether it be in this kind of setting or other settings. And time goes by. The moment is there, and I'm lost in that moment. Fully present and engaged in the moment. Something might jar my attention. I might look at, oh, my goodness, what happened to the time? So maybe we want to be considering that you want to have lots of moments with the people that matter to you versus they need to have more time. Right. Because you want to actually be present, connected and engaged while you're with them. There's a lot of people who have a lot of time with people that don't actually ever connect.
[28:31] B: Yeah, I know. I've been there too.
[28:33] A: I'm sure you have. We all have. Right. So if it wasn't so troubling and you had more ease and knowing that there's an infinite amount of moments that you get to be having with the things and the people that matter to you, and what you're getting, which is really, really cool, you already have a lot of it, is that the commodity that becomes more valuable as we get older is time. Going back to those sayings because we like them today, people have a saying that, you know, when you're young, you'll spend time to save money. Our first house, my wife and I, we painted the entirety of the house, had friends over and helped. We stained all the furniture. Right. We're young, we quote, unquote, had the time. When we moved into our house that we're currently in, we had a newborn and a four year old, five year old, four year old. And I was working a lot. We had somebody come and move us, like to the point that they put shrink wrap around the dresser and left our clothes in it and picked it up and brought it to the new place. That's nice, right? Like that was how, like they packed up the night before and they left our bed unpacked, our couch unpacked and the TV so that we could. And then they brought it all there and it was right. So like I didn't do any of it because there was no right. So you'll spend money on the back end to save time. Right. We want you to be having the fluidity to expand and shrink time. So the time that you're at sale, it feels like a blip. Really helpful, useful on the way to me being a better version of me so that I have more of it and can connect in the moments to the things and the people that matter to me. Yeah. So what's happening now?
[31:04] B: I was just thinking, I don't know.
[31:12] A: Well, my question is, would that be okay? Yeah, it would be.
[31:20] B: It would be.
[31:21] A: Yeah. Right. And you don't have to be concerned with how it's going to happen. It's about that it's okay. Because the other unconscious part of your brain can organize in ways to support you. Right, right. And what's the thing that's going on in you right now?
[31:50] B: Nothing really.
[31:51] A: Nothing really?
[31:52] B: Yeah.
[31:55] A: Do you know how to change your state? Like there's a really cool thing. Guy by the name of Andrew Huberman. He's a neuroscientist at Stanford. He's got a fear lab. He discovered with other people the, what they call the psi breath. It's a deep breath in and then at the top of the breath, a quick breath in and then a longer exhale. It's kind of cool.
[32:23] B: What does that mean?
[32:24] A: What does it mean? So what, what we know, neurophysiol in our neurophysiological body that when you do that, it starts to settle. It's an activation of our phrenic nerve, which begins to calm and settle the body. That cool. So you breathe in.
[32:53] B: So does it reset naturally if you do it yourself?
[32:56] A: Yes. So here's the thing that we've learned. When we're in a state of anxiety and our mind is racing and we're having a lot of thoughts, and we're trying to talk ourselves out of having thoughts that we're having, and we're in our head, it's never gonna work. We can't get it out from staying in it. So what do we have to do? We have to change it at a physiological level. First thing that we can do to change physiology is to change our breathing. But these are neuroscientifically proven, meaning they've had, like, scans going on in the brain. They're watching what's happening. Animals naturally do it. People naturally do it after being really startled. So with his fear lab, he would watch people. Right. He'd put VR glasses on. What's your big fear? Oh, I'm afraid of spiders. Okay. Clint. Spiders would be crawling, right? Like, there'd be that kind of.
[33:51] B: That's terrible.
[33:52] A: Terrifying, right? You're afraid of sharks. Okay, cool. We got an underwater one. We'll put you in this cage, and you open up, and then there's the shark, and it's coming at you, so you can really have the. Right. And it's virtual reality, so it looks real.
[34:03] B: Is that a form of therapy?
[34:06] A: This was just research exposing you, right? Some of it. There is a form of therapy called exposure therapy. I don't particularly buy into it. It's not my favorite mode to do that. I don't think that to get people better, you need to have them more in the problem. You need to more get it clear that they're no longer in that problem. Yeah, right. Oh, by the way, do you know what you haven't included in this whole time thing? That you got out early. Right. F, man. You've got extra time now because you actually got out early. You were supposed to be there longer. See, that's the cool thing. I know you haven't included that at all.
[34:44] B: Well, I was thinking that, but then we got to the tightrope analogy, and I was like, well, I've been walking on this tightrope.
[34:54] A: Yes, but what you haven't included is that you actually got it early, so you got more time.
[34:58] B: My calves hurt.
[34:59] A: Right. That's why we want More range.
[35:02] B: Yeah.
[35:03] A: Because you know what the fastest way from point A to point B in a nonlinear system is not a straight line. That's the slowest way. I'm going to give you the neuroscience research. Maybe I've shared this with you before, but we are made up of a lot of atoms. And in atoms there are electrons. And electrons are not things that go step by step by step. We can't observe an electron in the wild because our observation, because we're so big, changes, it disappears. So a researcher in London who wanted to find out what does the electron do? Where does it go? Couldn't figure it out. Watched a children's show. Guy had a cylinder filled with glycerin, dropped a droplet of dye into the cylinder, rolled the cylinder forward, the die dispersed, disappeared, gone. Huh. Cool. Now, here's the parlor trick. He began to spin the cylinder in reverse, and the die began to form back. But where it formed back as a full droplet was not in the same place he dropped it. It was somewhere else in the cylinder. He did it again. It disappeared, came back in another place, and David Bohm went, boom. That's what the electron does. The electron takes leaps. So what we know about change, what we know about all sorts of growth, is that what we do is we take the step that's in front of us and see what we know that you've done a really good job of, is I'm going to do the thing that's right in front of me. Right. Like, if I want to get to the top of the mountain, it's very unmotivating to continue to look at how far I still have left to go. That is an unmotivating. Holy fucking shit. Right. Instead, I want to focus on the step that's in front of me and then take that one and then the next step that's in front. Right. And that's what we do in navigating the path. Well, in life, we take small steps. Small steps. Lee Iacocca, biggest disaster in automotive history. Do you know what it was? Ford Pinto used to blow up, like, spontaneously. Yes, the igniter. I know. Well, here's what happened. It was in the 70s. The Japanese had brought over Toyota and Honda. We were in a gas crunch. They got better gas mileage than our big, you know, 11 miles per gallon cars, which didn't matter when gas was 25 cents a gallon. Right.
[37:28] B: But back then, 25 cents, well, then.
[37:31] A: It was going up to like a $1, $50. You go from 25 cents to that. Okay, I Just don't drive.
[37:37] B: Yeah. That's like six dollar gas today.
[37:40] A: Yes. Right. It's crazy, right? So. So Iacocca said we got to compete with them. You guys have two years, two years straight line, two years to get a car done and on the assembly line so that we can make it to complete with the Japanese. And they did amazing. Ford engineers went through the whole thing, created a car in that period of time, and then it became the Pinto, which blew up because what. In order to do it, they had to skip certain tests and things that if they had done, they would have realized that this was too close. Might have taken them maybe an extra few months. Not that much. Right. In the overall scheme of things. Right. But having that straight line that I got to get there at that time is what created the biggest automotive blunder in history. Got it.
[38:34] B: Yeah.
[38:36] A: I'm saying all this stuff because change is not something that happens in a linear fashion as well. People go, oh, you gotta work on change. And then over time, you'll change. Except if my house caught on fire, that fucking changes shit.
[38:50] B: Yeah.
[38:51] A: So change doesn't always happen in a gradual thing. It can happen in an instant. If I got a phone call, heaven forbid that, you know, my wife and kids were in an accident. Okay. That fucking changes life.
[39:01] B: Yeah.
[39:01] A: Right. Sorry, I'm out. I get it. You got your time thing. I've gotta go handle something else. Right. Like life fucking changes. Right. So what we want to add to this is in nonlinear systems, when you take steps and you move along the way somewhere, and you can't know where, and you can't know when there's going to be a leap because that's what the electron does. And we're made up of lots of electrons. Right. So all we're interested in you having more freedom to become the you you want to be. Right. Which we know you're already somebody who's driven. Mm. We know that you're somebody who, like, is good at doing what there is for her to do. Right. Really good skill set that you learned back in your other. Right.
[39:57] B: Past life.
[39:58] A: Right. Right. Really good skill set that you learned. Right. That I know how to exist in a world where, like, if these are the things that there are for me to do, I can do them. Right. You know, a lot of people have a really hard time.
[40:13] B: Yeah. They've made that clear to me.
[40:17] A: Like, a really hard time doing the things that they're. They're there for them to do. Right. I asked my daughter, could you go get your allergies like, really, like, could you put your dish in the sink? What the. Like, just do what you're told. Do the thing you're supposed to do, and then I don't have to tell you. Right. So we want you to have much more fluidity and ease. Right. In your journey, which is an ongoing journey. This is a small part of it. However long this part is, it's still a small part of the overall journey. Right. And you already realize that the journey doesn't stop. So we want to be able to coast sometimes. Right. If I'm in the river and the river is flowing. Right. Keep paddling, get myself where I need to go. Right. Because I gotta get there. I told myself that I was gonna be there at this particular time. I don't want to be any second. Right. Every once in a while, I can still get some good distance without having to do anything. When I lived up north, the best thing was biking up to the top of a hill, finally getting there, and all the effort that it took to.
[41:45] B: Finally make it to the top, it.
[41:50] A: Was coasting and getting a far distance without doing much at all. Right. So I don't think what's been included in your journey, and even here, and I'm not suggesting coasting means, like, I'm not doing anything, but sometimes it's okay for you to be still that you're on your way, even if. Right. At first, it doesn't seem like I am. Right. At first, this thing seems like it's prolonging something that's already been long. I got that. I followed you. Right. But what hasn't been included is all of the other things that go along with that that I can't have anticipated or planned for. Right. And it's one of those areas that helps stretch me. You don't need a lot of stretching in the parts you're already good at.
[42:57] B: But. So what am I not good at?
[43:01] A: Divergences, things not going as planned.
[43:04] B: I feel like I'm really good at that.
[43:09] A: Things that you've set out for you that you thought you had more say and control in not going the way that you wanted them to go. That's the part that I would say that you need some more stretching in. What do you think?
[43:37] B: I don't know. Cause I just think that, like, I've never. I've never set the bar really high for myself.
[43:50] A: Except now you have.
[43:52] B: No, not even now.
[43:54] A: No. Now is. I'm not going to get a point because I don't want to lose any time.
[43:58] B: No, I mean, that Was a bar.
[44:00] A: You set for yourself that's pretty high.
[44:02] B: Well, I didn't want to lose points because I don't. Didn't want to. I did not. I literally it, like, I don't know how I made it this far without losing a point. I don't know how I did.
[44:24] A: Yeah.
[44:25] B: I don't know why everybody thinks I'm great.
[44:31] A: Huh. I wonder what it would be like to you start feeling that way. I don't know. You know, that you actually are good enough for you.
[44:39] B: I don't know.
[44:40] A: You don't know. Huh. Notice how that's happening?
[44:43] B: Well, I think things like this happen where instead of looking at it like, oh, you know what that was. Inevitably it was gonna happen, because literally all the advocates have told me all the time, like, it's impossible to go through this program without losing a point. It's impossible, so it's gonna happen. It's impossible, so it's gonna happen. And it did happen. And I was like, finally, it happened. But then I was like, no, I didn't want this to happen. And I don't think it's fair because a tree dropped some leaves on the ground that I could potentially stay in the program for two weeks longer because of a tree in the yard.
[45:29] A: Not because of a tree in the yard, because it wasn't as if you didn't know.
[45:36] B: Yeah, I guess I should have circled back around.
[45:38] A: It isn't that you didn't know that they don't check things until the evening, because you did know that.
[45:46] B: Yeah. And normally I'm more of a perfectionist and I go back out, but I worked that day. And so I guess part of me kind of feels like since they've been saying it to me the whole entire time, it's impossible to lose the point that they've literally were pulling at, like, grasping at what they could to take a point from me. And that's what makes me not want to stay in the program for two weeks longer, is because you had to pull that hard and take a point for a couple sticks on the ground. And I think that that's not fair. Like, if it was something I did, like, a communication error where I was like, screw you.
[46:31] A: Who told you? And when did you learn that life is fair, Dr. Q?
[46:42] B: Never. I know life isn't fair. Look at my life.
[46:44] A: But you said that that wasn't fair.
[46:46] B: No, the principle.
[46:48] A: It wasn't fair.
[46:51] B: The principle of having a point taken for sticks and leaves. Like, how is that an error that I made? Because I got feedback A month ago to not be so much of a perfectionist. So I didn't. And then you take a point from me for not circling back around. So now next time, like I'm gonna go out there four times and make sure there's not a beetle on the ground.
[47:24] A: I'm gonna go out there at 8:45. Yeah, do it then.
[47:31] B: 8:45. 8:50.
[47:33] A: 8:55 like right. That isn't. See you went to the. I'm gonna go out four times. I go to. What's the simplest? Well if they're gonna check at this time, I'm gonna make sure that it's done before they check. And right before they check. That's easier than keep going four times. No, just wait until. Oh they're gonna, okay, let me go ahead and do it. So it's done before they check. Right, right. Notice how it occurred to you is to. Didn't even occur to you to go, oh, I'll just wait till right before they check. Right. So that's the part where it's stretching, growing. How am I about things that are not fair that I don't think are just that I think, you know, aren't that big of a deal. But I got dinged for it. Like that's the part. Right. As you said to me a long time ago, you said, you know what, I may have not thought like I did anything that got me the first thing, but I did do something that got me to jail. Right. Because I was already on probation or whatever it was. Right. So I took ownership in that and did my thing. Right. Uh huh. Ann, your point is?
[49:23] B: I mean, yeah, I'm wrong for not going out at 8:45.
[49:26] A: I don't think there's not a wrong. See the thing you have to be considering is, is this an area that I don't have a lot of freedom in. Yeah. Cuz I'm pretty activated. How am I going to in life deal with situations where there are things that are not fair that happen?
[49:53] B: Yeah. But not most situations aren't gonna keep me two weeks. We don't know what those situations are gonna be. I just want to go home.
[50:09] A: Yeah, right. And you're on your way. You're in action too.
[50:15] B: I know.
[50:17] A: On your way to be going home. Right. And it'll happen. It just may not happen on the timetable that you arbitrarily stamped.
[50:42] B: I think that losing a point just makes me feel like obviously I need more time, that I'm not good enough yet.
[50:59] A: Oh, it's going back to good enough. Fucking thing. Well, can you be good enough for you?
[51:08] B: I am good enough for me. But it's not me who needs to be impressed right now. I'm under a microscope, being analyzed in everything that I do.
[51:24] A: By whom?
[51:27] B: By everybody.
[51:29] A: Everybody. All people. Michelle Obama's looking at you. She isn't she.
[51:34] B: At one point she probably was.
[51:38] A: Not everybody.
[51:39] B: Not everybody but the program.
[51:41] A: Uh huh. So what if it doesn't have to do with being good enough? That's why we go back to how do you want to be? Can you be good enough even if there's bad shit that happens or mistakes that happen or stuff that goes on or I get dinged a point?
[51:56] B: Well, yeah, I can be. But I just want to be able to go home. And I know that I will eventually. But I'm sick of looking at everything as eventually. Like knowing that every day is one day closer. And I know that it's been like that for so long again, as you.
[52:23] A: Do all of this stuff, you know what you don't include that I got home early. All that extra time you got.
[52:30] B: Fuck.
[52:31] A: You could not be even in this program right now. I know still behind bars, you gained all that time and we go, okay, doesn't matter. Well. Cause I've already got that time. It's about the time that I might lose later. I'm not including the time that I gained.
[52:52] B: But I.
[52:53] A: Right.
[52:54] B: I guess I figured that when I got out of prison, I wouldn't feel like that anymore. Like I wouldn't have to feel like that anymore.
[53:07] A: That you're losing time. You don't have enough time.
[53:10] B: Yeah, I heard that.
[53:14] A: I'm still waiting. You don't actually have to feel that way.
[53:18] B: Make me not feel this way.
[53:20] A: Yeah. So let's think of a you who's more. Okay. Who's actually including that. There may be a jump which just hasn't happened yet. The quantum leap that I'm in. A nonlinear system so that we get a you who's easier to move with the obstacles that show up. So just think of that for a moment. Do that breath where you breathe deeply in. And at the top of the inhale, a quick inhalation. Do it again. Breathe in. See, it's a breath in. Yeah. One more time. All right. And now continue to breathe so that your exhale is a little longer than the inhale. That's right. Just like this. Right. Slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth as you continue to breathe. Right. And I'm wondering from this phase, what happens when you close your eyes and even travel back along the timeline, back to a you when she was in prison, who was really troubled, feeling she lost all that time, let her know that she did the time she got out, her gain time, so that she's even closer to what she truly wants for ultimate goals. Which is becoming a better version of me. That's right. What happens to the earlier you back in prison, seeing the you here, now free outside, with the ability to sweep up beetles and leaves on a porch outside. That's right. In sunny Florida. Right, Right. What's happening now?
[57:12] B: She feels better.
[57:14] A: She does feel better, doesn't she? Right. You didn't know when you entered that you were gonna get out early, did you? No. Right. There was a leap that happened. Right. We can't even be certain when. What we know is that you did the things that there were for you to do in an ongoing everyday way, and it happened. Pretty cool that you is feeling better, isn't she? She's not feeling so trapped or confined, not having the weight of the world. Right. So that you can lighten up because you know that in a moment it's timeless. So you can think of a you connecting to the people that matter to you in the moment. That's right. And as this is happening, how's your body feeling now?
[58:52] B: Better.
[58:53] A: It is feeling better, Right. Maybe we could get you to even consider it might be fun to step off the tightrope, to lighten up on me a little bit so I can breathe a little better. Right. Because that's what allows for the non linearity movement. Imagine what the plane would have to do to force itself to get to the exact coordinates that it had placed planned. What we realize is that all it has to do is be within range. Right. Instead of on and off like there used to be with the air conditioner, we now have a range of temperatures we can set it at. Right. You want to open up so that there is a range. That's right. Because with that, more opportunities present themselves. Ones that you might not even have considered ever before. And again, what's happening now in your body? How's your body feeling?
[60:38] B: Great.
[60:50] A: What are you noticing now?
[61:04] B: It's better.
[61:06] A: Well, that was a better breath. Yeah. Space is always under time. So when we connect to more of the space around us, like let's say somebody's telling me that I don't have any time in my calendar and I get them connected to space, there's more room than what they thought. But they couldn't get there because they Were this band of information, they had to go to a different level. So I want one more time you to close your eyes, lower your jaw, rest your tongue, Breathe in a little bit of a slower and deeper way. Expand awareness out so that with your eyes closed, sense first the space in you that you're made up of mostly space. That if we took the atom and made it the size of a marble, the electron floating around would be more than a football field away. So that you're made up of mostly space.00001% of your body solid. The rest of space. Just notice more space in your arms, your legs, chest and abd begin to connect to the space outside of you in this room. The space in front, the space between you and me, the space under the couch, behind you, up above. How there's space all around you, inside you. And that the space goes beyond the confines of this room and office, all the way out in all directions. And although we may think of space as the thing that's separating you from me, it is the thing that connects you to me and everything else. Space. And as you're connecting to more of the space, imagine what would happen if you were to float up and out of your body first beyond the ceiling and the roof, so that you're up above the building, looking down and then extending up and beyond, all the way out, all the way up into space, looking back down at Earth. The space that you can notice between you and the moon, the space that goes well beyond the moon, floating all the way out to the little, what used to be planet Pluto. And looking back at all the other planets, all the way back into space. And then like a rocket ship, all the way back in you. That's right. And then, when you're ready, take a deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. There you are. What are you noticing now? Space. Interesting. Yeah, right. You know, it's really weird sometimes. I'll be on a hole and, like, have finished golf, and I'll be looking back, and there's somebody on the tee, and I watch them swing, and they swing. And then moments later, you hear the dink. Because light travels faster. You already see a minute, and then you hear dink after the craziest thing. Right, Right. And time can slow down when you're with the people that matter. Ted Williams was a baseball player, one of the last people to bat, like, 400. And he used to say that he could slow down a baseball in his mind so that he could see the laces. Now on a 90 mile an hour fastball. You don't see the laces unless it's slowed down. Right. He could read when Ruckard used to spin the label as it was spinning high. If you've ever been in a car and you're on the interstate and you're driving really fast and you get off and you're going down a regular road that's like 45. Doesn't feel like you're moving.
[67:20] B: Yep.
[67:21] A: Right. People who fly pilots and then they get in their car, they're going like 90, and they're like, oh, I don't even feel like I'm moving. Right. All of that is the distortion of time. Right. So how's your body feeling now?
[67:44] B: Light?
[67:44] A: It is, isn't it? Yeah. And that's what we want. You're learning to be more about you. Lightening up. Right.
[67:55] B: Easier to get across the tightrope.
[67:59] A: Lighten up so you don't have to be on it anymore.
[68:04] B: I'm just kidding.
[68:06] A: Yeah, exactly.
[68:08] B: Yeah.
[68:09] A: Cool. Well, we'll get back together again. You did great today.
[68:13] B: Thank you. Thanks.
[68:16] A: Yeah. So.
