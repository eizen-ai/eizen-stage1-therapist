[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 18th of April. Surely we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is valuable, useful, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:15] B: Yes.
[00:16] A: Cool. Okay, so menu of the things that we want to do. So now tell it to you in this way. Nobody would give a shit about the stuff they went through if it wasn't negatively affecting now, right? If I was feeling and thinking and acting and reacting totally the way I wanted to, I wouldn't care about any of this stuff. The only reason we do is that we get that somehow it's affecting now. So our goal is always, how do we want things to be for you now? Meaning if we could change right now problematic ways that you feel, think, act, or react, what do we want to get better, right? So some people come in and they tell me I'm more tense, I'm nervous, I'm anxious, I get jittery and uneasy. In certain social situations, I got a lot of discomfort. Sometimes it moves into panic. Sometimes it affects me in sleep. They don't want to be feeling like that. Other people go, well, for me, I am reactive. Like, I lose it, right? Like, it may take a little bit, but when I lose it, I fucking lose.
[01:25] B: Is like all the way lost, right?
[01:28] A: That I'm overly reactive. I'm way more irritated and angry. Little things just set me off. I don't. And I do shit that now. I'm like, fuck, I wish I didn't do that. Like, I don't want to be doing that anymore. Some people go, well, for me, I'm like, just down. He used to have a lot more energy and zest and interest in life, and now I just like him. Like, I don't want to be feeling like that. Some people go, well, for me, it's like loss. Like, people that matter to me passed away. And even since then, like, I got a lot of around all of that, right? Some people go, well, for me, I get it. It's shit that I've gone through and it's over, but it still haunts. I don't think about it all the time. But if I do think about it or shit reminds me of it, I'm still right at the effect of it. Some people go, well, for me, there's a whole bunch of shit that I've done that I wish I never had. And so I got a lot of, like, you know, internal like guilt and shame and regret and remorse over stuff. I'd like that to be gone, too. So those are, like, the big menu of the kinds of things that I know, how to get better. Okay, all of that. Well, good. So then we're in the right place. That's awesome. So then what would be useful for me to know, to understand how things have been? What do we want to actually, like, you know, get better? Because if we check off those things, like, how have you been overly reactive? How have you found yourself, you know, nervous, tense, anxious? How do you know when you're doing?
[02:58] B: How do I say? Number one thing is I stuff the emotions and I just. I run away. Run away, Run away. That's how I got into a lot of the trouble that I've been in.
[03:13] A: You stuff the emotions or you figure out ways to try not to think about them.
[03:20] B: Just don't deal with it.
[03:21] A: I'm not sure that you stuff it.
[03:23] B: Yeah, I just don't deal with it.
[03:24] A: Well, you figure out ways to not think about it. Oh, that thing sucked and made me feel bad. So let me figure out ways to never think about that.
[03:30] B: Never deal with it.
[03:32] A: Okay, so I just go this way.
[03:34] B: I'm just gonna go this way and I'm gonna leave all that sitting right here.
[03:37] A: That's right.
[03:38] B: Yeah.
[03:38] A: Yeah.
[03:39] B: So I do that. Definitely run away from my problems. Don't want to do that anymore.
[03:44] A: How'd that work?
[03:46] B: It just made them worse.
[03:47] A: It did?
[03:47] B: Yeah. Now that I want to get better and want to deal with them, they're just like 10 times worse than they are.
[03:55] A: I don't know. I'm not sure that'll be true.
[03:57] B: Not true?
[03:58] A: No. No. Because we're not troubled by shit that happened because it happened. I know that sounds crazy, but I'm gonna say it in this way, Shirley. If I broke my arm when I was eight years old, right? And if I was still upset about it now, and I was as emotional about it as when it happened, you would be looking at me like, what is wrong with this guy? His arm is fine. I see him move it all over the place. He can't keep his arm still. Yeah, right. But if I told you about what happened to me when I spent, you know, three weeks in the summer when I was nine at Uncle Mark's house, right? And, you know, I started talking about how it was nice, and he let me stay up and he watched some R rated movies. Then he, like, gave me something to drink. And then, you know, over time, like, he started doing. And I Started to get, like, really upset over it. You'd be like, well, yeah, of course. You're troubled because of what Mark did. Right. That's what we all say. So why does that emotional wound not heal, but the physical wound does? No. Do you deal with this? No. You may get it in a cast. Your body fucking does the healing. You don't have to deal with it. They put it in a cast so you don't fuck up your body's ability to heal it. Right?
[05:15] B: True.
[05:16] A: Because it was up to us, we'd keep fucking it up, keep using it.
[05:20] B: Very true.
[05:21] A: Got it. Why does the emotional wound not heal? It's not because I didn't deal with it. It's actually, and this is the craziest part, when I went through the troubling moment, my brain short circuited. So emotionally, my brain got stuck. Emotionally, my brain doesn't know that moment ended. My brain being the part that works more like an animal, that's the emotional part. My logical brain totally knows it's over, Totally knows I'm grown up, totally knows it's not happening. May even know it wasn't my fault. My emotional brain still thinks it's happening, still feels it was my fault, and is constantly looking for anything that's similar to it to protect me. But similar gets confused as same.
[06:12] B: Right?
[06:13] A: Right. So the reason that it doesn't heal isn't because it can't. It's because the brain doesn't know that it ended. So what I tell people all the time, instead of where therapy thinks because I stuffed it, that I've got to get it out of me. Right. What if we don't have to get the bad feelings out of you because it's not actually in you.
[06:35] B: Show me.
[06:36] A: That's new, Right? Totally different concept. What if it's not about getting the bad feelings out, but it's the reverse? It's about getting the good news in. We have really good news to get into certain parts of your brain when they were going through awful moments that in the moment that it was awful, you weren't sure you were going to survive it, make it through it, or be okay.
[07:02] B: Right.
[07:03] A: And that's still stuck. So we've got really good news to tell certain aspects of the brain. Guess what? That ended.
[07:12] B: That's over.
[07:12] A: I moved through it. I'm here now I'm okay. Got it?
[07:18] B: Yeah.
[07:19] A: So that's one major difference. Instead of trying to process, be emotive, get it out of me, really feel it, it's really the reverse. We want to go in. And we want to unplug the memory so the brain can read what happened as data about something that happened versus happening.
[07:39] B: Gotcha.
[07:40] A: Makes sense.
[07:41] B: Absolutely.
[07:42] A: As soon as it's unplugged, the emotion that was attached to it goes away. Gone. Like a light switch turning on. It's the fucking coolest thing in the world, let me tell you. I do this all the time and it is still the coolest thing in the world when somebody has something that used to really bother them and you go through a little process and boom, that's gone. And then you ask them the question, well, think about it right now. Try to feel really. And they're like, yeah, no, it's not there anymore. Like that's the coolest thing in the world. Okay, so that's the first part, Right. So that's one aspect of it. Right. So we get that. And I don't need to even know specifics that what you learned in life was the best coping mechanism all of us have. If there's shit that makes me feel bad, figure out ways to never think.
[08:35] B: About it go the other way.
[08:37] A: Right. The problem is sometimes I think about it when I don't want to. Sometimes shit triggers it or reminds me of it when I don't want to do. Damn it.
[08:45] B: Very inconvenient times.
[08:46] A: Right. But I'm trying to go this way. So one of the things that we want to do is we want to get the impact that the stuff is had cleared. So you're free from it. So it's not running any of that in you and it doesn't cause any of this. We can totally get that done free from it. Sounds good, right? Don't you think? Wouldn't that be really cool?
[09:05] B: That would be great.
[09:05] A: Yeah. That's why I said earlier to the women. Right. You know, you grew up in whatever you grew up in that led you to have these controlled choices. We say it's choice, but the right, not really choice.
[09:21] B: I like that. Yeah, right.
[09:24] A: But the cool part is because you chose this and you get freedom from that. You get to totally be directive of how you want your life to be moving forward. Not dependent on what in what happened. Free from what happened. That's really cool. Exciting.
[09:43] B: Sounds like a plan.
[09:44] A: Yeah, cool. But what else would be useful for me to know, to understand? Right? I don't need to know the specifics of what happened. But as you talked about, maybe I'm a little overreactive, anger wise. Maybe I'm a little more like, how does that show up where has that been problematic for you?
[10:04] B: If I don't run, then I just argue. Like, I don't, I don't want to be like that. To where like. And I'm better than I used to be, but I'm still not where I want to be. Like, I will just get mad and are you with you even if I'm wrong? Like, you can't tell me that I'm wrong until I'm blue in the face. I will argue with you and cuss you out even if you're my best friend. You're my best friend. I'll cuss you like, so what might.
[10:40] A: Be something that you got in an argument with somebody about? Like, you know, the really important stuff.
[10:47] B: The really important stuff.
[10:50] A: It's probably never really important stuff.
[10:51] B: It's really, really like, probably like I want to go shopping and you want to go somewhere else. You know, to the park.
[11:01] A: Yeah.
[11:01] B: You know, something like that. Something really small.
[11:04] A: Yeah.
[11:04] B: But no, I don't have time to take you to the park because I'm going shopping and that's what I'm going to do. And if you don't like it, then, oh, well. But you're supposed to be my best friend. Why am I like that? Why am I being like that? I don't like being like that.
[11:17] A: Okay.
[11:18] B: Yeah.
[11:19] A: So sometimes that my way or highway.
[11:21] B: Yeah. Pretty much. Like, I'm stubborn to the point where.
[11:24] A: Compromising.
[11:25] B: Yeah.
[11:27] A: So maybe we could get you to be more able to, to be a little more easygoing, a little more flexible. Maybe a little more flexible to move with the flow of things.
[11:38] B: Yeah. Control freak, I guess is the way to that. Most people say, okay, say it to me.
[11:44] A: You know, that's what they've said.
[11:46] B: Yeah.
[11:47] A: Oh, oh. So. So they say that the attributes of Shirley is that she's stubborn, hard headed. Control freak. That's got to make you feel great.
[11:57] B: Yeah. Instead of be like, you funny, you know, like, that's terrible. Right. So, yeah, we definitely want to solve that problem because I don't like being. Yeah, I don't, I don't like feeling that way, you know, like I'm mad for no reason.
[12:14] A: Yeah. Or rigid.
[12:16] B: Yeah.
[12:16] A: Right. The, the, the issue is that there's an inflexibility, there's a rigidness, which again, rigidness works at some times, but not all the time. So the problem is we live in a world where we think it's all or nothing. I'm this way or I'm that way.
[12:36] B: Yes.
[12:36] A: That's how I think what we want Is we want to have range, Meaning there are going to be times that it makes sense to be very firm, rigid. There might be times that it makes sense to be controlling because that serves that situation well. Make sense.
[12:58] B: Yes.
[12:59] A: But there are other times where being that way doesn't work so well. So what we want to add is range so that you have more than just that way of operating. Make sense?
[13:15] B: Yes. It used to be way worse than it is, but it's still.
[13:19] A: How did it get better?
[13:23] B: Probably just the knowledge that I do it because before I didn't realize that I'm yelling for no reason and, you know, saying things that are really mean.
[13:34] A: Yeah.
[13:35] B: That I'm saying to somebody I love, I care about.
[13:38] A: Yeah.
[13:38] B: That I say I love and care about, but I'm saying something like, completely horrible to them, you know, like. So once they started pointing that out, you know, it was, you know, you can't. It's pretty obvious once somebody tells you, and you. Then you see yourself.
[13:53] A: Okay.
[13:54] B: So.
[13:54] A: So the reflection kinda went okay. Now I. It's a little more metered, a little more. I notice it a little bit more. So I can have a little more fluidity. It's still active, it's still there, but I got a little more fluidity. Right. So it's the idea of the things that control us the most are the things that are most unconscious. Like, if I don't know that I don't know, then that's got a lot more control over this thing that I kind of know. Still gets me every once in a while, maybe more than I wanted to, but, like, I know it. So, like, I can kind of do.
[14:28] B: Something about it, but don't know where it's coming from, But I can kind of.
[14:34] A: So we want to, again, turn the intensity down. We want to get it so that at times that it makes sense to be that, you know, firm, rigid, controlled, that it's on at times that it doesn't make sense that it's able to be turned down and that there's range.
[14:53] B: Within it and there's an in between.
[14:55] A: Yeah.
[14:55] B: That's where you're gonna have to get me. Because there's an in between. Yeah, I'm very black and white.
[15:00] A: Well.
[15:01] B: But I'm right and wrong.
[15:02] A: Yeah. But that's only because we live with the exclusive. Or what that means is I'm this way or I'm that way. It's this or that.
[15:14] B: This outfit or this outfit.
[15:16] A: Got it. But life doesn't work that way. So I'll give you a Great example of it. You can be happy, you can be not happy. So it's happy, not happy. Another way to say not happy would be unhappy. So I'm happy or I'm unhappy. But in life you already know that you can be happy, you can be unhappy, you can be not unhappy. And if you're not unhappy, it does include being happy, but it also includes all of the other emotions you could be experiencing other than unhappy. Right, Got it.
[15:59] B: Yes.
[16:00] A: So that's what I mean by opening range.
[16:02] B: Gotcha.
[16:03] A: Right. Florida used to be a horrible place to live. One, they didn't have ac. That would be horrible. None of us would want to be here in August. No AC. 2, the AC that they used to have was on and off like a light switch. She turned it on when it got too hot, turned it off when it got too cold. How often was that? No rain. Now we have thermostats. Much better.
[16:25] B: Much better. You like 78, I like 72.
[16:29] A: We can adjust it exactly. Cool. Okay, so I know what to do with that. What else would be useful for me to know? What else are we wanting to get better?
[16:38] B: This is a hard question.
[16:39] A: It's not that hard. It's pretty easy. No, I'm not buying that it's hard.
[16:44] B: Oh, you're not buying it? No. You've been through this. Oh, man. People pleaser. Okay, People pleaser. But also. Okay, Certain people pleaser. Let's say that.
[17:01] A: Okay.
[17:02] B: Particular people pleaser. Have to care what you think.
[17:06] A: Oh, first.
[17:07] B: Yeah. I have to care about your opinion though.
[17:09] A: Okay. And if you care about their opinion, then you really try to please them.
[17:13] B: Yeah. If I don't care about your opinion. Yeah, you just like off off. Yeah. So good. No, not good. Cuz I've told a lot of really awesome people to off, you know.
[17:25] A: You didn't care about their opinion.
[17:26] B: No, I didn't give a damn about them.
[17:27] A: That's right.
[17:28] B: You know, but they were awesome people.
[17:29] A: Maybe might not have been that awesome.
[17:31] B: Well, okay. Yeah. I wouldn't have never had a chance to know because I told them to.
[17:37] A: Off and they never came back. Yeah, yeah.
[17:40] B: You know. You know, they could have been. But yeah, if I care about your opinion, then people pleaser to the extreme, like deathly. I want you to see me in a certain light, I guess. See me as a good person. I don't know.
[17:57] A: Okay. So when you're a people pleaser, sometimes you do it because you get joy out of doing something for someone that you know that they'll like. But sometimes people Pleasers feel like they have to and they're resenting having to. Or sometimes they don't have the freedom to not do the caretaking, pleasing, and do something else so they feel guilty. I don't know if either of those two things show up for you.
[18:28] B: Say the first one again.
[18:30] A: Well, like, sometimes somebody who's a people pleaser, like, may want to go do something else but feels that they can't because they need to do the people pleasing. Or they feel a little like they're doing it and now they're kind of like, resenting feeling like they have to do it. Yeah, right. Like somebody can be like, you know what? I love making dinner. I love it when you're enjoying what I'm eating or what I made to eat.
[18:58] B: What are you, mind reader or something?
[18:59] A: Right. But then sometimes it's like, you know, fuck, why do I always have to cook? God damn it.
[19:04] B: We get sick of it.
[19:05] A: You know, we get sick of it. Now I'm resenting that before. Is this like, you know, me being a pleaser and caretaking now I'm like, freaking resenting having to do it.
[19:17] B: Sometimes if it gets. Yeah. If it gets taken advantage of. Yeah. More in, like, people would not have to ask me for anything. They just have to have a casual conversation about they need help with something. Like, for instance, you don't have any gas in your car and you. You gotta go somewhere. Okay, well, I'm about to fill your gas tank for you because you just. You didn't ask me for anything. But we're just hanging out, having a conversation, and we just came up in conversation. Oh, man, I gotta get to the doctor. I'm having gas in my car. Next thing you know, you got a full second. Yes. Just wanted to please you, Just want to make you happy.
[20:01] A: Okay.
[20:02] B: That type of thing.
[20:03] A: Okay.
[20:03] B: Yeah.
[20:04] A: And sometimes to your own detriment.
[20:06] B: To my own. Yes.
[20:07] A: Yeah.
[20:08] B: To my own terrible detriment. Yes.
[20:10] A: Oh, terrible detriment.
[20:11] B: Terrible, terrible, terrible. Like, all the way down.
[20:14] A: Not just my detriment, my, like, terrible.
[20:16] B: Like, it's like unrecoverable sometimes, you know?
[20:20] A: Okay.
[20:20] B: So. Yeah. Okay. But don't. Don't know. I don't know. I'm doing it when I'm doing it. Next thing you know, my bank account's empty, you know?
[20:32] A: Yeah.
[20:32] B: My gas tank's empty, too.
[20:34] A: Yeah.
[20:35] B: And they're driving around fine.
[20:37] A: So it's overextended at times. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So we want to get that thing shifted so that it's done really, at the times that it works for you to get the joy out of doing it and the freedom to not have to and feel good even if it doesn't.
[21:04] B: Yeah. Like I don't have to fix everybody else's shit.
[21:09] A: Yeah, it's okay. Yeah.
[21:11] B: They can have shit.
[21:12] A: Yeah.
[21:13] B: It's not.
[21:14] A: It's not my problem, but it's always easier to try to do theirs than mine.
[21:17] B: Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[21:20] A: I mean, I gotta look at me. No, man, I'm looking at you.
[21:23] B: I said sometimes, but then I was like, oh, yes.
[21:26] A: Yeah.
[21:27] B: Somebody was like, you know, they would come over to my house and I'd be like, man, I got, you know, I gotta pay my water bill. Oh, my God, the car's breaking down. I gotta fix the car. I talked to my daughter yesterday. She was being a little brat. And then, you know, I tell them like a whole list of problems and I'd be like, what about you? What's going on with you? How can I help you? What do you need? You need anything, let me, you know, tell me what you need, you know, so. Yeah.
[21:55] A: Yeah.
[21:55] B: Like dad told me to my face. That's how I do. I didn't know I did it, but yeah.
[22:00] A: Okay.
[22:00] B: Once I realized I did it and then you could see it.
[22:03] A: Okay. So that's something that's been problematic.
[22:06] B: Yeah.
[22:06] A: You valuing your.
[22:07] B: You. Yeah.
[22:08] A: You being worth it to you. So we'd like to get that adjusted.
[22:16] B: Oh, yeah. You probably should adjust that a little.
[22:18] A: Bit so that you get to be more good in you.
[22:20] B: Yeah.
[22:21] A: More at peace in here.
[22:22] B: I definitely trash talk myself.
[22:23] A: More comfortable in your own skin. Yeah. You get to lighten up a little on you.
[22:27] B: Yeah.
[22:28] A: Okay, cool.
[22:29] B: That's one of the things I could totally say, you know, Salah Circle, where they, you know, when I moved from assessment over here, they said, take it easy on yourself. Don't be so hard on yourself. So just in the four weeks I was at assessment.
[22:44] A: Yeah.
[22:45] B: More than one person told me, like, take it easy on yourself. Don't be so hard on yourself. You know? Okay.
[22:51] A: When you're hard on you, whose voice is it in?
[22:53] B: I don't know.
[22:54] A: You know, when you're saying the dumb stuff about you.
[22:56] B: I don't know because I don't hear myself doing that. Other people point it out. Yeah.
[23:02] A: Okay.
[23:03] B: Even when that's one thing. Like, even when they.
[23:05] A: Let's ask it a different way. How do you know when to be hard on yourself? What is it that you might have done or said? Then you're like mad for having done it or down on you for having said it or.
[23:18] B: Or literally anything. Everything in life. Anything that. Yeah. Pretty much involves another person. Yeah.
[23:30] A: So would it be like you just had a conversation and then like they walked? Oh, that. Yeah. I shouldn't have said that.
[23:36] B: I should have said that. Or, Or I could have helped more or.
[23:43] A: Okay.
[23:44] B: Are they mad at me?
[23:45] A: Ah.
[23:45] B: And for no reason. Why are they, Why'd they leave the conversation?
[23:49] A: Yeah.
[23:50] B: Are they mad at me now?
[23:51] A: Yeah.
[23:51] B: What did I say? Type thing. Yeah. Always thinking somebody is mad, upset, angry.
[24:00] A: At me for something. Okay.
[24:03] B: No reason.
[24:04] A: Yeah. So that change would be getting it so that you read emotionally other people's stuff as being about them. And then again, you got friends. Freedom in how you respond. Sometimes it might be with caring, compassion, love and concern. Sometimes it might be being real firm and directive. Right. Sometimes it might slide by like rainwater on the roof. Like, okay, well there it goes. Got it. Like that's how we want this thing to be. Cool. Okay. What else would be useful for me to know? What else are we wanting to get better?
[24:41] B: Oh no, that one was pretty good. Yeah, that one was pretty. That was a. Yeah. Mm hmm. I don't know. You tell me.
[24:54] A: What am I supposed to know? I'm not a mind reader.
[24:57] B: I just asked you were your mind reader about the cooking dinner thing.
[25:00] A: Yeah. No, I'm not. My wife says I should be better at it by now, but I'm not very good at it at all.
[25:05] B: No.
[25:08] A: No. But what we get so far is that there's stuff that's happened that although it's over, it's underneath the surface affecting you. We got that there's stuff that happened where, you know, loved ones have died. There's still heaviness and hurt around that. We want that stuff lightened. We want that stuff cleared. We get that there are times that you find yourself, you know, in this kind of stubborn, you know, controlled arguing thing that you're not even sure why you're doing it, but you're doing it and nobody can say nothing to you because like you're arguing about it. Right. You'd like that to stop. So you got more flexibility in how you interact. That whole self conscious and being down and hard on you, like, I shouldn't have done this or I should have said that. That whole people pleasing thing. We want all that lifted. So I got those things. What else are we wanting to do?
[26:01] B: I think it's pretty good.
[26:03] A: Like when you're in social situations, like if you're in a Group. If you're at, like, you know, a meeting, if you're with the other women in the house, do you find yourself, like, worrying about what they might be thinking about you? Do you find yourself worried about whether I'm going to say something that may, or is it only after the fact that I just said that thing and now I feel stupid for having said it and I'm an idiot for having.
[26:25] B: Done it after the fact type thing?
[26:29] A: Okay.
[26:29] B: I don't. I don't predict what other people are thinking or saying, but it's. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe both.
[26:46] A: Maybe both.
[26:47] B: Maybe both. Yeah, now that I think about it. Now that you mention it, yeah, you know, maybe both. Maybe I'm just sitting there just waiting for shit to hit the fan, you know? And it's like, I'm calm, cool, and collected until I'm not, okay, just hanging out. But in my head, there's a million things going on. Like, if you. If you go out there and ask Savannah how. What kind of person am I? Like, oh, she's chill. She's so laid back. But in my head, it's not like that.
[27:23] A: Oh, okay.
[27:24] B: It's not like that at all.
[27:25] A: Okay.
[27:26] B: Yeah. So.
[27:28] A: So we would like this to be quieter.
[27:30] B: Yeah. Can we.
[27:32] A: Yeah.
[27:33] B: Can we turn that down?
[27:34] A: Yeah, yeah.
[27:35] B: It's way too loud.
[27:36] A: Okay, so we want to turn down the volume of that.
[27:39] B: Yeah. And then, you know, it just. It always goes back to negative stuff in my head. Like, I'm always constantly negative, negative, like.
[27:50] A: Negative stuff that you did or didn't do. Negative stuff that happened to you. Negative stuff that.
[27:55] B: All that.
[27:56] A: Okay.
[27:57] B: Past stuff. I could all of a sudden just be four years old again. And, like, I. I looked at this scar earlier. I got it when I was, like, eight.
[28:07] A: Yeah.
[28:07] B: Like, why am I thinking about this scar that I got when I was eight?
[28:10] A: Yeah.
[28:13] B: Like, all the way back then.
[28:15] A: Yeah.
[28:16] B: Just out of nowhere, though. And then, you know, stuff that happened more recently and then, of course, I think it's normal for, like, my brother just died, like, six months ago.
[28:27] A: Okay.
[28:28] B: So it's normal to still have him on the back of my mind. So maybe. I don't know.
[28:34] A: Okay.
[28:35] B: Yeah.
[28:35] A: Yeah. So that's something, too.
[28:37] B: A lot of negative stuff always going on in my head instead of more positive, like, hey, things are gonna be okay.
[28:43] A: So lots of reminders and memories about stuff that had been troubling.
[28:49] B: Yes. Just shitty, shitty stuff.
[28:51] A: Okay, cool.
[28:53] B: That's fine. Memory.
[28:55] A: Not only shitty, shitty stuff, but then down on you yeah. For not for having the shitty, shitty stuff come to mind.
[29:01] B: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[29:02] A: Like, so we want you to lighten up some.
[29:04] B: Like over here. Telling myself to shut the fuck up. I'm like, I can. In my head.
[29:10] A: Yeah.
[29:10] B: Not out loud.
[29:11] A: Right.
[29:12] B: Just like. Okay. Why are you thinking about that? I don't know why I'm thinking about that.
[29:17] A: Yeah.
[29:18] B: And it sucks.
[29:18] A: And here's the cool part. Even if you knew why, it wouldn't change that you were thinking about it.
[29:23] B: Right.
[29:25] A: Only time that people spend any amount of time trying to figure out why is when they're not doing well, when they're not feeling well. That's when we try to figure out why we don't do it when things are going great. Yeah, right. The guy's out on a bicycle ride, enjoying the trail, seeing the nature go by. There's not a moment that he's going, I wonder what is having this experience be so enjoyable? How does it relate late back to early childhood?
[29:55] B: True, but see, that's the thing.
[30:01] A: What's so funny about that? No, no, I'll explain that in a second. But what's so funny about that is that is the tendency when we're not feeling good, we try to figure out why. I'm not thinking that. If I knew why, it would help me feel better. But here's the cool part. It doesn't. And it's not on the road to the solution. It's actually a symptom of the problem because I only do it when things aren't going well. I never do it when things are great because I'm present.
[30:31] B: Right. It's great right now.
[30:33] A: Yeah, I'm up time. I'm not really focused. I'm not thinking. I only do that when things aren't going well. Right. So we want to get that shifted so that it's easier for you to be emotionally present, to have access to more. The reason that you remember or are reminded of those things more frequently is that our brain is pre programmed for survival sake. To remember the negative more intensely than the positive.
[31:03] B: That sucks.
[31:04] A: I needed to know where the tiger lives more so than where the berries are. And if the berries are at all close to where the tiger lives. I figure out how to avoid the berries even though they taste because the tiger will kill me.
[31:22] B: Yes. Gotcha.
[31:25] A: Got it. So the negative stuff is remembered more intensely because it's for survival. The error that's going on truly is that part of the brain doesn't know that it ended. Doesn't know that you made it through it doesn't know that you're okay. We want all of that updated. So any of the past regrets, remorse, guilts or shames that that's cleared. Any of the hurts or the angers or the pains or the sadnesses, that's cleared. So that you're present mind is more quiet, you are free. So that there's more ease and moving through the day to day situations. Not that there won't be stressors and not that there won't be times that it makes sense to be directive and firm.
[32:11] B: Right.
[32:12] A: But we want flow too.
[32:16] B: Doesn't have to be rigid. It doesn't have to be my way all the time.
[32:19] A: That's right. Based on the situation and the circumstance. That's what directs how we want you responding. Not I'm this way always. I've never learned. No, no.
[32:31] B: Sometimes I'm this way.
[32:32] A: Right, Exactly.
[32:34] B: There's no middle ground with me. Like, you know, either I like you or I don't.
[32:39] A: Yeah.
[32:40] B: You know, it's. And that's it.
[32:42] A: Like.
[32:42] B: And there's nothing you can do to convince me otherwise.
[32:45] A: And we want to get that shifted.
[32:46] B: Yeah.
[32:46] A: We're gonna have fixed so that you're way more. Okay.
[32:49] B: Yeah.
[32:50] A: Yeah. Cool. Okay. Any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know?
[32:57] B: I have a lot of guilt from my children?
[33:00] A: Just they're shitty kids.
[33:02] B: No, they are wonderful, amazing kids. Like, you got good kids, huh?
[33:08] A: You got good kids.
[33:09] B: I got awesome kids. How many? There's three.
[33:14] A: Okay. They're gonna say there's 17.
[33:18] B: Whoa.
[33:18] A: Surely. Holy cow. All 17. Good.
[33:23] B: They are all right.
[33:24] A: Three kids. How old kids?
[33:27] B: 20, 15 and 14.
[33:29] A: Okay.
[33:30] B: Just recently had contact with the 20 year old like past couple years. Once she turned 18. No contact with the two little ones. They pretty much. They cut me out of their life.
[33:42] A: They live where?
[33:43] B: They live in Virginia.
[33:44] A: With whom?
[33:45] B: Their dad.
[33:45] A: Okay, so bio dad.
[33:47] B: Yeah.
[33:48] A: Okay.
[33:49] B: Ex husband. Still technically husband. Whatever. But yeah, the way I lost custody and then I went to jail and kind of just lost contact and never picked it back up.
[34:04] A: Couldn't.
[34:05] B: Couldn't. Couldn't easily pick it back up.
[34:09] A: Sure.
[34:10] B: So a lot of guilt there because of the. Couldn't easily part. Like just because it wasn't easy. I didn't do it. I just kind of gave up. So that's a big one.
[34:22] A: Okay.
[34:22] B: That's a big one.
[34:23] A: So we want you to be more okay with that because you know what? You're not better off. And neither are they with you feeling bad.
[34:31] B: Right.
[34:32] A: It's not a Good motivator. And you probably weren't in a great situation. I mean, because you already told me that the drug of choice was meth.
[34:40] B: Right.
[34:41] A: And hanging out with little kids on meth is not good for little kids.
[34:45] B: I didn't start doing the meth until after I lost the kids.
[34:47] A: Oh, yeah, again, you lost the kids, but then you didn't get them back.
[34:52] B: Right. Because. Yeah. Went straight for the drugs.
[34:57] A: Not that. Again, not choice. Controlled choice. Makes sense.
[35:03] B: Yes.
[35:04] A: Notice I go, fuck that. No. Should have been. Right. So again, all that stuff that's going on, we want it so that we've got distance. To see it clearly. So that you get to be more okay even if what happened wasn't. We want you to be more okay because we're interested in your. On your way to being a better version of you. Which in the long run is better for all parties. Right. It's not better to get in and then fall off and then be in and then fall off and then be in and then fall off.
[35:42] B: Right.
[35:43] A: Right.
[35:44] B: Don't want that.
[35:45] A: Right. Not best for them. Right. So we want you to be rehabilitated. We want you to be changing your life. Life for the better. That then becomes something that people can see. Oh, my. Look at where it was. Look at where I am. Right, right. And that's a better thing.
[36:11] B: That's a much better thing.
[36:13] A: Yeah.
[36:14] B: Yes.
[36:14] A: Okay, cool. So I want you to get to be more okay with all that.
[36:19] B: Yeah.
[36:19] A: Even though what happened wasn't.
[36:21] B: Yeah.
[36:21] A: Or what you did, was it?
[36:23] B: Exactly.
[36:23] A: Yeah. Okay. I know how to do that too.
[36:27] B: Yeah.
[36:28] A: That's cool.
[36:29] B: That was a big one. You notice how I held that one out, so. And yeah.
[36:34] A: Pretty much got to get to know the guy first.
[36:35] B: Yeah. Got make sure he knows what he's doing before I let it all out. Yeah. That was a big one. That's it. I got a lot of trauma from the trafficker.
[36:53] A: No.
[36:54] B: Yeah.
[36:54] A: Because he was a really good guy.
[36:56] B: He was a great guy and he loved me to death. Yeah. He would just do anything to just make sure to ensure my happiness.
[37:03] A: Right. Exactly. Yes. That's how it works for them.
[37:06] B: Yeah. So a lot of trauma there. Trauma bond, etc, etc.
[37:13] A: You get the idea. Yeah.
[37:15] B: Yeah.
[37:15] A: Should probably.
[37:17] B: He is currently in prison.
[37:18] A: No. Probably a good place for him. Yeah.
[37:21] B: Most likely.
[37:21] A: Yeah.
[37:23] B: Yeah. There he shoots. It doesn't change anything.
[37:29] A: We want you to be free from all that.
[37:30] B: I want to be free from all that and recognize a horrible situation or relationship when I see it from a distance. I need to get ahead of this thing.
[37:44] A: No, I'm not so sure, you know What?
[37:48] B: What do you mean you're not so sure?
[37:50] A: I know. Right?
[37:50] B: Yes.
[37:52] A: Wouldn't it be better to be attracting and attracted to people who are. Well, yes. Not that I'm headed for the disaster and I know I'm going off the cliff, but it's far enough away that I haven't fallen yet. But I'm still headed towards it. Right. Because. But at least I know I'm getting into it.
[38:23] B: It's so accurate.
[38:27] A: Right.
[38:27] B: All that's missing was the horse and carriage.
[38:29] A: The issue is we want to get it so that I'm not finding that attractive and I'm not attracting it.
[38:38] B: Good idea.
[38:39] A: Makes sense.
[38:40] B: Really get ahead of this thing.
[38:42] A: Yeah. So it's not showing up.
[38:44] B: Right?
[38:46] A: Right. Whoever thought that way? Right. People who have no problem that don't bite their nails don't spend a lot of time thinking about biting their nails. What?
[39:04] B: I mean, I heard what you said.
[39:07] A: People who don't bite their nails don't spend a lot of time worrying about biting their nails.
[39:11] B: Right.
[39:12] A: Because it just doesn't show up.
[39:14] B: It's just not on the radar.
[39:16] A: It doesn't show up because they don't do it. It's not. They don't find it there. So somebody who's considered concerned about whether I'll find the bad guy and need to, like, that's a lot of energy towards that.
[39:29] B: Yeah.
[39:30] A: Right. It's kind of putting the light out. Here I am.
[39:33] B: Here I am, Horrible person. Come manipulate me.
[39:38] A: Right. We want to get that completely shifted.
[39:41] B: Yeah. We want to shut that down.
[39:42] A: Yeah.
[39:43] B: Yeah. That's bad.
[39:43] A: Okay. And I had to clean that stuff up, too.
[39:45] B: All right.
[39:46] A: Yeah. Let's go.
[39:47] B: What are you waiting.
[39:50] A: I'm not waiting.
[39:51] B: Oh, you just wait for me to finish.
[39:53] A: No. Now you're giving me all the things that we're gonna be doing.
[39:56] B: Oh, now I'm giving you the real stuff.
[39:58] A: I got nothing there. There ain't nothing in there.
[40:01] B: I don't think. Nothing I can think of. Can't think of a single thing.
[40:06] A: Yeah. Yeah. Right. So we want all that cleared up and gone, too.
[40:10] B: Yeah. If you don't mind.
[40:11] A: Right. Cause that's also impacted how you felt about you.
[40:14] B: Oh, yeah. Oh, for sure.
[40:16] A: Yeah.
[40:17] B: Yeah.
[40:17] A: And we want to get your own value to you, that you're good enough for you.
[40:24] B: Actually, not just saying it, right?
[40:26] A: No. Like feeling. Yes. Not just knowing, but feeling.
[40:29] B: Right, exactly.
[40:31] A: That's the whole part.
[40:32] B: Not even having to think about it.
[40:34] A: Where we're changing things for you. Is gonna be inside, Right? Right.
[40:39] B: Yeah, that would be nice.
[40:41] A: Yeah.
[40:41] B: Cause I can say it all day.
[40:43] A: Right?
[40:43] B: Yeah. Ooh, I'm good. I'm fine.
[40:45] A: Right? Sure. I am.
[40:49] B: That's. Me too. I'm fine. How are you? Oh, I'm good.
[40:53] A: Yeah.
[40:54] B: Ask me. Do I talk to an advocate ever about anything?
[40:59] A: No. Cause you think all the advocates are publix clerks, and when they ask you how you're doing, you're supposed to say, fine, I'm good. Right.
[41:07] B: Just checking out.
[41:08] A: Because nobody else at public. Oh. You know, I am so glad you asked me. I'm having a fucking shitty day.
[41:13] B: Having a horrible day.
[41:14] A: Let me tell you something. Could we turn the light off? Yeah. I know you people behind me know I'm gonna be talking for a while.
[41:20] B: The line gets long, you know?
[41:21] A: I mean. No, but yeah, we want you again. And then even in that way, we want you to have the freedom, too, if it makes sense to talk or share certain things, and the freedom to not have to if it doesn't, and to feel. Okay, both ways.
[41:38] B: That's a new one.
[41:39] A: Got it.
[41:40] B: Yeah.
[41:41] A: Right. Because even, like, you don't have freedom there. To. Or not to.
[41:46] B: Right.
[41:47] A: Right. Cool.
[41:50] B: Sounds good to me.
[41:51] A: All right, well, we know where we're headed. Anything else for you that you think would be useful?
[41:56] B: Always talking it out. Be the solution to the problem.
[42:00] A: Yeah.
[42:07] B: Just my brother.
[42:08] A: Yeah.
[42:09] B: Losing him. He's the first person that I like. Lost.
[42:13] A: Lost. Yeah.
[42:14] B: So. And it's still very fresh.
[42:16] A: Yeah.
[42:17] B: I don't know how to do it, so I just kind of like.
[42:21] A: Yeah, no, you just try not to think about it, because when you do, you're feeling bad. Right. Even just now. Right, Right.
[42:31] B: Be some kind of weird mind reader or something.
[42:33] A: No, I just watched what happened.
[42:37] B: The whole reaction.
[42:38] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[42:40] B: So that one's.
[42:40] A: That's what we want to get shifted so that you're connected to who he is in an ongoing way, so that you can feel and sense his presence with you in an ongoing way, even though he's no longer in his body. Because what's been missing is that you don't have access to all the experiences you acquired in being with him. Because even if you think about an experience, got to go through the loss, and now it clouds those experiences because that one's blown up. So we want you to have more access to who he is in an ongoing way, being connected to the place that he's never left, which is here. Right. And be more at peace. With it.
[43:25] B: Is that why you got the Iron man shirt? That's right. You know, I'm just checking, right?
[43:34] A: Yeah. There you go. You're good, Charlie. I like it. Yeah. Any other stuff?
[43:51] B: Little family stuff, but I feel like it's typical family stuff, but maybe not typical, but, like, just here and there. Family interactions that have just been shitty that I think about from time to time that I just, you know, just feel shitty about.
[44:06] A: Yeah.
[44:06] B: You know, things that were done to me, things I did.
[44:08] A: Yeah.
[44:09] B: Family.
[44:10] A: Yeah. Like mom, dad, other siblings, grandma.
[44:13] B: Yeah. I have a. I have a whole family. I have a whole family, so. Yeah, all those. All of them.
[44:21] A: Okay.
[44:23] B: Even the brother that passed away.
[44:25] A: Yeah. Yeah. So we want to get that stuff unwound.
[44:29] B: Yeah. He was an. But I miss him.
[44:32] A: Yeah.
[44:32] B: You know, all that.
[44:35] A: Okay.
[44:36] B: So that's pretty much it, I think.
[44:39] A: Cool.
[44:40] B: Not too bad. Yeah, you said. Yeah.
[44:49] A: That'S right. Not too bad. It's gonna be way better when we're done.
[44:54] B: Oh, that would be nice.
[44:55] A: Yeah. And you're gonna notice it right away.
[44:59] B: You're making a whole lot of big statements here. Oh, you just know what you're doing.
[45:05] A: Yeah.
[45:05] B: Okay.
[45:06] A: Don't. I mean, the. The person who's doing heart surgery because. Yeah, no, I know how to do that. It's gonna be successful. This is a. Don't you. It'll be fine when you're right. Shouldn't that guy be pretty confident? Yes. I'm not quite sure how to do this thing, but I'll give it a try. No, dude, I want the guy who.
[45:21] B: Knows what he's doing.
[45:25] A: You're fucking with my heart. No, I want the guy who knows what he's doing. Okay.
[45:30] B: Point taken. Point well taken.
[45:34] A: That's the other major difference. And I'll leave you with that. Most therapy says it's your job to do all of the work to get you better. I don't look at it that way. It's my job to do the work to get it better for you. Of course, in collaboration, I'll work with you. So it's my job to do it. Right. The dental hygienist's job to clean your teeth. You're there.
[45:57] B: She's gotta hold my mouth open.
[45:58] A: Collaborating, cooperating. Right. But it's her job to do the work. Same thing. You're in it. You don't have the ability to change it because you're in it. You need somebody else who knows how to change it for you.
[46:15] B: Okay.
[46:16] A: Yeah.
[46:17] B: It's a very good way to look at it.
[46:20] A: Yeah. Even the best dentist in the world doesn't pull his own cavities.
[46:23] B: Mmm. Mmm.
[46:26] A: He does it all day long inside.
[46:28] B: It's like you don't see him pulling his own teeth.
[46:32] A: Right? Yeah, very true. Cool. Well, I'm excited for us to get back together again.
[46:40] B: You're excited?
[46:40] A: It's gonna be fun.
[46:42] B: So when's that?
[46:43] A: I don't know. I don't know.
[46:45] B: Whatever they say.
