[00:00] A: Alright. So today is the 19th of May. Surely we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is transformative and life changing, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:18] B: Yes, it is.
[00:19] A: Alright, cool. So when you were in here the last time, what you told me was a variety of different things. One, we get that there had been that problematic using in particularly around, you know, pain pill stuff and meth. That was way problematic. We stopped that, which is really good.
[00:37] B: Six months over yesterday.
[00:39] A: Yeah. Congratulations. Thank you. You had mentioned that recently there has been a loss and that's also been weighing on you. There's been some health related stuff around mom that's been weighing on you. There's been some strong emotions, regret, remorse, sadness, kids. We want to get that stuff lifted, enlightened. So again, you're dealing with it with a little more ease in you. We get that there's been a variety of things that you've gone through, some of them recent, some of them a lot longer ago, that although those moments are over, the experiences are done. Going through them kind of left an impression on you. It kind of underneath the surface has continued to impact ways that you think, feel, act, react. We want to get the effect that that stuff has had cleared and gone. And then you also mentioned that there's a tendency for you to be having this negative, critical voice about you where it's kind of like saying negative and critical things about you and you tend to be really down and hard on you. So those are the big things.
[01:43] B: The big ones. Yep.
[01:46] A: That I'm remembering from what we talked about the last time out of what I said. Is there anything that I missed?
[01:53] B: Um, no. Well, not that I can think of right now.
[01:59] A: Okay. Any other stuff that kind of comes to mind that would be useful for me to know?
[02:06] B: Just the recent interaction, you know, I saw a lot of the anger and the stubbornness and the refusal to be wrong coming out.
[02:19] A: Yeah.
[02:20] B: And it's like the black and white thinking. Yeah, really, really came out this time and trying not to have that anymore.
[02:29] A: Yeah. Because we want to get you out of the world of either or that maybe we could include both and more. Right. Yeah. Right.
[02:39] B: It'd be okay.
[02:40] A: Right? It would be okay. Because that opens up more range in how we deal with stuff. Right. If I have. Either I do it this way or I do it that way. I don't have very much flexibility. Exactly right. We want to have both and more. It's like this silly example. I'll tell it to you. It's like when somebody says, I want to be happy. Well, then they have. In life, I'm either happy or I'm not happy. But you can be happy. You can be unhappy, which is not happy. You can be not unhappy. Now, if you're not unhappy, does it include being happy?
[03:17] B: Not necessarily.
[03:19] A: Well, yes, it does. It's inclusion versus exclusion. See, exclusion is and or, Right. I'm either this or that. The exclusive or this is and and is inclusive. It's kind of like somebody saying something, giving you a compliment. Wow, those are really pretty glasses. But, you know, totally negates it. They go, oh, those are really pretty glasses. And, oh, now it adds to it. You follow me with that? Very different thing. So we can be happy. We can be unhappy. We can be not unhappy. If we're not unhappy, it does include being happy, but it also includes all of the other emotions we could be experiencing other than being unhappy. Got it. So we open up range, right? Like in Florida, before most people started moving here to live, it was because they didn't have ACs. And then when they did have ACs, it was on and off. So if it got too hot, I'd turn it on. When it got too cold, I'd turn it off. Then I got too hot, I'd turn it on, and then it got too cold. Then they created this really cool thing, and it came from fuzzy logic of computers, because computers used to be zeros and ones for their coding. And then they created a thing called fuzzy logic, which gave us a range of numbers, like, let's say, 0 to 100, which worked on the thermostat really well.
[04:41] B: Yeah.
[04:41] A: Because then I can set to a certain thing, and I don't have to keep turning it on and off.
[04:47] B: I need that.
[04:48] A: Right? Yes, we want it. Exactly. That's what we're talking about. Right. So what I'm gonna do then, given we know where we're headed, what we want to get done, I'm gonna lay down a couple different things. Some of it will be kind of talked a little bit about the last time, but I'm going to lay down a foundational way of understanding the machinery, meaning how our brain works, why it works in the way it does, why past experiences can continue to have a negative effect on us, how we're going to go about unplugging and clearing, how we go about rewiring your brain. So that it works better once we lay that foundation down, then we're actually going to deal with different stuff and get it unplugged. When I'm explaining things, I'm going to use examples on purpose that aren't about you.
[05:35] B: Okay.
[05:35] A: And I do that because we want to be able to see something and it's harder to see it when it's right here than it is when it's over there.
[05:42] B: That's why I got sent to the assessment.
[05:45] A: Exactly. So that's what we want to get shifted and adjusted so that when you leave, you markedly notice things. Things being different and better. Meaning what people tell me over and over again is shit that used to really bother them that they've learned to never think about, but when they did it still they can think about that stuff and it doesn't have any of that effect on them at all.
[06:07] B: Okay, let's do that.
[06:08] A: Right. They're able to see things more clearly for what they are. They've got more distance, they've got more ease in dealing with stuff. Got it. So the lens we're looking through, is that what causes us to feel the way we feel in response to stuff, whether it's past or current or future, is something our brain has been doing to you. Right. So from the lens we're going, your brain makes you feel bad. Right. Because the lens we normally look through, that stuff causes this in me. When she acted like that, it made me feel this way. When that person said that stuff, I felt like this. And when they were doing that, it made me do this stuff causes feelings. That lens is not wrong. We just have this power. Tiny little amount. Yeah. Change it. We work hard to get a hell away from it. There's life, though. And you know, there's some stuff you can't change. Other stuff you can't get away from, other stuff you can't get to have not happened. The change is we got to do something else. That's what we're going to be doing. Adjusting how your brain emotionally reacts to stuff. I use this silly example. I might have said it to you before, but the lion approaching the zebra, people go, lion makes zebra scared. And we all go, yeah, of course, Stuh. But we look at it from the other lens, we go, wait, no. It's actually when the zebra itself sees senses, feels, smells, or thinks that the lion's coming. It's zebra's brain, not lion, that's causing all of zebra to be alert, motivated and stronger. We do call that scared. It does run away.
[07:35] B: Yeah.
[07:36] A: And yes, the brain of zebra does it to zebra in response to lion approaching. But it's zebra's brain, Right? So your brain has been making you feel bad in response to stuff. First question, do you really think it wants you to feel bad? No, it doesn't. Do you think it would want you to feel good? No, it doesn't. No. No. That's the fucked up part about the brain. What an asshole. What we've learned in working with thousands of different people over time. You're a bright gal. I'm a pretty bright guy. But most of our brain emotionally works like the brain of an animal. And an animal doesn't have feelings because their brain is concerned about their mood, their affect, how they feel about themselves, their sense of self esteem, their sense of self worth. Whether they feel lovable or good enough, it only causes emotion to motivate them to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. That's the error. Not for them, but for us. Because our brain does the same thing. So when a rabbit sees a fox approach, their brain makes them experience fear. Not because they want him to have a bad day, but to make him run really fast away. Squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire. Pain. But not because the brain of the squirrel wants the squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid, dumb moron. Now it's an idiot because all the other squirrels are gonna laugh. Me, because I'm marred. No, just get the tail out of the fire. See, the crazy thing for us to consider is all the negative emotions we experience. Anger, hurt, sadness, sorrow, grief, guilt, shame, rage, resentment, angst, upset, worry, pain. All that shit is being caused by the part of our brain that works like an animal for the same reason. To motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. The issue is that many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem we can't solve.
[09:24] B: Okay, so what do we do?
[09:29] A: Good news, right? It's causing us to feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. Good news, we don't need to. Because the majority of the problems that our brain makes us feel bad about are in time periods that are already finished or in time periods that haven't even happened. So we don't need to solve it. We need to update the timing and see, just like the situation that you had with the other residential. There's what was going on, and then there was all of what we'll call the past. Similars through life experiences that were mapped into that situation, which is why your reaction was way higher than the situation needed. Do you follow me with that? Like, if we watch two guys who are arguing over something and I go, surely the thing they're arguing about emotionally, 0 to 10, where is it? You're like, I don't know, it's like a one. It's not a big deal thing, right? But we look at them, their faces are red, they're screaming obscenities at each other. One guy's fists are pounding the table, the other guy's like, throwing shit. Like, their emotions are like they're not dealing with what's happening, they're dealing with what's happening. Plus all of the past similars that are getting mapped into it. What we're interested in doing is getting it so that you are much more emotionally present. So one of the outcomes where we're headed is a you who's much more emotionally present, meaning she's dealing with what is going on without the effect of what has or the worry about what might. Got it. That's one of the areas that we're headed. Okay, cool.
[11:08] B: Sounds like a flame.
[11:09] A: Yeah. So if we know that it's in a time period that no longer exists, we don't need to solve the problem. We need to update the timing. That's the error in our human brain. And it's a timing error because we have a different part of our brain that an animal is missing our intellect. And see, with our intellect, it does give us access to time, Right? Animals don't have time. You can't ever go around and ask the squirrel, hey, what time is it?
[11:36] B: It's about 4:30.
[11:37] A: You're not gonna know. Right?
[11:40] B: Gotcha.
[11:41] A: Go to the raccoon. Hey, what time is it? What do you mean, what time is it? I have no idea.
[11:45] B: Dinner time always right for the raccoons.
[11:49] A: Light out, it's dark out, I got nothing. Right? So. So the problem is a timing error. And because our intellect gives us time, you know, you're sitting here now, you can remember doing something earlier. You can think about something you might do over the weekend. No other animal can do that. That's not a problem when the experiences are positive or when they're neutral. Because if they're positive or when they're neutral, our brain gets the difference between the memory of it and the experience of it. Right? For example, somebody's telling us about a great trip that they had to Key west, right? They took the little boat that goes down from Fort Myers. They got there real fast, right? They went out on Duvall street, they had some drinks, right? They went to Hemingway's house, they went deep sea fishing, right? They saw a Florida marlin, right? They got their picture next to the sign that said 90 miles from Cuba. They wrote on little like mopeds, right? They tell us, right, like they tell us all about it. But you and I both know that they know the difference between the memory of being there and being there. It's totally clear. But when it's negative, and again, it doesn't matter whether it's a big negative or a little negative. It doesn't matter whether the negative happened a long time ago when I was a very young child or yesterday. And it doesn't matter whether it was a one time occurrence or happened multiple times or years. Any negative experience. Weird, bad, sad, awful, sad, shocking, scary, horrific, confusing, awful, traumatic.
[13:17] B: Why do we do that? But not with the watch.
[13:20] A: Our brain will confuse the data, memory and info, thinking it's the experience, it does it for survival, right? A rabbit who hears a twig snap and runs fast away has a better chance of living than the one who heard the twig snap and went, not George, not George, Joe, shit, right? So that's where the problem lies, is that we were built, you know, and people with different religious stuff will say, God did a wonderful job of creating a system, right? The human body, designed to keep us alive. The joke that he played on all of us is figure out how to be happy. That's on you because there's no programming about being happy, right? That's right. That's right. So that's the first thing, is that when it's negative, our brain confuses the memory, thinking it's the experience. So it explains why somebody's telling us, you know, they're talking about something that happened to them when they were 14, right? And maybe it was their older brother's best friend who you know, happened to rape them. And all of a sudden they start telling us about it. They get to the part where they're in the bedroom and he's. And their face is like contorted and their voice is all choked up and they're like tearful. Now this is the person who's 44 years old. So it's 30 years later.
[14:43] B: Mm, still feels like you're living.
[14:47] A: Yes. What the hell is happening?
[14:49] B: I know we're nice people kindly listening to them.
[14:54] A: What is going on? And what's happening is emotionally the brain is confusing that memory, thinking it's the Experience. That's why they're having that emotional reaction, which we can totally tell they were having when they were talking to us. Because guess what? We're perceptive. We saw it all over them, but it was also affecting them. Even over the weekend when they were, you know, drawing. It was under the surface. Logically, up here, they know that they're safe there with us, that they survived, that they're okay. They even realize it wasn't their fault and they didn't do anything wrong. And they might even know that some of it felt good, but not because they wanted it, but because the body part touched. In that way, they know it all why inside, they still feel. Got it. Because part of their brain never got updated. So they err for all emotional wounds, not physical wounds. Right. I break my foot 10 years later, if I'm still bothered by it. You're like, what is wrong with him? His foot is fine.
[15:53] B: Broke both my arms when I was 10.
[15:55] A: Right. You're not. Oh, no. Right, right. Because they still work. Right. But all emotional wounds get stuck because the brain never gets that it ended, even though logically I know it did. Emotionally, my brain got stuck with all those stuck moments. Meanings get flooded and attached to it. And what did we learn when we were little? The good happens bad because I'm good. So all little children from age born up are reinforced with the notion that good things happen when I'm good. If you're a good boy or a good girl, your life will be good. Santa brings you presents when you're good. Mom and dad gives you hugs and kisses when you're good. You get rewarded for being good. Good things happen when you're good, which is great if life is always good. Fuck. I've never met anybody where life has been nothing but good. No. And the error isn't just that we told them that life is good and good things happen when they're good. It's that the opposite must also be true. Bad only happens when you're bad. Bad only happens if you've done something wrong. The reason that you got punished is because you were being bad. Which isn't true because an adult, you know that bad shit happens to you without you doing anything wrong. I'm minding my own business. Some guy freaking smashes me with his car. He was drinking. What? I didn't do anything. I was just right. Bad things can happen without me doing anything wrong. But because of what we learned first, that still sticks. So it would feel like it was my fault. Right. That's why you know the guy who's gone out, right. And he got beat up by a bunch of thugs. They took a baseball bat and broke his knees. Horrible thing. Right? And they happened to be wearing. Right. Def Leppard shirts. Right. Now he sees somebody with the deaf. Well, the issue back then wasn't the shirt, was it? Is that what bothered him? No. Getting hit with the baseball, that break. But because it co occurred, it got stuck. Right, right. It explains why somebody telling us about something that they went through and they feel like it was their fault. Like the girl who got the ride home from her co workers friend and then he happened to like force himself into her apartment and rape her. That's an awful experience. And she blames herself for being so stupid. I mean he was being kind walking her to the door because she doesn't live in a nice neighborhood. Oh, she should have known better. Yes, you should be thinking that your co worker's friend is going to. But because it was bad, it's my fault. Make sense? I got dropped off at uncle's house and I spent the week with him. And while he was there he molested me. Great. Well, I should have known better, right? You should know that your uncle, what you're seven, right? Like all that stuff happens where then it feels like it meant something about me. Like I should have known better. Idiot me. You should have known that your uncle was a pedophile. Oh right, I should have because I'm seven. Because I even know what a pedophile is then. Right? But because it was bad, it's my fault. So with all the negative experiences, what make them feel worse about me and why they stay stuck even more is that that meaning gets attached. That makes me feel like it was my fault. Because of course if it was bad, it is my fault. Because bad only happens when I'm bad. Right now we've got those two things locked. And that's why our brain is hyper vigilant and super sensitive. But what it's looking through is a little pinhole at the world looking for anything that's similar to anything that was painful but it confuses similar as saying. So the weirdest thing, this guy is totally into this girl and they're both going to be intimate tonight. They're excited, like he's wanting to, she's wanting to. They're making out, right? And she's kind of flirting. She touches her fine. He does this and he's like, what the fuck is wrong with me? The girl I'm into is just touching me in a Way that should feel good to me. And I did this. Yeah, but is there any similarity to Uncle Mike when you're 11? Yeah, yeah. No, it's a Hannah. Yeah, but that was scrubby man hand. That was pretty nail painted. Female hand is a hand like it doesn't. Right. You follow me with that? So the error that goes on for human beings is our brain is scanning for anything that's similar. But similar gets confused as same. Right. The soldier doesn't dive on the ground when the firework bursts in the air because he didn't know it was the fourth of July. He was the same dude that lit the fireworks. Watch. It's gonna be great. Different part of his brain confused the boom with a grenade that was not conscious. Got it. So all of those components have only one common denominator and that's distortion. Because think of it. If I take my hand and I slam it into the sand at the beach and I pick it up, it does leave an imprint. But is the imprint the same thing as my hand? Is the meaning at all? What happened? Did she put herself in danger? Did she get a ride home with her co workers friends? Right. How different is a firework from a grenade? Right. So instead of trying to process and get the bad feelings out of me, really cry it out. Right. We want to get the good news in.
[21:22] B: Yes.
[21:23] A: To parts of the brain that don't know certain awful events ended. We want to get the good news into certain parts of the brain that don't know that I survived it, that I made it through it, that I'm okay. That would be really good news.
[21:36] B: Yeah.
[21:37] A: Right. That's what we're gonna be doing. Does that make sense?
[21:41] B: Yes.
[21:41] A: As we do that, it's gonna free up energy because energy is being used to deal with all that shit. Whether I think about it or not. Right. Just like the refrigerator is using energy. Right. Whether I open the door or not. To keep the things cold. I might notice that it's cold because I went in to get my drink of orange juice, but the refrigerator's been on and it's using energy the whole time. I don't notice it Right. Until I open the door. Same kind of thing. So all the energy that was stuck there is going to be released to be able to be used, recycled as restorative and renewing energy. In addition, it's going to change the way that the programming got laid down in your brain. Because with that programming laid down in the brain the way it's been, anytime you encounter stuff, it sets it all off. As the programming changes, it no longer sees similar as identical. It gets to see similar as different. I get to be distinguished and more clear.
[22:48] B: Sounds good.
[22:49] A: Got it.
[22:49] B: Yes.
[22:51] A: Yeah. So the you that I'm seeing, one, she's much more emotionally present, dealing with what is without the emotional effect of what has the you that I am seeing is a lot lighter. She's much more comfortable in her own skin, and she reads other people's garbage as being about them, not me. So that she's seeing it more clearly for what it is. And given that she sees it as their stuff, depending on who it is, she might respond in a caring, compassionate, and understanding way. She might respond in a very firm and directive way. Or she might. All right. Let it go by because there's no stick.
[23:30] B: Not my circus.
[23:32] A: That's right. Not my monkey. Not my circus. Exactly. Got it.
[23:37] B: Got it.
[23:38] A: Good job. So this is where we're headed. So that you get to be more free. Free to be much more. Okay.
[23:45] B: In.
[23:45] A: You. Got it. So then the next little piece that we want to do is we want to do some processes that are designed to get you. By the way, any questions about that stuff?
[23:55] B: Nope, I'm up to speed.
[23:56] A: Good. We want to get your body into the right states for healing, and the right states for healing are always states of rest. It's why colds, flus, or surgery. We tell people, too. Rest. Right. So we've got some really cool brain levers that are designed to put the body at rest. First lever's silly. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. So I don't mean like, ah. I mean just a little bit when you slightly lower your jaw. Right. Not all the way. Just a little bit. Right. Maybe the width of an index finger. When you slightly lower your jaw, what it does is it activates a nerve called the vagal nerve that it's connected to the whole enteric system, which is from, like, here to here. And it begins to put the body into more. Parasympathetic response.
[24:44] B: Say that word again.
[24:45] A: Parasympathetic response. So it's a resting response. So you slightly lower your jaw. The second lever.
[24:54] B: Easy, but it's not.
[24:55] A: It is not hard.
[24:57] B: Okay, go ahead. Second.
[25:00] A: Right. Because you can close your mouth.
[25:02] B: Mm. Very tight jaw.
[25:04] A: Right.
[25:05] B: Now all I'm noticing is how tight my jaw is.
[25:07] A: And then you can, you know, open your mouth slightly. You would think, like, if you were whistling.
[25:15] B: Okay, I can't whistle, but.
[25:16] A: Right. You don't have to. But you notice how it's just a Little bit lower.
[25:19] B: Gotcha.
[25:20] A: Got it. Good job. Right. So the first lever is we slightly lower our jaw. The second lever is we rest our tongue at the bottom of our mouth. Which might sound crazy, but when we rest our tongue at the bottom of our mouth, it starts to turn down some of our internal chatter and actually help to satiate the body. So we slight satiate. Mean, like, you know, calm.
[25:41] B: Hold on.
[25:42] A: Satisfy.
[25:43] B: Satiate the body.
[25:44] A: Okay. Like when somebody's satiated, they're like, really like, oh, I like your words, but.
[25:51] B: I gotta know what they mean or I'm not gonna.
[25:52] A: I'm glad you're asking. That's a good thing because I want you to be on the same page with me too. It's a collaborative process.
[25:59] B: Gotcha. Learning new words in our thing.
[26:02] A: Yeah.
[26:02] B: Hopefully they stick.
[26:03] A: Yeah. Or not. It doesn't matter. So your jaw is slightly lowered and you rest your tongue. And the third lever, as you begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper as you inhale. And then there's a pause, and then slightly slower as you exhale. So it's a longer exhale.
[26:21] B: The 4, 7, 8.
[26:23] A: Not quite 4, 7, 8, because we're not going to do the counting aspect of things. And it's not such a long pause, but it's more about you breathe in and then out. So go ahead and slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue. Begin to. Now breathe in a way that's a little. Little bit slower and deeper so that as you exhale, your exhale becomes a little bit longer than your inhale. Right. And as you're breathing in this way, notice how's your body feeling now? Like, more tense or more calm?
[27:08] B: More calm.
[27:09] A: Isn't that cool? That already works.
[27:11] B: Just like that.
[27:12] A: Right. So then the next lever is when we're in highly elevated beta waves. Beta waves are fine for most states because it's what we're in when we're talking. Awake state focused state, conversation state. Good for arithmetic, attention. Right.
[27:31] B: Studying.
[27:31] A: But when beta waves get elevated, they run at a much higher hertz. They create a tunneling of our vision, and it's where all anxiety, agitation, irritation, frustration, anger lives. Have you ever heard people like, you know, I'm so mad I'm seeing red. Right. And their vision narrowed in. Right, Got it. We want to begin to move our brain waves down into alpha waves. Alpha waves are correlated with what surfers call flow or athletes call the zone. So it's alert by relaxed. Okay. And how it works is it's an opening of our awareness to our peripheral vision. Peripheral vision just simply means sides of the eyes. So again, you slightly lower your jaw and you rest your tongue. And you breathe in a way that's a little bit slower. That's right. And deeper, exhaling a little bit longer. As you're breathing in this way, you can look across and see me and my nose. You'll see my fingers stay looking at my nose as my fingers open up. As my fingers get wide, you can notice them wiggling with the sides of your eyes. Seeing my nose, you see my fingers with the sides of your eyes. You also pick up the space towards the side windows and doors. The space that's between us, the space that's beyond me, the space behind you, underneath you and above your head. And again, as you're noticing this space, check inside. How's your body feeling now?
[29:07] B: Very, very chill.
[29:08] A: Isn't that cool how that looks? Right? I know. I think it's the neatest thing in the world.
[29:13] B: Super focused on your nose now, though, right?
[29:16] A: That's okay. You know, it's there, it's there. Can't miss it. Right? So then the next lever is, if you've heard somebody use the phrase maybe said it yourself, I'm under a lot of stress, right? And in order for somebody to be underneath the stress, where does the stress have to be? That's right. So we know the reversal is to get out from under and rise up above it. We have the other metaphor of bird's eye view, which means I'm able to see everything as being underneath and below me. Because I'm above it, I'm over it. And not a perch bird, a soaring bird that's free to fly through the sky. Right? So one more time, your jaw is slightly lowered and you rest your tongue. You breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe. You look across and you see me and my nose. You see the fingers, they go out wide. You notice the wiggling with the sides of your eyes. You pick up the space towards the windows and doors. You notice the space between us. You can see the space beyond me and sense the space behind you, underneath you and above your head, and realize that the space goes out from the room in every direction and in all ways, all the way to outer space and beyond. Now, just for a moment, close your eyes and imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof so that you rise way up above it all in the sky. You're having this really cool bird's eye view, being able to see everything as being underneath and below you because you're above and over it, just like a bird. Free to soar, fly, glide, move all around in all ways, in any direction. Free. Big, wide turns, curves, arching angles. You soar, you fly, you glide, you're free. That's right. When you're ready, bring awareness back down and into your body to reassess, associate inside you. That's right. Take one more deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. Right. And what are you noticing now? Isn't that cool?
[31:51] B: I feel exactly where you moved your hand. Yeah.
[31:55] A: That were set and balanced inside. That's right. And so now that you're centered and balanced, think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something beautiful. Like as you're looking at it, you're like, what is it that you see?
[32:10] B: Bluebird.
[32:11] A: Yes. And isn't there a moment when you're experiencing and seeing the bluebird? You're feeling peaceful and excited, and people might suggest to you that it's the bluebird that gets. Gives you the feelings. But if we looked at it from that other lens, we'd go, wait, no. Isn't it maybe that seeing it and experiencing it drew your awareness down inside? Because what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited? In the same way, if my hands are cold and I move them towards the campfire and I say, surely, my goodness, is fire getting hotter? Is the fire at all getting hotter? Or am I becoming more aware of the heat? So you and I both know that in your life there have been multitudes of occasions, situations and times where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. The stressors, the angers, the upsets, the hurts, the guilts, the shames of me. But no matter where your awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited, just like two of us are here. How do you know it? You look around, your senses bring in data. Intellect organizes it. That's light of knowledge. At your center, it's a brighter light, light of wisdom. So we've got knowledge and wisdom. And I work with all sorts of people who've gone through all sorts of stuff. I remember one girl I worked with, older brother of all people, used to take his GI Joe figures and march the them up her leg and perk them in her. So there was a lot of uck around all of that. Right. And as we worked together, cleared out all the discomfort, the pain, the Guilt, the shame. It's gone. And so she's sitting across from me. She's got this, like, glow on her. And I go, you know all that. Ugh. I go, where was it? And she's like, it's gone. I don't feel any of it. I go, I know. Isn't that cool? Right? It is awesome. And she says, yeah. I go, but where was it? And we started thinking. I go, was it at the surface level? She's like, no, it wasn't in a level thing. I said, oh, maybe it was hiding in your center. She's like, really? How could that stuff survive at the light when I'm peaceful and excited? I said, huh? Well, then where was it? And she said it to me. She goes, oh, it was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I said, well, what happened? She lights have joined, the shadows are gone. I said, whoa, that's cool. And then we started talking about how people tend to screw up identity words on the time. They say things like, I'm anxious, I'm depressed, I'm shy, thinking the way they feel is who they are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm really, really upset, and you go, why are you so upset? And I go, sure. You'll never believe what he did to me. And you go, what did he do? Well, first he brought me into this room, sat me on this chair that immediately my head goes down and my feet come up. And you're like, yeah, you're at the dentist. Well, then he took this light, kind of positioned it right in my eyes. I can't see a damn thing. You're like, yeah, no, you're at the dentist. And then I go, well, then he took this cold metal instrument and shoved it inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness. And you're what? And I go, charlie, my mouth. I'm at the dentist.
[35:24] B: You got me.
[35:25] A: That's funny.
[35:26] B: I'm sorry. It's not funny.
[35:28] A: But it's the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother in the GI Joe figure. I said, when you were little, he messed with your stuff. And she looked at me, and she had that same glow and that smile. She said, that's right. He did. And for a long time, that hurt my body, it hurt my feelings, it hurt my thinking. And then she started to, like, get like. And I go, what? She goes, but you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my stuff. He never got me. And I went, whoa, that's pretty powerful. She goes, do you know How I know that? I go, no, how do you know that? And she goes, well, I remember talking about how most people walk around thinking that they are their bodies, that my body is me. I mean, that's what happens when people die. They die, their body stops. They're gone. She said, but somebody told me, what if you're not your body? What if you have a body? What if your body's totally yours? That is definitely your toe, right? Yeah, but what if your body isn't you? And she started talking about how she has an aunt that lost her thumb. And when her aunt sees people now.
[36:52] B: My brother lost all his toes, right?
[36:56] A: Lost her thumb in an accident. She still plays the French horn, right? But when she goes and visits people, they don't say to her, amy, I'm glad almost all of you could come over. They don't say that. Why? Because she's all there. I'm sorry, right. Even if that part of her body is missing. So we could say, you totally have a body. It's yours. It isn't actually you. And then she says, you know what? People also think that they're their thoughts. Well, yeah, but do you know that you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? I go, what? She goes, yeah, you're not even the thinker of them. Your brain is.
[37:32] B: Who's the doctor here?
[37:33] A: I go, really? Your brain is the thinker of your thoughts? She goes, yes, and you are not your brain. You have one, it's yours, but it isn't actually you. Whoa, that's deep. Right. So I'm not my body and I'm not my thoughts. You're not even a feeling because you have different ones at different times, and you're still you regardless of which one you're feeling. So you can't be feeling. You're clearly not what you do because you've done a lot of different things. And when you stop doing one of those things to do a different thing, you didn't stop existing. Right. So then we started thinking. Well, that's a really weird question that starts to come up. Because if you're not your body, your thoughts, your feelings, or what you do, then what the heck are you? So we're going to say, for our purpose of what we're doing together today, that the who you are, the real essence, what we religiously like to call soul, spirit, that the who you are is what you became aware of as you see the bluebird. That the who you are is the light at the center. And see the light that is you surely it can't be touched in that way. Right? Isn't that kind of cool? And then we did a different experiment because I said, oh, I get it now. That the light that is you, which we call soul, and we relate to it as mine because I say it's my soul. That what we should really maybe say instead is the light at the center is me. I have things like fingers and toes, but my soul isn't a thing I have. It's me. And we went, huh, that's kind of cool. And then she says to me, watch what happens. And I go, okay, what's going to happen? She goes, I'm going to take my hand like this. So take your hand like this, right? She said, look at that spot on the back of your hand.
[39:40] B: Hand.
[39:41] A: Then I'm gonna take my hand and I'm gonna move it towards your hand. And as I move my hand in towards your hand, you'll see it moving in, but you'll notice something happen that before my hand. That's right. Ever touches your hand, that you'll be able to feel my hand.
[39:55] B: That's weird.
[39:56] A: Isn't that cool?
[39:57] B: That is pretty cool.
[39:58] A: How you can feel the energy. Yeah, right. From my hand. The warmth, the tingling within the finger, fingers and the palm of your. That's right. Hand. That's right. And you're already noticing little twitches happening within the fingers. Right. And then we can just take that hand just like that and tilt it down. Right. Then we just kind of touch it a little bit ambiguously. Because when your hand and arm gets touched ambiguously, you don't have to do anything, but your unconscious starts to do stuff. Stuff. That's right. And see, you can notice that that hand has become a little bit more wax. Like it's kind of got that waxy flexibility. Isn't that kind of interesting?
[40:41] B: Yeah, that's really cool.
[40:42] A: But see, all of this is just letting you know that your unconscious right now is responding to you.
[40:49] B: Okay.
[40:50] A: Your unconscious is responding and organizing towards the future you. That you and I are collaborating. Right. And what'll happen is that hand will begin to drop down, but only at the same rate at which you drop down and inside towards delight at the center. What you became aware of as you see the bluebird. Right. So as that hand just drops down on its own pace, you don't have to do anything. And it might become curious, Right. To notice what. What's happening in you. Right. How's your body feeling now?
[41:27] B: Warm.
[41:28] A: It is feeling warm because you're warming up to all the changes that are already underway. Right. Isn't that interesting? It is, right? Your unconscious is responding to you. It's not how I did it. It's that. Well, right. It's your unconscious conscious responding to you. Because you and I are collaborating towards a mutual goal that we both want. Right? The deal with grief. And when grief gets stuck or frozen, it tends to be the moment of the loss that blocks access to the essence of who the person is for me, right. So when a guy told me that his wife, who had been married to for 42 years, years, got ALS, there was this progressive decline. Every time he thought about her in detailed pain, even though he'd been remarried and it was six years after, anytime he thought about life, he was in pain. Because every time he thought about it, the moment that was there was him kissing your cold forehead as her body was willed to the hearse. And what was that moment doing? It was blocking access to all of the other moments that he acquired in being with her. So when people walk around and say, you know, I have the remains of my parents in my closet. I had a client one time tell me, my parents are in my closet.
[42:53] B: Yeah.
[42:54] A: And she said, no. No, I mean, just the remains, just the ashes, right? I said, no, that's not even what remains of your parents. What remains of your parents is in the experiences that you acquire in being with them that you can't ever lose. Because what do we get from people that matter to us? Is it the trinkets, the necklace, the things? It's the experiences. And once you've acquired an experience, can you lose it? No. People can't take away. My first time going to Disney when I was nine. Can you lose something you don't yet have? Can you lose it if you've never experienced it? So if you can't lose it you've acquired, you can't lose what you don't yet have. Where's loss? Maybe when people's body stop, it's not that they stop, it's that their bodies stop because they're no longer in need of it. Because it stopped, they exited it. We don't pick them up in the same way, but it doesn't mean that they're not here. Right. If we took a glass of ice and we put it out on the, you know, table out on the patio, and an hour goes by and a little kid comes up and says, hey, somebody stole your ice and replaced it with water, we would laugh to ourselves and say, nobody stole the ice. But what happened? Is that it went through a transformation from solid state to liquid state. But the molecule that made it up, the H2O, is identically the same. Our perceptions totally change. The kid gets it. We then leave that same glass of water out on the patio. A week goes by, kid comes back and say, somebody stole the water. Nobody stole it. It evaporated. He goes, what's that? I go, well, it went from liquid to gas. The molecules identically the same. How we pick it up totally changed. And he's looking at us really confused because he goes, because if I can't see it and I don't touch it, how can I feel it? I go, right. Well, it's because you're in Florida. It's all around you. And then we put them in, right? We put him in the desert of Arizona. We go, you don't feel any of it here, do you? We bring him back to floor and go, see, don't you feel it? And he shows us the rain clouds, and we capture the water, we put it in the freezer, and the kid goes, oh, my goodness. It's all the same thing. We go, that's right. So when people's bodies stop, it's not that they stop, it's that their bodies stop. But it's always the shock of knowing them the way we did that blocks access to our experiencing them in an ongoing way. Make sense? So one of the things that we want to do is we want to lighten and lift. Because Einstein was a really smart dude. Do you know how I know he was really smart? Everybody after him who's really, really smart is called an Einstein. So the dude had to be brilliant, right? And what he said is, energy plus matter equals this physical existence. And what became the second law of thermodynamics is energy cannot be destroyed, it transforms. So when the body stop, it's not that they stop, it's that their bodies stop, right? So where we're headed is a you who's much more present and clear, connected to what matters, dealing with difficulties, with more flexibility, freedom and ease and much more content and much more. Okay, in. You got it. And as we organize towards all of this, take your hands out like this. Take your fingers up like that. Good. Separate them. Look right in between your fingers. As you look between your fingers, you can try to keep your fingers apart. But what you might begin to notice is that the more you try to keep your fingers apart, the closer they get. And see, it's your unconscious responding to you moving your fingers closer and closer to touch. And what will happen surely when your fingers do eventually touch, as you know, they're moving closer than they did, that when your fingers do touch, you'll simply close your eyes. Right. And with your eyes closed, you can drift down deeper and down deeper inside towards delight at your center. What you become aware of as you see the bluebird, that calm and peaceful, easy flowing energy, delight that is you. That's right. All of this is happening. What you can be consciously aware of. Oh, and by the way, what you're not consciously noticing at the same time. Because your unconscious is wonderful, responsive and totally interested in serving you. Working in ways that are best for you. That's right. That part of your brain also has direct access to the control panel. That's right. And knows exactly what to do to change things, to cause more healing. That's right. Right. And then you can write. When you're ready, open your eyes. Good job. And what are you noticing now?
[47:56] B: I feel happy.
[47:57] A: You do, don't you? And as you're feeling happy and body's more calm, the other than conscious part is going to travel back down the timeline of negative experiences. Things that happened when you were really little to more recent to just the other day. It's going to narrow, begin to group and categorize those moments into different things. It doesn't necessarily mean it's chronological, but it's just going to be categorized into different things. And then that part of your brain is going to narrow, pinpoint and bring a moment to your awareness that would be useful for us to unplug and clear out the effect it's continued to have on you. Right. So as you and I are organizing towards the future, you practice clear, light, free. That other part travels back and will bring an experience to mind. You know, one of those ones that we don't like to talk about because whenever we do, we feel gravity. You got one of those? Yeah. Good, right. The one that just came to mind happened about how long ago?
[48:57] B: Five years.
[48:58] A: Five years. Good. The feeling tones that come up are feeling tones of what is it? Anger, hurt, sadness, grief, guilt, shame, regret. A combination, all those. Okay, good. So first question I have for you. Would it be okay to get that gone, meaning the bad feelings, if the bad feelings were gone, would it in any way, shape or form mean that what happened was okay? Right. You get to be okay even if what happened wasn't good. If that happened five years ago, there have been other things you've done after that that were more enjoyable than that. What's one thing anytime from when that was over until yesterday. That was more fun than that.
[49:31] B: Talking to my daughter.
[49:32] A: Yeah, talking to your daughter. Way more fun than that moment. Good. Something else.
[49:38] B: That's it. It just never ran out.
[49:40] A: I don't know. I think you're going to the auction with my parents. Going to where?
[49:44] B: The auction.
[49:45] A: The auction. Okay. I thought you said the oxygen. I'm like, it's all around us. What are you talking about?
[49:50] B: Straightforward. Going to the auction.
[49:53] A: Going to the auction with your parents. Right. And one other thing that you dodged recent that was more enjoyable.
[50:00] B: Seeing you at the library.
[50:02] A: Yeah, Seeing me at the library. All those things happen after that.
[50:05] B: Yes.
[50:05] A: There's a part of the brain that doesn't know any moment beyond that. So we have good news to get in. How we clear it? Simple. I don't know how to do it. Okay. A intend to be with me here now, when you tell me what happened quickly, in a minute or less. So you're going to intend to be with me. You're going to tell me what happened five years ago to go. That happened. That happened. That happened. That happened was done while intending to be with me. My job, by the way, is to keep you with me.
[50:30] B: Okay.
[50:31] A: And I know that I can be more fun than that was. And the reason you want to be with me is that this is what's happening. That is it. We're working on the goal where we want you to be. Right. Got it. So that thing happened. Happened about five years ago. When it happened, you're where?
[50:46] B: Virginia.
[50:46] A: Virginia. Good. Daytime or nighttime? Daytime. In a house or an apartment?
[50:52] B: In the courthouse.
[50:52] A: You're in the courthouse. Good job. Right. So you're in the courthouse in Virginia and you're standing like next to an attorney.
[50:57] B: By myself.
[50:58] A: Oh, you're by yourself. Right. Good. And then there's other people there. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[51:03] B: The judge ordered custody. Somebody else.
[51:08] A: So the judge said, you. These kids are going to stay with their aunt. Their aunt. Good job. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[51:16] B: I fell on the floor.
[51:19] A: You fell on the floor. Right. Good.
[51:20] B: Crying.
[51:21] A: And then you're crying. Right. And then went. Right.
[51:23] B: Then me and my brother drove back to Florida.
[51:25] A: And then. And then that ended. And then you left the courthouse.
[51:28] B: What about the courthouse?
[51:29] A: And then you drove back to Florida and then that moment was over. No, it wasn't over.
[51:34] B: The kids had to go to Virginia. They were in Florida.
[51:36] A: Right. So then the kids had to go up to Virginia and you had to say bye to them.
[51:40] B: Didn't get to say bye.
[51:41] A: Okay.
[51:42] B: Didn't get to say bye. I went to go pick him up from school and a police officer was waiting for me, and I went to the psych ward.
[51:50] A: Oh, and you went to psych ward.
[51:51] B: Never got to say bye.
[51:52] A: Right. Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[51:54] B: They came and got my kids while I was in psych ward.
[51:56] A: Right, good.
[51:57] B: Spent 30 days in psych ward. Never got to.
[52:00] A: And then you got out of the psych ward, and then that moment was over and they were living with your aunt. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, Right. Like talk to your daughter or go to the auction or see me at the library. Now, notice as you were recalling that there was discomfort, not because that was such a sucky moment, but because your brain was confusing that sucking moment, thinking it's happening. It's caused the discomfort trying to motivate you to get that sucky moment to stop. Good news, it has. We never go backwards of the memory, though. We only go forward. But when you go backwards, it literally unplugs it and takes away the charge. Watch what happens. So you see me at the library, we're going to the auction. We were talking to your daughter. Right. Then you got out of the psych ward. Then you're in the psych ward. Then they had taken the kids and you went to go. Then the police officer was there, and then you went to go pick them up from school. Then you and your brother drove back, and then you left the courthouse and you got up from the ground. And then they said they're going to live in the end. And then the judge made the ruling, and then you guys had gone to court, and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing as I ran through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it easier to deal with? Isn't that weird?
[53:15] B: I stayed right here with you.
[53:18] A: Right. Notice how different that was. Because what's happening for the first time is your brain is beginning to read it as data about something that happened versus happening. Got it. Third, the emotional brain doesn't get logic, but it does get patterns of association. And the associated pattern is that the memory of that happening and the experience of it happening have been glued together. So they're living as if they're the same thing. But there are things you can remember doing today that you know you're not doing. Like putting your glasses on. You can remember doing it. You might even remember where you were when you did it. Right. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your glasses on, then I went Shirley, stop putting on your glasses. You look at me and go, I'm not putting on my glasses. One, you know that they're already on. Two, you know there's a difference between remembering putting them on and actually putting them on. If I said you, well, then stop putting on your sandals. You'd be like, I'm not putting on my suit. Good. So you can remember doing that. You can remember the judge saying that the kids are going with the urine. You can remember the cop being there and taking you there. You can remember all that happening. You can remember putting your glasses on. Shirley, stop putting on your glasses. Say, I'm not putting on my glasses.
[54:33] B: I'm not putting on my glasses.
[54:34] A: Well, then stop putting on your sandals. Say, I'm not putting on my sandals.
[54:36] B: I'm not putting.
[54:37] A: Well, then stop me from putting on my jeans. Say, you're not putting on your jeans.
[54:40] B: You're not putting on your.
[54:40] A: Well, then stop the judge from saying that. Say the judge is not saying that.
[54:43] B: The judge is.
[54:44] A: Well, stop the cop from doing that. Say, they're not doing that. Well, then stop that from happening. Go. It's not happening.
[54:49] B: It's not happening.
[54:49] A: So then where is that? Say it no longer exists.
[54:52] B: It no longer exists.
[54:53] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. Right. By the way, that you, when all that was going on, didn't know that later on she was going to talk to her daughter. Right. Or go to the auction or see me at the library, which ended up.
[55:07] B: Being perfect for this, didn't it?
[55:12] A: Got it. So close your eyes. Picture that earlier, you just after that judgment was right. Let her know, first of all, that moment is over, finished, completed, defeated that it no longer exists. Right. So that she gets it. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about speaking to her daughter. Right. Let her know about going to the auction with folks. Let her know. Let her know that you're on your way to becoming more okay. Right. And as the earlier you is getting it, what do you notice now?
[55:48] B: I don't know.
[55:49] A: Oh, you don't know, by the way, that earlier you, who was losing access to having her kids with her, was also doing shit that wasn't okay to have kids with her. Right. Do you follow me with that? But in the moment that she was in the middle of doing all of that, could she see that very clearly? Right. Got it. Right. Because the judge wasn't going. You know, it'd be really cool. I'd like to fuck this mother and screw up her kids all at the same Time the judge was going, okay, so we need to figure out a way to get these kids into a safer environment than the one that they're in currently. Because this mom isn't operating in a way that's working to have kids with her. Got it. You didn't have that clear in the middle of it makes sense. You were thinking you could be doing that stuff and raise your kids. Come on. Got it. So what do we know now? The judge doing that was about what was best for your kids in that moment. Maybe the lesser of two evils. What was really interesting, what was best for your kids. And you being a mom. Right. Are you wanting what's best for your kids?
[57:09] B: Of course.
[57:10] A: Oh, you do? Okay. But in that moment, it didn't feel that way. Right. So what if you let that, you know what you're learning and realizing now. Right. That it wasn't about me, it was about the behavior that I was engaged in that led that to happen. Right. That it wouldn't have mattered whether it was me or some other mother doing the same things that I was doing. That's what the judge would have done. Got it. Let her know that that's over. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about talking to her daughter. Let her know. Right. And again, as this is getting into the earlier you. What do you notice happening now?
[57:59] B: Mm. Mm. I don't know. I'm still confused.
[58:03] A: Oh, well, does the earlier you look so troubled? Yes, she does. What's she so troubled about now?
[58:12] B: I don't know.
[58:14] A: Well, then how do you know that she looks troubled?
[58:18] B: I don't know.
[58:19] A: Oh. I mean, Chad.
[58:28] B: I still feel like I'm living it because I haven't had contact with the kids, the little ones.
[58:34] A: Well, aren't you still living it? Mm. Right. But what does that. You who is in the middle of addiction, active addiction, and lots of problematic behavior. Right. Using her body to help fund her. What does that you not know? Well, I would say what she doesn't know is how much closer she is to actually talking to them. So check it out. If we're driving from Florida to South Carolina and it's a nine hour drive and we've been in the car for six hours, we start to have the feeling like we're never going to get there. But we've already gone six hours, aren't we a hell of a lot closer to being there than we were before we started? So as you're looking at this thing, clearly, aren't you a heck of a lot closer now than you were when you were being put into the psych ward because you were trying to go see your kids and they didn't think that you were just trying to go see your kids. They thought you were going to try to take your kids.
[59:58] B: I was going to try to take my kids.
[59:59] A: Oh, okay. Well, there you go. So then they were right.
[60:03] B: Exactly. What?
[60:04] A: I was right. Which, if she had taken her kids, would that have been what was best for her kids?
[60:14] B: No. Cuz they would have got taken away by force and I would have got locked up.
[60:18] A: Wouldn't have been what's best for our kids, period.
[60:22] B: They still would have got it removed from my care. It just would have been a lot more traumatic for them.
[60:26] A: Right.
[60:28] B: It was traumatic for me, but it didn't need to be traumatic for them.
[60:30] A: Right. And they got to go with a relative that was caring enough to be interested in having them live with them.
[60:44] B: Yeah.
[60:46] A: Cause they could go to foster if they had no relative. Right. What's happening now?
[60:58] B: I'm starting to feel better.
[61:00] A: Oh, you are, huh? Isn't that weird? How do you know you're starting to feel better?
[61:08] B: Cause I lumped right here and right.
[61:10] A: Here is going away. Oh, it is, isn't it? Oh, you mean you're actually seeing it clearly? Right? Cause are we thinking that you back then was in her right mind? Oh, okay, good.
[61:22] B: That was insane, I'm telling you.
[61:24] A: I wonder why she went to the psych.
[61:27] B: You have no idea.
[61:29] A: I can guess.
[61:30] B: You have no idea.
[61:32] A: Right.
[61:34] B: And then, you know, I use drugs to just numb that instead of like.
[61:44] A: Right.
[61:44] B: Digging in my heels and becoming a better.
[61:48] A: Well, I don't know whether that's true. I think the drugs were already being used.
[61:55] B: Not like they.
[61:56] A: No, no, no. Do you follow me? But the drugs were already being used in a way that was problematic enough that her kids were being taken.
[62:05] B: That's where. Okay, that's where we're having. My kids were taken because I tried to hang myself. And they were there. They didn't see me, but they were at the home. So when the EMTs were called, the kids and my ex husband were there and. And they started a DCF case. And then I went to leave my husband, but I took the kids with me. But the DCF case was already open, so they took it as I was trying to run away from the DCF case, when really I was just trying to run away from my shitty husband. That made me want to kill myself. And I was extremely depressed and I didn't know what to do. So I went home to my mommy and then I went to the custody hearing with my brother and all that other stuff happened. So the only time I ever failed a drug test, it was for marijuana. One time. I didn't fail drug test. I didn't. I did drugs recreationally, but I didn't start using meth until after they were gone.
[63:13] A: Oh, good.
[63:14] B: But that's not good.
[63:16] A: But. Well, no, it is good. Do you know why that's good?
[63:18] B: Why?
[63:19] A: Because you didn't use meth when you had your kids.
[63:22] B: Yeah.
[63:23] A: Do you know how good that is?
[63:25] B: They just said I was.
[63:25] A: No, no, watch. Just stay with me for a second. Charlie, I want you to get this. Okay. Do you know how really good it is that you may have used other stuff, marijuana, what have you recreationally when you had your kids with you that you never used? Masks. Right. Do you know how worse it would.
[63:48] B: Be if they had to see me?
[63:51] A: If you're using meth and having your kids with you. Okay. So really good that it didn't start until they were gone. And we get that some of that started because I was so troubled that they were gone. But what we haven't unpacked or. Or cleared out has to do with stuff that had to do with this ex.
[64:15] B: Did I make a face on my face?
[64:18] A: Oh, and you, you know, Ems, being cold because you were hanging from something interested in being dead at that time, which also is not great for your kids. Right. Now that you're here, you have a chance to interact with them again.
[64:46] B: I couldn't think that far ahead.
[64:48] A: A little bit better.
[64:49] B: Yeah.
[64:50] A: Right.
[64:51] B: Couldn't get that far before.
[64:52] A: Right. Got it.
[64:54] B: Yeah.
[64:55] A: Yeah. So notice that moment. Right. You weren't in your right mind, which as they were taken then led you to using in a really problematic way.
[65:08] B: Yeah, that's.
[65:09] A: Yeah, got it. Right. So the you that was really, really troubled and not in her right mind that led her to attempt suicide, that kids were in the home and husband found you. Right. That you that then subsequently took her kids to mom that subsequently lost her kids to aunt. What does that you back then who is not in her right mind and in a real bad state, need to know that you know right now about you.
[65:55] B: There is hope.
[65:58] A: One. Okay. There's hope. What's the other thing she needs to know?
[66:02] B: I'm in my right mind now.
[66:03] A: Uh huh. Right. That would be better. Right.
[66:05] B: I'm way better than I.
[66:07] A: And you're away from him.
[66:08] B: And I'm definitely away from him.
[66:10] A: That's right. So close your Eyes and picture that earlier, you let her know that she's away from him, free from that. Let her know that you're doing way better now, not even doing this stuff recreationally and clearly not doing the math. Right. Let her know that you're really interested that even when you were confronted instead of leaving, you went to the assessment house. Right. That's huge growth in showing that you're interested in being a better version of you. Uh huh. Let that earlier. You know all of this. Right. Right. And as she's getting it, what do you notice now?
[67:07] B: It doesn't seem like that much of a big deal.
[67:10] A: Oh, isn't that cool? Oh, you mean it's shrinking? Huh. What do you notice to the.
[67:18] B: It's gone.
[67:19] A: Oh, it's gone, right? It's gone, right?
[67:23] B: It's still there, but it's not.
[67:26] A: What's there?
[67:28] B: The sadness of not having the kids.
[67:30] A: Uh huh.
[67:32] B: The guilt that I didn't do the right thing way back in the. Because if I would have done the right thing way back then, they'd be in my life right now.
[67:40] A: Uh huh. Could you?
[67:43] B: I didn't. I could have.
[67:44] A: I don't think you could have because.
[67:46] B: I wasn't in my right mind because.
[67:49] A: That'S not what occurred back then based on all the stuff that was going on. Do you follow me with that? We get it how much you love them. Right. But they're not not better off with you feeling guilty. Right. Like they don't do better with you being guilty. They're better off with me becoming healthy and well, which doesn't get there through guilt.
[68:24] B: Staying in the assessment house.
[68:26] A: Guilt is not a good motivator.
[68:28] B: Mm.
[68:30] A: Guilt makes me feel worse, not better. We don't want the field goal kicker who missed the one at halftime feeling guilty about the game winner before he goes to kick it. It's a bad strategy to do well. Oh my goodness, I hope I don't miss one. I missed the last one. Everybody's gonna be alright. Time out. We don't want him kicking. We'll get somebody else. There's somebody else that remembers that anybody.
[68:57] B: Else kicks that he made before. Good idea.
[69:06] A: Right? Got it.
[69:08] B: Yes.
[69:09] A: Right.
[69:11] B: Better.
[69:11] A: And see at that time, based on whom you were with, make sense. You did what occurred for you to do back then. And based on all the factors that were going on back then, you couldn't have not done it. Even if now you look back wishing you hadn't got it. But with all those factors that were going on back then, you did what occurred for you to do. And you couldn't have done done that.
[69:45] B: Right?
[69:46] A: Right. Right. So that you may want to lighten up on that earlier. You sure? Who wasn't in the situation you're in now? Right. And as you lighten up on the earlier you, what do you notice happening inside?
[70:07] B: I just feel better.
[70:09] A: You do, don't you?
[70:10] B: All the little lumps are gone.
[70:11] A: Isn't that cool? Right?
[70:14] B: I relaxed a little bit.
[70:15] A: You did, didn't you? We're on our way, right? Right. We're on our way to getting things cleared so that you're free to be more okay now. Because in life, all of the things that have happened, we can't get them to have not happened. Even if we don't like it that it did, we can't get it to have not happened.
[70:51] B: Gotcha.
[70:57] A: Yeah. What's happening now?
[70:59] B: I got a stress ball in my hand. I don't know why. What's happening now? I don't know what's happening now.
[71:05] A: You don't know what's happening now? How's your body feeling?
[71:08] B: I'm still relaxed, but for some reason I started tensing up.
[71:13] A: I don't know whether you're tensing up. Are you?
[71:16] B: They're not the rest of me. Just this part.
[71:18] A: Is that even tensing up?
[71:20] B: No, just working it out.
[71:22] A: It's working it out. That's right. That's right. And see, as you and I are organizing towards the future, you think of the bluebird, Right? Take a deep breath in. Exhale. And eyes can remain closed. As they're closed, your eyes rest. As your eyes rest, you also rest. You're aware of your breath, my voice, the background sounds, how it feels to be seated in the way. You are noticing all of this at the same time. The unconscious parts of your mind are organizing towards the future. You re routing wiring so that it becomes more optimized. That's right. That's right. And you surely don't have to do anything to cause change to happen within your mind and body does it for you. You. As things begin to lighten up even more. Big, deep breath in. And now exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Good job. All right. What are you noticing now?
[73:07] B: I feel very, very calm in my back.
[73:09] A: And as you're very, very calm again, that other than conscious part is going to travel back down the timeline of things that have happened and bring another moment to get clear. That's right.
[73:25] B: No.
[73:26] A: Yes. Yes. Because you know what? Your brain is going, holy shit, this works. I actually feel better. About something that I've never felt better about. Huh. What are all the other things that I could start to feel better about that'll then have me do better in life? Because when people know more, they do better. And when people feel better, they do better. That's right. Gotcha. So your brain is going to travel back down that timeline and bring another moment to your awareness to clear. I don't think it is.
[74:03] B: It is, though.
[74:05] A: According to whom?
[74:08] B: Me.
[74:09] A: Oh.
[74:14] B: I don't know what else to clear.
[74:17] A: I don't think that's true. I'm good. I don't want Shirley to know. Shirley's unconscious. Do it for her. When I was like, oh, you got it. Good.
[74:37] B: I don't know. I was like, 13. You got one that raised me. Yeah, I got one.
[74:43] A: Good. So be here with me. Notice how you're going there.
[74:45] B: Yeah. Hi.
[74:46] A: I want you here.
[74:47] B: Hi. How you doing?
[74:47] A: You know, I want you here because I'm more fun than that was.
[74:49] B: Oh, yeah.
[74:54] A: So you're 13 when that one happened. When it happened. You're where?
[75:00] B: Home.
[75:00] A: So you're home. Good. And daytime or nighttime?
[75:04] B: Daytime.
[75:05] A: Daytime. And you're, like, in the living room, kitchen, dining room. Bedroom.
[75:08] B: We'll say dining room.
[75:09] A: Dining room. Right. Good. And then what happened?
[75:12] B: My dad that raised me was moving out.
[75:15] A: Yes.
[75:15] B: Took my little brother with him.
[75:16] A: Yes.
[75:17] B: My mom got with a new man.
[75:20] A: So your dad took the little brother to Tennessee. Right. You said bye. No. You just took him and you came home and they went there.
[75:27] B: Didn't even know it was happening.
[75:28] A: All right. So you came back. You didn't know that they. And then mom said, they're gone.
[75:32] B: They're gone. And we're moving to an apartment with our new boyfriend, Jack. Well, he's my stepdad now. He's been with her for 23 years, so.
[75:43] A: So we're moving in with Timmy. Tim.
[75:45] B: Yeah. Good guy. No complaints.
[75:51] A: Right.
[75:51] B: Just the dad that raised me for 13 years and my brother.
[75:57] A: Right.
[75:58] B: Were gone.
[75:58] A: Gone just right. Like that. Right.
[76:00] B: And I didn't.
[76:02] A: Right.
[76:03] B: Know why.
[76:04] A: Right. And she said, we're moving him and Timmy.
[76:06] B: Yeah.
[76:07] A: Right.
[76:08] B: Move the house, brother, dad, all gone.
[76:12] A: Right.
[76:13] B: Same day.
[76:13] A: Right. And as you're telling me about it, what are you noticing? It just.
[76:20] B: It was too much change for a little girl without being, like, prepared for was overwhelming.
[76:28] A: I'm not so sure even being prepared for it. Okay, so sure. Here's what's gonna happen for 13 years. And your younger brother are gonna leave and go to Tennessee. You and I are gonna leave the House that we're in and move in with this other guy that you don't really know, but I don't even know.
[76:44] B: Never met him.
[76:45] A: You good with that? No. Just to make you prepared.
[76:48] B: Just to prepare you. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
[76:53] A: I mean, you prepared, right? You're good now, right?
[76:56] B: No, it was very confusing and overwhelming.
[77:01] A: And so, so notice felt very right. All of that stuff felt like it had something to do with you. Did it? No, I had to do with whatever was going on with mom and that guy. Right. And them leaving and not saying anything had nothing to do with you. Had everything to do with them. Right. And we don't know why it was so troubling for you to be able to say goodbye to your kids. We don't know where that came from. That I gotta drive frantically to Florida with my brother to grab them.
[77:44] B: Yeah.
[77:47] A: We don't know. We don't know. We don't know where that came from.
[77:50] B: Same brother, by the way.
[77:52] A: Oh, right, but. But see, you didn't know you didn't.
[77:53] B: Get to say goodbye to us either.
[77:55] A: Right. But you didn't know that later on you were gonna interact with that same brother, did you? Mm. Right. See that you, when they left, thought they were gone and you'd never see them again. Right? What do you know? You sure did good to see him. Surely got to see your brother. Uh huh. That's right. That's right. Them leaving had nothing to do with you or their lack of love for you or your lack of loveability. Because you can remember it happening. You can remember coming home and they're being gone. And mom said, hey, by the way, we're moving in with Timmy. Right. You can also remember putting your sandals on.
[78:39] B: No, she didn't even tell me. We just did it.
[78:41] A: Oh, no matter, right? We're going out of nowhere. Why are you driving somewhere? Why? We got all of our stuff with us.
[78:47] B: Pack your stuff. Just pack your stuff.
[78:49] A: Awesome. So you come home, nobody, they're not there. You can see that some shit's missing. And then mom. And then mom says, you know, pack your shit, pack your stuff, we're moving.
[79:05] B: Brother and other dad already gone. Saw brother again.
[79:09] A: You're like, wait a minute, are we moving with them? No, some other dude that you don't know. Damn it.
[79:16] B: Never met him. He's great, by the way. He's. He's still with her. It ended well, but at that time.
[79:27] A: It'S really fucked up.
[79:28] B: Yeah, it was hard, right?
[79:30] A: You can remember mom saying that, pack your stuff. You can remember putting Your sandals on. Shirley, stop putting on your sandals. Say, I'm not putting on my sand.
[79:39] B: I'm not putting on my sand.
[79:39] A: Well, then stop mom from saying that. See, she's not saying.
[79:41] B: Mom's not saying that.
[79:42] A: Well, then stop it from happening. Oh, it's not happening.
[79:44] B: It's not happening.
[79:45] A: So where is it go. It doesn't exist.
[79:46] B: It doesn't exist.
[79:47] A: That's right again. Did that happen have anything to do with you?
[79:52] B: No.
[79:53] A: No. Had to do with what was off with them, by the way. When you were 13, did you realize like you do now, how much was off with them? No.
[80:05] B: No.
[80:06] A: Got it. Make sense. So again, close your eyes. Picture the 13 year old you who wasn't sure she was gonna be okay. Let her know, of course, that she made it through it. Let her know that that happening had nothing to do with you. Had everything to do with what was off of the adults. So that she gets. It's not about me. Let her know about later on seeing the brother. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know that Timmy turned out to be a decent guy. Yay. Let her know. Right, right. That you're okay. Right. Let her know that they weren't well then. Right. And as she's getting it. What do you notice now?
[80:47] B: It wasn't even that big a deal.
[80:49] A: Notice how it's not. Well, it wasn't a big effing deal.
[80:52] B: It wasn't. It wasn't though. Like, I. I was fine. I was well cared for now.
[80:57] A: But it wasn't big deal then. Yes.
[81:01] B: Yeah.
[81:02] A: To come in, they're gone. Mom says, pack your stuff, we're moving.
[81:08] B: What the heck? Yeah, what the heck's going on?
[81:14] A: Right?
[81:15] B: It was, yeah, weird.
[81:18] A: More than just weird.
[81:19] B: Overwhelming.
[81:20] A: I got no say, no say. Because maybe I wanted to go with them. No, no. Maybe.
[81:28] B: No, no.
[81:29] A: But maybe, but no. I got no say.
[81:31] B: Got no say at all.
[81:33] A: Right. Right.
[81:37] B: I also think about my brother's side of things. Cause he felt the same way. Only his mom and his sister were wrong because they didn't explain it to him either.
[81:49] A: Right. I don't know why. We were fucked up.
[81:54] B: We tried to figure that out. We never could.
[82:00] A: Had nothing to do with where we came from one time and what the adults are doing in our world.
[82:08] B: He said, what's wrong with you? I said, my mommy didn't hug me enough. And my brother just started cracking up laughing. It was like, oh, two troops too much. True.
[82:18] A: Damn, you really struck a chord on that one.
[82:20] B: It was so true that we Both couldn't stop laughing.
[82:22] A: Right, right. But see, back then when you were 13, you felt like you needed them in order for you to be okay. Did you? No.
[82:38] B: Oh.
[82:38] A: I mean, you're here, you're okay. I'm okay doesn't mean great. Yeah. But you're here. Right. Did you need them to be around in order for you to be okay? In order for you to care for your own?
[82:55] B: No.
[82:56] A: Right. Because even if you're not with them, don't you love them? Right. Right.
[83:08] B: Just cause she's mad at him doesn't mean I have to be mad at.
[83:11] A: Him Right now, as this is getting in, what do you notice? How's your body feeling?
[83:29] B: Just chill.
[83:30] A: Isn't that weird?
[83:34] B: It is.
[83:35] A: It's weird that your body's feeling chilled. Talking about that.
[83:41] B: Just relaxed.
[83:42] A: Right. Oh, you mean we can relax into clearing stuff. That's right, we can. It doesn't have to be painful. Cause you know what? You're doing a really good job of doing?
[83:56] B: What?
[83:57] A: Being with me in the library.
[84:04] B: The story will never get old.
[84:06] A: It's so good. Right?
[84:09] B: Never get old.
[84:11] A: I'm just really glad that Pascal season's over. I don't have to do that anymore.
[84:17] B: Well, you should just pick different team colors because it just didn't suit you. Yeah, whatever.
[84:24] A: We're done. Season's over. I'm not coaching again. No, I'm done. No, it's not at all. I'll go watch. I don't want to coach. Oh, okay.
[84:37] B: That's good. At least you know that, right?
[84:43] A: Yeah.
[84:44] B: We're at the library.
[84:45] A: Yeah, we're sitting here.
[84:47] B: Well, books are you good?
[84:49] A: That's right. Right. So again, as you think about that moment, what do you notice now?
[84:59] B: It's in the past.
[85:00] A: Well, we did know that. So what do you notice in terms of how you feel?
[85:04] B: I feel okay. I don't feel like I'm about to cry.
[85:08] A: Right.
[85:09] B: I feel calm.
[85:11] A: Right.
[85:13] B: Like it's okay.
[85:16] A: Yeah.
[85:19] B: That's good. It's way different than right. Not thinking about it at all, you know?
[85:24] A: Right. Or whenever you do think about it, it's still got all that.
[85:28] B: I feel like I didn't never think about it. It just kind of popped up when you asked me to bring something up.
[85:33] A: Right.
[85:33] B: Like I didn't consciously.
[85:36] A: Those are the ones that are best.
[85:38] B: Yeah. I didn't have it in my like.
[85:40] A: So again, as we organized towards the you who's becoming free, present and clear, much more okay. In you, that unconscious part, again, will travel back down the timeline and Bring another moment to your awareness to clear.
[86:03] B: This one's hard.
[86:04] A: Oh, well, then be with me, cuz I'm fun. What if we were to soften it?
[86:13] B: Soften it?
[86:14] A: Yeah.
[86:14] B: Yeah.
[86:15] A: By making it way over there. Okay. And small. And tiny little screen.
[86:18] B: Good idea.
[86:19] A: Right. So when you tell it to me, think of it like it's being told in a tiny little screen. About this big.
[86:24] B: Christine did this way. Christine did this before. Okay.
[86:30] A: Or just feed with me.
[86:32] B: I'd rather just be with you.
[86:33] A: Right. And know that that's over. So what if before you tell me about it, you actually get clear that that's done?
[86:40] B: That's done.
[86:41] A: That. That moment happened how long ago?
[86:45] B: 35 years.
[86:46] A: Oh, 35 years ago. Good. Right. So that moment is clearly over because it happened 35 years ago. What? What does a little, little, little girl need to know?
[86:55] B: It's over. It never happened again. And I'm strong.
[87:01] A: Right? She doesn't hurt me. Right? Oh, what else does she need to know? Because it was stuff that happened to her body. Right? Oh, what else does she need to know?
[87:12] B: She is not her body.
[87:14] A: That's right. I mean, because you can say this after me. It's really funny. I have a nose.
[87:21] B: I have a nose.
[87:22] A: Two elbows.
[87:23] B: Two elbows.
[87:23] A: Ten fingers.
[87:24] B: Ten. Ten fingers.
[87:24] A: Ten toes.
[87:25] B: Ten toes.
[87:25] A: I'm not my nose.
[87:26] B: I'm not my nose.
[87:27] A: Elbows.
[87:27] B: I'm not my nose. Or elbows.
[87:29] A: Fingers or toes.
[87:30] B: Fingers or toes.
[87:31] A: I have a vagina.
[87:31] B: I have a vagina.
[87:32] A: I'm not my vagina.
[87:33] B: I'm not my vagina.
[87:34] A: My vagina is mine.
[87:35] B: My vagina.
[87:35] A: But it's not me. But it's not me. Right. He messed with my stuff. Right?
[87:42] B: Yeah.
[87:43] A: Is your stuff you?
[87:45] B: No.
[87:45] A: No. Right. Messed with your stuff. Not you. Is there any part of you right now that's the same as it was then?
[87:54] B: No.
[87:55] A: No. All those cells have been replaced millions of times. Yet you're still you.
[87:58] B: Yes.
[87:59] A: Right. Watch. Take your hand and hold it like that. Right. Watch that spot. My hand comes close without it touching. Notice how you can feel it. See, Shirley, right now I know I'm coming closer to touching who you really are.
[88:16] B: You got a giant hand.
[88:17] A: I do. Than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings or screwed up your thinking. Right. Notice how you can feel this. And I'm not actually touching your hand. But you feel it. Right?
[88:34] B: I have my other hand.
[88:38] A: Right. So what do we want to let the younger you know that doesn't know messed with my stuff but didn't get.
[88:46] B: Me Messed with my stuff but didn't get me.
[88:49] A: Right. That's one of the things we want her to know. We want her to know that it's over, finished. No longer exists. Right. We wanted her to know that you're okay.
[89:03] B: I'm okay.
[89:04] A: You are okay that you're here.
[89:06] B: Mm.
[89:07] A: That's right. And you can endure and make it through pain. I mean, how many tattoos do we have?
[89:17] B: More than I can count.
[89:18] A: That's right. And some of them in sensitive areas.
[89:22] B: Yes.
[89:23] A: Where it hurts just a little bit more.
[89:26] B: Just for fun.
[89:27] A: Right.
[89:28] B: This one hurts the most. Just.
[89:29] A: Oh, yeah, that one's. That one. Yeah, I get that. Yeah. Right there. Yeah. There's not a lot of, like, a material in between where it's gonna hurt and hurt.
[89:36] B: That hurt. Real hurt. But I don't feel it anymore.
[89:42] A: Right. You don't, do you? Right.
[89:45] B: I can't even remember how it felt.
[89:46] A: That had been real hurt. You've continued to feel it only because part of your brain doesn't know that it ended. Like, your part of brain knows that that stops and it's not happening now. That's right. Good. So you're a little. Little when that one happened. You're where?
[90:06] B: California.
[90:07] A: California. Right.
[90:08] B: Grandma's house.
[90:09] A: And Grandma's house. Right. And you're where in grandma's house?
[90:11] B: I don't remember.
[90:12] A: Oh, well, you can make it up.
[90:14] B: Yeah. Bedroom.
[90:15] A: You're in a bedroom. Right. Good. Daytime or nighttime?
[90:18] B: Daytime.
[90:19] A: Daytime. And what might have happened?
[90:20] B: He was supposed to be babysitting.
[90:22] A: So he was babysitting you. Like it was a family member or friend or a babysitter, somebody.
[90:28] B: Grandma's husband's son.
[90:31] A: Grandma's husband's son. Great. Awesome.
[90:32] B: Don't even know him.
[90:34] A: Right.
[90:34] B: Stranger.
[90:35] A: Right. So he was there, and he was supposed to babysit you. Grandma and grandpa were off doing whatever they were doing. Right. Then what happened? Don't be here. Hi. Notice how you're going there. Hi. Hi.
[90:47] B: He tried to make it like a game, but he made me.
[90:50] A: So he wanted to play a game with you? Hey, here's a really cool game. It's called put my penis in your mouth. Well, you want to play? It's fun.
[90:58] B: Exactly.
[90:59] A: So he might have pulled his pants down. He might have put his penis in your mouth. You might have been like, wow, Right? Then what might have happened next? Then he played another game that's called hide the salami.
[91:09] B: No.
[91:11] A: He might have touched your body.
[91:12] B: He touched me.
[91:13] A: Right? He might have put his finger in your vagina. Right. And that might have been weird and hurt some of it. It might have felt good, but it would have been weird. Right. And then what might have happened next?
[91:20] B: I pushed him away and he went away.
[91:22] A: Right. And then he left.
[91:23] B: Yeah, right.
[91:24] A: And then what might have happened next?
[91:26] B: I don't know. I was too little. I don't remember.
[91:28] A: Isn't the crazy shit that our mind stops the story at the up worst part?
[91:32] B: Right.
[91:34] A: Well, eventually grandma and grandpa came home and then you left. And then later on you did something more fun like call your daughter. Right. Or go to the auction. Right. See me at the library. So you got seeing me at the library, going to the auction, calling your daughter. Right. And then you left. And then they got home. Right. And then he stopped and then you kind of pushed him away. And then he like touched in between your body and all sorts of stuff. He put his penis in your mouth and he said, let's play this fun game. And then he was left there to babysit. And then you'd gone over to grandparents house. And then before that you're back home doing whatever you do as we go backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it?
[92:10] B: A lot easier.
[92:12] A: Isn't that crazy? You can remember I'm doing that. You can remember putting your glasses on, surely. Stop putting on your glasses.
[92:18] B: I'm not putting on my glasses.
[92:19] A: Well then stop putting on your sandals.
[92:20] B: I'm not putting on my sandals.
[92:21] A: Stop putting on your watch.
[92:22] B: I'm not putting on.
[92:22] A: Well, stop me from putting on my watch.
[92:24] B: You're not putting on your watch.
[92:26] A: Well then stop him from doing that.
[92:27] B: He's not doing that.
[92:28] A: Well then you stop doing that.
[92:29] B: I'm not.
[92:29] A: No, stop it from happening.
[92:30] B: It's not happening.
[92:31] A: So where is it?
[92:32] B: Gone. It doesn't exist.
[92:35] A: No, it did. It doesn't. Right.
[92:37] B: Exist.
[92:38] A: Because we're not troubled because it did happen.
[92:40] B: Right. We're not trying to erase it.
[92:44] A: Right. Everything that has happened couldn't have not. We're not troubled that it did. We're troubled because we don't know that it's not.
[92:50] B: Because we know it's not happening.
[92:51] A: Yeah. Now you're getting it.
[92:53] B: Yes.
[92:53] A: Right. And as you're getting it, what's happening?
[92:55] B: I feel so much better.
[92:56] A: Right. By the way, all that. I know, all that happening, did it have anything to do with you? No. I mean, that little girl's going, hey, big boy. No, she's going, hey. You know, it'd be really cool. I've never had a penis in my mouth. And like I'm really young and I'd like to try it.
[93:14] B: Nope.
[93:15] A: Right. That wasn't, like, what she was thinking. It'd be a really cold love to go to grandma. Parents has. I love hot dogs. So I'm thinking no.
[93:22] B: You want to play a game?
[93:24] A: Yeah. No. No. Right. Got it. Had nothing to do with you, by the way. Did she do anything wrong?
[93:33] B: No.
[93:33] A: Right. Had nothing to do with you. Would it have mattered whether it was you in that situation or some other little girl? Right. Had to do with whatever was screwed up with him. Mm. Got it.
[93:46] B: Got it.
[93:47] A: Right. Now close your eyes. Picture the younger you. Let her know these four words. Repeat them out loud after me. Here we go. It's. It's not. Not about.
[93:55] B: About me. Me.
[93:56] A: Right. It's not about me. Say it.
[93:58] B: It's not about me.
[93:58] A: One more time.
[93:59] B: It's not about me.
[94:00] A: That's right. Let her know it's not about me.
[94:02] B: It's not about me.
[94:03] A: Had nothing to do with you. Had everything to do with what was off with him. Let her know that you're okay.
[94:06] B: I'm okay. It's not about me.
[94:08] A: That's right. So that she gets it.
[94:10] B: I'm okay.
[94:11] A: That's right. And as the younger you is getting it, what do you notice?
[94:22] B: Nothing. It's just not there.
[94:24] A: Oh, it isn't. Oh, she's not.
[94:25] B: It's not here. It's not here.
[94:27] A: It's not here.
[94:29] B: The unplug you do. That's what it feels like.
[94:32] A: Right?
[94:34] B: That's what it feels like.
[94:35] A: Right? We know that it happened.
[94:36] B: Yeah.
[94:37] A: Right.
[94:37] B: But it's not.
[94:38] A: It's not doing anything to you anymore.
[94:39] B: It's not in here. It's not right here.
[94:42] A: Right. It's like, isn't that cool?
[94:47] B: I feel like I got a bunch of trash bags and I'll, like, just throwing it in the dumpster.
[94:51] A: Yeah. Go on. Go on. Right. Cuz notice you can still know that it happened. Try to feel really bad.
[95:01] B: I can't. All right. I can't. It just made me laugh.
[95:11] A: Right? Isn't that the coolest part? That's the coolest part.
[95:14] B: It's awesome.
[95:14] A: And once it's been gotten, it can't go back the other way.
[95:18] B: It's weird when I think about it. And now I'm thinking about the library.
[95:21] A: Right? Your brain can't go back, can't go backwards, and can't go back to thinking it's happening.
[95:31] B: So that's still trying.
[95:32] A: Right?
[95:32] B: That can't trouble you again. It's just really like.
[95:35] A: It's right. Once Santa is make Believe Santa's make believe forever.
[95:41] B: That's really cool.
[95:43] A: Right? Once your brain gets that, it's data, it's data forever.
[95:46] B: Yeah.
[95:47] A: Right. And the meaning that was attached that somehow I was bad or wrong or did something wrong or should have known or shouldn't have been in that situation or. Or all that's gone too.
[95:55] B: I doubted you.
[95:57] A: A lot of that stuff is all about changing. Also how you interact with current stuff. Because everything feels like it's about me.
[96:05] B: Mm. It's not about me.
[96:06] A: No. It's not about you. Right. Must most of everything in life has nothing to do with you. 99.9999% of the billions and billions of billions of things that are going on all the time have nothing to fucking do with you.
[96:23] B: You don't say. Could have fooled me.
[96:29] A: Damn well feels like it has everything to do with me.
[96:32] B: I'm not the center of the universe.
[96:34] A: Yes. Right.
[96:35] B: Check Einstein's theory again.
[96:37] A: Somehow they shifted it that it used to be the Earth, and then they realized it was the sun that went around the Earth. Huh.
[96:43] B: What do you got there? Coffee?
[96:45] A: No, this is a smoothie.
[96:46] B: Oh, okay. I was like, if it was coffee.
[96:53] A: Yeah.
[96:55] B: So you checked Einstein's theory. I'm not in it as the center.
[97:00] A: No.
[97:01] B: Of the energy. That's weird. I could have swore I was in there somewhere.
[97:11] A: Right. It's not ever been a part of you. Right. It just felt like it was. Right. Close your eyes and let the little you know that he never touched me. He only messed with my stuff. He never touched me. Never got who I really am. He never touched me. Messed with my stuff. Right. There we go. Isn't that a good news thing? Cause you're becoming more okay in you.
[97:55] B: But now I'm getting mad.
[97:57] A: Oh, good.
[97:58] B: Yeah, let's get mad.
[98:00] A: What are we getting mad about? Right.
[98:01] B: I told my mom, and she acted like she didn't know who the fuck I was talking about. I didn't tell her for like 20 years. But when I did tell her, she acted like I didn't know. She didn't know who the fuck I was. And she did, and it pissed me off.
[98:13] A: Oh, good. So you told mom later.
[98:17] B: Much later.
[98:18] A: Right? Yeah. When you were an adult.
[98:20] B: Only person I ever told that.
[98:22] A: Hey, Mom. Grandpa's son molested me when I was a little kid.
[98:28] B: I didn't come out like that. I said it was some guy and he was babysitting us in California. My mom never left us with people, so she knew who the fuck it was. And there's no doubt in my mind. Oh, there's nobody else it could have been. But again, I was like four years old, so.
[98:47] A: Right.
[98:48] B: Kind of blurry. Very much not blurry. So telling her and her.
[98:55] A: Where were you?
[98:58] B: I was on the phone with her. I was in Virginia.
[99:00] A: Oh, you're on the phone with her. Right. And she's like, yeah, no, I don't know who that was. It probably never happened. Happened.
[99:08] B: When she acted like she didn't know who it was, I just dropped it.
[99:12] A: Oh, okay.
[99:13] B: Because I could see the conversation was not gonna go well. Like, why address it further if that's your.
[99:19] A: Because Mom's not easy to talk to sometimes.
[99:21] B: Yeah.
[99:22] A: You think I don't know. I don't know her? I'm asking. You're telling me. I meant to bring that up. And then all of a sudden she pretended like she didn't know and I just dropped it. I'm going, huh. She doesn't sound like a real open, easy person to talk to.
[99:39] B: No, I think. I think that maybe the reason why she did that is like, you know, she would have blamed herself cuz she left me alone with this guy that she shouldn't let me alone with. Cuz obviously he was up.
[99:53] A: Yes.
[99:53] B: People that are up kind of show that they're up once in a while.
[99:56] A: Yeah, but not right away.
[99:58] B: Not right away.
[99:58] A: And he was right. Because mom was.
[100:01] B: He was not a kid. But he was.
[100:02] A: Mom wasn't thinking, you know, it'd be really cool. I'm gonna have my 4 year old go stay with grandma. Grandma. So that she can be molested by grandpa's son?
[100:15] B: Yeah.
[100:16] A: Right. And lots. So you can remember telling mom that and mom kind of brushing it off. Right. You can also remember, I'm putting your leggings on today.
[100:23] B: Mm.
[100:24] A: Shirley, stop putting on your leggings.
[100:26] B: Not putting on my leggings.
[100:26] A: I'm gonna stop mom from brushing it off.
[100:28] B: Mom's not brushing it at all then.
[100:29] A: No. Stop her from acting like that.
[100:31] B: She's not acting like that.
[100:33] A: Then where is that moment? Say it doesn't exist.
[100:35] B: It doesn't exist.
[100:36] A: And again, mom being that way. Did that have anything to do with you?
[100:39] B: No.
[100:40] A: Or her not believing you?
[100:43] B: No.
[100:45] A: You know, you already said what it had to do with, what it would mean about mom if it were true. I remember working with this guy and he told mom that Uncle Tony molested me. And mom's response was, don't you say that about my brother. Not because she didn't believe her kid, but because what it Would mean about her if that were true, that our own brother could molest her kid like she can't even be with him. Follow me with that.
[101:23] B: Yeah.
[101:23] A: So where that you was feeling back then that it had something to do with me or mom's lack of care or love? Had nothing to do with that. Had everything to do with mom. Right. And what it would mean about mom to mom if it were to be true. Got it. And so as you get it, close your eyes and picture the earlier you having had that conversation with mom and let her know what you know now had nothing to do with me or mom's love for me. Had everything to do with that part. Being off with mom because of what it would mean about mom if it were true. Mom couldn't be with it. Right. So that she gets it. And as the earlier you is getting it, what do you notice happening to the anger?
[102:18] B: I'm not so angry.
[102:19] A: Yeah. And you can open your eyes because from here are we thinking Mom? You know, back then, maybe even now, are we thinking mom? Mom is a gal who's 100% mentally, emotionally, well, stable. Right. You're following me with that Trilly, as we're thinking about mom right now and what you know about mom. Mom's pretty domineering, right? Mom's pretty opinionated. Mom's pretty, right?
[102:56] B: It's her way or nobody.
[102:57] A: Oh, I don't know where that came from, do you? Come on, isn't it a good thing that I didn't hit her? I mean I threatened that I was gonna hit her, but come on, don't I get kudos for having not.
[103:13] B: Rude.
[103:19] A: I mean everybody should be like, man, great job.
[103:22] B: Go me always. Right.
[103:26] A: I don't know where that came from.
[103:27] B: Right?
[103:28] A: Uh huh.
[103:28] B: Oh, I know where it came from.
[103:30] A: Oh you do, don't you?
[103:30] B: Yeah, I've been doing that.
[103:32] A: Right.
[103:33] B: But I don't want to be like that. Oh, you don't do you don't like people like that.
[103:38] A: Ah, right. And you know that awareness is something she doesn't have, right? That's why you're interested in being a better version of you and she's staying the same. Oh, she's not, she's not getting the help I'm getting.
[104:01] B: But she's better than she used to be.
[104:03] A: Only because she's gotten older.
[104:05] B: Yeah, she's more understanding.
[104:06] A: No, no, it's only because she's gotten older.
[104:08] B: She's tired.
[104:10] A: Right. When you've ever hurt you, when you get older, you get a little wiser, you know? A little more. Right.
[104:17] B: Learn your lesson a little faster.
[104:19] A: Right. You don't have as much energy to fight about everything all the time. Right.
[104:26] B: Right.
[104:29] A: Got it. She's got her own stuff.
[104:34] B: None of my business.
[104:37] A: I don't know whether it's your business or not, but she definitely has her own stuff.
[104:41] B: It's not gonna be my business.
[104:43] A: There you go. Right? Yeah. So she may be better than she was, and that's a good news thing, regardless of whether she's done any. Yeah. So think about that moment and try to feel really angry at mom for going. Yeah. No idea. I even left you with your grandparents.
[105:16] B: Still a little irritated.
[105:18] A: Okay, good. What's the irritation about?
[105:22] B: Because I knew that she was lying and I didn't press her. I didn't continue the conversation.
[105:34] A: Oh, so is the anger at her or you now?
[105:36] B: Probably me.
[105:37] A: Oh, yeah.
[105:40] B: Was it even a conversation that needed to be had 20 years later?
[105:43] A: Yeah. But let's just check for a second. Like, the anger's at you for having not pushed her. What would have happened if you did?
[105:50] B: I don't know. She would have got mad Then what? On the phone.
[105:55] A: Right. Then what.
[105:56] B: What an answer when I called her back.
[105:57] A: Huh?
[105:59] B: Now we don't talk for six months.
[106:00] A: Would it have stopped it?
[106:04] B: No. She had no idea it happened.
[106:10] A: Right. So I wonder what it would be like to lighten up on the earlier you that was thinking that by mom acknowledging and owning it, it was going to make you feel better. See, you were thinking that by mom going, oh, my goodness, I never knew that. Oh, I'm so sorry that happened to you, sweetie. If I had known that he was that way, I never would have you left there. I feel horrible that that happened to you.
[106:35] B: Was that so much I asked?
[106:36] A: No, but you were thinking that. That then that would have made you feel better.
[106:40] B: Yeah.
[106:41] A: Would it?
[106:42] B: I guess not. I would have held onto it even more.
[106:46] A: It wouldn't have made you feel better about what happened to you. You would have gotten some sympathy from Mom.
[106:51] B: Yeah, but the thing would have still been.
[106:54] A: Right. See, that's where the earlier you was thinking that by confronting mom, that that was on the way to her healing. Right. So close your eyes and picture that earlier you having had the conversation with mom, and then how you've been angry at her for having not pushed her, which is only about your healing, and let her know that you're healing now, that it's not hurting like it did. That's right. That is not even making you feel bad about you like it used to. That's right. Let her know that you're okay. Right. Without ever having mom have to acknowledge that it happened. That's right. Because you're being better at Nothing to do with Mom. Right? Right.
[107:54] B: Just like that.
[107:56] A: Right. Isn't that cool? What do you notice, Shirley? What's happening now?
[108:02] B: Is that crazy?
[108:04] A: Notice how the anger's not there. Right. Right. Because the limitations in others, I'm not going to be so troubled by. Because it's their limitation. Nobody gets pissed that they can't teach their dog how to play checkers.
[108:31] B: Point made. Point very well made.
[108:35] A: Not in their capacity. They're not capable.
[108:40] B: Gotcha. That is so cute.
[108:48] A: Right? That was the best thing we got from the daycare place. So notice what you're noticing. Like, how's your body feeling?
[109:01] B: I'm good.
[109:02] A: You are feeling drinking, aren't you? Yeah.
[109:05] B: Everything balanced?
[109:06] A: Things are getting there. We're on our way. Right. To lightening the load.
[109:13] B: Really? Really.
[109:17] A: Right? Yes. Isn't that cool?
[109:20] B: It is.
[109:21] A: Yeah.
[109:22] B: It feels great.
[109:23] A: Yeah.
[109:25] B: There's nothing up here. Nothing.
[109:29] A: Yeah. Migraine. So, again, as you and I are organizing towards the you present, dealing with what is without the emotional effect of what has feeling. Good, good. Lightening up on you. Right. Think about that. Blooper. Take a deep breath in. Eyes are closed. As you exhale, keeping eyes closed, continue to breathe a little slower and deeper. Deeper. That's right. Exhaling longer. Because as you do, your unconscious, integrating more and more of what it's got and learned, healing from the inside out. More of it is happening now as you rest. And there's nothing you need to do because the lights are getting turned on inside. That's right. That's right. And because your unconscious knows more than you or I learn. Which new tracks to lay, which adjustments to be made, which levers to shift, buttons to press, knobs to turn, switches to flip. Right. Scanning back through moments recent, longer time ago, where there's emotions. Sadness, regret, remorse, guilt, Shame, Pain, anger, resentment. Right. Turning the lights on. That's right. Whenever you're ready. That's right. I don't know what's coming to mind now. Should there be something? I don't know whether there's a should.
[113:09] B: Whether there's a should.
[113:12] A: But as we think about, you know, looking at the chronology of your life and things that happened, are there things that you've done where there's shame, guilt, regret? That's a bad idea.
[113:38] B: Really.
[113:42] A: I'm okay, right? Disgust, anger.
[113:50] B: Mm.
[113:51] A: That would be useful to get cleared and gone.
[113:58] B: Fine. How did you Know that there was a thing there with. Without me telling you there was a thing there. I'm just asking, how did you know there was a bing when I didn't even. You didn't even say the bing part.
[114:20] A: Because you're here. Because your unconscious is responsive, Shirley. Your unconscious is really responsive to you. It wants to work in ways that are best. It wants he healing to happen.
[114:32] B: I was waiting for.
[114:33] A: It wants your life to work. I want you to have access to the things and people that matter to you. Want you to be healthy and well.
[114:44] B: Was waiting for you to.
[114:46] A: It already was there.
[114:47] B: I know.
[114:48] A: I know.
[114:49] B: How did you.
[114:51] A: I watched.
[114:52] B: You didn't do the thing.
[114:54] A: I watched. It's right there.
[114:57] B: You didn't do the thing or you.
[115:00] A: Didn'T think I did the thing?
[115:01] B: I didn't think you did the thing.
[115:02] A: That's right.
[115:03] B: You did it a different way.
[115:04] A: I did. Why do you want to do it all the same way all the time?
[115:09] B: All right, I want to do the thing.
[115:11] A: There you go.
[115:12] B: I want to do it. Covid.

[116:29] A: I mean. I mean, might as well spend it.
[116:32] B: Might as well spend my last paycheck.
[116:33] A: Is meth expensive?
[116:34] B: No, it's cheap.
[116:35] A: Oh, it's cheap.
[116:36] B: It's really cheap.
[116:36] A: Oh, well, we're really glad that the good stuff for you is really cheap. Cheap. It's like the crap food that they have in the grocery stores is also the really cheap stuff you try to get. The nice organic vegetable stuff. That's way more expensive. The good stuff for you, like, what the hell?
[116:54] B: So let's see. Grandma got sick of me.
[116:57] A: Yes. Because, you know, you were using meth.
[116:59] B: Yeah.
[117:00] A: At grandma's.
[117:01] B: Kick me out.
[117:01] A: Right. She's like, you can't stay here.

[117:16] A: Grandma's like you all go. But you guys come back.
[117:19] B: No, they just came back and she just let. But she wouldn't let me come back. That's what. Whatever. It doesn't matter why. It doesn't matter why. It really doesn't. Living on the street for like maybe.
[117:33] A: A month, that's not really sheltering in place, huh?
[117:37] B: No, no, it's pretty rough. And everybody was just trying to get me to do things I didn't want to do. So.
[117:48] A: While you're on the street.
[117:49] B: Yeah, yeah, I just wanted to get high.
[117:51] A: Well, right, yeah. But you know, you weren't working.
[117:54] B: Yeah, no, I was stealing. Oh yeah, I wasn't working. Working yet.
[117:59] A: To be able to afford stuff.
[118:01] B: Yeah, I wasn't working yet cuz, you know, I was above it. I was better.
[118:06] A: Oh, okay then. Oh, that kind of working.
[118:09] B: Yeah.
[118:09] A: Not like the Holiday Inn.
[118:10] B: Not like the Holiday Inn. No, I couldn't find another job. I didn't try to find another job.
[118:15] A: Well. Cuz I was doing meth. They don't really hire people.
[118:16] B: Yeah, they don't really like that bad.
[118:19] A: When you do meth. Like how often you have to do math.
[118:22] B: I was IV so I could go like a good eight, 10 hours in between, but I would go for days and then pass out. Not fall asleep, pass out, wake up. The longest I slept was 27 hours. Oh, wow.
[118:41] A: Okay. Lost a whole day.
[118:42] B: Lost a full day. Anywho.
[118:48] A: Yes.
[118:49] B: Yeah, Lots of messages. A little bit of heroin.
[118:53] A: Okay. I might as well mix it.
[118:55] B: Didn't really. Yeah. Loved my first speedball, but didn't really like the heroin.
[118:59] A: Yeah.
[118:59] B: I don't want to go to sleep. That's boring.
[119:02] A: Yeah.
[119:03] B: Who wants to sleep?
[119:04] A: Right.
[119:07] B: So I, with a friend, a friend of mine went to this hotel room and there was this old man and he just wanted to like, like do a bunch of math and spend money.
[119:21] A: So you said, I'm in for a bunch of meth.
[119:25] B: I'm in for the bunch of meth.
[119:26] A: But the spend money part.
[119:28] B: Spend money. I'd rather just take it from you, if you don't mind. So I, I played him basically. I didn't do anything sexual with him, but I made him think I was going to.
[119:40] A: Yeah, that's right.
[119:41] B: Took me to Walmart, bought me a bunch of clothes.
[119:43] A: Right.
[119:43] B: Because I didn't have any Right. Was very nice man, except for he wanted me to have sex with him for money.
[119:50] A: Right.
[119:51] B: You know, so when he went inside the next door to buy me a pack of cigarettes.
[119:56] A: Yes.
[119:57] B: I stole his car.
[119:58] A: Oh, good.
[119:59] B: And drove it to Charlotte, North Carolina.
[120:00] A: Well, really close.
[120:03] B: And that's where I stayed for the past three years.
[120:05] A: Okay. In his car.
[120:07] B: No.
[120:08] A: Oh, no.
[120:12] B: Charlotte. Yeah, that was the brakes pumping. I stole his car.
[120:18] A: Right.
[120:18] B: Got a new tag.
[120:19] A: Yes.
[120:20] B: In Georgia.
[120:20] A: Yeah. Well, good idea.
[120:22] B: Kept going to Charlotte.
[120:24] A: That's right.
[120:24] B: Which. The piece of that's tattooed on my back. He was from Charlotte. Oh, but he was from.
[120:32] A: Then you met a guy.
[120:33] B: He was in prison at the time. So I went to Charlotte not knowing anybody.
[120:37] A: So you didn't know anybody?
[120:38] B: Not a soul.
[120:39] A: But you just wrote. You figured Charlotte because it's a nice girl's name.
[120:42] B: Because he was from there, cuz.
[120:45] A: Who? Who's he?
[120:45] B: Frankie.
[120:46] A: Frankie. Who's Frankie?
[120:47] B: I don't know anything about Frankie.
[120:49] A: How did you know Frankie before he was in prison?
[120:51] B: I met him on Tinder.
[120:55] A: Are you kidding?
[120:58] B: I met him on Tinder. And we both liked, like to do a bunch of drugs.
[121:02] A: Right.
[121:02] B: So.
[121:03] A: And that you met him when?
[121:06] B: Right around Covid. February.
[121:09] A: So two months. Like before you moved into the Grandma.
[121:13] B: No, same time. It's all the same.
[121:15] A: After you got fired.
[121:16] B: Like, we both got out of prison at the same time.
[121:20] A: Yeah, but you started working.
[121:21] B: I was working. A regular job.
[121:22] A: Exactly.
[121:23] B: But he. I just met him on Tinder because.
[121:25] A: He liked eating right.
[121:27] B: Also use drugs. So it's probably with him that I started using the drugs again.
[121:33] A: Oh, okay, good. Frankie was a good guy.
[121:35] B: Frankie was a great guy. No, he was a piece of.
[121:37] A: Oh, okay, good.
[121:38] B: Yeah.
[121:39] A: So then Frankie went back to prison.
[121:41] B: Frankie went to prison. He got a year in prison.
[121:45] A: Got a year in prison for parole violation. Right, Good. So he got a year in prison. Not jail, prison.
[121:52] B: Prison.
[121:53] A: Right.
[121:53] B: Federal prison.
[121:54] A: Good. Right. Yeah, It's a lot easier.
[121:56] B: It's a lot easier. Federal prison is a lot easier, actually. You got better food. Yeah.
[122:06] A: Yeah.
[122:07] B: Deep breath, huh? Who's taking the deep breaths?
[122:10] A: There we go.
[122:11] B: Okay. So then you drove.
[122:14] A: He said, hey, Charlotte's. Great place.
[122:15] B: Yeah.
[122:16] A: Go up to Charlotte.
[122:16] B: So I had in my head, I was gonna go to Charlotte, right. And then I stole the car so I could.
[122:21] A: Right. Drive.
[122:22] B: It's all like, cool, right? Okay, cool. Not danger to myself or others. This is all cool. Right?
[122:30] A: So you drive to Charlotte.
[122:32] B: Oh, my God.
[122:33] A: With new plates.
[122:34] B: With new plates.
[122:35] A: Right.
[122:38] B: Stayed at a shitty hotel.
[122:40] A: Right.
[122:41] B: When I got there because you had.
[122:42] A: A lot of money to spend and no money. Right.
[122:45] B: Took the clothes that the guy bought me and returned them to Walmart because I had the receipt.
[122:49] A: Nice.
[122:50] B: So I could get money.
[122:51] A: Right. Yeah.
[122:51] B: Because I still wasn't doing that.
[122:53] A: Right.
[122:53] B: And then I met this guy.
[122:54] A: Different guy. Not Frankie. Not Frankie. Okay.
[122:56] B: Frankie's in prison, right? He's gone.
[122:58] A: He was gone.
[122:59] B: Forget about him.
[122:59] A: Right. But I got my tattoo. I got his tattoo on my back. I do.
[123:02] B: I have his name tattooed on my back.
[123:04] A: Yeah. No sleep Frankie, in that very short period of time. No sleep Frankie, no sleep. That's what it says. No sleep Frankie. Literally in the back. Isn't that nice? But that was during the time that you were doing the drugs with Frankie and you decided, hey, you know, it'd be really cool. I'd like to get a tattoo of no sleep Frankie on the back. He's like, yeah, you'll never be able to see it. It's great.
[123:24] B: I almost got it on my face.
[123:26] A: Better that you didn't. Good job. Smart moves, that one. Wait a minute. I'll get it on my face. All right. Maybe not.
[123:37] B: Maybe just my back.
[123:37] A: Put it on my back so I never see it.
[123:39] B: Yeah, Right. And then I got 704, which is Charlotte's area.
[123:44] A: Oh, nice.
[123:45] B: Never been to Charlotte.
[123:46] A: 704.
[123:47] B: Never been to Charlotte when I got the tattoos.
[123:49] A: Right. And then people are like, wow, you really must like Charlotte, huh?
[123:52] B: I guess I'm gonna move there. No, I just read the other guy. Then I met E. E, E. Yeah.
[124:01] A: In the lovely, nice hotel.
[124:04] B: And the day I met him is the first time I posted my ad.
[124:10] A: Oh, right. So he's like, hey, you know, we've got a good way for you to make money.
[124:14] B: Well, my brother's girlfriend had previously done these things, and I was just like. I would type for her while she was, like, doing whatever.
[124:21] A: Right.
[124:21] B: Getting high, taking a shower or whatever. I would just talk to the guys for her.
[124:25] A: Sure.
[124:26] B: And she would pay me to talk to the guys.
[124:28] A: Right.
[124:28] B: So I already knew the game.
[124:30] A: Yeah.
[124:31] B: So it was his idea, but it was my idea.
[124:35] A: Yeah. But.
[124:36] B: Yeah.
[124:40] A: And it was different because of Charlotte.
[124:42] B: It was different because it was Charlotte. My family wasn't around. They never know. They will never know. They'll never know.
[124:47] A: Yeah. They found out because it's Charlotte. I mean, it's not like we're interconnected at all.
[124:52] B: I mean, at first, they. They didn't know where I went.
[124:55] A: That's right.
[124:56] B: I had to call her for help. Like, six months later. And that's when she figured out where I was.
[125:00] A: Right. But yeah.
[125:03] B: Yeah.
[125:05] A: So you put your first ad out.
[125:08] B: Got my first play.
[125:09] A: Right. And did they come to you or you go to them?
[125:12] B: I went to them. He drove me in my stolen car.
[125:15] A: Oh, very nice. He was very chivalrous to drive you in the stolen car that you stole that he was driving. That became his pretty much, you know? Isn't that crazy how that fucking worked? Mm, yeah. Right. So then you went and did that.
[125:33] B: I went and did that. It was really easy. I didn't even have to do anything.
[125:37] A: Right. I mean. Cause he's a guy.
[125:39] B: You have no idea how easy it was. If it wouldn't have been that easy, I probably might have gone the other way with it.
[125:45] A: But it's a guy.
[125:46] B: It's a guy, so I didn't even have to touch it.
[125:50] A: Ready? All right, done. All right, good. Awesome. That was great.
[125:52] B: $250.
[125:53] A: Nice. Boom. And that is the fastest money for not doing nothing that I've ever earned.
[125:58] B: E was asleep in the car. I tapped on the window. He's like, you done already? Yeah, I'm done already. I got money.
[126:06] A: That's right. I can go get high. Right.
[126:08] B: Go get another hotel room.
[126:10] A: Right. Cause that's all it was about. Yeah, Right.
[126:12] B: And I can keep going right now. I can keep going. And once I started, I was very dedicated to my work.
[126:21] A: Oh, okay.
[126:22] B: Yeah. Well, I'm a hard worker. Look, I was great desk front desk clerk. I worked at J. Cr. J. Crew warehouse. I was great at that.
[126:34] A: Right.
[126:34] B: You know, just. You know, just go above and beyond McCall.
[126:37] A: That's right.
[126:38] B: So, yeah, once I started.
[126:40] A: Yeah.
[126:42] B: I couldn't stop. I really couldn't. Like, I got addict to the money more than meth, because meth is cheap.
[126:49] A: Yeah.
[126:49] B: And then I go out and spend that money, you know?
[126:53] A: Right.
[126:53] B: And get a car that's actually mine.
[126:58] A: Right.
[126:58] B: And get clothes.
[127:01] A: Right.
[127:02] B: Because I had already returned all this close to the Walmart, so I gotta get new clothes.
[127:05] A: That's right. Yeah.
[127:07] B: And just kept going.
[127:08] A: Yeah.
[127:09] B: And then I thought I loved him, E. Yeah. I still think I loved him. I still think I loved him.
[127:20] A: You still right now?
[127:21] B: Yeah, I still right now think I loved him.
[127:23] A: Oh, then or now?
[127:26] B: Then.
[127:27] A: Oh, you don't think you love him now?
[127:30] B: I think I have let go of.
[127:34] A: What was it that you loved about him? Protected me. Oh, did he? Protective by taking the car?
[127:41] B: I mean, I gave him the car.
[127:43] A: Stolen car and some of the money.
[127:45] B: No, I gave him the money. I gave him the drugs, made it real easy for him, you know, I made it easy. He didn't have to ask me for anything.
[127:54] A: No, no, no. Watch you keep thinking I gave him the money, I gave him the car, I gave him the drugs.
[128:05] B: All he had to do was pretend to love me.
[128:08] A: No, it's not just pretend to love you. You could not give him the money or the drugs or. See, that's the world of the manipulation, coercion, psychological is. It's literally still stuck in your head that I voluntarily did it. Like even right now, as you're telling me. No, no, I totally voluntarily did it.
[128:41] B: I did. I. Like, I totally did.
[128:44] A: Yes, that's what you keep thinking, is that you totally voluntarily did it.
[128:47] B: Right.
[128:48] A: What if you didn't?
[128:50] B: I would be very surprised.
[128:51] A: What if there was some version of psychological manipulation and coercion involved?
[128:57] B: I'm sure there was.
[128:58] A: That had it look like you were voluntarily doing it.
[129:05] B: I'm sure there was.
[129:12] A: Right. See, what you didn't know back then when you were giving it to him, thinking that you were doing it because you love him, because he protects you, is that there was a whole nother thing that was going on with him that had to do with psychological manipulation and coercion that had you feel like, oh, no, I'm indebted to him. So I'm going to do this for him, you know, because I do this to take care of the people that I love. Right, right, right. Because, I mean, he's worth half at least.
[129:37] B: Oh, no, I didn't give him that much. He definitely manipulated me to where, like, okay, the next day after I made the money, I left because I did not like it there. And he blew my phone up at that hotel. I did not like it there at all.
[129:56] A: Right.
[129:56] B: Like, so he blew my phone up.
[130:02] A: Constantly until I came back to that hotel. Yeah, because he liked it there because.
[130:08] B: He lived there his whole damn life. Yeah, like, the. There's a apartment complex right behind the hotel. He lived there his whole damn life.
[130:15] A: So, yeah.
[130:16] B: Yeah, that's his spot. Yeah.
[130:20] A: Right.
[130:22] B: So, yeah, I came back because I thought he wanted me back there, but it wasn't much.
[130:30] A: But he did want you back there. Yeah, he wanted me back there. Oh, yeah.
[130:34] B: And he wanted me to think that he loved me, cared about me.
[130:37] A: He wanted you back there. Why?
[130:43] B: Why? For real or why? I thought.
[130:46] A: Just check it out for both the why you thought I thought he cared about me.
[130:52] B: Thought he cared about me.
[130:54] A: And he saw that if somebody cares about you they want you to live in a skeevy place that makes you feel uncomfortable. Okay. So just checking. I'm glad that you're clear about that. Now.
[131:09] B: No, now.
[131:10] A: Okay.
[131:12] B: Actually, he just saw that I like to make the money, and I like to spend the money, and I like to do the drugs. So. So I was, like, perfect for him. And I had the car. Because I had taken the car. I left.
[131:25] A: Yeah, I got in the car. Right.
[131:27] B: But he wanted me back there because I had all the things.
[131:30] A: He wanted you back there because you had all the things. And you being back there was easier to track you, easier to control you.
[131:39] B: Mm.
[131:40] A: Easier to know where you are at all times. Easier to. To direct you.
[131:46] B: And then I was not allowed to come out of the room.
[131:49] A: Easier for him to direct who comes to see you.
[131:53] B: Mm. Mm. Well, if I. If he did, I didn't know about it. Yeah. Cuz I refused to have a pimp. I. He was my boyfriend.
[132:07] A: Boyfriend.
[132:08] B: You know, I refused to have a pimp. So any.
[132:11] A: I mean, we can call it whatever we want.
[132:12] B: People. I know. I know. Any people that came to see me is because. No, I'm doing my own texting.
[132:18] A: Of course.
[132:18] B: I'm doing my own footwork.
[132:20] A: First of all, who's going to be better at it? Me, the girl or the guy? Yeah, of course. So who's going to be better at being able to text stuff to a guy to get a guy to come and see them?
[132:34] B: I was texting.
[132:35] A: Do you think it's another guy?
[132:37] B: No, no, I was doing all the work.
[132:40] A: Right. Do you know what pimps do?
[132:45] B: No.
[132:46] A: Oh, they get you to do all the work. See, Shirley, this is the best part about all of this. I just want you to take a step away from your life. No, no, it wasn't that. He was my boyfriend. I didn't let him do that. I did all the work. But I did give him some of the money, and I did give him some. Some of the drugs, and I did buy him, and all I had to do is just kind of be there.
[133:11] B: And then like a month later, he got $11,000 from unemployment back pay, and I was, like, gone.
[133:21] A: Yeah.
[133:21] B: And then as soon as that money ran out, he loved me again, which was not very long.
[133:27] A: Right.
[133:27] B: Because he likes smoke crack, and crack is not a cheap joke.
[133:32] A: Way more expensive than meth. Way.
[133:34] B: Yeah.
[133:35] A: Okay, then. Yeah.
[133:36] B: So you ran out quick.
[133:38] A: Yeah.
[133:39] B: And I think he had somebody babysitting me while he was like.
[133:44] A: Right, but you were still staying at that.
[133:46] B: No. Oh, no.
[133:47] A: Oh, you Left the motel.
[133:48] B: I left the motel, went to another crappy motel. Because by then, I was stuck in the life. By then, I felt like this was a great option. Look at all the money I'm making. I ain't never made so much money in my life.
[134:00] A: Right. But I'm staying in a hotel room.
[134:03] B: Yeah, staying in a hotel room. Because if you had a house, would you have these jokers come to your house? So you might as well just stay in the hotel room. I'm not gonna get a whole house and then have these clowns come to my house. Gotta have the hotel room so I can jump around or stay on the move.
[134:22] A: Oh, right. You know, so good.
[134:25] B: Right? It's so ridiculous. I know. So for quite some time, it was back and forth between me and him.
[134:34] A: Right.
[134:34] B: And he had other girls, and I would get mad.
[134:37] A: Oh, he did, didn't he?
[134:38] B: You know, the reality of it all kind of, like, struck me. Next thing you know, I'm a bottom bitch, and. Excuse me. And that's when I bucked on him and stopped giving him anything.
[134:50] A: Right.
[134:51] B: So he got with somebody else.
[134:52] A: Rachel.
[134:54] B: And she would do anything for him, and she's still under him, even though he's in prison.
[135:00] A: He's in prison, though, too.
[135:02] B: He's in prison, too. Oh, Frankie got out. Oh, you don't want to know all this.
[135:10] A: Well, first of all, how are you doing right now as you're telling me about it?
[135:15] B: I'm okay. It's okay. Cause I made. I feel like I made empowered decisions once I realized what the hell I was doing.
[135:24] A: Yeah. So let's think back to the you who didn't think that E was her pen. Yeah, right.
[135:31] B: Ooh, I got defensive.
[135:33] A: Let's just think back to the you that didn't think E was her pimp. And as we look at it, clearly, what does a pimp do?
[135:44] B: Everything he was doing.
[135:46] A: That's right. And get you to do. Who's the workhorse with it? Feeling like you're doing it because you want to. I'm giving him some of the money because I want to. Mm.
[136:08] B: Yeah. My first week in Charlotte, I told him I slept with more guys this week than I have my whole life because I don't like people touching me. I know. I know. That's why I always had beaten charge. Anybody that would stray from my routine, I would leave. I robbed a lot of guys.
[136:34] A: Yeah.
[136:34] B: Like, I just took their money and took off.
[136:36] A: Sure.
[136:36] B: A lot.
[136:37] A: Right.
[136:40] B: A lot of guys I didn't rob, though.
[136:42] A: Right. Yeah.
[136:45] B: So back To Evie and pimp.
[136:46] A: Right again. So going back to the you who thought he was her boyfriend, what does she need to know?
[136:57] B: He just used you up and spit you out.
[136:59] A: Well, no, you got out. See, there's two things. One, he was your pimp. You didn't know that he was a pimp. But he was having you be his workhorse. He wasn't having to do anything, and he was getting compensated, Right? You didn't know that then. You thought he was your boyfriend, Right? Right. So was there love there? Or was the love what you do for me? I'll give you an example. I worked with one of the people before they were turning a trick. The guy did something that he wasn't supposed to do. He wanted anal. That was not part of the agreement. He forced it. He did it. She was her. Her boyfriend. Pimp found out, took a baseball bat, beat the out of the guy, got arrested for it, told her he did it because I love you. He did this because he loves me. He beat the out of that guy because he loves me. He totally loves me. Nobody has ever done that for me in that way. He must really love me. Hut was hooked, right? Did he do that because he loved her? If somebody had slashed his tires in his truck, he would have done the same thing to him. Because he loves his truck because he uses his truth. Because somebody fucked with his possession. He didn't beat the shit out of that guy because he loves her. He beat the shit out of that guy because somebody screwed with his possession. Got it. So the thing that we want to realize is when that earlier you. First of all, she thought it was his boyfriend, thought it was real love. Right? But when she finally realized he literally.
[139:04] B: Used those words often.
[139:09] A: Right. When she finally realized that it wasn't, he left.
[139:18] B: Left, came back. Left, came back. It ain't that easy, but yeah.
[139:23] A: Well, are you with him right now? No.
[139:25] B: Hell no, I don't.
[139:29] A: Do you get that? So I don't care how many times it took you to finally fully leave. The key thing is you left. You're not with him now. That's right. That's what we want to get in. So close your eyes and think back to the earlier you and let her know what you know now that that's over, that you see it clearly for what it was. And as soon as she realized she left. She got away. And now she's fully away and gone. Done, over, finished, completed. Right? Because you're worth more to it than right. You're worth it to you. That's why you had to protest that it was boyfriend, not pimp, right? Cause I'm doing this thing for us, baby. That's right. And again, as this is getting in, what do you notice? Now that's about a breath. You're so good.
[140:57] B: I don't even care. Like, I really don't care.
[141:00] A: Right.
[141:01] B: Like, all this stuff I felt like. Cause he made me look stupid that I had to make him look stupid. Stupid.
[141:12] A: Yeah.
[141:13] B: And I held on to that for a long, long time.
[141:15] A: Right?
[141:16] B: It wasn't that I loved him anymore. It was that I needed to make him look like a fool. Like, he made me feel like a fool.
[141:23] A: How did he make you feel like a fool?
[141:26] B: Because I thought he was my boyfriend. But he's telling people.
[141:32] A: She'S one of my. Right.
[141:34] B: One of my girls.
[141:35] A: That's right. You didn't bottom. So here's the cool. Right? So you can remember him saying that.
[141:41] B: Oh, I got mad.
[141:43] A: Yes, but you got mad because you didn't know. That's what I mean. So what I want you to realize is if I didn't know, I couldn't be any different. It wasn't until I got it that I could change it. Up until that point, I didn't know, right, that I was being manipulated and played. I thought it was real love. Do you follow me with that? I didn't. But you get it. It wasn't until you finally got it that you could change it and you did. And that's the part, Shirley, that we want you to start to feel really good about. Right? You didn't know. You thought it was one thing. When you finally realized it was something else, that's when you stopped. And that was the first moment of me getting away and getting away and finally getting fully away.
[142:45] B: But I think I need to let go of the anger. Just like I let go of the anger that had to do with my mom.
[142:50] A: What's the anger about?
[142:52] B: Just that he treated me that way and he manipulated me and he fooled me and I fell for it.
[142:57] A: So who's the anger for?
[142:59] B: Me.
[143:00] A: Oh, the anger's on you. Yeah. You're angry at you.
[143:04] B: But I'm angry at him, huh? But I'm angry at me.
[143:07] A: Well, you can. You can remember him doing that, and you can remember falling for it, and you can remember putting on your sandals.
[143:16] B: I'm not putting on my sandals.
[143:17] A: Well, then stop falling for that.
[143:19] B: I'm not falling for that.
[143:19] A: Well, then stop him from doing that.
[143:21] B: He's not doing that.
[143:21] A: Well, then you stop doing that.
[143:22] B: I'M not doing that.
[143:23] A: We'll stop putting on your glasses.
[143:24] B: I'm not putting on my glasses.
[143:25] A: We'll stop him from saying it's real love.
[143:29] B: He did not say it was real love. He's not saying it's real love.
[143:34] A: That's right. That's right. Is he a threat to you now?
[143:37] B: He is not a threat.
[143:38] A: That's right. Anger is a response to perceived threat that for all animals. As soon as the threat is over, the anger goes away.
[143:48] B: He is not a threat.
[143:49] A: Right. Mama bear gets mad when she sees a man poking a stick at bear cub. She'll ferociously attack, run after man. If she kills him, she's not feeling guilty. Maybe I overreacted. I could have just scared him if he got away. She's not talking to the other bears in the bear den. If you find this motherfucker, you hold him for me. No. Over. Right. So the thing is, you've been thinking that earlier you should have known better. Right? If she had known better, would she have done it?
[144:25] B: I don't know.
[144:26] A: Oh, you don't?
[144:27] B: I don't know.
[144:28] A: If you had known that the first time you met E. That he was going to. That he's a pimp and he'll be your pimp.
[144:34] B: No.
[144:36] A: And we write up a contract that he gets 20% of all your earnings. No.
[144:42] B: No. Yeah. That wasn't a flu.
[144:45] A: You follow me? Like, if we could float back along the timeline prior to you ever meeting Yi, and if that you back then had known. Right. Would she have done it?
[144:59] B: I think that's why Frankie sent me there and told me to go there. I think they knew each other, I think, because he told me which hotel to go to. He told me where. So it was Frankie, too.
[145:13] A: Right.
[145:13] B: Thank God I didn't put his name on my face.
[145:16] A: Good idea.
[145:17] B: But that conclusion didn't come until I was back in Florida.
[145:22] A: Do you follow me with that? So if you had known all of that, even with Frankie back then. Right. Would you have gone to Charlotte and stayed at that hotel?
[145:31] B: I wouldn't have gone to Charlotte.
[145:33] A: That's right. But see, if we. You didn't know that back then, and we can't have regret and remorse or guilt and shame about something we didn't know was gonna happen. So what would it be like for you to lighten up on the earlier you?
[145:49] B: Hmm?
[145:51] A: Right. That she just didn't know. Right. She was a little naive in that world. Right. So that she gets it. Right. And as the earlier you is realizing it from you. What do you notice now?
[146:14] B: Calm.
[146:15] A: Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing?
[146:18] B: He's not clouding my mind.
[146:20] A: No, you're becoming more clear because you're seeing it clearly. And we're also getting that with all the factors that were going on back then, you did what occurred for you to do and you couldn't have not done it even if later on we wish you hadn't. Right. So that you lighten up on you. Because you're better off. Right. Hi. There we go.
[146:53] B: Is that what you were waiting for?
[146:54] A: There we go. That's a good news thing. I never know what I'm waiting for or whether I'm waiting for anything at all.
[147:02] B: Yeah.
[147:02] A: My job is to be here.
[147:04] B: You just know when it comes. Right?
[147:06] A: Right. And respond to it as it's happening. Right, Right. Cause try to feel really bad about you for having gotten into that thing with him. What do you notice?
[147:24] B: Still mad at him though.
[147:26] A: Oh, what if you weren't? What are you mad at him about? So let me ask you, is the anger that he did it or is it coming from the thought that he shouldn't have done it? Oh, good, let's get that going.
[147:41] B: Thank you.
[147:42] A: Because here's the thing.
[147:43] B: Still there.
[147:45] A: But that's what it is. It's no longer about what he did. It's coming from the thought that he shouldn't have done it, shouldn't have been that way. So here's the thing. Intellectually, you can conceive of him having not been that way. Your emotional brain is trying to motivate you to get them to not be that way. Hurry.
[148:05] B: Still got the tattoo on my back.
[148:06] A: Uh huh. So watch. Year ago, this guy's brother had asked him to go on a motorcycle ride. He didn't go. His brother died. He's feeling guilty. He thinks he feels guilty because he should have gone, but he's not. He's feeling guilty because intellectually he can conceive of having gone. And if he had his brother Michael still be alive, that would be better. So here's the problem. Intellectually, he can conceive of this alternative outcome to something that's already ended. Emotional brain goes because it works like an animal. If you can think it, that means we can do it. Because an animal can only think of doing things that they can actually do. If they can't do it, they can't think it. That's why porcupines aren't trying to build hang gliders to fly.
[148:51] B: Got you.
[148:52] A: So the emotional brain goes, well, if you can think it that means we can do it. So the anger, which is what you're experiencing, is your emotional brain trying to get you to get him to not be that way. Hurry. We'll stop Frankie from sending you to eat. Quick. Well, there's nothing to be done. Because when your brain gets either, A, it no longer exists, or B, there's nothing to be done, it stops causing the feeling. Right. So I can simply say to you, well, then stop Frankie from sending you to E. Hurry. And you go, there's nothing to be done.
[149:28] B: Get the tattoo.
[149:29] A: Say there's nothing to be done.
[149:30] B: There's nothing to be done.
[149:31] A: No. Hurry. Stop him from doing that. Quick. Say, there's nothing to be done.
[149:34] B: There's nothing to be done.
[149:36] A: What are you waiting for? Come on.
[149:37] B: There's nothing to be done.
[149:38] A: Right. Well, then stop getting the tattoo.
[149:41] B: I'm not getting the tattoo.
[149:42] A: No. Hurry. Come on. We'll stop quick.
[149:46] B: It's so hard.
[149:47] A: Say there's nothing to be done.
[149:49] B: This is a tough one.
[149:50] A: Well, no, I don't think so. Because you know what? You didn't know back then that by getting a tattoo on your back with somebody's name that that was what pimps have.
[150:01] B: I don't know who was more manipulative, Frankie or E. Or both. I think they were together. I don't even know.
[150:07] A: Right, but see, you didn't know that then. Right? Got it.
[150:15] B: Mm.
[150:16] A: So the anger about them is thinking that they shouldn't have been that way. Well, then stop them from being that way. Hurry. Go. There's nothing to be done. Say there's nothing to be done.
[150:27] B: There's nothing to be done.
[150:28] A: No. Stop them from doing that during COVID times.
[150:31] B: There's nothing to do.
[150:31] A: No. Hurry. What do you. Come on.
[150:33] B: There's nothing to be done.
[150:34] A: Right. Why? Because it no longer exists. Does that define you?
[150:40] B: No.
[150:41] A: Does the tattoo define who you are?
[150:44] B: No.
[150:45] A: Right. Can that get changed?
[150:48] B: Yes.
[150:48] A: Here's the cool part about it. It's not on your face or your neck. Right. Like, we could have a worse problem. Shirley, it could be on your neck.
[151:01] B: I have a picture of a stencil where the stencil was on my face the night I got the tattoo.
[151:07] A: Right, right. Got it. Not only that, you never see it.
[151:15] B: I feel it.
[151:17] A: I don't know whether you do. I don't feel that one or that one.
[151:22] B: This one doesn't hurt as much.
[151:24] A: Well, it doesn't hurt at all.
[151:25] B: It doesn't hurt at all.
[151:26] A: That's right. That one.
[151:30] B: Why do I still feel that one?
[151:32] A: I don't know. Do you right now? Feel it? No. How do you know?
[151:38] B: Because we're talking about it.
[151:39] A: Oh. What if we took that one off? I mean, not that the thing off, but the feeling outside of it. What might it be in the shape of? You know, the hurt feeling. What might it be in the shape of? Make it up.
[151:55] B: Shape of that tattoo.
[151:57] A: Good.
[151:57] B: So what's that? Crescent.
[151:59] A: Yeah. So we take the crescent shape and put it out there. We think of you sitting here with me. We think of a you really troubled by that crescent shape down there. But up above out there. We then have you slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue and breathe a little slower, exhale a little longer. Right. Begin to lighten up on you moving that crescent even further on the other side of the wall and on the other side of the room, way out into the parking lot. See the ewe up above, who is really troubled. Soaring above it like a bird flying free gliding and moving. That's right. Because you're on your way to lightening up on you. Because that can be changed in your back. That's right. And it can be just a, you know, backwards reminder of who you're not. That's why it's in the back. Because it's a backwards reminder.
[153:16] B: Who I never was.
[153:17] A: That's right. Because that's not you. That's right. Right. So now what's happen?
[153:35] B: Mm, the lumps are going away.
[153:38] A: What about you being okay isn't fully quite okay? See, I still think that. That earlier you're looking back, not so angry at them. I think you keep looking back at that earlier, you saying, idiot. You should have known better.
[153:55] B: That's not you. I know it. I knew it wasn't me when I was doing.
[154:00] A: That's right. But she didn't. She. Okay, so let's just check. Was she in her right state? Because she totally went and got the tattoo. Stone sold. Sober. Stone cold sober.
[154:13] B: I gotcha. Nope. Not at all.
[154:23] A: Right.
[154:25] B: She had, like, suggestion of.
[154:26] A: She had, like, 90 days of having not used it all, and life was going really well. And she's like, you know, it'd be really cool. I'd like to get a tattoo. It was Jackass's name, right.
[154:36] B: Who I barely know.
[154:37] A: Right, Right. But at that point, life was spiraling in a way that hadn't been working. Stupid Covid. And not just Covid before COVID Because the stuff that was going on with that first X. Because where we're gonna do in our next visit is adjust this bad picker. Horrible that find me picking these up.
[155:15] B: Yes, please.
[155:16] A: We're gonna get to that next. But we needed to do this first. Okay, Gotcha. We want to get the picker adjusted so that we can.
[155:26] B: Extremely adjusted.
[155:27] A: Yeah, Right.
[155:28] B: Gotcha.
[155:29] A: Because think of it coming out of that awful relationship into then losing the kids and then having stuck at jail for a long chunk of time, to getting out of jail, to starting finally. Okay. I'm going to get life working, to having to get back then Covid happening and then getting whirlwinded into this other world that I wasn't even involved in before.
[155:59] B: And then my brother died.
[156:01] A: Right.
[156:02] B: And now I'm back here. And then I met Selah.
[156:06] A: Yeah. So just think of how much better things are. Right? Because you know who you're finally choosing. Yeah. This guy that you're worth it to you. That's what's happening. That's the coolest part. It's the hardest part, is that you're worth it to you. That's why when you think back about the stuff that we've already cleared, think back about the stuff that happened with grandpa's son. Right? Think back, right? Think back about the stuff in the courthouse. Right. Notice how we still miss, but it's not so heavy.
[156:49] B: I don't feel like I'm gonna cry now.
[156:51] A: Right.
[156:51] B: Every time I used to talk about it before.
[156:53] A: Right? Right. Think about the guy who had raised you and brother leaving. Right. Notice how lots of things that did have weight are getting lifted, lightened and cleared. So you're better now on the way to even that. Much better. And the coolest part is you're worth it to you.
[157:23] B: I'm worth it to me.
[157:24] A: That's right. And you're worth. You're getting an environment around you that also sees you as worth it. Even the barefoot smiley face. What?
[157:41] B: The barefoot smiley face, Morgan. Oh. I was like, what? The barefoot smiley face. She is.
[157:50] A: That's right. Right. Yeah. That's why people didn't go, well, get the fuck out of here.
[157:59] B: They could have.
[158:01] A: They went, hey, let's get you a cool down period because you're worth it to us. Because we know that you pick you and we're really interested in supporting you, becoming a better version of you so that you have a life that. That works really well for you.
[158:21] B: I'm not used to that.
[158:22] A: I know. That's the weirdest. What do you mean? People helping me.
[158:25] B: What do you mean?
[158:26] A: You fuck, man. I want these manipulative fuckers.
[158:29] B: Well, imagine that.
[158:31] A: Make me think that they're on my side. Not actually a real person that's actually on my side.
[158:36] B: What do you mean you care about me? What do you mean you actually care about me? What is that? You know?
[158:42] A: Yeah. Is.
[158:44] B: It's hard to like, that's the thing.
[158:47] A: That'S starting to open. It is not about believing it. It's about continuing to watch the walk, not the talk. Because all the other people gave you the talk.
[159:01] B: Mm.
[159:02] A: They were good at it and not the walk. I don't need you to look at the talk. I want you to see the walk.
[159:12] B: What they do and how they do it.
[159:16] A: Right. My stuff isn't talk. Because you even went, I didn't believe you.
[159:25] B: I doubted you. I was like.
[159:31] A: See, the really cool part about it is that despite doubting, you kept your eyes open and you played the game and you got to notice the change.
[159:41] B: And I won the game.
[159:43] A: That's right. Yeah. You did great. You're on your way. I'm so excited.
[159:50] B: I am too.
[159:50] A: Yeah. And then we'll get back together again and do more.
[159:53] B: Oh, yeah.
[159:53] A: Yeah, of course.
[159:54] B: Okay.
[159:55] A: Because we're not done. We got a whole chunk done.
[159:58] B: Yeah. Big chunk done.
[159:59] A: Right. Right. So what you're gonna know is you're going to notice things in different ways. It'll be in the moment, in situations that normally would trigger you. You'll be noticing, hey, wait a minute. I'm not feeling. Huh?
[160:11] B: I'm not even mad.
[160:12] A: Right. Or it'll go and you'll have a little. And it won't last. Or you'll go through the experience and think back and went, hey, normally that would have done something crazy and it didn't. Right. Got it. Yeah. You did great today. Really good. Connecting with you.
[160:29] B: Yay.
[160:30] A: Alright, we'll stop with that for now.
