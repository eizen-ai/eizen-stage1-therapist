[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 27th of June. Surely we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And given what we do is useful, valuable, the recording might be made available in teaching and training others. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:14] B: Yes.
[00:15] A: Cool. All right, so first, because it's been a while. How did our last session leave you?
[00:20] B: Awesome. Yeah.
[00:22] A: Good. Yeah. What did you notice for yourself that was new and different?
[00:27] B: Just the things that usually bother me barely touch me. Like, and I'm able to just, like. Like, if it's important, obviously we need to think about it for a little while, but it's not sitting and, like, festering and bothering me constantly.
[00:44] A: Okay, that's cool.
[00:45] B: So, like, things in between the family. I ache. I could talk to my grandma without getting triggered by, like, some of the stuff that happened in the past.
[00:59] A: Okay, cool.
[00:59] B: So that was really cool. Yeah, you know, just. It's great.
[01:04] A: Cool.
[01:04] B: Much better.
[01:05] A: Yeah. When you think about the stuff that happened in Charlotte, when you think about Frankie, what do you notice about that stuff?
[01:11] B: I don't even think about Frankie. I don't think about.
[01:16] A: Okay, well, that's cool, too.
[01:18] B: Sometimes the trafficker, his name's E. Sometimes he crosses my mind because he was more involved, like, than Frankie was. But I still dislike him greatly. Yeah, but that's about it. Like, you know, I don't hold on to that false hope that he really loved me or, like, the bitterness that our anger towards myself. Yeah.
[01:47] A: It's like. Okay, so that's better.
[01:51] B: You didn't even bother me.
[01:52] A: Hey.
[01:53] B: Yeah. So that's good. Yeah, that's good.
[01:55] A: Yeah. And you've noticed it in different situations, current situations, that you're not as reactive as you once were?
[02:03] B: Yes.
[02:05] A: Cool.
[02:06] B: That's great.
[02:07] A: Well, that's really good news. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, I'm glad about that.
[02:12] B: Yeah.
[02:12] A: What kind of comes to the tip top of what we want. Want to be doing today? You said you got in trouble for reading a book.
[02:18] B: I didn't get in trouble for reading a book, but I feel like they were, like, bumping me to the top of the list because. Okay. I did a thing where. Okay. You know, they're very picky about media at Salah. Like, what we're allowed to watch, what we're allowed to listen to, what we're allowed to read in certain phases.
[02:37] A: Okay.
[02:38] B: So I did a sneaky sneak, and I checked out a book that I knew I wasn't supposed check out from the library.
[02:43] A: Yeah, the library that we Saw each other.
[02:45] B: Yep, that's the one. And I took advantage of a new advocate that like, I knew she wasn't gonna notice that I did it. So that's old habits number one. Like it was called if you tell. And it was a horrible book about a true story that the woman tortured her friend for over the course of five years. Starved her beater. It was very graphic and it was horrible.
[03:16] A: It was a fun read.
[03:18] B: No, not at all. But I sure enough read it and I was triggered through the entire week last week. And I didn't know it. I didn't. Obviously I knew that I was being an asshole to these people because I had to apologize to like, resident and then advocate, advocate, whole house, another resident, another advocate. Like just throughout all last week, over and over and over. So it wasn't until yesterday that Deborah was like, you're. You're operating from an activated trigger state. Like you're not acting like yourself. And I even had like victim mentality, which is definitely not me. I'm not normally like that. And it was because, like, in my mind, I was like this victim, you know, like I put myself in her shoes. So throughout, like actual life, I'm like operating from like, if I was a victim. And I was like, wow, that's crazy. And I didn't realize it right away. As soon as soon as she said it and when she said I was triggered, I was like, you know, you always go to childhood first. Like, okay, what happened? I was like, no, I know what this is. This is this freaking book. Because it didn't start until I read the book. Started reading the book, like starting to get into the book. Cuz I got it on Saturday. It was not just the book. No, I was triggered by the abuse that she suffered and you know, etc. Etc.
[04:49] A: You may have had reminders of other abuse.
[04:51] B: Yeah, yeah. My own views.
[04:54] A: Yeah.
[04:55] B: So yeah, it was. It was pretty bad. And I didn't start to feel better until I was like, okay, I have to tell them the truth and I have to give them this book. So I didn't finish the book. Got pretty deep into it. I didn't finish it. I gave them the book and instantly started feeling better about like just holding a lie. Because I'm not a liar. I don't. I try not to be a liar. Let me say it like that. Try not to be a liar. I try not to be manipulative. Are old habits that, man, they die hard.
[05:29] A: You get it?
[05:30] B: Like I said, it's like the world's lamest relapse. I relapsed on a book. It was awful.
[05:38] A: Yeah.
[05:38] B: So I started feeling better as soon as I, like, the truth came out and I made amends to who I needed to make amends to, including the advocate that I like, took advantage of because I knew she was new. I knew she wasn't going to know. So telling her that, hey, by the way, this is what I did and this is how I did it so that other people can't make the same mistake I made. So now they'll keep people's library cards when they go to the library instead of letting us have our own library card. Like, they'll give us our library card when we go to check out. That way I can't check out a book and then go back and check out the rest of the books. That's what happened.
[06:20] A: All right.
[06:21] B: That's it.
[06:21] A: Yeah.
[06:22] B: And they were like, oh, you're acting crazy. You need to go.
[06:25] A: Well, as you just put it, it was triggering.
[06:29] B: Oh, yeah. Extreme.
[06:30] A: Meaning I was experiencing what I was reading in this woman. Experiencing. And that was troubling. Some of it took me back to, you know, my own trauma. Right, right.
[06:48] B: Yeah. It's an awful book. Do not recommend it. For some reason, it's on the like 2022 bestseller Non fiction list.
[06:57] A: Why?
[06:58] B: What is wrong with people? Why is that on the bestseller, like, of 2022?
[07:04] A: Yeah.
[07:04] B: Like the top five. It's awful.
[07:07] A: Okay.
[07:09] B: This is a terrible book. I think if somebody asked me, is that a good book? I'm like, yeah. Oh, would you recommend it?
[07:16] A: No.
[07:21] B: So now I know that they have their media rules in place and I will not ever do that again.
[07:30] A: Yeah, it's awful. Yeah.
[07:32] B: So, yeah, I think that what the scariest thing was is that even though I knew that I was like getting upset over like little things that easily fixable. Like, I didn't realize I was triggered until somebody else told me I was triggered. And then it was easy to figure it out. But if she wouldn't have said those words to me, I would. I would probably still be like.
[07:59] A: Yeah.
[08:00] B: And then some.
[08:01] A: So we don't want that to happen.
[08:04] B: Yeah, yeah. No, I don't want that to happen. And now I know why they have their rules in place for the media.
[08:14] A: Makes more sense. Yeah.
[08:15] B: Usually I'm like, I can read this book. I'm a grown ass woman. It turns out I'm not. I'm learning to be, but I'm not yet.
[08:25] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[08:27] B: So that's it.
[08:28] A: Okay. Okay. So given that that happened and now it's somewhat better because like you came clean. Right. And you recognize. Okay. There were some triggers. What do you want our time to do?
[08:49] B: I don't know. I think I already figured it out. So you ain't got to figure me out.
[08:53] A: I don't do figuring out.
[08:54] B: Okay, well that's good, cuz I did it myself.
[08:57] A: Yeah, I don't do figuring out, figure out where.
[09:01] B: I mean, it was just such a graphic book that I really don't need to figure out where the trigger came from because it was just.
[09:09] A: So that's not the issue.
[09:11] B: Right. Okay.
[09:13] A: So you asked a good question earlier. How could this book be on the top five books nonfiction of 2022? For some people who are reading that book, they're not doing what happened to you.
[09:31] B: Oh.
[09:32] A: Do you follow me with that? Like they don't have in their life something structurally similar.
[09:37] B: So they're not experiencing.
[09:39] A: Yeah.
[09:40] B: Experience it. Like it was so graphic that I was actually living this woman's. Like I could see it in my mind and nothing that bad happened to me, obviously. But yeah, yeah, yeah. I was basically living what she was living when I was reading this. And it was this graphic detail.
[09:59] A: Correct, but you had what we'll call reference points, meaning other experiences in your life that have had some amount of structural similarity to what she was going through.
[10:12] B: Definitely.
[10:13] A: That you could call it. That was the trigger. But in life we can't get rid of everything that triggers us. Right, right. So instead what do we want to do? We want to unplug that trigger. Yeah. The button so that even when it's pressed, even when I encountered it doesn't run that thing to me anymore. Right. Because like, if that wasn't going on and you were reading it as a story about somebody else and it wasn't causing all of that, you know, disassociation, association. If that was no longer going on with you, like, how would you actually be.
[11:01] B: Yeah, that's a good question.
[11:02] A: What's it like to be?
[11:04] B: What's it like to be not activated by that stuff?
[11:07] A: Because like, if that was no longer cause any of this, like, what would that be? Like, miss my note to know that you're free.
[11:14] B: Right. Let's find out.
[11:16] A: Yeah, well, like how do you actually want to be? I mean, I came up with the word free because that's the word that comes to mind for me.
[11:24] B: I mean, usually I say at peace. I need. I need peace.
[11:28] A: Yeah.
[11:29] B: I need my peace.
[11:31] A: Yeah. So if you're more free and at peace, what's that? Like, inside, very calm. It is very cold.
[11:40] B: Hard to get me activated to the state that I was over this past week.
[11:44] A: Yeah. Right.
[11:46] B: And that's how I was before this past week. I felt great.
[11:51] A: Right. So we think of you as being free, at peace, calm, and the last word clear so that you're seeing the scenario clear clearly for what it is.
[12:07] B: Okay. That's hard to do.
[12:13] A: I don't know whether it is that hard to do. No.
[12:16] B: Okay.
[12:16] A: No. Because the last time you came in here, you had not the same situation, but a situation where you had, you know, thought like, well, it was better. I only threatened to beat the shit out of her. I didn't actually do it.
[12:32] B: At least I didn't get that far this time. You know, I might have just cussed out my favorite advocate.
[12:40] A: So I should be getting rewarded because I only said I would. I actually didn't.
[12:47] B: Well, that's gone. I don't think like that anymore.
[12:50] A: Right. So the thing that we want to get shifted is we want to get it so that things settle down inside again. That's where we go. Okay. Peace, calm, free, clear. Meaning. Clearly reading that scenario as something that's going on over there.
[13:13] B: Okay.
[13:14] A: So I'm not, like, in. It makes sense. Because a different way to say it is you were being hypnotized by the story you were reading, and I was.
[13:28] B: Like, on defense mode.
[13:30] A: So that you were experiencing it, but not just while you were reading it.
[13:36] B: Right, Right. It stayed with me.
[13:39] A: Yeah. So if I'm watching a movie and I have one of those reactions that's normal to have happen during the movie.
[13:49] B: Right.
[13:51] A: But if it stays with me after I'm no longer watching the movie. Not so good.
[13:58] B: Not so good. It sure does.
[14:00] A: So that's where we think of you being as at peace and calm and clear and free. Right. And so as we think of you being this way, go ahead and slightly lower your jaw.
[14:17] B: Lower the jaw.
[14:18] A: Right. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth and begin to breathe a little bit slower. Right. Exhaling a little bit longer than how you inhale. Because when you breathe in a slightly slower and deeper way, it begins to alter your state of consciousness because you're consciously causing your breathing, which means you're breathing in a different way than how you unconsciously breathe. That's. That's right. And as your unconscious is responding, check inside your body. How's your body beginning to feel now?
[15:05] B: Already feel back to normal?
[15:07] A: Yeah, already feeling back to normal. Right. Then we add to it. So notice that you can see Me out in front of you, but that when you close your eyes, you no longer see me, but what you actually see is just the backs of your eyelids. When I look at the backs of my eyelids, there's different hues of color. Sometimes dark, sometimes bright. And then once again, go ahead and open your eyes and notice that what you actually see in front of you is me and all the stuff you can see out in front. One more time, close your eyes, realizing that what you actually see in front of you is just the backs of your eyelids. So as you're breathing a little slower and deeper, noticing that what you see in front of you is the backs of your eyelids, without using your memory or your imagination, what do you actually see behind you? And it might surprise you to realize that what you actually see behind you is nothing. You see nothing behind you. What's it like to drift into no thing? Nothing. Because in nothing, everything exists as a potentiality. In no thingness. That's right. As your unconscious now responding to you already reorganizing, knowing what you've gone through over the past week or more from what you had been reading, also knows which moments would be useful to clear whether you think they have anything to do with what you are reading or not. Your unconscious surely knows so much more than you. That's right. Surely your unconscious knows more than you. That's right. And knows which moments would be useful to bring to your awareness for us to unplug and clear. Right. And so as you begin very slowly to find your way back up and out of nothing and into now, your unconscious. That's right. Will travel back down the timeline in your own personal history of negative experiences. That's right. And we'll bring to your awareness in the moment that would be useful, most useful for us to clear. Now, when you're ready, take a nice slow and deep breath in. And then a long exhale and open your eyes. Good job.
[19:23] B: My neck crept.
[19:24] A: It sure did, didn't it? Yeah. In the short moments eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself?
[19:34] B: Very calm.
[19:35] A: Yeah, very calm. And as that other part of your brain, the unconscious travels back down the timeline to negative experiences, it's going to pinpoint a particular moment to clear. Yeah. What comes to mind?
[19:51] B: Fighting with my ex husband.
[19:54] A: Yeah. That happened about how long ago?
[19:57] B: Ten years ago.
[19:58] A: Yeah. And what's the moment that comes to mind? Because there are probably more than one flight.
[20:03] B: Oh, man. Probably our last fight before I left.
[20:08] A: Yeah, that one happened. You're aware.
[20:12] B: In Virginia.
[20:13] A: You're in Virginia, Right Are you at a house or apartment?
[20:15] B: House.
[20:16] A: You're at a house, Right. Indoors or outdoors?
[20:18] B: Indoors.
[20:19] A: Like downstairs or upstairs?
[20:20] B: In the kitchen.
[20:21] A: In the kitchen? Right. So you're in the kitchen. The kids are there. Right. So they're hearing and seeing. Right. And what's happening? So there's some yelling.
[20:30] B: Yelling. Lots of yelling. Cussing, pushing, blaming.
[20:34] A: Right. So he pushed you, you pushed him?
[20:36] B: He pushed me. I fell down.
[20:38] A: Right. You fell down.
[20:39] B: Kids are mommy, Mommy, Right.
[20:41] A: Good job. Right. Then what happened next?
[20:43] B: I swung on him, tried to hit him. He hit me. I fell back down.
[20:47] A: You knocked you back down? Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[20:49] B: Kids are mommy, Mommy.
[20:50] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[20:52] B: Over and over, man. I don't know.
[20:54] A: Well, what might have happened? Probably cops came because notice how the story stops at a shitty spot. I know, right?
[21:02] B: That's the worst part for it to stop it.
[21:04] A: Right. So something might have happened.
[21:06] B: Something happened. Eventually I ended up packing the kids up and coming down here.
[21:11] A: So then, like, the cops might have come.
[21:13] B: Cops might have came.
[21:15] A: Right.
[21:16] B: Cf might have got involved.
[21:18] A: Right. Then what might happen next?
[21:21] B: I just left. Never seen him again.
[21:24] A: You got in the car when you drove south. Right. Good. And then that moment ended. And then later on, you did something more fun. Like.
[21:36] B: That's the hard part for me.
[21:38] A: I don't know whether it is.
[21:39] B: I don't know why it is.
[21:40] A: I don't think it is. Because what was more fun than that moment was seeing me at the library. Yeah, right. See, seeing me at the library was way more fun than that moment we.
[21:48] B: Went to see Transformers.
[21:49] A: Right? Seeing Transformers. More fun than that.
[21:51] B: That was really cool. Going to Bush Gardens with my daughter.
[21:53] A: Right? Yes. We got Bush Gardens, we got Transformers. We got, you know, see me at the library. Yes. Right. And then you were down here, and then you had packed up and left. And then DCF might have come, and then police might have come. And then kids were saying, mommy, Mommy, Mommy. Then you'd been on the ground, and then he'd hit you, and then you tried to hit him, and then you'd gotten up, and then he had shoved you, and you were on the ground, and then he had shoved you. And then you were yelling and cussing and blaming, and then you guys started fighting. And then before that, you either got home or he got home. Then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing. And as we go backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[22:32] B: Much easier.
[22:33] A: Isn't that weird how that works? Right? You can remember all that happening. You can remember Putting on your pink watch.
[22:39] B: Pink watch?
[22:40] A: Yeah. Stop putting on your pink watch.
[22:41] B: I'm not putting on my pink watch.
[22:43] A: Well, then stop him from punching you.
[22:44] B: He's not punching.
[22:45] A: Well, then you stop putting on your shirt.
[22:47] B: I'm not putting on.
[22:48] A: Stop me from putting on my shirt.
[22:49] B: You're not putting on your shirt.
[22:50] A: Well, then stop that from happening. It's not happening. It's totally did.
[22:54] B: It totally, totally did. Yeah. Got me. I almost got me.
[22:58] A: You did, but we know it totally did happen.
[23:00] B: It happened.
[23:01] A: Right. Well, then stop it. Right. So then where is it? Say it no longer.
[23:06] B: It no longer exists.
[23:08] A: That's right. And as this gets in, what do you notice?
[23:16] B: Still was a difficult situation. But it doesn't. It doesn't sit right here.
[23:23] A: It's not sitting there, is it? Yeah. Right, Right. But it was a difficult situation. Yeah. That you made it through.
[23:30] B: Yeah.
[23:31] A: Right. Which is the thing that we're gonna be starting to learn about you.
[23:36] B: It's nice to know, Right.
[23:38] A: How you're someone that can make it through difficult situations. Mm. Right. That's really good to know. Right? Right. Yeah. There's a good breath. Right? Right. Yeah. Right. What else are you noticing for you?
[24:06] B: My parents. Hiding, probably.
[24:08] A: Oh, that takes you to earlier.
[24:10] B: Yeah. My biological dad and my mom.
[24:14] A: You might have been how old, kid?
[24:17] B: Like eight. Nine.
[24:18] A: Eight, nine. Right. And you might have been where?
[24:21] B: In my room.
[24:22] A: Right. And I can just hear daytime or nighttime all the time. Well, not all the time.
[24:29] B: We'll say nighttime.
[24:30] A: All right. Because we only want to think of one time.
[24:33] B: Okay, well, hold on then.
[24:37] A: Right. We want to think of one time that it did, because that's what our brain does best to deal with one at a time.
[24:43] B: Okay.
[24:43] A: Right. Versus the whole flood.
[24:46] B: So I was in my room.
[24:47] A: Yeah. Right.
[24:48] B: It was nighttime.
[24:49] A: Right.
[24:50] B: He was drinking.
[24:51] A: You were, like, on your bed.
[24:52] B: Yeah.
[24:53] A: Or in your bed.
[24:54] B: In my room.
[24:55] A: Right. Just in your room, doing whatever, being a kid. Right. You had known that dad had been drinking earlier, Right?
[25:02] B: He was mean when he got drunk Sometimes. Yeah. Sometimes.
[25:06] A: Right. So he might have been mean to you.
[25:09] B: Yeah.
[25:11] A: Then you might have gone to your room. Right. Then what might have happened?
[25:14] B: I could just hear them arguing.
[25:16] A: So he's yelling at mom. Mom's yelling back at him. Right. Then what might have happened?
[25:20] B: He might have pushed her or hit her.
[25:22] A: Right.
[25:23] B: Now she's crying.
[25:24] A: Right. Good. Then what might happen next?
[25:26] B: I don't remember.
[25:28] A: Isn't it shitty that the story stops the bad point again?
[25:31] B: I know.
[25:32] A: So we got Mara crying. Right. Then what might have Happened next, he might have left, he might have laughed. Right?
[25:39] B: Yeah.
[25:40] A: Eventually, mom stopped crying.
[25:42] B: She stopped crying.
[25:43] A: That incident was over. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun like go to Busch Gardens or transversers.
[25:51] B: That's where you at the library.
[25:52] A: That's right. That's right.
[25:54] B: It's way more fun.
[25:56] A: We got the library, we got Transformers, we got Bush Gardens. Right. And then mom had stopped crying and he may have left and then she was crying and then he might have shoved her, hit her, and then they were yelling back and forth and then he was mean and then he had been drinking and then you had gone to your room and before that he was drinking and before that you were doing whatever you're doing. Right. And again, as he goes backwards compared to forward, what do you notice?
[26:23] B: So much easier.
[26:24] A: It is. Right? You can remember him doing that. You can remember putting your glasses on.
[26:27] B: I smile at you while you can.
[26:29] A: Can't me. Yeah, right.
[26:31] B: Well, I'm thinking about it.
[26:32] A: Yeah, right. Notice how fast this goes. It goes this fast and you are, you know, one of those people that you know. Cuz lots do go. I don't know how you're ever going to do that.
[26:49] B: You make it so easy.
[26:50] A: And then it was like, oh, well, that's how you do it, I guess. Okay.
[26:53] B: Impressive. Impressive. I got to tell you, it's good.
[27:00] A: I had a young girl in my office the other day and I had her for a couple hours. I'd never met her before. You know, she had fears of like coming and seeing a guy. Like shit had happened with a guy. Like, we get to the end, we clear stuff up. And she goes, well, that was really fast.
[27:15] B: That was really easy. It's way easier than I thought it was gonna be.
[27:19] A: Right. It's actually good to come. The thing that I wasn't looking forward to, I can actually look forward to because I leave and I feel better.
[27:27] B: So I said, oh, we're going to see Dr. Kee already.
[27:29] A: Yeah. Right, right. Because you can remember all that happening with dad.
[27:33] B: Yeah.
[27:33] A: You can remember putting your pink watch on. Well, stop putting on your pink watch.
[27:37] B: I'm not putting on my pink.
[27:38] A: Well, then stop him from doing that.
[27:39] B: He's not doing that.
[27:40] A: Well, then you stop putting on your socks.
[27:41] B: I'm not putting on my socks.
[27:42] A: I'm gonna put on my sneaks. Well, stop that from happening though. It's not happening.
[27:46] B: It's not happening.
[27:47] A: Right. Where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[27:49] B: It no longer exists.
[27:50] A: Right. Which is. Right. That's what we want to get in. It's over. You move through it. You're okay. Mom's okay.
[27:59] B: She's okay.
[27:59] A: She is, isn't she? Yeah. Mom might not be 100%. Well, probably not. Right.
[28:06] B: Who is?
[28:07] A: Who is? Right. But Mom's probably got her own, you.
[28:11] B: Know, she's got her own stuff.
[28:13] A: Right.
[28:13] B: She doesn't have a doctor. Q.
[28:15] A: Don't. Not yet.
[28:17] B: Not yet.
[28:17] A: Right, Right.
[28:20] B: Very true.
[28:21] A: Right. But see, things are changing for you, which, as it happens, it changes in both directions.
[28:29] B: Very true.
[28:30] A: Yeah. Because then you start being different towards them in both directions, which shifts things for them.
[28:41] B: It sure does.
[28:42] A: Yeah. Right. Right. And again, all of that happening had everything to do with what was off back then with dad. Right. And that you didn't need dad to be any other way in order for you to move through that and be okay. Now you are, aren't you? Right. Making, like, you know, much better decisions. Even if there was a step backwards. Right. Making much better decisions.
[29:19] B: Even with the step backward, I still made decisions I wouldn't have normally.
[29:24] A: Right.
[29:25] B: Like telling on myself.
[29:27] A: That's right.
[29:27] B: I had to do that to move forward.
[29:30] A: Well, you thought it would be best. You didn't have to.
[29:34] B: I didn't have to.
[29:35] A: No. You chose to. Right. Because you're worth it. Right. Right. And that. Cool. And what's important to me is I want to be seen and experienced as somebody who's, you know, truthful, who's not hiding out.
[29:56] B: And I need peace.
[29:59] A: I don't know whether you need it. I think it's, again, a useful thing.
[30:02] B: A useful thing.
[30:03] A: You've lived a long time without saying it's true whether you actually need it.
[30:08] B: Very true.
[30:09] A: Right.
[30:10] B: It'd be nice to have.
[30:11] A: Yes. You feel much more at peace when what I'm going to call you're in integrity. See, integrity wasn't something that mattered a lot when I was out on this tree, when I was doing whatever I needed to do to survive. So if I told that person that we're. And I took, like, I'm completely. Cause what I was doing even in the first place, was completely out of integrity for who I want to be in the world.
[30:41] B: Yes.
[30:41] A: So if I'm already out of integrity, might as well continue.
[30:46] B: Might as well keep going.
[30:48] A: Right. I mean, that's kind of how that snowballs, so to speak.
[30:51] B: Yes, it does.
[30:52] A: But as you're getting more into being in integrity, that's all about being whole. Like, it's all connected. That that's what was out for you.
[31:03] B: Yeah.
[31:04] A: Right.
[31:05] B: Completely threw me off yeah.
[31:10] A: Yeah. You were only reading it cause you heard it was, like a good book.
[31:14] B: It was supposed to be a good book. I don't know what's wrong with these people in this world. It's a good book now.
[31:20] A: Yeah. Well, it might be a good book.
[31:21] B: Whatever happened to Dr. Seuss.
[31:23] A: It might. Well, a little older for Dr. Seuss, but it might be a good book for somebody that hasn't experienced what you experienced. That therefore doesn't trigger them into reliving or vicariously. Or vicariously living the experiences that the person in the book is living.
[31:46] B: Yeah, that's what it was. That's what it is.
[31:50] A: Right. But it wasn't just that. That wouldn't have been able to happen if you already didn't have tracks laid down that had structurally similar things. It may have not, as you said, been to the extent of what happened with her. It's the same thing that any guy who's watching a show and sees somebody kick another guy in the nuts, they immediately go, oh.
[32:24] B: Point. Point made, point. Very well made.
[32:30] A: Right. And that would happen as they saw it. But if that continued to cause them to be in pain for the rest of the day.
[32:38] B: Well, okay, I'm gonna make a comparison here. I can't watch bones being broken because I broke both my arms when I was a kid. So anytime, like, they put on these. I don't know why people watch that either. But these people being hurt and they're like bones breaking, I can't watch it. Can't triggered. So I do not to watch that because it reminds me of my bones being broken.
[33:05] A: I wonder what that younger you would need to know.
[33:10] B: Get my bones healed.
[33:11] A: Yeah. Ooh, they did, didn't they? Yes. Right, Right. Because in the moment that it happened that you wasn't sure she was ever gonna be okay, and she was in lots of pain.
[33:31] B: Mm.
[33:32] A: Right. How did it happen?
[33:34] B: Fell off a tree.
[33:35] A: Oh, cool. And not just one. Go for both. Mm.
[33:39] B: Flat on my face. Yeah.
[33:41] A: Right. And that hurt.
[33:42] B: Sure did.
[33:43] A: Yeah. Right. And you can remember being in that pain and it hurting and then. Was somebody there?
[33:55] B: My brother.
[33:56] A: Your brother? Did he pick you up?
[33:58] B: He ran away.
[33:59] A: He ran away. Right.
[34:00] B: But then he came back and picked me up. He was scared. He was little. He was only like eight or something.
[34:08] A: So then he helped you, picked you up. Right. And then you guys kind of ran into the house. Right.
[34:15] B: With my hands on it.
[34:16] A: Right. And then what happened?
[34:18] B: Woke up mom.
[34:19] A: Yes.
[34:20] B: Went to the hospital.
[34:21] A: Went to the hospital. Right.
[34:23] B: They put casts on.
[34:24] A: They sure did.
[34:25] B: And then it healed.
[34:27] A: And then it healed. Right? Right. So you can remember that it happened. Right. Close your eyes and think back to the younger you just after it happened, who was really scared because you couldn't move her. Right. Let her know how it turned. Right. Let her know how much she can move them now. Let her know how they healed. Let her know how she took the steps that there were for her to take. Getting mom up, getting to the hospital, getting them put in casts. Because your body has an amazing ability to heal wounds. Physical wounds and emotional wounds. The reason that the cast happens is so we don't screw up our body's ability to heal. That's right.
[35:26] B: Yep.
[35:28] A: That's right.
[35:29] B: If only it were so easy.
[35:32] A: Yeah. Well, what if it is? Because emotional wounds heal immediately. When your brain gets that it's data about something that happened versus happening, it immediately changes it. And it doesn't have the same tone, it doesn't have the same feelings as that younger you when she broke her arms, realizes that she's gonna be okay to heal. Right. What do you notice happening to the younger you?
[36:16] B: I'm good.
[36:18] A: She is good.
[36:18] B: She's still playing.
[36:20] A: That's right. And you can open your eyes. Right.
[36:28] B: Right.
[36:32] A: What are you noticing now?
[36:35] B: Well, that made me think about my brother.
[36:38] A: Oh, right.
[36:39] B: So life.
[36:40] A: Well. And as you think about your brother, what do you notice?
[36:44] B: It was just a memory of him.
[36:46] A: Uh huh. A good one or a bad one?
[36:51] B: A good one.
[36:53] A: Okay.
[36:54] B: But. Okay. I turned it into a bad one because I fell out of the tree. He got down first, and then I fell out. And then he went to run away and I said, no, don't leave me. And he came back and he picked me up.
[37:15] A: He did.
[37:17] B: So I related that I relate that to his death now, he went away and I said, no, please come back. But this time he didn't come back.
[37:28] A: He didn't. Sucks.
[37:32] B: Yeah. So just the breaking the arms memory reminded me of that happening.
[37:44] A: So let's just check. Do we think that your brother wants you to feel bad? Mm. Mm.
[37:49] B: Probably not.
[37:50] A: Isn't that weird? Like, he's actually not interested in you feeling bad?
[37:54] B: Mm. Mm.
[37:55] A: He's really interested in you being okay. Did you know that he's actually been doing better with what happened than you have?
[38:07] B: Mm.
[38:07] A: For two reasons. First reason, he's crystal clear that it couldn't have not happened exactly the way it happened, even though nobody likes it that it did. Right. So that's the first thing he's crystal clear about that. Second thing, he hasn't lost any of your love. Your love for him hasn't diminished, has it? You don't love him any less now.
[38:31] B: No.
[38:31] A: Right. You follow me with that?
[38:33] B: Still a little pissed at him.
[38:34] A: Well, there was other shit that happened. But you're not pissed that in a way that you still don't love him. The reason that you're pissed is because you do.
[38:42] B: Right?
[38:43] A: You don't follow me with that. Like if you didn't fucking care at all.
[38:46] B: Like you're such an asshole. I love you so much.
[38:49] A: Right, right. Because there was some other stuff that was going on with him, right. That had you have to get out of the house hand in hand, he went back and all the other stuff that was going on. But he's been doing better than you have for a while, right?
[39:05] B: Oh yeah.
[39:06] A: Because he hasn't lost connection to your love. The flip, you haven't been experiencing his. Not because he's not here, not because his love is any less, but because the shock of knowing him the way you used to. Right. The shock of the lost blocks, access to who he really is for you. Make sense.
[39:36] B: Yeah.
[39:36] A: I tell you about Einstein being really smart? I did.
[39:41] B: I mean, I kind of knew.
[39:42] A: Do you know why he's really smart? For our purposes? Because Einstein said who we are is energy plus matter equals the physical existence. And what becomes the second law of thermodynamics. Energy cannot destroyed, it transforms. Right? Who we are is energy plus matter. The energy is the life force, not the body. The body isn't actually you. You have a body. It's not yours. My mom lost the tip of her index finger, but she's still her.
[40:12] B: He lost his toes.
[40:13] A: That's right. But he was still him, even with the toes missing. Because he was never his body or his thoughts or his feelings or what he did. Who he is is the light. Right? Right. We know that when ice turns to water, it doesn't mean that the ice cubes are gone, they transform. When water moves to gas, it doesn't mean the water's gone, it transforms. And when it comes back from the rain cloud and we capture it as water and we put it in the freezer, it's all the same thing. So what if when people's bodies stop, it's not that they stop and see, here's the big question I have for you. Because notice how you're going to like all sorts of like times with him and feeling sad. I wonder what it would be okay for you to feel okay, See? Would it be okay for you to no longer be hurting over what had happened to him. Would it be okay for you to no longer be experiencing it as loss, meaning that you can have access to who he is with you ongoing? I remember a woman one time, she told me that my parents are in my closet. She goes, no, no, no. What remains? The remains of my parents. I go, but that's not even your parents. They weren't ever in the remains. That's what's left of their body, not them, because they were never their body. Right. We walk around going, I have a soul. Right now. I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord the soul to take. Scary nightmare?
[41:54] B: Not really.
[41:55] A: Yes, it is. When I was a little kid and my mom said that to me, kissed my forehead, walked to the door, turned the light off, said, goodnight, sweetie. Now I'm laying there thinking about my death. Why do we have this one at the end? Two hands breaking through my window, ripping open my dead body, grabbing it from me, my soul. Take your soul, Right? What if we thought of my soul as me? What if we thought of my fingers as my toes? Is something I have. What if I think that the light is me? Right. Who your brother is for you never left. Right. That hasn't gone anywhere. Because here's the deal. In life, can you lose something that you've never acquired? If you never acquired it, how could you lose it? Right. Can you lose something that you've acquired? Because what do we get from the people that matter to us? Is it the trinkets or the stuff? Or is it the experiences?
[42:48] B: Right.
[42:49] A: Once you've acquired an experience, can you lose the experience? No. So if you can't lose it, you've acquired, you can't lose what you don't yet have. Where's the loss when people's bodies stop? It's not the they stop. Is that their bodies stop. We don't pick them up in the same way we did, but it doesn't mean that they're not here. And it's always the shock of having known them the way I used to that blocks access. It's like the little kid walking outside going, hey, there's no sun today. And we go, no, it's still there. Just as hot, heavy and bright as it was earlier. It's just hiding behind the cloud. Right? Right. That's what we want to do. We want to have you have access to more of who he is for you in an ongoing way. So my question would be Would it be okay for you to be okay even if what happened wasn't? Even if he'll never like it that it did, but that you get to have more of an ongoing connection to who he is for you? Right. Because there was some shitty stuff. But he's still your brother. Right? And you love him. And you didn't want that to happen. Right? So how'd he die?
[43:59] B: Overdose.
[44:00] A: Overdose? How'd you find out?
[44:02] B: My mom.
[44:03] A: You were where?
[44:04] B: Charlotte.
[44:05] A: You were in Charlotte. Oh, we like Charlotte with E. Yeah. So you're in Charlotte with Ian. Mom call us? Hey, Charlotte. What'd she say?
[44:20] B: Chad just.
[44:22] A: Yeah, Chad just died, right? You're like, what?
[44:25] B: Justin.
[44:26] A: Justin.
[44:27] B: I just. I just didn't know what to say. I just.
[44:30] A: Mom was telling you was Chad. You're like, I don't have a brother named Chad. It's Justin. Who is this on the phone? This is a weird.
[44:37] B: No, she sent me a message that said it was an emergency to call her.
[44:44] A: Oh, good. So she sent a text, emergency call me. You called her. Right.
[44:48] B: And I already knew what it was.
[44:50] A: Right? Because you kind of had a sense. Right. But then she kind of said it right then. What happened next? You might have cried. Right then. What might have happened next?
[45:01] B: Drove down for the funeral.
[45:02] A: Then you drove down to the funeral, Right? Did you see the body? Did you touch. Did you notice that he didn't feel the same? Do you know why?
[45:11] B: Why?
[45:11] A: Because he wasn't in there anymore. That's why it didn't feel the same. See? But the you back then didn't know that. No. And then like, cremation or burial.
[45:22] B: Burial.
[45:23] A: Burial, Right. The body, not him. I mean, he's not like. Right. You be on it. No, he's not. Right. I wish he would be in the body that's buried.
[45:34] B: That's dig him up, man.
[45:36] A: Well, that would be really weird. Then we'd have like, zombies and. You know, I know we are all okay with the zombie apocalypse, but.
[45:44] B: Jesus died and came back. How come? Can't nobody else? But then, now you come back.
[45:48] A: Where did Jesus go again?
[45:50] B: Went back up. Yeah.
[45:52] A: Isn't that weird? How do we know? It's all those things that I get confused by sometimes.
[45:58] B: Sometimes you just know.
[46:00] A: Or sometimes you just gotta believe. Whether you know or you don't. Sure, right? Sometimes you just gotta believe. Because it's real hard to go. Yeah. With certainty. I know. Oh, were you there, Shirley? Did you see him?
[46:14] B: Sure was. Sure was.
[46:19] A: Right. Like none of us were there. We just gotta believe. Right?
[46:22] B: Right.
[46:27] A: But we want you to be more okay with what happened. Cause you can remember getting the call. You can remember going down there. You can remember touching the body, knowing, wait a minute, it doesn't feel the same. You can also remember putting on your. Your leggings.
[46:40] B: I'm not putting on my leggings.
[46:42] A: Well, then stop putting on your socks.
[46:43] B: I'm not putting on.
[46:44] A: Well, then stop touching the body.
[46:45] B: I'm not touching.
[46:46] A: Well, stop mom from texting you.
[46:47] B: Mom's not texting me.
[46:48] A: Well, then you stop putting on your glasses.
[46:50] B: I'm not.
[46:50] A: Stop me from putting on my shirt.
[46:51] B: You're not putting.
[46:52] A: Well, then stop him from doing that.
[46:53] B: He's not doing that.
[46:54] A: Well, stop it from happening. Oh, it's not happening.
[46:56] B: It's not happening.
[46:57] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[46:59] B: It no longer exists.
[47:00] A: Right. Have I ever showed you this before?
[47:02] B: But he does.
[47:03] A: He does. Have I ever showed you this before? It's a ping pong ball. You ever play ping pong? Yeah, everybody's played ping pong at least once. But this one doesn't bounce because it's got metal pieces. But this one's cool because when you put your fingers on it, it's really cool. Now take that finger. This one.
[47:21] B: Oh, this one.
[47:22] A: Right. Touch there. Notice how it doesn't do anything. Take your other finger, index finger, over here. Touch mine.
[47:29] B: Ah, that's cool.
[47:33] A: Isn't it cool?
[47:34] B: Do it again. Oh, my gosh.
[47:36] A: So do you know how it works? It works just like a light switch. When a light switch is off, there's an opening. The energy can't flow. When the light switch connects, the energy is able to complete the circuit. And it flows when I'm touching.
[47:52] B: Cool, man.
[47:53] A: When you touch now, it completes the circuit. So who we are is energy plus matter equals the physical, touchable existence.
[48:06] B: I need one of those.
[48:07] A: And see, the other thing that I know, Shirley, is that there are things that you and I know are here, but we don't sense or feel in the way we do other things. Things like, for example, we know that there are cell phone waves, radio waves. We can turn on the radio in the van, and all of a sudden, music starts coming out. But it wasn't as if the music just started when I turned the radio on. The waves are there. We don't feel them. We don't feel them right now. Right. There are scents that we can't pick up. Dog can pick up a scent. We can't pick up the same scent that the dog picks up. Right. We blow the Whistle. We don't hear a sound. The dog's like. So what we have to remember, remember is that our senses are limited to what we can perceive. Have you ever looked at a computer? There's a screen on the desktop and there might be a folder that you can click on and that might have, like, a Word document in it, but that's not where the Word document is contained. See, the system that we were built with was engineered to keep us alive. So the desktop that it shows up is only the important things about keeping us alive, not everything. So what if your brother hasn't gone anywhere? We think of heaven as a place far above the stars and sky. But what if it's not? What if it's in a different plane that I don't pick up? Not because it's not right here next to me, but because my senses don't have that kind of range. They're limited in their scope. Right. When your brother's body stopped working. He didn't. His body did. And so he left it. He was no longer in need of it because it stopped. He exited. That's why when I touched him, he didn't feel the same because he wasn't in it anymore. And what I didn't know is that I thought that meant that he was gone. Because I thought he was.
[50:01] B: His body used the ball and touched him with the ball. That it would have went off or wouldn't have. Probably not. Huh?
[50:09] A: It wouldn't have because the energy is not there. Right. The life force. Oh, that he is. That's right. Was not in the body because he wasn't in it anymore. That's why the body stopped. He was never his body in the first place. Right. Just like I talk about a lot of times when people have had abuse stuff. They messed with my stuff, my body. They never got who I really am. They never touched me. They messed with my stuff. And heck, my stuff has been replaced millions of times since then. Yep. There's none of my stuff. It's the same as it was.
[50:52] B: It's not even my stuff anymore.
[50:53] A: It's all been replaced, right?
[50:56] B: Yep.
[50:57] A: Because every cell is replaced over and over and over again. Right. Millions and millions of times. Your feet are longer than they were when you were two. But despite those changes, you're still you. So what we want is, we want to have access to more of who he is. Because the things that you have in common with your brother, what are some of the things that you like to do with him or things that you both enjoy? Bush gardens uh huh. What else.
[51:23] B: Did he have?
[51:23] A: A love for? Reading?
[51:24] B: No, no.
[51:25] A: But he liked turkey.
[51:27] B: Yeah, he liked turkey. We liked both. Both like Thanksgiving mama's banana pudding.
[51:31] A: Yeah, right.
[51:34] B: Watching the same shows, playing Sega, playing games.
[51:39] A: Like Sega Genesis.
[51:40] B: Yes, like a classic. Yeah. And we used to play Mortal Kombat and then watching the Simpsons.
[51:51] A: Exactly. There you go. Right, Right. So I wonder if it would be like to be feeling him with you when you watch the Simpsons.
[52:03] B: They won't let me. Maybe one day I'll get to watch the Simpsons again. Yeah. Or play Mortal Kombat.
[52:14] A: Right. Playing a game.
[52:16] B: Just playing any game. Or just having some turkey.
[52:20] A: Or maybe some banana pudding.
[52:22] B: We could say Monopoly too.
[52:24] A: Did they put vanilla wafers in the banana pudding? With some whipped cream too.
[52:29] B: My mom makes the best banana pudding ever.
[52:34] A: My grandmother used to make the best banana cream pie.
[52:38] B: Oh my gosh.
[52:39] A: She would make the crust from scratch. She would put the bananas. Had to be the right firmness so that they could go in. She layered all in. She'd make her own whipped cream. She'd put the whipped cream on top. Oh my.
[52:53] B: Have no green bananas. You gotta get the ones that are almost brown. They're starting to get the little spots. And whenever I eat banana pudding, he's there.
[53:02] A: Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So how you doing now?
[53:08] B: I still miss him.
[53:10] A: Uh huh.
[53:12] B: Maybe I can start seeing him and things.
[53:14] A: Well, that's easier. Watch. That's the thing to start to open to. Because you couldn't see it. Not because he isn't here, but because this was on. It's really hard for me to see you. What's going to start to happen is there's more of an opening for you to feel him with you. By the way, he's really excited about the things that you're doing for you. Because one of you are getting out, one of you are getting healthy.
[53:44] B: He's one of the reasons why I'm here.
[53:47] A: You follow me with that. And he's really excited about what you're doing.
[53:52] B: Yep, I know that.
[53:54] A: Yeah. Cool.
[53:59] B: What about when you go to the cemetery?
[54:05] A: See, do you know what I've done with my grandmother? My grandmother's an osprey now. She wasn't ever, but after my grandmother died, I saw a couple ospreys. I'm like my grandma now. Every time I see an osprey, I think of my grandma and I see more ospreys. She's with me. She hasn't gone anywhere. My love for my grandma hasn't disappeared. Her love for me hasn't Disappeared. It's as strong as it's always ever been. And I feel it. As this thing gets out of the way, it enables you to feel more of the presence of who he is, which is in the experience. See, what happens with grief is it gets frozen. And then every time I think about them, have to go through the frozen part of the grief to remember any of the good times. Instead, what we want is that moment to be put in context. It's a moment and a long line of lots of moments I had with her. And there's that moment, and then there's all the other moments that I experienced. And being with him through all the years that we've been alive together. Which is there more of all those years. That's right. And all those moments and all those experiences. And see, now you're gonna have access to more of it. More of who he is. Because where he lives is in the experiences that you acquired.
[55:39] B: Get you some water.
[55:40] A: I know. Just like nobody can take away the time that I went to Disney.
[55:47] B: Yeah.
[55:50] A: The experiences stay. And that's where he lives, is in the experiences in being with him. And he can go with you. And all the experiences that you acquire now and the ones that you and him enjoy together. Right? Yeah. So what's happening now?
[56:11] B: I feel a little bit better.
[56:13] A: You do, don't you? And what happens when you lower your jaw and you rest your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower?
[56:22] B: You know how hard it is to rest a jaw?
[56:24] A: It isn't that hard. I don't give really hard assignments.
[56:31] B: True.
[56:32] A: Bit slowly. Deeper. I do. It's not a deep. But you breathe a little bit slower and deeper and things begin to open up to more of what you want. Because what just started to happen is the things that we stated. Being more at peace, calm, free and. And clear. Being able to see it clearly for what it was. Right. Right. See it clearly for what it right with you. Who he is is with you now. Surely. That's right. And as all of this gets in. One more deep breath and then a big exhale.
[57:49] B: My neck cracked again.
[57:50] A: I did. There we go.
[57:52] B: I wasn't ahead of it. Now I know it's working right there.
[57:55] A: Correct. Good job, Shirley. We'll get back together again. You did great today.
[58:00] B: Good job.
