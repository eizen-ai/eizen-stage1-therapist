[00:01] A: So today is the 3rd of July. Yes. And Shonda, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. Malia is also here observing, as you can see, and I want to make sure all of that's okay with you.
[00:22] B: Yeah.
[00:23] A: Cool. All right. So what do you think would be useful for me to know? What do we actually want to get better for you? Did anybody tell you at Selah, any of the other residents or staff, like, why you're coming here? When are you gonna go see that guy?
[00:39] B: No, not really. They kind of. They don't. They. They recommend that we don't talk to each other. What about? Yeah, about, like, what it is that you do and how you do it. I know a lot of girls told me to, like, be open minded, like, when they first met you. Yeah. So. But you just had my best friend in here, Des. That's my bestie. So she told me. She's like, yeah, you don't really have to say a lot. He's like, informative. So I was like, okay, that's cool. I'm like. I don't really know what to tell you. I don't know you. I don't know how much I'm supposed to tell you. Like, and I've never had therapy before outside of Christine.
[01:20] A: Yeah.
[01:20] B: So I don't even know how to do, like, your regular therapy.
[01:24] A: Well, you said that you had some therapy when you were in Tarpon.
[01:27] B: No, it was just like a. Like a. But that was more for, like, addiction. Right. So we did, like, what triggers you, like, like your preventative plan for when you get out. Like, to call, like, 90 meetings and 90 days. For me, it was six months of meetings. It was more of like, that.
[01:46] A: You're an overachiever. Sure.
[01:49] B: Right. That's what it was.
[01:51] A: Actually.
[01:51] B: I'm very happy I overachieved that because that helped me then drop my very serious charge that I had.
[01:57] A: How cool is that?
[01:58] B: Yeah, that was great.
[01:59] A: Good job.
[02:00] B: Yes.
[02:00] A: I was very long clean and sober now.
[02:02] B: Since September.
[02:03] A: Cool. Good job.
[02:05] B: But I don't count it. No, I lied. January.
[02:07] A: Okay.
[02:07] B: I got arrested in September. Yeah. Yeah, in January. But I don't really count this as, like, clean time, because I'm not. I should, because I don't have, like, any law that's keeping me, like, here. Here.
[02:22] A: Right.
[02:22] B: So technically I should call it that. But if I'm not able to make my own choices. I don't. Well, I still can, I guess.
[02:29] A: I don't know. It's weird, right? Because you made your choice to come here.
[02:32] B: Right. But for some reason in the back of my head, I don't see it as, like. I don't cry. I don't see it as free will, even though it is free will. Maybe I shouldn't give myself credit for it.
[02:42] A: Whatever you do, be hard on yourself.
[02:45] B: Yeah. Yeah. That's what I do.
[02:49] A: I'm not gonna take any win. I'm just gonna, like, be hard on.
[02:53] B: Me all the time.
[02:54] A: Oh. So then one of the things that we want to do is get it so that you're lighter and easier on you.
[02:59] B: That'd be helpful.
[03:01] A: So that you're more okay in you.
[03:03] B: That'd be nice.
[03:04] A: Okay. I know how to do that.
[03:05] B: Okay.
[03:06] A: That would be really cool, by the way, if you want tissues that are on both sides of the cabinet.
[03:10] B: Right. Thank you.
[03:12] A: You're welcome. Yeah.
[03:14] B: But, like, I told Christine, so isn't.
[03:16] A: It a really cool thing that you actually chose when you didn't have to?
[03:20] B: Yeah, I think I want to do it more for, like.
[03:24] A: You wouldn't want to start to feel good about that.
[03:27] B: No.
[03:27] A: I guess maybe, Shanna, you might want to start to feel good about that, that you actually chose, even though you didn't have to and even if you chose because, like, you want to do it because you want to be better for your kids.
[03:36] B: Yeah.
[03:37] A: Isn't that a start? Because in order for you to be better for your kids, you have to be better for.
[03:42] B: For me.
[03:43] A: Yeah.
[03:43] B: I keep saying that. So I'm gonna try it. I'm gonna try to listen. Okay, so I'm listening.
[03:50] A: So what were you saying to Christine?
[03:52] B: Oh, with Christine, I was, like, telling her, like, maybe it'll help me be here, because, like, my daughter's 12.
[03:58] A: Yeah.
[03:59] B: And so she's, like, at this awesome age where, like, she knows everything. Right. But, like, she knows everything, and you can't tell her anything. And so when, like, with my trafficker, like, he's still very close to where we live and stuff, and, like, she doesn't see him as a threat. And so when I tell her, like, don't go certain places, don't do certain things, she's like, well, mom, just because you got on drugs and met these crazy people, it doesn't mean that I will. And I'm like, but you're an extension of me, so, like, I don't know how much to tell her, like, without scaring the shit out of her, but, like, I want to scare the shit out of her so she doesn't like, think that the world is like gumdrops and like, lolly, like the way that I was raised into thinking the world was. So I don't want her to be that way. But, like, right now she's with my.
[04:47] A: Mom, who's the gumdrop queen.
[04:50] B: Yes, the gumdrop queen. So she's still very like, you know. Anyway, I'm hoping that. I don't know how much to tell her. So I guess Christine is kind of.
[04:59] A: Like, helping me with what you should tell mom.
[05:02] B: No, tell my daughter. Because, mom, I'm not gonna change her. She's 70. She's. There's no changing her. She's gonna see what, like, I gave up on that. And then like, my dad, he just kind of wants to support me where I am now because, like, he's my dad, you know, Nobody wants to think, like, their daughter was traffic. That's terrible. Right? So he's just kind of like, let me just support you where you are. Like.
[05:22] A: So they go, that really thing didn't quite ever happen, right?
[05:25] B: No, no. Like, he knows that happened, but he doesn't want to, like, revisit that. He's just hoping that Sa will do that for me. So anything he can help me. Like, at Salah, you go to that.
[05:36] A: Place and take care of that thing so we never have to talk about it ever again.
[05:38] B: Right? And that's okay. Cuz I love my daddy. So, like, at least he's like, okay with it. Whereas my mom, at least my mom, she doesn't even think that thing happened. So it's like, at least my dad's like, on board that it happened.
[05:51] A: Okay.
[05:51] B: You know, he's like, we don't want to talk about it. But my mom like, to hur. It didn't even occur to herself. Like, that's even worse.
[05:57] A: Do you know why mom is like that? Do you want to know why Mom? Oh, I actually have an idea.
[06:02] B: Oh, do you? Okay. What? I don't know.
[06:04] A: Mom can't be with it because of what it would mean about mom.
[06:08] B: Oh, that makes sense. Yeah, she's very much like that. Everything. Everything reflects on her when really it doesn't.
[06:13] A: Well, and not just mean about mom, but like, what it would mean that her own daughter would be trafficked. What it would mean about her as a parent that her own daughter got trapped. She can't be with it. Like, Right, right, right. Like, I'll give You an example. I had a woman one time, her son said to her that Uncle Tony molested me. And the response was, don't you dare say that about my brother. How did you say that?
[06:38] B: Right?
[06:38] A: Like, that's the worst response ever. Right? But she said it because she couldn't even be with that as a possibility happening that, like, what it would mean about her as a parent that her own brother would do that to her son. Like, can't even go like. Like literally short circuits the brain in such a way. No, no, didn't happen. Like, no, no, really did. No, didn't happen. That's where mom is with this.
[07:11] B: That makes sense.
[07:12] A: Right? Because of what it does to mom. Not that that's okay, but, like, at least gives a little around all of that. Yeah. Okay, so daughter, right? We don't want her to walk around in gumdrop land, but we also don't want to grow her up into adult world of awful bad things.
[07:36] B: Right?
[07:36] A: And so when she says to you, mom, just because you. You got caught up with bad people and did drugs, doesn't mean I won't. That's exactly right, sweetie. It doesn't. Right, but it also doesn't mean you won't.
[07:51] B: Okay.
[07:53] A: It doesn't also mean you could. The issue isn't that you will.
[07:57] B: Right.
[07:58] A: The issue is that it could. Right? Right. I'm not saying that you will.
[08:03] B: Right?
[08:03] A: It could.
[08:04] B: Right.
[08:05] A: And all I want you to do is, like, have a little bit of your eyes open.
[08:08] B: Right? Right, Right. So you'd see that.
[08:12] A: I'm not saying that it will. No, you're not me. But it could.
[08:16] B: Right.
[08:17] A: And now let's have that for a moment, because then she's got a little more space to see it. Right? Because in her world, she doesn't know. Right. 12 year olds know everything in their world.
[08:31] B: Right.
[08:31] A: But what they don't know is that there's a world outside of what they can see.
[08:34] B: Right?
[08:36] A: Right. Like I can't see Malia right now.
[08:39] B: Right?
[08:39] A: You can. Right?
[08:41] B: I can't.
[08:42] A: It's like she's not there. No, she is.
[08:45] B: Right, Right.
[08:46] A: That's what it is to be 12. They don't know that they have that form of tunneled vision. Got it. You want to have it a little more open. We don't need to be all the way open.
[08:59] B: Right, Right. But I need more than just her at 12.
[09:02] A: Yeah, got it. So we want to have a little more freedom to be able to share with her. We want you to actually start to feel good about the positive Changes you're making. Yeah, that would be useful.
[09:14] B: Yeah.
[09:14] A: Right. Instead of always, like, kicking me. Right. Okay, cool. What else do we want to get better for you? You're doing great so far. You are. I'm really glad you're here.
[09:26] B: I don't have anything else right now.
[09:31] A: I'm not sure that's true.
[09:33] B: Are you thinking of anything?
[09:35] A: Well, okay, so one thing we want is you to have more freedom to talk to your kiddo.
[09:39] B: Yeah.
[09:40] A: In a way that, like, is impactful but not, like, horribly scared.
[09:45] B: Right.
[09:46] A: Two, we want to get it so that you're easier on you, that you actually lighten up on it, because there's a tendency for you to be really down and discount any positive changes you've made. I would also imagine that there's a tendency to kind of kick you. My guess would be that you kind of sometimes think back about things that you did and kind of pissed off that you did them. Like, kind of like, you idiot. How could you have done that dumb thing? Does that ever happen?
[10:12] B: Yeah, I think I just, like. Well, Christy is kind of helping with that. Like, I can't, because we've been doing our. I think it was, like, enneagram. I think it was something like where she has you talk.
[10:22] A: The genogram or the.
[10:23] B: The geniogram. No, not the one that says, like, you're a type one.
[10:27] A: No, no, that. Right, that's it.
[10:29] B: Not that, but the one where you talk about, like, you.
[10:32] A: Your circle around you. Family.
[10:35] B: Yeah.
[10:35] A: Siblings.
[10:36] B: Right.
[10:37] A: Kids. That.
[10:37] B: And so we started doing that, and she just kind of, like, I made me realize, like, I can't be upset about myself for, like, not knowing what I didn't know.
[10:46] A: But you did have a tendency to be upset at yourself.
[10:51] B: Yes, but I'm still. Probably still at.
[10:53] A: Yeah, that's what I was hearing.
[10:55] B: Yeah. But she's helped me realize, like, really. That's just. I couldn't have responded any other way. Like, I didn't know how to. Any other way. So the fact that I responded the way that I did, the way that things played out.
[11:07] A: Yeah.
[11:08] B: I can't be mad at myself for, like. Like, I really wasn't dumb. I can't. I just know that. So I can't.
[11:15] A: Like. Right, but now you do know that.
[11:19] B: Yeah.
[11:20] A: You can't be mad at yourself, but there's still a little bit of it.
[11:23] B: Just because I know it doesn't mean that, like.
[11:25] A: Right. I emotionally, like, yeah, so what?
[11:28] B: I could know something, but that doesn't, like, you know.
[11:32] A: Yeah. Do you know What I specialize in.
[11:34] B: To get me into, like, those two to match.
[11:37] A: Yeah. So that you know it here. Yeah.
[11:40] B: Right.
[11:40] A: You know it here. Right, Frank? That's what we want. That's what I'm saying. We want you to be good with you.
[11:46] B: Yeah.
[11:47] A: We want you to be free from the past, whether they be the things that you did that you're mad at yourself for having done, because now you see it differently than you did back then or the stuff that happened to you. We want the effect that that has had cleared and gone so it's not weighing on you. Right. I call it. We want you to lighten up a little bit so that you're more okay in here. Like, you're more at peace in here. So right now I'm seeing. Hearing there's a lot of conflict.
[12:19] B: Yeah.
[12:19] A: And being okay in here.
[12:21] B: Right.
[12:21] A: And we want that to settle so that you're actually more grounded and okay in here.
[12:26] B: Yeah. Because I think, like, while being at Salem, there's a lot of things that I've learned that, like, I know mentally, but, like, the lengthy emotional, like, connect is not there. So just because I know something, like, logically, that's not gonna help me. Like, how did Christine say it? Like, I think at Salah, I think it's not that, like, Sayla's not really teaching me anything new on how to get things. It's how to keep them.
[12:54] A: Right.
[12:54] B: Like, I know how to get jobs. I know how to, like, live on my own. But it's, like, keeping those things because it's the emotional setback that gets me to go back out and use it. That's what makes me relapse. It's because, like, I'll know something, and, like, I could know it all day, but, like, until it, like, with my emotionally.
[13:14] A: Yeah.
[13:14] B: Until it clicks. Like, I'll relapse. That's what causes me to relapse. Because after a while, like, my emotions will take over, and then it doesn't matter that I know something metal. Like, it's just like. Or I'll be real.
[13:26] A: How that shows up when you had a relapse. Like, like, what did you know logically that you didn't feel emotionally, whether it be around a job or something else, that then had you go to relapse.
[13:36] B: Oh. Like, okay, so I did. I got arrested in September, and then in January, I got my charges. Like, I got my time served. And so I went home. And, like, while I was at home, like, me and my mom got these fights. And I remember sitting at home And I'm like, I know. I don't want to go out there and use. Right. And I know that, like. And I knew that my mom wasn't gonna change. Like, she didn't see situations, but she was, like, harping on me, right? Like, I'm like, I'm not shooting. I think I asked her for a beer one day, and she's like, no, because you're gonna go back to using drugs. I'm like, you should be happy that I'm not shooting a method. My arm. The fact that I'm asking you for $3 for a beer is not a freaking big deal. But I knew that she wasn't gonna change. Like, I saw what my mom was doing. I knew it logically. I, like, took all the little tools that I learned in Axe, right? So, like, I had this little trick, but I ended up, like, because the emotional click wasn't there. Like, I let her emotionally run me down to where I was like, you know what? You're right. Shoot up meth or drink a beer. It's the same thing. So I just went back to using. But then, like, I didn't let. Like, I ended up calling my public defender, and I was like, hey, I'm back doing this. I don't want to be doing this. Like, at least being at that program. Yeah. Like, I knew, like, I didn't have a job.
[14:47] A: I had a really good job.
[14:48] B: Yeah. And I came back, and then I did another three months.
[14:51] A: Good job.
[14:52] B: Yeah. So that's an example of that. Like, I knew something mentally, like, I knew that it was right. But, like, emotionally, like, the click wasn't there. So, like.
[15:01] A: So the cool thing is, we want you to have a lot more freedom from mom.
[15:06] B: Yeah. Like, I know I can't go back home. And that's kind of like, why I chose to come to Sayla. Because I don't want to be back with her. Like, I can't.
[15:12] A: Not the way that you've been. Right.
[15:14] B: Yeah.
[15:14] A: But what if you were free emotionally, that mom being that way, saying that stuff didn't cause all of this in you.
[15:21] B: That'd be great.
[15:22] A: Wouldn't that be cool?
[15:23] B: But the only way I could do that is, like, if I'm not with her.
[15:26] A: I'm not so sure that's true.
[15:28] B: I don't know. Like, at least not with me and her and my daughter in the same house. Like, that can't work because she expects this, like, level of loyalty for me because I'm her daughter, that she doesn't see that. What she wants for me. I need to give my daughter.
[15:42] A: Right.
[15:42] B: Like, she wants that loyalty for me, but I have to give it to her. But when me and her have a fight about something that my daughter did because we live in the same house, she'll be like, chloe did it. D d d d d d and so I'll stick up for my daughter. And she's, like, insulted by this. Like, you're my kid. You're supposed to have my back, but I'm her mom. Like, do you see how that doesn't work?
[16:01] A: You got a triangle. That doesn't serve you with mom and your daughter.
[16:05] B: Right. It doesn't.
[16:06] A: But you also don't have any freedom.
[16:09] B: No, I don't.
[16:09] A: With your mom. No. So one of the things, whether you go back with mom or stay there or not isn't the issue.
[16:19] B: Okay.
[16:20] A: The thing that we want is we want you to be free. That if it makes sense, you could. But they don't have to. We want you to be free so that mom doing that kind of stuff doesn't cause all of this in you.
[16:35] B: Right.
[16:36] A: Does that make sense?
[16:37] B: Yes.
[16:38] A: That's what we want. To get shifted. So again, you're more centered and grounded day. More comfortable in you, more okay in here. That's what we want. Yeah. Cool. I know how to do that.
[16:52] B: Okay, cool.
[16:54] A: I know how to do that. I know how to get that to be way better.
[16:56] B: And I think maybe the other thing, like, I would like it if I could feel like an adult. I don't know why I don't feel like an adult. I just don't. Like, I know I'm 35, but I don't feel 35. Like, I feel like I'm 21 or something like that. Like, maybe it's because I had to come back and live with my mom. And, like, when I'm not around her, I feel fine. But when I'm with her, it's like she, I can't say, has this, like, spell on me, but all of a sudden it's like, I'm 13 years old.
[17:24] A: You regress? Yeah, that's what the word is.
[17:28] B: What is it?
[17:28] A: You regress.
[17:29] B: Yeah.
[17:30] A: So, like, you're a 13 year old.
[17:31] B: Yeah. And I don't want to be that way. And especially in front of my daughter because my daughter shouldn't see me like that.
[17:36] A: Right.
[17:36] B: That's not okay. It's not okay. So I don't know how to be okay. Like, with the three of us together.
[17:42] A: Yeah.
[17:44] B: So I don't wanna, like, I don't have my sister does it? Because my sister doesn't live with my mom. So it's very easy for my sister.
[17:49] A: Just be like, older or younger?
[17:52] B: Older. We're 12 years apart.
[17:54] A: Well, that's a big, big difference.
[17:56] B: Big difference. Yeah.
[17:58] A: But. Yeah.
[17:59] B: So she's like, shahari. My mom can't get along, but she's here because I don't live too together either. So it's, like, very easy for my sister to, like, please her, you know, over the phone or, like, in person for an hour and not have to live with her. Like.
[18:12] A: Right. Does sis live in the area? Okay, so. But they don't live together, so she's got short little windows that she can be with mom. Right. And kind of pretend to be out where she needs to be for mom. Right. And then go back to being normal. Right. Or if you're there all the time, it's like. Right, Right.
[18:31] B: Yeah. What happened to me?
[18:32] A: Basically, like, this is really hard. Let me go somewhere else. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that's the thing. Like, you actually don't have much freedom with mom.
[18:43] B: Right.
[18:44] A: We're not actually seeing mom's stuff as being about mom because it all feels like it's about me.
[18:50] B: Right.
[18:51] A: We want to get that whole thing turned around so that you're staying the adult you, that you're more comfortable in you, that you lighten up on you, that you're more at peace in here, that you're seeing her stuff clearly as being about her, not me. Cool. We can totally get that done. Yeah. Awesome. I would imagine that there have been a bunch of things that have happened in your life that although the experiences have ended, they be mom or other stuff. That although stuff is over underneath the surface, it still affects you. Right. Like, I would imagine, you can correct me if I'm off. That sometimes you think about things that you don't want to be thinking about, and they cause you to feel bad. Sometimes things remind you of different things, and all of a sudden, you're kind of back in that. Yeah, we want that to stop, too, so that the effect fact that the stuff you've gone through no longer has that weight on you. Cool. Do you ever get bad dreams? Do you have anxiousness in certain groups or social situations? Do you find yourself reactive angrily? More than maybe one or. Give me a sense of how that goes, Shonda.
[20:15] B: I don't know. I don't think I have, like, overall bad anxiety. I had bad dreams.
[20:21] A: Okay. Are they about stuff that happened or.
[20:25] B: Yeah, it's like the feeling is the Same.
[20:27] A: Okay.
[20:28] B: Like, how I would feel out there. Like, whether I was, like, being embarrassed or, like, exploited or whatever, the feeling will be the same.
[20:35] A: Okay.
[20:36] B: I don't know why I have those dreams. I don't. I'm trying to pay attention to see, like, what happens that'll make me have, like, when I'll have those dreams that I haven't been able to put anything together.
[20:48] A: That, like, the answer to why you have those dreams. Simple answer. Your complicated supercomputer of a brain has a glitch.
[20:57] B: Okay.
[20:57] A: It's a little bit of a malfunction.
[20:59] B: Okay.
[21:00] A: That's why.
[21:00] B: All right, time for this. Okay.
[21:03] A: We want to tune up that malfunction so that it stops doing that to you. So that at night you're more peacefully and effortlessly resting. So that those unwanted feelings, whether that be the feeling exploited or embarrassed or what have you, that that stuff's gone. We want the effect of those experiences that you had in life that caused those things. We want the effect that that's had cleared and gone so it's no longer running in you. That's a good process. I like that one. Yeah. Do you know why I like that one?
[21:36] B: I don't know.
[21:37] A: You don't know? Do you want to know?
[21:38] B: It was deep.
[21:40] A: It was deep. But there's another part of why it was deep. Because you consciously didn't decide to take the deep breath. But right after we said what we said about getting that stuff cleared, your body took a nice deep breath and a longer exhale. Because what we're talking about working with isn't just up here. We want to work with the part that controls the automatic. And so your unconscious is listening at the same time to what I'm saying. And it was responding. That's why I liked it.
[22:20] B: Okay.
[22:23] A: Got it. Because that part of your body, mind wants to work in the way that you want it to as well. Right? It doesn't always. Not because it's not interested, but because complicated machines are prone to error. Got it. Okay. What else would be useful for me to know? What else do we want to get better? What I've gotten so far is that we want you to have more free, direct conversations with your daughter. We want you to be free as it pertains to mom so that you can stay in your adult self. And mom doing all that witchcrafty, whatever stuff that she does that causes that. That no longer causes the effect that it's had. We want to get it so that you're no longer having those bad dreams that have that Same kind of feeling tone around exploited or embarrassed or. Or we want to get the effect that the experiences that you've gone through, whether it be the stuff that you did or the stuff that happened to you, we want the effect of that cleared and gone so it's not weighing on you anymore. And we want you to be much more comfortable in you, much more. Okay. In you.
[23:42] B: So.
[23:43] A: So that you are free to celebrate the wins and actually feel good about them. Sounds good versus kind of minimizing. Well, you know, I could kind of call this maybe that I've been clean, but it really doesn't count because I've been programmed. But I kind of chose a program.
[23:57] B: But I don't feel like I'm in a free point.
[23:58] A: Right. Like, you follow me with that. Like, we really want you to actually be like, hey, you know what? I'm choosing me. Like, what had me choose this program is I recognize that in order for me to have a life different and distinctly different than the one I've had, I need to be doing something that's about me growing and becoming more of who I really am. And that's something to feel really good about.
[24:26] B: I think, like, I talked to. I was just. I was talking to Christine. Like, I didn't realize that she kind.
[24:34] A: Of made me see that.
[24:35] B: Like, I do think I do that. But, like, even when I was little, I wasn't allowed to, like, have my own feelings. So my mom would very much always tell me, like, how I should feel and why I should feel that way. So I always needed, like, other people to tell me how I felt about something.
[24:58] A: Yeah.
[24:58] B: Which is kind of, I think, also why I, like, why a lot of times, like, I didn't trust, like, my gut check, like, why I would feel a certain way around people or, like, why they would make me feel, like, whether it be good or bad or indifferent.
[25:11] A: Yeah.
[25:11] B: Like, I always had to go to somebody and be like, hey, do you feel that same way? Like, always needed that validation from somebody else just to be like, did you feel that too? Or did you get. And I mean, of course, like, my trafficker totally, like, capitalized on.
[25:23] A: Oh, sure. Yeah. Right, Right, of course.
[25:25] B: But, like, now I'm getting better at, like, trusting my own gut.
[25:32] A: Cool.
[25:33] B: My own gut checks, like, why I feel the way I feel around certain people. And, like, with Christine, it's like, I. That's been validated. Like, I felt a certain way about somebody, and then, like, weeks later, something happened, and I was like, oh, that's why I felt that way Like, I'm getting better at knowing, like.
[25:52] A: Oh, you mean we want to get it so that you trust you.
[25:55] B: Yeah.
[25:56] A: That you've got what you need inside. Yeah.
[25:59] B: That I don't have to go to somebody else.
[26:00] A: That you get to trust you. Oh, cool. I'm totally on board with that.
[26:05] B: Yeah. Cause it really sucks when I, like, question, second guess myself.
[26:08] A: Like. Yeah.
[26:09] B: And so then I felt stupid for laying out, and I get such a terrible situation. But then, like, I work with Christina and I realized, like, based upon what I do, I couldn't react in any other way. So I can't be mad at myself or, like, not seeing the things that got me to where, like, I was at. So I can't be mad at myself.
[26:30] A: Right. You didn't realize that you had somewhat been groomed based on growing up experiences, how mom was people telling you how you're supposed to feel, even if you didn't feel that way, and that that kind of groomed you to be by the trafficker, which also use the same thing. No, that's not you. That's. This is how you're supposed to. Right, Right. Which is the term that we like to use now called gaslighting.
[26:59] B: Yes. Yep. Yep.
[27:04] A: Right?
[27:05] B: And it, like. And I had a thing.
[27:06] A: It was.
[27:07] B: It was a girl at thela, and she was just doing this stuff to, like, annoy me, right? Like, she was. One night, I think we just switched rooms, and I don't know why we didn't like each other, but, like, she literally belched for like, two and a half hours, dude. And I was like, she's doing this on purpose. Like, and of course, if I bring it to her attention or, like, tell an advocate, it's gonna be like, how am I gonna prove that that's she's doing on purpose? Right? Like, it's a. It's a bodily function. How am I gonna prove that? Like, this chick is doing this? So I was like, what do I have to go on? I was like, my gut check, right? That's all I have to know that that's why she's doing this. Anyway, it was like this long ordeal, but, like, I confronted her and, like, we worked it out. And, like, she hasn't done it since, because I was like, that's my boundary. Like, I'm not gonna be sitting here with, like, the old me would have been like. Because of course, once I confronted her, she did say, like, I don't know what you're talking about.
[27:56] A: Right?
[27:56] B: But then when we were gonna work it out, she's like, well, I'll keep a diary. Like a. Like a food journal. Da, da, da. Dunno. The more you say that, the more you're pissing on me, telling me it's fucking raining, dude. Like, stop. Like, whatever you're doing, stop. Like, if we didn't like each other. Yes. Like, I totally stuck up for myself. Like, and she stops. Like, we haven't had that problem since. Like, I wasn't gonna do it. Like, were the old me, I would have, like, believed her. I would have been like, okay. For the advocates, like, okay, maybe.
[28:29] A: Maybe it was that kind of yellowy rain.
[28:31] B: Right?
[28:32] A: Exactly.
[28:33] B: But I would have been like, okay.
[28:34] A: It is rain though.
[28:35] B: Right, Right. Right. Because I'm looking at her and she's telling me, so, like, the advocates can't tell me different. So, like, yeah, okay. And I was like, no. Like, I. Like, I used to get paid to be stupid. Like, no, more like, I'm not, dude.
[28:49] A: Right.
[28:50] B: And so, like, I was happy that I was able. Like, Christy got me that far. But, like, you know, like, with other stuff, I would like to be able to just know that, like. Like, I'm able to.
[29:01] A: So what I'm gonna language it as. Cause it's a gut check. But we want your head, your heart, and your gut to be in alignment. So it's all incoherent. So you got your head brain activated, you got your heart brain activated, you got your gut brain activated. And they're all running harmoniously in alignment and coherence with each other. Yeah.
[29:30] B: And I'm wondering if that would be, like, hard to learn, because I never had that.
[29:34] A: No, it changes inside.
[29:36] B: Okay. Because it's never been that way.
[29:38] A: Right.
[29:38] B: I've never had all three, like, in line at one point.
[29:41] A: Yeah. So the change is not hard because it's an inside out.
[29:45] B: Okay.
[29:46] A: So kind of like, it doesn't actually require a lot of work on your part. Like, think of, like, a cut that I have on my arm. Over time, my body heals it. Did I have to work on it? And I think, okay, he'll heal, heal, heal. Or did it just do it on its own? Right. And when you learned how to ride a bicycle or tie a pair of sneakers, which you're not allowed to because.
[30:10] B: You don't have laces. Hey, I took those up voluntarily. But okay.
[30:15] A: Yeah, Right. When you learn how to do that, once you got it, you got it.
[30:21] B: Right.
[30:21] A: You didn't have to relearn. It was just different. Right. Those are learnings from the inside out. We want the Learning to happen from the inside out make sense. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna change the way that your emotional brain automatically and pre consciously reacts and responds to the same stuff in life, past, current, future, so that your brain emotionally works naturally, more in the way that you want it to. That's the change that we're going to do. We're going to get it so that you're much more comfortable in your own skin and that your trust is in you, not somebody else. And that you're solid and good with it. Got it? We want to get it so that you're a lot lighter, so that you're more okay. And the effect that the past has had, whether it be the stuff that now you wish you hadn't done because you know different and how come I could. You want all that cleared so you're at peace with all of that again, not that any of it was okay, but that you're at peace with it now. Got it. We want to get it so that you're seeing stuff with mom clearly for what it actually is. And we want to get it so that you have distance emotionally from it. Even if you're in a close physical proximity to her, we still want you to have emotional distance so that you see it clearly for what it is. And we want you to have the flexibility and fluidity to dance and move through it. Right. Because she's your mom, she's got your kid, we're gonna have interactions with her throughout life. Right. So we want that to have more ease in moving through all of that. Makes sense.
[32:16] B: Yeah.
[32:18] A: And then we want to get it so that at night you're peacefully and effortlessly resting. We want the effect that that stuff has had where it's been, the exploited or the embarrassed or. We want those moments cleared and gone. Because the real reason that we stay bothered by shit that's happened to us isn't because what we went through was awful bad, wrong. I shouldn't have done it. They shouldn't have done it. It's because when it happened, emotionally, the brain short circuited. So what that means, Shonda, is that at that deeper level, that part of my brain doesn't know it ever ended. I do. That part doesn't. It got frozen. I moved forward. That part stayed stuck on. Right. That's why the emotional wound doesn't heal. I break my foot when I'm 10, and if I told you about it and I'm upset right now, you're looking at me like, what's wrong with this guy, he walked in here, it's fine, Right? But if I told you about my Uncle Joey and what he did to me at 10 and I'm emotional, you're like, well, yeah, of course. Why? Why does that emotional wound not heal? Why does the physical wound heal? And it's because the brain doesn't know it's over. So instead of having to process it and get the bad feelings out of me, we want to do the reverse. We want to get the good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know what any. We want to unplug the memory so the brain can read what happened as data about something that happened versus happening. Once it's data, we're fully clear that we're through it. We gain the wisdom and strength from having made it through something that was difficult. Got it. That's where we're headed. Make sense so that you get to be much more at peace, much more comfortable in your own skin. The whole thing gets to lighten up so it won't matter so much whether mom gets it or not, whether mom can see it or not. Make sense because we get it that that's a problem that mom can't even recognize. We get it. Dad just doesn't want to talk about it, but at least recognizes. I feel a little bit better about that.
[34:45] B: Yeah, I can live with that.
[34:48] A: Right. But we want to get it so that you're free from the effect that the stuff has had on you. So it's not running you anymore. Right. That's what I mean by there's no freedom with Mom. It's like literally running you. You got no space, no freedom, no room to be with it. Right. It's just the beat down thing that constantly happens, so to speak. And what you're doing is you go, wait a minute, I have an opportunity to change my life for the better. I recognize that if I go back to the same thing and do the same stuff, it's going to repeat the same pattern. I don't want that to happen. So you entered a program not even fully knowing what the whole program was going to to be. You couldn't have possibly known ahead of time. But what had you pick it is that you're worth it to you. Whether you fully feel that yet or not, you pick something to have life be different for you because you're worth it. May have been, hey, you know, I want to be worth it for my kid, for me, because I totally love her and she's worth it to me. But you did you picked it to change, and that's huge. Right. And I'm not saying it'd be really good for you to start feeling, you know, pretty good about that. You don't have to feel good about all the other choices. This one, really good. Because that's the coolest part, what you said. I got hooked into the same shit, started doing it, called my public defender person said, wait a minute, I just got looped in the same thing, that I don't want to be this. Okay, go back. Cool. Went back.
[36:37] B: Yep.
[36:38] A: Started to change. Okay. What else is there for me to support me in becoming a better version of me. Right. For my daughter, for me. And you chose it. You may not feel like you have freedom because they have to get you up at a certain time. You have to do certain structured things within the program. Right. Feel free. But the freedom is that you chose to come here and you didn't have to. That's really cool. Yeah. And I'm super excited for you. Right. Because all sorts of things are going to start changing. Right. What people tell me when we're done, because we're going to get together again won't be until August because I'm going to be out of town for two weeks in July. But we're going to get together again. We're going to have like a few hours together. And in those few hours, we're going to change the whole way that this thing has been constructed in you. So it's not causing all of that for you. What people tell me over and over again is the stuff that used to really bother them. It's not bothering them at all. The intensity of distress, the frequency of distress, the duration of distress, way less. So they're able to move through things with much more easier. Make sense. We're gonna do stuff that settles the nervous system, that quiets and calms the body so that you get much more grounded, settled, clear. We'll do processes that'll align your brain so they're in coherence so it'll be easier for you to do the things that you know are best because they'll be what I know and they'll be what I'm trusting.
[38:51] B: Right.
[38:53] A: Got it.
[38:53] B: That would be cool.
[38:55] A: Exactly. And that's what we want aligned. Make sense. Those are the changes that we're going to be doing. And like I said, you'll notice it right away. Things being better and different. Makes sense.
[39:12] B: Makes sense.
[39:12] A: Do you have any questions for me?
[39:15] B: Not right now.
[39:16] A: Okay. Is there anything that I can clarify for you?
[39:21] B: No. I think I got it.
[39:23] A: Okay. I'm gonna give you one other little piece of information that I think will be interesting in terms of how we're gonna go about changing things. Right? So we tend to look at life that the circumstance or the thing, that situation, what I did, what they did, is what makes me feel the way I feel. So when mom acts like that and says that stuff, it does this to me. When that person said those things, I felt like this. When I did this thing, I felt that way. That's the way we look at life. That lens is not wrong, okay? But it gives us this much power, okay? Because in that lens, we have two choices. I work hard to try to Change it. I'm 70. Not fucking changing it.
[40:08] B: Right.
[40:09] A: Change it. I try to get as far away from it as I can. Sister only shows up. Right, Got it. But in life, you already know that there's some stuff I can't change and other stuff I can't fully get away from 100%, okay? And then a lot of bad stuff I did, did to me happened to me. I can't get the bad stuff to have not happened.
[40:33] B: Okay?
[40:35] A: So we are going to come up with a different lens, right? And the lens is that if we can't get that stuff to have not happened and we can't always change it, we can't always get away from it, we want to adjust the way that your emotional brain reacts and responds to it. Meaning we can't get rid of everything in life that presses my buttons, because as soon as I get rid of one thing that presses my buttons, there's another one ready to press the same buttons. So we can't get rid of all the stuff that presses the buttons. However, what we can do is unplug the button so that even if it gets pressed, it doesn't cause that in me. So the example I use with people frequently is when a lion approaches a zebra, you and I and most everybody else would agree lion is now making zebra scared. Right? I don't disagree with that. But if we look through the other lens, we go, wait, isn't it actually when the zebra itself sees senses, feels, smells, thinks lions coming, isn't it zebra's brain, not lion, that's immediately making all of the zebra alert and motivated and stronger? We call it scared. It runs fast away. Yes, the brain of the zebra does it to the zebra in response to. To the lion approaching, but it's the zebra's brain. Right, Got it. From that same lens, there are ways in which your brain has been working that causes you to feel bad. By bad, the beating myself up. Then by bad, the discounting any positive thing that I was able to do. My bad. It's a feeling that I get with mom. Or your brain might do all of that to you in response to stuff, but you recognize that way of your brain working has been problematic, which is the issue for us to get addressed so that it stops doing that to you. Got it. And that's where we're headed. Right? Where we're headed is a you where I bet right now. Because I've noticed different emotions as you were telling me about different things. I bet right now on Twitter you could think about any of the stuff that's happened and feel just a little bit of the bad feelings now. Right. Notice how it didn't take long to get there. But here's the cool part. This time you did it on purpose. That wouldn't be a problem if it only happened when you chose to do it. The problem is that your brain does it to you at times that you're not choosing. That's the glitch. So where we're headed, the you that I'm seeing, that kind of feeling, you got this you, she remembers having had it, but if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't even know how to get it. This you, it's been completely cleared. It's gone. Meaning the lingering effect of the past stuff, whether it be stuff that happened to her, stuff that she did, any of the strong emotions, hurt, anger, resentment, guilt, shame. That's cleared and gone. The you that I am seeing, emotionally present, at peace, much more comfortable and grounded in our own skin. Distance to see things clearly with other people for what they are. Flexibility and ease and how to dance and move through it. Got it. So that you're much more good in you. Right. You're trusting in you. Right? Got it. This is where we're headed. Right? And that's where the question isn't how it's gonna happen that we get you here. The question is, would it be okay?
[44:31] B: Right.
[44:32] A: Notice how it's okay. We've got a green light, and this is where we're going. Make sense? So we're gonna give you. Because I have time in between now and when we'll get back together again, I'm gonna give you a small homework assignment. It's not hard, and it doesn't take long. If you did it 10 times a day, which would be a lot, it will take you a full minute.
[44:53] B: Okay?
[44:54] A: Okay. We want to get away because our brain responds to things that are symbolic. It's why advertisers use symbols. It's why when you see a big yellow arch on the side of the road, you immediately think of right. And you see a swoosh mark on somebody. Sneak, sneaker.
[45:11] B: You think of right.
[45:12] A: But what do they have to do with, you know, sneakers or cheeseburgers?
[45:16] B: Nothing, but they're symbols.
[45:18] A: We want a way to symbolize the future. You. Solid, grounded, clear, distanced, free. Seeing things clearly for what they are. Being able to dance with that flexibility and flow. We could use a wild animal. We could use something out in nature. We could use something. Something up in the sky. We could use a natural formation of the earth. We're gonna make it up.
[45:42] B: Okay.
[45:43] A: What symbol comes to mind to symbolize the future? You.
[45:47] B: Oh, you're asking?
[45:48] A: Yeah, we're gonna make it up. I don't know, like a you who's free, clear, peaceful.
[45:54] B: Could I just make a number? Could it be a number?
[45:56] A: A number?
[45:57] B: Yeah. I like that. Over. Seven.
[45:59] A: Seven. I thought you were gonna. I was gonna say seven.
[46:02] B: I felt like seven.
[46:04] A: It could be the number seven.
[46:05] B: Okay, sure.
[46:07] A: Seven can be a symbol. Okay, so then all you have to do is think seven. Okay, Take. I'm gonna explain it first, then we'll do it so you know how it's done. You can think seven.
[46:19] B: Okay.
[46:20] A: Then as you do, you're gonna take a slow breath in. And then you're gonna exhale and close your eyes. You're going to keep your eyes closed as you breathe in, thinking seven. And then you exhale and open your eyes. That was pretty easy, wasn't it?
[46:43] B: Like I said, is it two times a day?
[46:45] A: Not even just a few times a day. Because every time you do it, it's telling the part that I commented on the breath. Right. It's telling that part that's not conscious. Hey. Begin to lay down the foundation. Begin to prime. Begin to set up towards the future me. That's symbolized by the seven. The me who's solid and grounded inside, who's much more okay in me, who's lighter, who's clear, who's flexible, who's free. Got it. Got it. There we go.
[47:22] B: Okay.
[47:22] A: You did great.
[47:23] B: Thank you.
[47:24] A: Really awesome connecting with you.
[47:25] B: Thank you.
[47:26] A: Thank you. And then I'll be excited to get back together with you. We're gonna make a huge difference. You're gonna notice it right away, too.
[47:32] B: Okay.
[47:33] A: Like, you're gonna notice it that things that used to bother you and they're not gonna bother you at all. You're gonna be like, hey, normally that was. And it's not cool. You're gonna notice being free to speak up for yourself.
[47:44] B: Cool.
[47:45] A: But in the times that it makes sense.
[47:47] B: Right.
[47:48] A: Not always, because sometimes it's better not to.
[47:51] B: Right.
[47:52] A: But we want you to have the freedom to. When it makes sense to. Got it.
[47:57] B: Got it.
[47:57] A: Yeah. You did great.
[47:59] B: Cool.
[47:59] A: Really good connecting with you.
[48:00] B: Thank you.
[48:01] A: You're welcome. My pleasure.
