[00:00] A: Okay, so today is the 25th of August, Sandha. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. Given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:17] B: Yes, sir.
[00:18] A: Cool. Okay, so one last little component, right? So we know that part of the brain stays active, doesn't know it ended. So we have good news to get in. Second part, when we're little children, we're lied to by anybody in authority. So whether it be parents, teachers, clergymen, police officers, anybody who's an authority figure, all of our culture reinforces the same messaging that gets installed in little children. And the messaging that gets installed in little children from birth until about 7 or 8 is that if you're a good boy or if you're a good girl, your life will be good. That's the messaging. All the TV shows, all the movies, all the stories, all the fables, all the books, all the educational material, everything geared for little children reinforce the message that when you're being good, good things happen to you. So. Right. You want candy? Can I have that Starburst? Well, you need to use your manners. Can I please have the Starburst? Oh, I'm being good. Yes, you can have the Starburst. Right. And that message from little on gets reinforced that when you're being good, I give you hugs. Oh, I'm so proud of you. I give you praise. What a great job you did. Right? Once a year, some dude you don't know drops a whole bunch of gifts off at your house.
[01:46] B: Okay? Yeah.
[01:47] A: Right. Because you're good.
[01:49] B: Right?
[01:50] A: Right. The good kids get presents, the bad kids get coal. Right? Whatever that is. No kid even knows what coal is. Maybe in West Virginia they might because they got still coal miners everybody else, nobody knows what even coal is. What is that thing? Right, Right. So. So the deal is, when we're little, we're trained to believe that good is because of me and because of what I do and because of my identity. If I'm good, good things happen to me, which is great. If for that child, everything is always good. It doesn't work that way, though. Human beings, we have fucked up shit that happens to us all the time. Right? Good things happen to bad people. Bad things happen to good people. That's what we learn when we're older. Right? We know that bad things happen. Whether I've done anything wrong, but because what I learned when I was 0 to 8. And because when I go through something troubling, it's emotional. So what am I not accessing most? If I am emotional, am I also brilliant and wise?
[02:58] B: No.
[02:58] A: No, right? When I'm like, how brilliant and wise am I? Right? Do I look like the wise sage who's got. So what's active is that emotional state, which is my emotional brain. So of course, if it's bad, it must be my fault. Now, it doesn't matter whether it happened when I was little. So maybe I drew a picture on the wall for my mom that she wasn't really happy that I was drawing on the wall and she spanked me on the hiney and my nervous system learned I was doing something I wasn't supposed to do. Something bad happened to me. Okay, Spanking bad things happened because I was being bad, right? That could be that message. But let's say this girl, one of her co workers, set her up with a friend of hers, right? Guy was nice. They went out on a date, you know, he came, picked her up, brought her flowers, right? It was nice, right? They went out to dinner, they had a good conversation, you know, he goes to drop her off at home, gives her the peck on the cheek, and he's like, oh, I'm so sorry, I really have to use the restroom. And of course, not being a bitch, he's like, sure, go ahead, use the restroom. She had no idea that when he came out of the restroom, he was gonna force her to have sex with him. She was gonna rape him, right? She had no idea that that was gonna happen. But nobody's shocked afterwards when she's blaming herself for having been so stupid, right? She should have known better. She never should have let him in. What was she thinking? I don't know. The dude had to pee. Like, we just had a nice meal. Like, what the.
[04:29] B: Right, right, right.
[04:31] A: But because it was bad, it's totally my fault. I did something. Got it. So even the kids whose parents get divorced, dad is gone, dad maybe has an alcohol problem. The kid doesn't go, oh, well, dad and mom divorcing, that's a mom and dad issue. Dad not being around isn't about my love of dating. It's about dad's fucked up addiction. No 4 year old doesn't think that. 4 year old thinks if I mattered to my dad, if I was worth it, if I was truly lovable, my dad would be around. And even when dad had the best intentions of being there at the, you know, soccer game, first start for the kid all excited when waiting for dad, doesn't see dad at all. Whole game goes, kid doesn't go, oh, right. Dad is an alcoholic. It is a Saturday morning. He probably went out Friday on a drunken vendor. He's probably so hungover he couldn't even wake up, right? It's not about me. It's about dad. No little kid's gonna go back to, Daddy told me he was gonna be here. I must not matter to Dad. I must not be lovable. Maybe it's because I'm not good enough. Maybe if I was more of a starter, Daddy would be here. Maybe if I was better at soccer, maybe. But there's something not okay with me, right? It goes into that all the time. Makes sense. It's so sad, right? But that's the messaging. Because it's bad, it's my fault. And it could be little things, right? It doesn't even have to do with me, but it could be going on, right? I happen to be walking down the wrong side of the street and somebody slugs me. I should have known better. Shouldn't have been walking down that side of the street, right? Yeah. Well, fuck. If I had known that the guy was gonna slug me, I wouldn't be on that side of the street, right?
[06:25] B: Was I supposed to? Yeah. Kosi told me a lot about that. I try not to be better. I think I'm a little bit better at not being mad at things that, like, I didn't know what I didn't know.
[06:34] A: Or better yet, the dog who comes over that I thought was a friendly dog, and I reached my hand down, That's. Well, damn. If I had known the dog was gonna bite me, I certainly would have put my hand down there. But I was taught, you know, no, put your hand down there. Dog needs a sniff, Right? Right. Again, it goes back to, I was being stupid, right? Freaking idiot, dummy, all those things. Because if it's bad, it must have something to do with me, but not me, my behavior or my actions or even my thoughts. Me at a deeper level, my identity. That's where all the esteem stuff comes in, right? Let's say I might not be really good at math, but I've got other kids around me that are really good at math. And so, of course, because I'm not as good as these kids, I feel like I'm stupid. And it doesn't just go, oh, I'm not great at math. It's goes, no, I'm just stupid, right? Because I'm not great at math. I'm stupid in all areas of life.
[07:36] B: I felt that way before. I not feel the math, but that's what it does.
[07:41] A: It blankets. All things. Make sense.
[07:45] B: Yes.
[07:46] A: So with those two things active, that's why we get triggered when we don't want to get triggered. Because my brain. All those moments are still active. So my brain thinks they're still happening. The meaning has made me feel worse about me. So now I'm even that much more. My brain is looking for anything that is a reminder of anything that I went through that was bad. But similar gets read as identical.
[08:15] B: Right?
[08:16] A: Right. That's where I gave the example of the soldier diving on the ground because the firework burst in the air. But he was the guy that lit it.
[08:24] B: I don't think you told me that.
[08:25] A: Right. You would think that the guy who dove on the ground because his brain confused the sound of the firework with mortar grenades. Right. But he lit it. He would think he would know better. Right?
[08:40] B: Right.
[08:41] A: But it gets confused. Right. The gal gets ready to go out on the date, and she had gone out with the galaxy, and the guy went to the restroom, and in the restroom, sometimes they have, like, colognes. And so he gave himself a squirt.
[08:55] B: Right.
[08:56] A: Now, he had no idea. And she had no idea when he came back. But all of a sudden she's like, there's something about this guy now. I don't like. She couldn't even, like, place it, but, like, she had wanted to kiss him. Now she's. She's getting, like, feeling disgusted right now. She had no idea, neither did he. That the cologne that he's bringing is the same cologne.
[09:15] B: Okay.
[09:16] A: Was the cologne that her uncle wore when he molested her.
[09:20] B: Oh, shit.
[09:22] A: Now we know when she was being molested by her uncle. The issue wasn't what he smelled like.
[09:29] B: Right.
[09:30] A: That is not the part that bothered her. What he was doing to her is. Right. But because they co. Occurred, they're merged. So now she smells it and she's back in that response. Not crazy.
[09:44] B: Yeah.
[09:45] A: Right. Or it's a time of day, or it's a location.
[09:51] B: Okay.
[09:52] A: Where I see certain things where. Oh, my goodness, all the stuff is back. Make sense?
[09:58] B: Yes.
[09:59] A: So all of that are reminders. Because my brain is looking for anything in my current environment that was similar to anything that I went through that was painful to have me react faster.
[10:12] B: Okay.
[10:14] A: Right. Because the mechanism of survival is fight, flight, freeze, fawn.
[10:22] B: That's okay.
[10:23] A: Got it.
[10:24] B: Right.
[10:25] A: So if the animal, right. Hears. Let's say rabbit hears a twig snap in the Woods. There's two of them. One rabbit bolts, the other rabbit thought it might be. Oh, fuck. It's not George. I'm dead. Right. So in an animal world, the sooner and the more intense I react to stress or threat, the better chance I have to live. Got it. That's what's going on. That's why I didn't have any of the reminders. As I'm driving in the car, as I'm talking to mom, as I'm talking to my daughter.
[11:02] B: Right.
[11:03] A: All of a sudden, we get back to the location where shit happened.
[11:08] B: Yep.
[11:09] A: Right. And they're structurally similar stuff. And I recognize. Oh, Mom's getting triggered about me walking to the store because in the past, I'd walk to the store and get drugs.
[11:18] B: Right.
[11:19] A: And she doesn't want me to use drugs. Right, Right. Which is cool that my mom doesn't want me to use drugs.
[11:25] B: Right, Right. But I'm not. It's not. I just want him out to do what's going on. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:32] A: Got it. So that's why that stuff continues to run.
[11:36] B: Okay.
[11:37] A: We just want to unplug the effect that the stuff has had so it's no longer running. Think of, like, there are faulty connections, faulty programs. There are errors and misfires in the way that your brain is reading your world, because it's not reading your world as what's happening now. It's reading your world through the lens of what did and all the emotional response of what has. So I'm not really seeing. Right. It's why I tell people sometimes, and it might be with mom, might be with dad, might be with your daughter, that the people who know you the most, who are closest to you, are the ones to see that you've changed last.
[12:22] B: Yeah.
[12:24] A: Not because you haven't changed, but because they've got this on.
[12:29] B: Okay.
[12:30] A: And when I've got this on, how well do I see you?
[12:34] B: Right. Not very.
[12:35] A: Right. I see all my stuff about you.
[12:38] B: Right.
[12:39] A: But I don't really kind of can peek through.
[12:41] B: Right.
[12:42] A: You follow me with that? Yes.
[12:44] B: Yes.
[12:45] A: So other people will notice changes in you before people who are super close to you.
[12:51] B: Okay.
[12:51] A: But the cool part is you're gonna notice the changes in you. Right. Because if you were no longer troubled by the stuff that happened, if being with mom or even at the house no longer did all this, regardless of how mom might be, if it wasn't causing all of that in you, like, how would you actually be?
[13:10] B: Right. So much better.
[13:13] A: So much better. Right. So that's where the you that I am seeing the impact because right now, you had thought about different things, but I bet you can think about one of the things that have happened and feel a little bad feeling. Right. Notice how it doesn't take a long time. Right. But you did it on purpose. Wouldn't be a problem if it only happened when you chose it.
[13:33] B: Right.
[13:33] A: The problem is that your brain does it to you when you're not choosing.
[13:36] B: Right.
[13:36] A: That's the error. Got it.
[13:39] B: Got it.
[13:39] A: So the you that I'm seeing, that kind of feeling about those kinds of things, the you that I'm seeing, she remembers having had that, but if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't know how to get it. It's like, cleared and more meaning. She could in detail, describe to you one of the things that happened that was awful while being with you, eating pizza.
[13:58] B: Okay.
[13:58] A: Right. Perfectly okay. Other people like, how can you not be upset? And you're like, well, I like the pizza.
[14:04] B: It's good.
[14:05] A: Because where you are is you're emotionally present.
[14:08] B: Okay.
[14:08] A: Right. So the second thing, the you that I'm seeing, she's much more emotionally present so that she's emotionally dealing with what is going on without the emotional effect of what has. She still has the wisdom and knowledge from having gone through and made it through stuff, but the emotion turned out. Got it.
[14:29] B: Yeah.
[14:29] A: The you that I'm seeing is much more centered and grounded and. Okay. She's able to see stuff clearly. She's able to see other people's stuff as what it is, and she's able to make her own decisions based on what's best, not just based on what others are saying. She may do what others are saying if that aligns with what's best for her or she may not. In both ways, she's got freedom. Got it. This is the you that I'm seeing. Yeah. Makes sense. And you don't have to see the future you is clear as I do. Because the question isn't how it's gonna happen that we get you here. The question is a different one. Would it be okay with you?
[15:10] B: Yeah.
[15:11] A: Yeah. Right. So we've got a green light, and now your mind gets to organize by knowing where we're headed. And it being okay with you is actually on the way to it. Right. Like, in order to get somewhere, we first need to know where we're going, and we need to be okay in going there. Right. Like, if I told you to get in the car and start driving, you're like, okay, Three hours from now, I'M gonna tell you where to go. You're like, wait, because I could drive three hours in the wrong direction.
[15:42] B: Right? Yeah, Right.
[15:45] A: Got it. So now that we know where we're going, your brain gets to organize. Then what we want to do is we want to get your body into the right states for healing. And how we get your body into the right states for healing. You're always putting body in states of rest. Because think about it, when somebody's got a cold, when somebody's got the flu, when somebody just had surgery, what do we want each of those people to do? Yeah. Because that enables the body to accelerate healing. Got it. So we're going to go through some processes that put your body into the right states for healing. We're also going to do some education in that we know that there's stuff that's happened to your body that hurt your thoughts and feelings. We want to have the distinction that you have a body. This one's totally yours.
[16:44] B: Okay.
[16:45] A: But what if it's not actually your body?
[16:47] B: You.
[16:50] A: It's a weird question, right? What if you have a body and your body's yours, but your body isn't you?
[16:59] B: Okay, I get that.
[17:01] A: That you aren't your body. Right. You just have one. Right? Right. And we know that because, like, my mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident.
[17:11] B: Okay.
[17:12] A: And when people visit her, she goes to visit other people. They don't say, hey, I'm glad almost all of you could come over.
[17:20] B: It's terrible.
[17:21] A: It's terrible, right? It's terrible.
[17:23] B: Okay. Yes.
[17:25] A: So we know that there's not a single cell within your body that's the same as it was. Yeah. They've all been replaced. Like, your feet are longer than they were when you were two. Right. Yet despite those kinds of changes, you stay you. Right. So you have a body. Totally yours is in you. Right. You also think thoughts. Right. But what if you're not the thinker of them? Because lots of times thoughts just come to mind, not because you decided to have them.
[17:55] B: True.
[17:55] A: Got it.
[17:56] B: Right.
[17:56] A: So your brain is actually the thinker of your thoughts, not you.
[18:00] B: Okay.
[18:01] A: And your brain isn't you because it's an organ just like your heart.
[18:06] B: Right.
[18:06] A: You don't walk around going, I'm my heart. I have a heart. Right?
[18:10] B: Right.
[18:11] A: I'm not my kidney or my lungs or my liver.
[18:14] B: Right?
[18:15] A: Right. They're all organs. They're part. Not you. Right. So you're not your body, you're not your thoughts. Weird question. Well, then Maybe you're your feelings, but you feel different ways at different times. So you're still you, regardless of how you're feeling.
[18:32] B: Right?
[18:32] A: Right. So you're not feelings either. Right. Then we go, oh, maybe you're what you do, but there's lots of things you've done through life. And when you did this and then stopped and then did this other thing, you didn't stop existing.
[18:45] B: Right.
[18:47] A: Weird. Because if you're not what you do, or your thoughts or your feelings or your body, then what the heck are you? It's a weird question. Okay, so for our purposes today, I'd like you to think of a time when you are outside in nature and you see something that's beautiful. Like, I'll give you an example probably now. A month ago, I was in San Francisco, and just outside of San Francisco is a park called Muir Woods. And in Muir woods, they have big, huge redwood trees. And redwood trees are enormous, and they go way, like 400ft in the air. Like, they are so big. So there was a moment as I'm sitting there on a log, looking at a creek, hearing the sound of the babbling, seeing the human hugeness mass of the trees in the forest. Right? That moment was like, wow. So think of a time when you were outside in nature and you have one of those experiences where you're like, wow, okay. Right. What is it that you see?
[20:06] B: Snow.
[20:07] A: Snow, right. And there's a moment as you're seeing the snow that you're feeling like that. All wonder, peace, excitement.
[20:13] B: Okay.
[20:14] A: Right. And some people would say to you, well, of course, seeing the snow is going to give you the feelings. But if we looked at it differently, we could say that being there and experiencing it drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited? Kind of like if I'm at a campfire and it's cold outside and I begin to move my hands towards the flames and I go, holy cow, this fire is getting hotter. Is the fire actually getting any hotter? No, no. I am becoming way more aware of the heat. Got it.
[20:56] B: Right.
[20:57] A: So we know that in your life, multitudes of occurrences have happened where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Angers, upsets, guilt, shames, resentment, sadness, hurts, pains. But no matter where awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited. We're gonna check that out for a moment. Right? Then we go, wait a minute. If that's the case, how do you know that two of us are in here? You look around your senses, bring in the data. Your intellect organizes the data. We think of that as knowledge. And sometimes people call knowledge light. So we'll call it the light of knowledge, okay? At your center, it's a brighter light. It's actually the light of wisdom. So we've got knowledge and we've got wisdom. And as you know, I work with all sorts of people about all sorts of awful stuff happen. But I remember this one girl, she was like. I don't know, like six or seven. An older brother at the time would take, like, GI Joe figures and march them up her leg and then park them in her. So she had a lot of ugh around all of that. But when we worked together, we cleared out the hurt, the shame, the anger, the guilt, the pain that was gone. And so she's sitting across from me like you are, and I asked her the question. I go all that. I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone. I don't feel anything. I said, I know. Isn't that cool? She goes, it is. I go, but the question was, where was it? And the two of us started thinking. I go, was it at the surface level? And she's like, no, it wasn't intellectual. Oh, well, then maybe it was hiding in your center. And she's like, really? How could that survive in light where I'm peaceful and excited? I said, whoa, that's true. I go, well, then, where was it? She goes, ah. It was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I said, well, what happened? She goes, the lights joined. They're now touching the shadows. The distortion is gone. And I said, whoa, that's pretty cool. And she said, it is. And then we started talking about how people, when they come in to see me, they screw up identity all the time. People tell me things like, they're anxious, they're shy, they're depressed, they're ocd. They think the way they are is how they feel. They think that who they are is how they feel. But if I go to the dentist and I'm really upset when I come out and you say to me, why are you so upset? And I say, sandhya, you'll never believe what they Dentist did to me. And you're like, okay, what did he do? Well, the first thing he did is he put me in a chair. And as soon as I sat down, immediately the chair started doing this. So my head is down below, my feet are up in the air. It's very uncomfortable.
[23:56] B: Okay?
[23:57] A: He then positions it, and you're like, yeah, okay. You're at the dentist. He then positions this light, like right in my eyes. I'm like, blinded. I can't see anything. Right. And you're like, okay, but you're at the dentist. And then he took this cold metal instrument and he shoved it inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness.
[24:17] B: And you're what on the side of my mouth? I'm at the dentist.
[24:25] A: But it's the same thing I said to the girl with her brother in the GI Joe figure. I said, when you were little, he messed with your stuff. And she looked at me and she had that same glowing smile. And she said, he did. And for a long time it hurt my feelings. And for a long time it screwed up my thinking. And then she looked at me and she had that same glow and that same smile. And this just like, you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body. It screwed up my thinking and feeling, but he never touched me. And I went, whoa, that's powerful.
[25:08] B: Yeah, right?
[25:10] A: So where we're headed is a you who's free, who's at peace, who's clear, who's light. So before we move into the next part process, do you need to use the restroom or anything?
[25:25] B: Are you telling me I need to pee?
[25:27] A: I don't know whether you do or not, but if you do, now would be a good time to do it.
[25:31] B: Okay, I'll go pee.
[25:32] A: Okay, I'll pause this. That are really cool processes that put the body into the right states for healing. They use brain levers. So neuroscience has really been a game changer in what we're able to do. Because what we've discovered right. By FMRI machines, is first thing we discovered. Our brain has what they call neuroplasticity. And what that simply means is every experience we go through on purpose or not, literally causes changes in the physical structure of our brain. And that our brain has the ability to rewire, which is really cool. Second thing neuroscience science discovered is that it's called memory reconsolidation. So what we've learned is when a memory is moved from the long term stores into the present moment, it's moldable and malleable. Meaning we can change the coding of the memory. Right. The error in coding of troubling memories is it's being coded as happening versus data about something that happened. Got it. So that gets changed. As that changes, it also changes all the meaning that was attached that was making me feel worse about me. Got it. And then they came up with these really cool. By watching what's Going on in somebody's brain. These levers that put the body in a state of rest. First lever, though, is the silliest one of all. It's about slightly lowering the jaw so it's not like, ah, it's just a little bit. When you slightly lower your jaw, it activates the vagal nerve in our body and starts to put it into parasympathetic response. So you slightly lower your jaw. Second lever is you rest your toe at the bottom of your mouth. And then the third lever is you begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale. So that when you exhale, the exhale is a little bit longer. So you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue, and now you breathe in a little bit slightly slower and deeper and out a little bit longer. And just notice what starts to happen as you're breathing in a little slower and deeper and out a little bit longer, notice what's happening. How's your body beginning to feel now? Like more tense or more calm. Isn't that. Now, the next lever is also interesting, so I'll explain it in this way. We have different frequencies, we have different hertz that our brain operates in. So the frequency that we're in for most waking states is the frequency of beta waves. So they're good for focus, conversation, communication, concentration, social interaction, things like arithmetic. However, when beta waves get elevated, meaning they run at a higher frequency, a higher hertz. It's where all of anxiety, agitation, irritation, angst, worry, upset, traumaless. Because what it does is it causes a tunneling of our vision. It narrows what we see. We want to move naturally, the brightness, brain waves down into alpha waves. Alpha waves are highly correlated with what surfers call flow. Just kind of riding the wave, right? What athletes think of as being in the zone. So they're alert, but they're relaxed, right? And it's correlated with an expanding of our awareness, meaning we notice more with our peripheral vision, the sides of our eyes. So how it works is again, you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You breathe in this way. That's a little bit slower and deeper, exhaling a little bit longer. As you continue to breathe in this way, you can look across and see me. And you can see my nose. You're gonna stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers. My fingers are gonna move out as you stay looking at my nose. But with the sides of your eyes pick up my fingers wiggling. Isn't that interesting? And notice that with the Sides of your eyes. You can now pick up the space towards the the side windows and doors. Notice how you're more aware of the space between us and the space that's beyond me. You can sense the space underneath you, behind you and above your head. And as you're noticing more of the space in the room, again, checking inside your body. How's your body feeling now?
[30:56] B: I feel calm.
[30:57] A: You do, don't you? Isn't that interesting? And then the last little one, you might have said this. People say it all the time. I'm under a lot of stress.
[31:05] B: Okay.
[31:09] A: Now if we listen to that literally, right, If I'm underneath stress, then where is the stress? It is. It's above me, Right. Sometimes it feels like a weight on my shoulder, sometimes it feels like a weight, but I'm definitely underneath it. Right. So a reversal is being out from under it and up above it. Okay, having a different metaphor. It's a bird's eye view. What does a bird's eye view mean? Yes. So I'm the bird seeing everything as being underneath and below me because I'm above and over it. But not just a perched in a tree bird, but a bird that's soaring through the space of the sky. Watch a bird just soar and it makes these big, wide. So we're going to imagine what it might be like to be the bird above and over it. So one more time, you slide slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue, you breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper. Exhaling a little bit longer as you do, you can look across and see my nose, you can see my fingers, they move out. You begin to notice more of the space in the room, the space to the sides, the space in between. And see, it's neat because space normally is the thing. We just disappear. We never see it. But notice what's happening is you're aware of more of the space in between and around you and all the objects, right? And how the space literally goes beyond the room, all the way in every direction space is at, actually unending, all the way to outer space, right? Then what you do is go ahead and close your eyes and imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body that you rise up beyond the ceiling and beyond the roof, all the way up above it all. You're having the bird's eye view of seeing everything as being underneath and below you because you're above and over it. And just like a bird soaring free, flying through the sky. Making those big wide curves turned arching angles. You soar, you fly, you glide, you move free. That's right. Then bring awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside you. Big breath in and exhale. And eyes are open. There we go. Good job. And in those short moments, what were you noticing within you?
[34:23] B: I felt lighter.
[34:24] A: You feel lighter. Isn't that a good news thing? And as you're feeling lighter, we're gonna make some requests of the unconscious parts of your brain, the part that beats your heart and breathes through you, that does all the automatic. That part is also a warehouse. So you totally know experiences. That part knows even more of which experiences would be useful to bring to your awareness for us to unplug and clear. It also knows which order to bring the moments in, so you don't have to be concerned with that at all. Your brain is going to do it for you because it knows that as it brings those moments into the light between us and we unplug it, the effect that it's having gets cleared and all the energy that was stuck in dealing with it gets released to be used within mind and body as restorative, healing energy. Got it. So one last time, slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue. Breathe a little slow. Exhale a little longer. Notice that with your eyes closed, you can still sense the space behind and in front, underneath and above, to your right, to your left. Noticing more space, imagine floating up and out of your body, well beyond the ceiling and the rooftop, so that you rise above it all, having the bird's eye view of seeing everything underneath and below you, soaring free to fly and glide and move in all ways and in any direction, becoming more free to be that much more okay in you. And as all of this is going on, your unconscious has begun to organize, group and categorize different moments in life through different time periods, through different things that happen. Big, small, long time ago, recent one time, multiple time experiences. It's going to begin to categorize group, so that as you bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate, that part of your brain will select a particular moment and bring it to your awareness to clear. And you got one. Yeah. The moment that comes to mind, one that happened that was yucky, that means try never to think about, because when we do, we feel yucky. The one that just came to mind happened about how long ago you might have been humbled.
[37:30] B: 32.
[37:31] A: Yeah. So how long ago was that?
[37:34] B: Three years ago.
[37:34] A: Three years ago, the feeling that comes up as you think about it, is a feeling of. What is it? Sadness, hurt, anger, regret, remorse, guilt, shame, pain. A combination, all those things. Okay, good. So first question. Would it be okay to get it gone?
[37:52] B: Yeah.
[37:52] A: And if it was gone, would it in any way, shape or form mean what happened was okay?
[37:57] B: No.
[37:57] A: Right. You get to be okay even if it wasn't. Right. Got it. Good. So how we clear it, like I said, is you're going to intend to be with me. You're just going to tell me facts about what happened, really, matter of factly, that happened. That happened. That happened. That happened, that happened. That was done. Right. We're gonna go through it like that. It'll be really easy. But because it happened three years ago, there have been things you've done after that that were more enjoyable than that. What's one thing, anytime from when that ended until yesterday, that was more enjoyable than that moment?
[38:29] B: Everything.
[38:30] A: Give me one thing.
[38:32] B: Seeing my daughter.
[38:33] A: Yeah. Seeing your daughter. Way more enjoyable than that. Good. Something else.
[38:36] B: Being at Salah.
[38:37] A: Yeah. Being at Salah. Right. One other. Yeah. Right. Good. All these things happen after that. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond it. Okay, so we have good news to get in.
[38:49] B: Okay.
[38:50] A: Right. That moment three years ago when it happened, you might have been where. So you're in St. Pete. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[38:59] B: Daytime.
[38:59] A: Daytime. And you're wearing St. Pete, like, outside in your house. Right. There you go. Right. Good. And then what happened? So you're there, you're on the street?
[39:10] B: No, I was in, like, a. Like a rundown motel.
[39:14] A: So you're in a motel. Right. And like, in a motel room?
[39:16] B: Yes.
[39:17] A: Right. Like upstairs, downstairs.
[39:18] B: Downstairs.
[39:19] A: Downstairs. Right. Good. And the door is right outside?
[39:21] B: Yeah.
[39:22] A: To the, like, parking lot?
[39:24] B: Yep.
[39:24] A: Right. It wasn't like an inside. No. Right. Good. Right. And then what happened next? So you're in the room.
[39:29] B: I did a. Somebody gave me a shot of drugs.
[39:32] A: So somebody gave you something. Right. Good. As you're in the room. So you're in the room with somebody else?
[39:38] B: Yep.
[39:38] A: Is there just one person or more than one person?
[39:40] B: More than one person.
[39:41] A: So it's you and that person?
[39:43] B: Yep.
[39:44] A: And somebody else.
[39:46] B: Yep.
[39:47] A: And somebody else?
[39:48] B: Yep.
[39:49] A: Okay, so how many people were in there?
[39:51] B: Like three that I remember.
[39:53] A: Three that you remember? All guys? Guys and gals.
[39:56] B: And one girl.
[39:57] A: So you and another girl?
[39:59] B: Yeah.
[39:59] A: And then, like two guys. Right. Good. And so they gave you the. Whatever they gave you. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[40:04] B: And fell asleep.
[40:05] A: And then you fell asleep. Right. Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[40:09] B: And then later on, I found out that, like, they raped me and put me on the Internet.
[40:13] A: Well, then you woke up. Right. Right. And then you found out that they had done stuff to your body.
[40:18] B: Right.
[40:19] A: While you were out. Right. Right. And that they had videoed it. Right. Right. And then they had uploaded it.
[40:23] B: Right.
[40:24] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened? And then you're like, what the. Right. What the. Right. And then what happened? Right. Be here. Hi. Hi. Hi. Get here. Hi. Be here. Hi. No, here. Not there. Right here. Hi. Right. Hi. Right.
[40:44] B: Okay.
[40:45] A: That went over here. And notice how you're still there. You might want to exhale. Did you know that when we get upset, we forget to breathe? Like, we actually hold our breath. It's the mechanism of being upset. I know.
[41:02] B: I can't breathe again.
[41:05] A: And as you're breathing, you know what's starting to happen? What do you know? Well, just check. What's happening is you're starting to breathe, feel better, and you're starting to talk to me.
[41:15] B: Yep.
[41:15] A: Oh, you're feeling better.
[41:17] B: Yeah.
[41:17] A: Right. Why?
[41:18] B: I don't know.
[41:19] A: Oh, because you're coming back here.
[41:20] B: Okay.
[41:21] A: Right. Because you're being with me, not there. Right, right, Right. Isn't this better than then? Yep. Right. Good. So you're coming back here. Hi.
[41:29] B: Okay.
[41:29] A: Right. Good. I notice what my job is to do. Yeah. When you start going there, what do I want to do?
[41:36] B: Not be there.
[41:37] A: Sanda, come here.
[41:38] B: Hi. Be with me. Hi.
[41:39] A: Hi. Right. Right. So then you had seen it, the video, online.
[41:44] B: I didn't see it.
[41:45] A: No. But you had found out that they had put a video on.
[41:47] B: Yeah.
[41:47] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. And then what happened next? Right. Because our mind likes to stop the story at the shitty spot.
[41:54] B: Yeah.
[41:55] A: Right. Well, then you might have left the room.
[41:57] B: Yeah.
[41:57] A: Right. And then that moment ended. Right, Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like see your daughter or go to Salem.
[42:04] B: Yeah.
[42:05] A: Or even come here.
[42:06] B: Yeah.
[42:06] A: Right. Good. Now, notice, as you were telling me about it, there was all that discom, but it was actually a little less because you were intending to be here. Now, here's the craziest part. You're gonna go. What? Wait, what? We never go backwards. We only go forward.
[42:24] B: Okay.
[42:24] A: But when we go backwards, it unplugs the memory and it takes away the charge because notice where the memory stopped. The worst spot.
[42:33] B: Right.
[42:33] A: Finding out that they had done that stuff to your body and videoed it and put it online.
[42:38] B: Right.
[42:38] A: Got It.
[42:39] B: Right.
[42:39] A: What happened next? I don't know. Well, fuck. Something happened. Clearly, you're not there. Like, are we in the room? Right, got it. So we want to go backwards, right? So we got being here, right? We got being at Salem, we got seeing your daughter, right? And then you'd left that place, and then you'd found out that they had posted stuff online. And then you'd find out that they video. Then you'd found out that they had done that stuff to your body. And then you had woken up, right? And then before that, you'd gone to sleep. And then before that, they injected. And then before that, you would go into that room.
[43:13] B: Right.
[43:14] A: Then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Right? Right. As I go backwards compared to when you were telling it to me, forward emotionally, how was it? I know. Isn't that weird?
[43:24] B: Yeah. That's okay. It was forward. That was bad. Backwards.
[43:28] A: And it's doing that because for the first time, your brain is beginning to read what happened as data.
[43:37] B: Okay, that makes sense.
[43:40] A: You weren't actually being troubled because that was yucky. You're being troubled because your brain was thinking, that yucky moment is happening. It's causing all the upset to try to motivate you to get it to stop. Good news. It has.
[43:58] B: I've always wondered about that because it's like, I used to be so grateful that, like, I was asleep for it because I wasn't, like, awake. And I've never actually seen, like, the video, like, myself. So I'm wondering if maybe, like, I'm making it out to be worse than, like, what it was. Even though there. There's really no good way to look at it. I don't know. It's always been confusing to me because, like, I said a lot of the shit that was said to be, like, I was asleep for. And I used to be grateful for the person. Like, that's why I would. Because I knew I was being trafficked. Like, I would choose to hang out with this person because I knew that I was getting fucked over, but at least I wouldn't remember it. But then, like, just to know, like, later it would be brought up and people would bring things to my attention. I'd be like, oh, shit. You know, Like, I don't know. That's like, really gaslighting. Sometimes I wish I was awake. But then it's like I made a conscious effort to, like. Like, hanging out with this guy only because I knew that I wouldn't, like. Like I wouldn't be away for It.
[44:55] A: I don't know.
[44:55] B: It's weird.
[44:57] A: I can't describe that well. Right. But we want to do the next piece with this one, because that's where it's confusing, because there's parts of it that I feel better that I wasn't present for it. But then when I found out some of the other stuff that actually happened, then it made me feel crappy that it happened.
[45:14] B: Yeah.
[45:14] A: Got it.
[45:15] B: Yeah.
[45:15] A: Okay, good. So next part. Emotional brain does not get logic, but it does get patterns of association.
[45:23] B: Okay?
[45:24] A: And the error is that the memory and the experience are glued. So the memory is as if it's the experience. But there are things you can clearly remember doing today that you know you're not doing right now. For example, putting on your sweatpants, right? You can remember doing it, right? You can probably remember where you were this morning when you did it, right? Right. But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your sweatpants on, and then I went, sanda, stop putting on your sweatpants.
[46:00] B: Wait, what?
[46:01] A: Right. You would look at me and go, I'm not putting on my sweatpants. Because, you know, there's a big difference between. Between you remembering doing it and you actually doing it doing it now. Got it.
[46:12] B: Right.
[46:13] A: You can remember putting your shirt on, right? And if I went, sanda, stop putting on your shirt.
[46:17] B: Right?
[46:17] A: You'd be like, I'm not putting on my shirt.
[46:19] B: Right?
[46:20] A: Even if I said to you, well, then stop me from putting on my shirt. You're not putting on your shirt. Because there's a difference between the memory and the experience. Got it. You can remember that happening, right? That injecting you and then waking up, finding out that they had done what they did to your body and posted online. You can remember that happening. You can also remember putting your sweatpants on today, right? Sonia, stop putting on your sweatpants. Say, I'm not putting on my sweatpants.
[46:46] B: Say that I'm not putting on my sweatpants.
[46:48] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt.
[46:50] B: Put me on your shirt.
[46:51] A: Right? Well, then you stop putting on your shirt. Say, I'm not putting on my shirt. Well, stop me from putting on my jeans, right? Well, then stop them from drugging you and recording what they did to your body. Say, they're not doing that. Right? Well, then you stop putting your hair up. Say, I'm not putting my hair up. No, stop them from doing that. Say they're not doing that. Well, stop it from happening. Go. It's not happening. Right? So then where Is that moment. Say it no longer exists.
[47:16] B: It no longer exists.
[47:17] A: Bingo. And as this gets in, what do you notice happening?
[47:23] B: It doesn't really phase me.
[47:25] A: It doesn't, does it? Them doing that, did that have anything to do with you?
[47:31] B: No.
[47:31] A: No. Would it have mattered whether it was you or another gal that they had there that they injected, that they had and did that? Right. It wouldn't have mattered if you're somebody else.
[47:43] B: Right?
[47:43] A: You didn't know that then, Right? Right. So we want to repeat these four words. Here we go. It's. It's not. Not about. About me.
[47:54] B: Me.
[47:54] A: Right? It's not.
[47:55] B: Right?
[47:56] A: Right.
[47:56] B: Say that it's not about me.
[47:57] A: Write one more time, it's not about me. Now close your eyes. Picture the earlier you. Let her know that moment is over. Finished, completed, defeated. It no longer exists. Let her know that you're okay. Right. Let her know that that happening had nothing to do with you.
[48:12] B: Right.
[48:12] A: Everything to do with them. It's not about me. So that she gets it.
[48:16] B: It's not about me.
[48:17] A: Right. Let the you know about seeing her daughter. Bonus. Ayla. Right. Let her know. And as the earlier you is getting it, what do you notice now happening to the earlier you's face?
[48:31] B: Oh, I feel better.
[48:33] A: Yeah. Notice how she's not looking so troubled? Right? Right. Notice how easy that was.
[48:41] B: You made it easier. I don't suggest I do it myself.
[48:44] A: But that's why we're here together.
[48:46] B: Okay? Yeah.
[48:49] A: We're doing this thing together. Right. And because we've already done one, it'll make doing more easier because what does our brain do? It's a really good learner.
[49:00] B: Right?
[49:01] A: Right. And it learns how to do something, and then it might take a little practice.
[49:05] B: Okay.
[49:06] A: But it gets easier each time. Like, if I first learned how to tie a pair of shoes, it's really hard to figure out what I do with the loop. Do I do bunny rabbit.
[49:15] B: Right.
[49:16] A: Like, that's a hard thing to do.
[49:19] B: Right.
[49:20] A: But once I've done it, and I've done it a lot, does it take much thinking? Oh, shoot. What do I do? I do the left one over the right one or the right one over the left. Like, how do I make the right. I just do it. And it applies to others. I learned on this shoe, but I now got a different shoe on. But it still has laces. Oh, no, I know how to do it. No, no. But that's a different shoe. Yeah. No, no. But it's still got laces. Got it. So it's the same thing. We're interested in clearing even more. So again, as your jaw is slightly lowered and you're resting your tongue and you're breathing a little bit more slower and deeper. Notice already feeling a little bit better. That other part of the brain again is going to travel back to those groups and it's going to select another moment for us to clear. Right. This one happened when?
[50:16] B: Like, four years ago?
[50:18] A: Yeah. And again, that one, you're where?
[50:22] B: In an alley.
[50:23] A: So you're in an alley. Good. Daytime or nighttime time?
[50:25] B: Night time?
[50:25] A: Night time. Like, so it's night time, you're in the alley?
[50:29] B: Yeah.
[50:30] A: Right. And are you standing. Sitting.
[50:33] B: Sitting.
[50:33] A: Sitting in the alley? Right. And like, who's there?
[50:37] B: This one guy.
[50:38] A: This one guy?
[50:39] B: Yeah.
[50:39] A: And you were in the alley with him? With him, Right. There was nobody else? There's nobody else. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[50:45] B: He took out a knife.
[50:46] A: Right? He took out a knife, right?
[50:48] B: Yeah. And then he talked to me for, like, three hours. No, I'm lying. Like, 45 minutes.
[50:52] A: So he's talking to you with the knife, saying, like, I could cut you or hurt you.
[50:57] B: Yep.
[50:57] A: Right, Good.
[50:58] B: And then he wouldn't let me leave. Like, I would get up. And then he made me sit back down, right?
[51:01] A: No, no, you didn't need to sit. Right, Right. Good.
[51:04] B: Yeah.
[51:04] A: Like I'm gonna go down. No, you need to sit. Right, Good. And then what happened next? Yeah.
[51:07] B: And then you raped me.
[51:08] A: Well, then he did what?
[51:10] B: He told me to lay down.
[51:11] A: He told you to lay down?
[51:12] B: Yeah.
[51:12] A: Right. And then he pulled your pants down?
[51:14] B: No, he told me to take my pants down.
[51:15] A: He did. To take your pants down. He took his pants down. And then he put his penis in your vagina. And he did that for a period of time.
[51:21] B: Yeah.
[51:22] A: And then he stopped.
[51:22] B: Yep.
[51:23] A: Right. And then he took his penis out of your. Yeah. And then he pulled his pants back.
[51:26] B: Yeah.
[51:27] A: And then you pulled your pants back up?
[51:28] B: No, I took baby wipes.
[51:29] A: You took baby wipes and cleaned. Right, Good. And then you pulled your pants back out. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[51:34] B: And then he followed me.
[51:36] A: And then you got.
[51:37] B: He walked me back to my room.
[51:38] A: Like, you walked back?
[51:40] B: Yeah.
[51:40] A: Right. And then that moment ended. Yeah. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun like see your daughter or.
[51:47] B: Drink a Mountain Dew that day? Yeah. Yes. Not later that day, but yeah.
[51:54] A: Yes. Conversations with Christine.
[51:56] B: Yes.
[51:56] A: Right. So we got having conversations with Christine. We got meeting White as. We got going to Sayla. We got seeing your daughter. We got drinking a Mountain Dew.
[52:03] B: Yep.
[52:04] A: Right. And then before that, like, you were back. And then he walked you back.
[52:07] B: Yeah.
[52:08] A: And then you had pulled your pants up. And then you had cleaned. And then he had pulled his pants back up. He took his penis out. He put his penis in. And then he had his pants down. Your pants down. And then he told you to do that. And then he said you couldn't leave as you got up a couple times. And then you were sitting there and he had pulled out a knife. And then before that, you'd gone to the alley. And then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing.
[52:27] B: Yeah.
[52:28] A: As we go backwards again, compared to forward, what do you notice? Right. You can remember him doing that, right? Right. You can remember putting your sneaks on, right? Sonny, stop putting on your sneaks.
[52:38] B: I don't know what you want.
[52:39] A: Right. Well, stop him from holding a knife.
[52:41] B: But it's not happening.
[52:42] A: Right. Well, then stop him from putting his penis in your pajamas. Right? Well, you stop putting on your shirt.
[52:47] B: Yeah, it's not happening.
[52:48] A: Right. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[52:50] B: It no longer exists.
[52:51] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. Right. And again, that happening. Was that about you?
[52:55] B: It wasn't about me.
[52:56] A: No. Right. You can remember him doing that, right? Right. You can also remember putting your hair up.
[53:01] B: Right?
[53:01] A: Well, stop putting your hair up. Well, then stop him from doing that.
[53:04] B: He's not doing that. Right.
[53:05] A: Where is it? Say it doesn't matter. Right. Now close your eyes. And again, picture the earlier you let her know that she's okay. Let her know she didn't get caught. Right. Let her know that you're okay. Right. Let her know that that stuff happened to her body, but he actually never touched you. Let her get. It's not about me. Right. Because that guy would have done that thing whether it was you or somebody else.
[53:30] B: Right?
[53:31] A: Right. So that she's getting. It's not about me. Right. And as the earlier you was getting it, what do you notice now?
[53:37] B: I feel better.
[53:41] A: Right. You do, don't you?
[53:43] B: Yeah.
[53:43] A: Isn't that cool?
[53:44] B: Yeah.
[53:44] A: Right. Right. Because what's starting to happen is your brain is re reading experiences as information. It's data about shit that happened. Right. Shit that happened to my body. But I'm not learning about me. Right? Right.
[54:07] B: Right.
[54:07] A: I may be learning about some actions I did, some behaviors I had, some shit that happened to me, some stuff that went down to my body. I may be learning what I was thinking back then or. Or not actually learning about you.
[54:20] B: Right?
[54:21] A: Right. Because who you are is Much more than any of the stuff that happened to you. Right. And again, as all of this is getting in, what's happening inside of you.
[54:35] B: I feel lighter. I feel better.
[54:37] A: You do, don't you?
[54:38] B: I'm more peaceful.
[54:39] A: You are more peaceful. Right, right. All this stuff is becoming more okay. Right. Not that it was okay that it happened, but you're more okay even though it did. Because that's the key thing about any of the stuff that has happened, unfortunately. And it would be way better if I had a wand and I could go, it never happened.
[54:59] B: Right.
[54:59] A: Like, that would be great.
[55:00] B: Right.
[55:01] A: But we can't get things to have not happened. So we can do the second best. Unplug it. Right. So it's data. So it stopped running that in me. Right. So again, as your jaw is slightly lowered and you're resting your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper and you're feeling lighter and more peaceful again, that other than conscious part is going to travel back down the timeline of experiences and brain another moment to your awareness to clear this one happened.
[55:32] B: When Can I talk about when I went? Like last weekend when I went to my house? I want to be able to that.
[55:40] A: Not bother me anymore. We do want that to not bother me.
[55:42] B: Yeah. I want to be able to go to my house.
[55:46] A: And we're on our way to that not bothering you.
[55:49] B: Okay.
[55:50] A: But see, that happened last weekend.
[55:52] B: Yeah.
[55:52] A: Right. So we know that there's a feeling tone.
[55:56] B: A what?
[55:57] A: A feeling tone.
[55:59] B: Okay.
[55:59] A: That you get so you can think about that feeling tone with Mom. You know how things change. Like, as soon as you walked in the house.
[56:08] B: Yeah.
[56:08] A: Then it was like, why am I giving you money? Why are you going to the gas station? Why do you want to go to the gas station? Why do you want to Mountain Dew about? What's that about?
[56:15] B: Right.
[56:15] A: What else are you going to do? Clearly, about just Mountain Dew. Right. Got the feeling.
[56:21] B: Yeah.
[56:21] A: Good. Close your eyes and let the feeling take you back. Let the feeling grow you earlier and younger.
[56:31] B: What does that mean?
[56:32] A: Let it take you back in time to another time where you had that same kind of feeling when you were much, much younger than now. Right. Let the feeling tone take you back, back.
[56:56] B: Back.
[57:01] A: Right. And it's going to guide you back towards one of the first times you had that kind of a feeling. You know what's coming to mind now?
[57:18] B: When I felt that same exact way.
[57:20] A: Similar way to that. If it's earlier, younger, younger, earlier.
[57:27] B: It's all when I was at my sister's house before we moved there. But it all had to do when I was on drugs.
[57:33] A: Uh huh. And maybe even before then.
[57:38] B: Maybe. I don't know.
[57:40] A: Right. You don't know. But watch what happens as the feeling grows you younger, takes you back. Cuz this thing that goes on with you, with mom isn't new.
[57:54] B: Right?
[57:56] A: Right. But part of the mechanism is mom being that way means stuff about me.
[58:04] B: Okay.
[58:07] A: Or she doesn't trust me, or she doesn't believe me, or she doesn't think I'm changing or.
[58:13] B: Right.
[58:14] A: But it feels like it's about me.
[58:17] B: Okay.
[58:18] A: You know, it's mom's stuff. You know, logically, it's mom's worry about you using and that she doesn't want you to use because that was a real problem for you.
[58:34] B: Right. Okay.
[58:38] A: So you get the feeling of what it's like to be with mom when she's like up your ass.
[58:44] B: Okay.
[58:45] A: About that stuff.
[58:47] B: Okay.
[58:48] A: Got the feeling what I feel like when she feel the feeling. Like, think about being at the house last weekend.
[58:55] B: Okay.
[58:56] A: And mom being like, why are you going? We're cheaper.
[58:59] B: Right. Right.
[59:02] A: Got the feeling. We'll give you $2.50 because that's all.
[59:05] B: You need for a yes. I have the feeling.
[59:08] A: Got the feeling. Good. Close your eyes. Let the feeling slide back. Growing you younger and earlier. Back towards one of the first times you had that kind of a feeling. Younger, Earlier. Earlier you. Younger you. Which may or may not have to do with mom. But the feeling tone, as the feeling tone guides you back, it'll bring another experience to mind.
[59:44] B: Oh, I got nothing.
[59:46] A: And you might think, what does that have to do with anything?
[59:53] B: I don't. I know the family is that she's like, you'll never change. But I can't remember other time other than I wasn't on when I had an alcohol problem in my 20s.
[60:08] A: Mm. And probably even before then. See, I'm thinking this construct goes way back. Like maybe it's the feeling I'm not as good as. Or I'm not good enough. Or I'll never do it right for her. I'll never be enough for her.
[60:29] B: Yeah.
[60:30] A: I'll never be who she wants me to be.
[60:32] B: Yeah.
[60:33] A: I'll never live up to her expectations. Can't ever do it all that kind of feeling. Because that's the same kind of feeling that comes from. Oh. She doesn't think. Think I'm ever gonna change.
[60:44] B: Right.
[60:47] A: Right. So as that travels back and it takes you younger, probably earlier than 20.
[60:53] B: Yeah.
[60:54] A: It was like maybe into your teens.
[60:56] B: Yeah.
[60:57] A: Yeah. Maybe even younger than that. But there's gonna be a moment that comes to mind.
[61:04] B: Okay. It was. I was like, 13.
[61:07] A: Yeah. You got one, don't you?
[61:08] B: Yeah. You're not my daughter.
[61:10] A: So, like, you're 13. You're where?
[61:13] B: @ our house.
[61:13] A: So you're at your house. Good. And like, are you in your bedroom or in the kitchen or living room or dining room?
[61:18] B: We're in the backyard.
[61:19] A: So you're in the backyard. Good. And it's afternoon, evening, daytime, morning. It's like afternoon, afternoon. Right. And like, are you like on the grass or.
[61:29] B: She was like, clipping. Clipping the hedges. And I was standing outside talking to her. She was mad at me that I wasn't helping her.
[61:38] A: Right. So she was up there clipping the head. You're just standing there at 13.
[61:42] B: Yeah.
[61:42] A: This sucks. I don't want to be doing.
[61:43] B: I don't want to be doing this. Exactly.
[61:45] A: Yeah. Neither does she. But she's doing it anyway because she's the adult. Right, right, right. And then what happened? She said.
[61:52] B: And then we ended up getting an argument. And she's like, you're not my daughter. Because I didn't want to help her because I was explaining to her that this sucks.
[61:58] A: Right.
[61:59] B: And then she didn't have to do it either.
[62:01] A: Right. Good. Right. Why do you have to do it, Mom?
[62:03] B: Right. They're just freaking hedges.
[62:05] A: Right? Yeah, but the hedges need to look a certain way.
[62:07] B: But why? No, they don't. You're doing this for no reason.
[62:10] A: I'm doing it cuz I like how they look.
[62:13] B: Okay, whatever.
[62:14] A: Right.
[62:14] B: But then why do I have to do it? Let me go do something else.
[62:17] A: Cuz you're my kid. You have to do the sucky.
[62:21] B: Yep. And then she's like, you're not my daughter. And I remember getting really like.
[62:24] A: So she's like, you're not my daughter. Yeah, right. In that angry way. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[62:33] B: I think I just went inside and didn't bother to.
[62:35] A: And then you went inside.
[62:37] B: Yeah. I don't really remember what I did after that.
[62:39] A: Right. Is our mind always stops right there.
[62:42] B: Yeah. Like, I don't really remember what. It was.
[62:45] A: Crazy. Right. But then that moment ended. And then later on, you did something more fun, like see your daughter.
[62:51] B: No, I was 13.
[62:52] A: I know, but later on you just.
[62:54] B: Oh, later on in my life. Yeah. Yeah.
[62:55] A: Yes. Right. Or you came here.
[62:57] B: Or I came here.
[62:58] A: Right, Right. Or you, you know, talk to Christine.
[63:03] B: Yes.
[63:03] A: Right.
[63:05] B: Yep.
[63:06] A: Right. You met other people in programming.
[63:08] B: Yep.
[63:08] A: Right. So we got Meeting the other people, got talking to Christine. We got seeing your daughter and I'm mountain deer. Right. And then before that you had gone inside.
[63:18] B: Yeah.
[63:18] A: And then she's like, I'm not. You're not my daughter. They're like, why are we having to even do this? It's stupid. I hate it. So hot. It's just shrubs, nobody cares. And then she's out there cutting the shrubs in the heat and pissed she's even doing it. Right. And then you'd gone outside to see mom. Right. And then before that you're doing whatever you're doing. Right. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[63:41] B: But not as bad, right?
[63:43] A: You can remember her saying that?
[63:45] B: Yeah.
[63:45] A: You can remember putting your sweatpants on. Sanda, stop putting on your sweatpants.
[63:50] B: I'm not putting my sweatpants on.
[63:51] A: Well then stop her from saying that.
[63:52] B: I can't.
[63:53] A: She's not saying that. Right. Well you stop putting on your watch.
[63:57] B: Not putting on my.
[63:58] A: Well, stop her from saying that.
[63:59] B: She's not saying that.
[64:00] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[64:02] B: It no longer exists.
[64:03] A: Right. Mom saying that. Was that about you?
[64:06] B: No, no.
[64:07] A: Was that about you not being her daughter?
[64:09] B: No.
[64:10] A: No.
[64:11] B: I don't know what that was about.
[64:12] A: It was about her whatever the hell was going on with her that day. Yep, got it. But you didn't know that then. Right. So close your eyes, think of that 13 year old you and let her know first the moment is over, that it no longer exists. And that mom saying that had to deal with whatever was going on with mom that day. It's not about me.
[64:35] B: Right. It's not about me.
[64:36] A: So that the earlier you gets it. Let the earlier you know that moment has something off with her too. Right. That mom's not always 100% mentally, emotionally well. Right, Right. So that she gets it right. As the earlier you is getting. It's not about me. What do you notice happening to her face?
[65:06] B: I don't really see it anymore.
[65:08] A: Yeah, you don't. No. And that you doesn't look so troubled. Cuz now as you think about it, remembering mom saying that, what do you notice?
[65:17] B: It was just really crazy. They're just words. It just. It was just not bad.
[65:23] A: Right.
[65:24] B: Just a touchy out.
[65:26] A: Right, Right.
[65:27] B: But we all get mad. So it's not.
[65:29] A: We do.
[65:29] B: It's not like personal.
[65:32] A: Right, Right. And again, as this starts to get.
[65:36] B: In, I feel a little bit better.
[65:40] A: You do?
[65:41] B: Oh, a lot better actually.
[65:42] A: Just a little bit. Right. So think about mom Think about last weekend.
[65:50] B: Yeah.
[65:51] A: And what are you noticing?
[65:53] B: I think I'd be alright. I think I'm not that person.
[65:56] A: What do you notice about. Remember her saying it? Okay, why are you wanting to go to the the gas station so bad? Why do you need Mon to do so? Right, right. What are you doing? I got to give you money. What are you going to use drugs for?
[66:11] B: $2.50? Yes, mom, you going to use drugs?
[66:14] A: I mean, heroin, I heard is cheap, right?
[66:17] B: Yeah. Yeah, right. That's so silly.
[66:23] A: And what do you notice what's happening inside of you as you're hearing her say that stuff right now?
[66:30] B: It's not really bothering me.
[66:31] A: I'm taking it personal. Right. Who are we learning about?
[66:36] B: That's her thing.
[66:37] A: Yeah. And what are we learning about Mom?
[66:40] B: She doesn't know how much drugs we're about to cause.
[66:43] A: And what else are we learning about Mom?
[66:47] B: She just worries.
[66:48] A: Yeah. She's scared.
[66:49] B: Yeah, right.
[66:51] A: She doesn't want me to use. She wants me to be okay. Right, Right. You're learning that mom wants you to be okay.
[67:00] B: Right, Right.
[67:02] A: That mom saying that has to do with mom's love and care and worry.
[67:08] B: Right?
[67:09] A: Right.
[67:10] B: And it's not her attacking me.
[67:13] A: Right. So as you're checking it out now, what do you notice? Because again, close your eyes. Picture yourself being there. You guys drove all the way up there, you talked about like, oh, cool, I'm gonna be able to get a mountain deuce. I don't get to have any soda or sugar or any of that kind of stuff. Right. When you get in, you walk into the house and you're thinking, okay, now that we're here, we're just gonna walk down the street a little ways to the gas station to be able to get Mountain Dew. Daughter and I can go for the walk. She's like, why do you want to go so bad now? You just got here. Why do you have to leave already?
[67:41] B: Right.
[67:41] A: You need to go. Why do you. Why do you have to go get a Mountain Dew? Why? I don't know if I should give you money for Mountain Dew.
[67:47] B: Those are like her triggers.
[67:49] A: Like, what else are you gonna be doing when you walk to the grocery store or the gas station? And as you're hearing it, what are you noticing?
[67:57] B: She's just worried.
[67:59] A: Yeah.
[67:59] B: Like, I almost feel bad for her.
[68:01] A: Right? No. Oh, isn't that weird? Right? Right. Which as I'm feeling bad, I might say, yeah. Oh, yeah. Mom, you're probably worried that, like I'm gonna go use. I really appreciate Your care.
[68:13] B: Yeah. I feel bad for her. Is that bad for me?
[68:16] A: Isn't that interesting? Cause what I'm hearing is mom's care and love for me now.
[68:25] B: Right.
[68:25] A: Which is different than what I was hearing, period.
[68:27] B: Yeah.
[68:28] A: Uh huh.
[68:29] B: Yeah. This feels better.
[68:30] A: Right? Right.
[68:32] B: Than before those feeling.
[68:35] A: Right. So we're rewiring how your brain interacts with your world.
[68:43] B: Okay.
[68:44] A: The only reason that we want to unplug the effect that stuff has had is that it's negatively affecting now.
[68:54] B: Right?
[68:55] A: Right. Like if you were thinking, feeling, acting, reacting totally the way that you want to, and life was working totally the way that you want it to, would we care about any of the crap that happened to you? Oh, no. The only reason we do is that we recognize that it's been negatively affecting now. Right. That's what we want better. We want you to have more freedom and ease as you interact with mom, as you see your daughter. We want you to have more freedom to powerfully choose what's best for you. Not to feel forced that I can't because of what it does to me.
[69:37] B: Right.
[69:37] A: Got it? Yeah, got it. So again, you slightly lower your jaw and you rest your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper. That's right. And exhaling a little bit longer. Notice. Notice what's happening in your body. Become aware of more of the space around you. As you notice more of the space again, another moment is gonna be brought to your awareness which may or may not have anything to do with mom. It's gonna be one of those moments that we try not to think about. Because when we do, we feel bad. Right. As we're organizing towards your becoming more free and okay in you. Right. That other part travels back and will bring another experience to mind. Yeah.
[70:32] B: I don't know if it's something that really.
[70:34] A: No, you just got one. Oh, definitely evaluate the one that came to mind. It's like somehow this might not be the right one. This might not be the right. Because here's the cool part. Your unconscious doesn't know more than you do.
[70:45] B: Right.
[70:45] A: I mean. Right.
[70:48] B: Okay, fine.
[70:49] A: So perfect.
[70:50] B: It just doesn't sound as traumatizing the rest of this.
[70:54] A: Isn't it interesting? This one happened when you might have been how old?
[70:59] B: No, I was 35 years ago.
[71:02] A: Right. You're aware. And what happened?
[71:04] B: I was at my dad's apartment complex.
[71:08] A: Chair. Your dad's apartment complex.
[71:10] B: And sitting on the stairs.
[71:11] A: Yes. Right. Talk to detail. Right.
[71:14] B: And I was crying.
[71:16] A: Yes.
[71:17] B: Cuz the. Like we were engaged at the time.
[71:20] A: Yes.
[71:21] B: I found out that like, he left me. Like, he broke up with me. He left me for some chick at the park.
[71:26] A: Right. So the guy that you were engaged to left me, said, I'm out going with this chick at the park. Yep. Right.
[71:33] B: And I just remember the like.
[71:35] A: And then you were crying. Right. It was really sad. Right. And you were crying. Right. And then what happened? Because you just found out.
[71:45] B: Yeah.
[71:46] A: How'd you find out that he left you for the girl in the park?
[71:48] B: He told me on the phone.
[71:50] A: He's like, hey, by the way, I'm with a girl in the park and I've left you. Yeah.
[71:53] B: Like, I knew it was coming. Like he like fessed up like that day.
[71:56] A: Oh. That he had been screwing around with this girl. Right.
[72:00] B: And that he in fact was now choosing this.
[72:02] A: Right. He was going with her. I mean. Cause, you know, girls in the park are the ones that I would always choose.
[72:08] B: Right. That's what even sucked for. Because like, you couldn't even upgrade, dude. Like, that's it. Like, what's wrong with me? They're like, you.
[72:15] A: Oh, isn't that funny that you meant what's wrong with me? Right. Versus what's wrong with him? Right. Right. So then you're crying. Right. And then what happened next?
[72:24] B: I think I went to go look for drugs.
[72:26] A: Right. Good.
[72:27] B: And then I ended up in a bad situation, so.
[72:29] A: Well, then what happened?
[72:30] B: Bad.
[72:31] A: So you went looking for drugs.
[72:32] B: Yeah, I went to go look for drugs.
[72:33] A: Right. And then what happened to the gas station at the Mountain Dew?
[72:38] B: No.
[72:39] A: Right. So you went looking for drugs. Right.
[72:42] B: And I ended up like.
[72:43] A: So you found them.
[72:45] B: Yeah.
[72:45] A: Or at least found somebody who had them.
[72:46] B: Yep.
[72:47] A: Right.
[72:49] B: And then I like disappeared for nine.
[72:50] A: Days and then like, you used them. Yep. With that person.
[72:54] B: Yep.
[72:54] A: And we're gone.
[72:55] B: Yep.
[72:55] A: Right. And then you came resurfaced.
[72:57] B: Yep.
[72:58] A: Right. It's good. Magic trick. Tada.
[73:00] B: Tada. Yeah.
[73:01] A: And then what happened next?
[73:05] B: Everything was okay after that.
[73:06] A: And then that was over.
[73:07] B: And that was over again later on.
[73:09] A: You did something, you know, more enjoyable.
[73:11] B: Yep.
[73:11] A: Right. Like, you know, make iced coffee.
[73:14] B: Make iced coffee.
[73:15] A: Right. Ground the beans. Right.
[73:17] B: I don't know if that was more enjoyable. Yeah, it was more.
[73:18] A: Probably more enjoyable, but good. So we got ground in the beans. We got, you know, making the coffee. Right. Then before that, like, you had resurfaced and then you're gone for those days and then you've been using and then you found the guy who had him and then you went looking for him and then you were crying and then he told you. Yeah, no, I'm with the girl in the park. Yeah, Right. And then you had been thinking he had been doing stuff.
[73:39] B: Yeah.
[73:40] A: Right. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[73:42] B: Yep.
[73:43] A: And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it you can remember him doing that and telling you that you remember putting your sneakers on, Right? Well, stop putting on your sneakers. We'll stop him from telling you that he's the. Well, then stop him from doing that he's the one. Well, then you stop doing that.
[73:58] B: I'm not.
[73:59] A: Well, yeah. So then where is it?
[74:00] B: It's not happening.
[74:01] A: It no longer exists. That's right. It's not happening. It no longer exists. Right. And again, is. This is getting in.
[74:09] B: I feel like childish that. That.
[74:11] A: I don't know. Well, check that. Earlier you was thinking him choosing her. It's something to do with you. Did it have to do with you?
[74:20] B: No, I don't think so.
[74:22] A: Well, let's just. Let's just check a couple things. So when we're little children, we get choices. Right. And the two choices for ice cream tend to be chocolate or vanilla, Right?
[74:34] B: Right.
[74:34] A: And if you're a kid and you have to pick, which one do you want? Do you want the chocolate or the vanilla?
[74:38] B: Vanilla.
[74:39] A: Does that mean there's something wrong with chocolate?
[74:43] B: I guess not.
[74:44] A: No. No. It just means that you have a preference. Could it be one day that you pick vanilla? Pick vanilla. Pick vanilla, and then today you pick chocolate?
[74:51] B: Yeah.
[74:52] A: Does that mean that there was something wrong with vanilla?
[74:54] B: No.
[74:55] A: Or did your preference change your preference? Right. If somebody bought a Toyota Camry and then the next car they bought was a Honda Accord.
[75:02] B: Right.
[75:03] A: Does it mean that there was something wrong with the Camry?
[75:06] B: No.
[75:06] A: No. If they had a blue car and then bought a white car, does it mean there was something wrong with blue?
[75:11] B: Not necessarily.
[75:12] A: No. It just means their preference changed. Right, Right.
[75:17] B: Right.
[75:17] A: What you didn't know when that happened back then is that preferences change.
[75:23] B: Right?
[75:23] A: Right. That have nothing to do with you. It has to do with them and their preference. Right, Right.
[75:32] B: Yep.
[75:34] A: Got it. That earlier you didn't know that. So close your eyes and picture her. Let her know that moment's over. Finish that it no longer exists. Let her know that it's probably better that she's not married to him now. Right. Let her know that it had to do with his preference and not you. Right. So that the earlier you gets it. Right. And as the earlier you is getting it, what do you notice?
[76:04] B: I Feel better?
[76:06] A: You do? Right? Isn't that a good news then? So part of what's starting to happen, and this is a key thing and a big thing for all people, but even more so when we have sucky stuff that happens, is the camera lens is getting reversed. So currently the camera lens has been pointing in at me where I'm feeling like other people's crap is about me.
[76:35] B: Right.
[76:36] A: Well, now the camera lens is starting to get adjusted outwardly. So now I'm able to accurately read other people's stuff as being about them. And I might be learning about them, and I might be learning about how they're feeling about something I said or did or what I could or might do, but I'm learning about them. See? Notice what's starting to happen as you already knew it here, but didn't feel it here. As you think about mom being concerned about you using. Right. Notice what am I learning and learning about mom? What am I learning about mom? I'm learning about mom's concern for my well being.
[77:21] B: Right?
[77:22] A: Right.
[77:23] B: And it's just him and his preferences.
[77:25] A: Not whether I'm gonna go use drugs or not.
[77:28] B: Right.
[77:28] A: I'm worried about mom's concern, not whether mom believes me or not.
[77:34] B: Right.
[77:35] A: I'm still worried about. I'm still learning about mom's concern. Right. And probably mom shouldn't believe me at this stage of the game because there's been numerous times where I'm like, no, man, I'm never gonna use them again. Oh, accept that next time.
[77:54] B: Right.
[77:58] A: Right. Because you had told me the first time we got together, there was a time that like, you were good, you got yourself clean, clear, sober, you went back living at home and then all of a sudden it felt like I was back in purgatory and. And found myself doing it again. Yeah, got it.
[78:10] B: Yeah. I'm getting better though, like each time I go home. Cuz like this time I went home and I was able to recognize like instead of just getting mad at her, I'm like, wait, those are her triggers. Like I'm triggering her to act that way. Cuz we were fine before we came to the door. You know what I mean? So it had nothing to do like with me.
[78:27] A: Whereas before I was like, you're now learning that it's not about you, but what's now starting to learn is it's being embodied. So it's not just what I know, it's also how I feel. Okay, because you knew it was her stuff, but it was still feeling icky.
[78:45] B: Right? Yeah.
[78:48] A: Got it now, as we think about it. Just check. Is it feeling icky?
[78:52] B: No.
[78:53] A: Right.
[78:54] B: No.
[78:54] A: Notice how that's different than it was, Right?
[78:59] B: That's true. That's true.
[79:07] A: And that's happening because your brain is getting its data.
[79:11] B: Okay?
[79:12] A: It's able to emotionally see shit. It's. For what it is, not about me.
[79:17] B: Not about me.
[79:20] A: Mm. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. All right. I'm gonna use the restroom again.
[79:30] B: Okay.
[79:30] A: I'll be back.
[79:31] B: Okay.
[79:31] A: Give me one second. Yeah. So let's just check. Think about the stuff that we've talked about so far.
[79:36] B: Okay.
[79:37] A: Right. So think about the thing that happened three years ago. Right. Where the whole video being out. Right. Think of that. Think about the thing that happened in the alley. Okay. Right. Think about the thing that happened when you were 13.
[79:50] B: Okay.
[79:51] A: Anything about the recent thing with Mom.
[79:53] B: Okay.
[79:54] A: As you're thinking about all of it right now, what do you notice?
[79:58] B: That I don't feel bad, but my first instinct was to think about it backwards. Yeah.
[80:04] A: Huh. And you don't actually feel bad.
[80:06] B: Right? Right. You told me to think about it, and I thought about it backwards. And therefore, I don't have, like, a.
[80:12] A: Well, even if you think about it forward, just remember being in the alleyway.
[80:16] B: Yeah.
[80:16] A: And, like, trying to get up. I'm gonna. No, no, you can't leave.
[80:20] B: Right. No, it's not. It's not.
[80:22] A: Right.
[80:23] B: I don't feel it like that.
[80:25] A: Right. Notice how different that is.
[80:29] B: Right?
[80:29] A: Right. And different than it ever was.
[80:32] B: It feels like I'm looking at it. I don't know if you trained my brain to look at that way subconsciously, but I felt like when you just said think about it like that in all those situations, I wasn't, like, my first instinct to think about it. It looked like I was looking at it from, like, a third person perspective. Like, I could see myself in that situation.
[80:49] A: Right.
[80:50] B: But the first time I said it to you, I was, like, in it. In it?
[80:53] A: Yeah. You were looking through your own eyes. Yeah. Versus watching it on it.
[80:57] B: Yeah. Like, it being somebody else now. Like, right now, if I make the connection again, if I, like, think about the situation of, like, let me empathize with that person. Like, then I feel it that I would start crying again. But, like, my first instinct would when to think about it. Is it to automatically.
[81:12] A: Well, would you start crying if I like it?
[81:15] B: Yeah.
[81:16] A: If you put yourself in the picture again and you're, like, looking through your own eyes and, like, you're actually in the alleyway seeing him in the night, looking through your own eyes.
[81:27] B: No, see, now, I would have to. Like you said, I. It'd be cool if you could, like, make yourself do it. Then I would be making myself do it.
[81:33] A: Yeah. Try.
[81:35] B: Well, if I tried, I would cry.
[81:36] A: No, I don't know whether you would.
[81:38] B: I know I would.
[81:39] A: Well, try.
[81:39] B: No, I don't want to try.
[81:41] A: Well, this would be the time to try.
[81:42] B: Why?
[81:43] A: Well, because we want to have an experience of that. It's very different than it was. See, normally you would try not to think about it because whenever you did think about it, you felt bad.
[81:56] B: Okay.
[81:56] A: I'm asking you on purpose.
[81:58] B: Okay.
[81:59] A: Remember it. Think about it. Try to really feel that. Okay. I don't.
[82:06] B: I hate you.
[82:07] A: No, you don't.
[82:07] B: No, I don't. I really did. Like, I don't know, because if I would cry now, that would feel like I'm forcing myself to cry where before it came, really.
[82:15] A: Right. You're not. Right. Yeah. Right. We can still not like it. We can still feel bad if it was somebody else in that same situation. We don't like that it happened. Right. But it's not causing that in you anymore.
[82:27] B: Right. That's weird.
[82:29] A: You're not ready to cry.
[82:31] B: Right?
[82:32] A: You're not ready to cry because your brain knows its data. It's over. You survived it. You're okay.
[82:40] B: Yeah.
[82:41] A: Yeah.
[82:42] B: That's awesome.
[82:44] A: Yeah. So one of the things that you talked about is sometimes I just kind of go along with what others want.
[82:50] B: Yes.
[82:51] A: Right. Like, I can maybe be or influenced or. Some of that happened with trafficking person. Some of that sometimes bleeds in with mom stuff or I have to know.
[83:01] B: What'S going on outside to know how to navigate. Like, they say this thing a lot at the program. Right. I need to know how everybody else is doing in order to know how to. I need to know the weather outside in order to navigate how I act inside the house. Well, I'm not in the rain, so what difference does it make? What difference? You know, like, what the weather is outside. But for whatever reason, I need to know this. And I think, like, Christy told me, like, that served me before. Right. Like, knowing how everybody else felt and what everybody else was doing that served me in my past, like, while I was being trafficked, because that's how I survived. But, like, now that doesn't serve me. So how do I let that go? Like, I don't need to know how somebody else is doing in order to go about my day.
[83:50] A: Right.
[83:51] B: Whereas before I. Like, that was like, a need of mine.
[83:54] A: Good. So let's think of a time when you really felt like you needed to know what was going on outside in order for you to be okay inside. Right. Because you said served me right. So check it out. It's not that we want to get rid of anything that serves you.
[84:14] B: Okay.
[84:15] A: Okay. We want to keep it.
[84:17] B: Right.
[84:18] A: What we want though is we want to have a way to turn it. Meaning turn the intensity of it.
[84:27] B: Okay.
[84:29] A: Adjust how odd it is. Right. Would it be fun to listen to the radio if all it came on was full blast all the time?
[84:37] B: No.
[84:40] A: Isn't it nice sometimes to turn it down so I just want it in the background. But if a song comes and I want to sing to it, I can.
[84:46] B: Also turn it up. Right.
[84:49] A: And then I can be singing this on. And then if it's another song that comes off, I can turn it off. If it's something else. Oh, I want to listen to, I can turn it on.
[84:57] B: Right.
[84:58] A: And I can turn it. And I have range with it.
[85:00] B: Right.
[85:01] A: So it's not about getting rid of anything that serves you.
[85:03] B: Okay. I think I'm learning how to do that tuning thing.
[85:06] A: It's about being able to tune it. Right. But let's think of situation where you might be in where you felt like you really need to know the temperature of everyone else in order to know whether I'm okay. Right. Got that feeling like I'm kind of like a little not quite sure of myself cuz like I'm needing to figure out what's going on over there and.
[85:30] B: Yeah. But I. I mean I had a moment like that recently.
[85:33] A: Oh good. Just get the feeling down. Content is not the issue.
[85:36] B: The content is not the issue.
[85:38] A: Yeah. Just feel it.
[85:39] B: Okay.
[85:39] A: Feel the discomfort.
[85:40] B: Okay.
[85:41] A: Got the feeling.
[85:42] B: Yep.
[85:42] A: Good. Close your eyes and let the feeling guide you back.
[85:47] B: Okay.
[85:48] A: Let the feeling grow you back.
[85:52] B: Okay.
[85:52] A: So it takes you back to an earlier moment.
[85:55] B: Okay.
[85:56] A: And what comes to mind?
[85:58] B: Every moment with my mom.
[85:59] A: Uh huh. Well, let's think of a moment younger you. Earlier, younger you.
[86:05] B: Oh, it's like way back when I was little.
[86:07] A: Right, Good. That's it. So you might have been how old and what might have happened?
[86:16] B: I mean, we can use that same example.
[86:18] A: Well, even earlier than 30.
[86:24] B: Okay. I was like six.
[86:26] A: Yes. Beautiful. You're doing great.
[86:28] B: Maybe.
[86:29] A: Yeah.
[86:29] B: Like five or six.
[86:30] A: Yeah. And what happened? You're where and what happened?
[86:32] B: I was at my house.
[86:33] A: So you're at your house, Right? Good.
[86:34] B: Yep.
[86:35] A: And you're inside or outside?
[86:37] B: Inside.
[86:37] A: Right.
[86:39] B: And I was trying to Tell my mom something. I don't remember what it was.
[86:43] A: So you're trying to tell mom something.
[86:45] B: But I was stuttering.
[86:46] A: Right.
[86:47] B: And she yelled at me.
[86:49] A: Right? She yelled.
[86:53] B: Right. And I don't remember what she yelled.
[86:55] A: Right.
[86:55] B: I remember thinking, like, why is she mad at me? And not knowing why she was mad at me.
[86:59] A: Good job. Right. And then what happened next?
[87:02] B: And then I don't remember.
[87:06] A: I know, because mine likes to stop the story at the shitty spot again. Right. And eventually, maybe I was able to share it with mom, or I'd not, but either way, that moment ended.
[87:16] B: Yeah.
[87:17] A: Right. And then later on, I did something more fun, like grind coffee beans. Right. And make a nice coffee. Right? So we got making nice coffee. We got grind coffee beans. Then you're off doing whatever you're doing. And then, like, you weren't sure why she was all upset, and then she had yelled at you, and then you're trying to tell her something, and then you would, like, have the thing that you wanted to share with them. And then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it? Right. You can remember mom being that way. Y'all know you can remember putting your shirt on?
[87:51] B: Yep. It's not happening now.
[87:53] A: No. Hurry. Stop putting on your shirt.
[87:56] B: It's not happening.
[87:57] A: Right. Well, stop putting on your sneaks.
[87:59] B: It's not happening.
[88:00] A: Right. Well, stop me from putting on my sneaks.
[88:02] B: You're not putting them.
[88:03] A: Well, then stop mom from yelling.
[88:04] B: I can't.
[88:05] A: She's not yelling. Right. So then where is it? Saint no longer exists.
[88:08] B: It no longer exists.
[88:09] A: Mom's yelling, was that about you or her?
[88:12] B: About her.
[88:13] A: Yeah. You didn't know that then? See, back then, it felt like mom being that way was about you. Right? Right. What we're learning is that it was about Mom. And what are we learning about Mom?
[88:31] B: That she just gets nervous.
[88:33] A: Yeah. And is mom somebody who's mentally emotionally stable? Well, all the time.
[88:40] B: Not all the time.
[88:41] A: She isn't, is she? Mom's probably got her own stuff. Right? Mom's probably got her own traumas.
[88:49] B: Yeah.
[88:50] A: Right. Mom was pretty, like, controlling and domineering. Right. You know what mom wasn't doing for you? She wasn't creating what we call agency. Ever heard that term before? Agency means I have the ability to do shit on my own.
[89:10] B: Okay.
[89:10] A: That I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, I can handle shit and do stuff on my own.
[89:16] B: Right.
[89:17] A: Mom wasn't building agency. Right. And mom was Building dependency.
[89:24] B: Yeah, for sure.
[89:27] A: And then I had to walk on eggshells because I wasn't sure how mom was gonna be. Some days mom would be fine when I came home. Some days mom wouldn't be fine. But I wasn't sure which mom I was gonna get. And I never knew from moment to moment which mom I was gonna get. I could get the caring mom or I could yell at me mom.
[89:43] B: Right.
[89:44] A: And I never knew what I was gonna get.
[89:46] B: Right. So depending on what mood she was in, I would know, I would know how to like go about my day. Like, if she was in a good mood, then I could ask her. If she was in a loving mood, then I could like. But then if she was in a bad mood, I would know not to like.
[90:00] A: Right.
[90:01] B: Put off my stuff. So I had to know how she was doing in order for me to be.
[90:05] A: That's what it felt like then, didn't it?
[90:07] B: All the time.
[90:08] A: Right, right. But that made you feel like it was about me. Mom's mood was about me because it was about.
[90:21] B: No, like, the cause of her mood was not about me. But her mood very much influenced, like, affected me. Her mood affected me.
[90:27] A: It affected when you could share what with her.
[90:30] B: Right.
[90:30] A: So yesterday I had the conversation with my 14 year old because my wife takes my 14 year old to school and I take the 10 year old. The 10 year old goes to school earlier. 14 year old complain sometimes that my wife isn't ready when she's ready to go.
[90:44] B: Okay.
[90:45] A: My wife complains sometimes that the 14 year old isn't ready when she's ready to go. So they've got the same complaint. So at, you know, God bless you. Right. 9:45, 10:00 at night, the daughter's telling her when to go when she wants to go. Well, I want to leave at 8:15, but I really mean 8:30 because you're never ready by 8:15. Oh, is that how we're gonna play it? My wife gets all like, upset now. My wife has got a back that's hurting. She's in a. And then like, she's upset. So now my daughter's upset.
[91:16] B: Okay.
[91:18] A: And I shared with my daughter, I go, it's a timing issue, sweetie. 10:00 at night isn't the time to stick it to mom that you're not ready.
[91:28] B: Right.
[91:29] A: When I'm ready. Not the timing to have that conversation, not the right time. Right. And I learned that about my wife. Like I would go away and once a year I go with college buddies to a Trip, we go see a rock concert or a baseball game. We play around the golf. We go to a different city, and it's fun.
[91:47] B: Okay.
[91:48] A: At the end of it, we plan what we're gonna do the following year.
[91:51] B: Okay.
[91:53] A: So I'll come home and my wife will ask me how it was, and I'll tell her all I was. And then next year we're gonna go to. And her looking at me is like, would he never want to be around us?
[92:05] B: So you don't tell her both things at once.
[92:07] A: You don't want to be around like you were just gone. Why are you going to be gone again? It's freaking a year from now.
[92:14] B: What are you talking about?
[92:16] A: So what I discovered is when I come home, because I've been gone, I can't tell her right away about when I'm going to go away again. I can make all those plans.
[92:24] B: Right, but you don't tell.
[92:25] A: But I can't have the conversation in the same moment. Right, Got it.
[92:30] B: Got it.
[92:31] A: So we learned some really useful tools to navigate mom. But the thing is that earlier you felt like mom having all of that was about me. Did that anything to do with you? No, no, it had to do with mom.
[92:44] B: Right.
[92:45] A: And Mom's mental health issues. Got it.
[92:50] B: Yep.
[92:51] A: And as we look at it clearly, as the adult that you are now, doesn't mom have certain mental health issues? A little bit high on the anxiety, A little bit over on the control?
[93:00] B: Yeah.
[93:02] A: A little bit domineering, you know, like. Like it's got to be my way or the highway all the time. Got it.
[93:11] B: Got it.
[93:11] A: Right. Close your eyes. Picture the younger you let her know that moment is over, that it no longer exists, and that mom being that way is about Mom. Right. Not about me. So that the earlier you gets it. Right. So that she begins to have more fluidity with where and when it's on and how much is on and knowing what's going on around her. Right. And again, as this gets in, what do you notice happening to the earlier you? There's a good breath. Feel better. You do, don't you? Right? Because that's part of the change that we're interested in having happen. Remember, it's not about getting rid of a tool that serves me well. It's about having the tool on when it's useful for the tool to be on, not on when it's not, and a range of how much it's on based on circumstance and situation. Right, Got it.
[94:20] B: Got it.
[94:21] A: Yeah. So again, think about, you know, being at the house recently. Right. And kind of feeling like you gotta like, you know, check the temperature of everybody. Like, who am I gonna be now with?
[94:37] B: Right.
[94:38] A: And what do you notice?
[94:40] B: I don't really feel like I need to. I need to focus on myself.
[94:46] A: Right. And you're still gonna notice over there, but you're gonna be noticing over there is it's about them. And see, this is the cool part. When it starts to be about them, then we have friends, freedom and flexibility in how I respond. Because sometimes based on who it is and what it's about, I might respond with some care, concern, compassion, love. At other times I might respond with very firm and directness. At other times it might go, bye. Okay. Because it's got no stick. Because it's not about me. Right. So when I'm learning about other people, let's say my daughter, I'm learning that she's like upset. And before it used to feel like her upset was about me. Well, now I'm learning that she's upset and maybe she's upset over something I said. Oh my goodness, sweetie, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize that that would be something that upset you. I might respond to it that way if she's upset at what I said. Well, yeah, then you need to make sure that you don't do this thing and then you won't be hearing this from me. Right. Like I told, I had my conversation with my 10 year old this morning. I'm like, your tonality with me has been very disrespectful. I don't want you to talk to me with that tone. So what do you need from me in order for you to not talk to me with that disrespectful tone? Right. I can respond that way.
[96:23] B: Right?
[96:24] A: I can respond. Yeah. That's why you're getting that, because you were disrespectful. Right, Got it.
[96:29] B: Right.
[96:29] A: I can go by right, because it's not about me, had nothing to do with me. It's their upset. She was upset over some other thing about it. Nothing for me to do about that. Right. That's the freedom that we want you to be having as you interact with others. And that's the part that you're going to start noticing for yourself. So with what we've done, what you're going to start noticing is, hey, certain things that normally would make me upset aren't making me upset. Or even if they do, it doesn't get so upset. It doesn't last as long. It's not Happening as frequent. So even if I do, it's less. Wait a minute. Now I'm seeing it more clearly. Huh? Now I'm kind of checking in me, because I'm learning about them, right? That I am developing. What I'm going to use the word is more agency. Meaning I'm developing more of that grounded centeredness that I'm good in me, that I have what I need to deal with, what is and what might come my way. Okay, got it. That I'm reading other people's stuff as being about them. Not everything is about me, right? Some of this shit is about them. It's their crap, Right? Right. And I'm learning that it's their crap. Right? And just check. What do you notice? Just even thinking about that right now, I feel better.
[98:01] B: I think a good look at things a lot. I think I'm gonna apply what you told me here today about some other stuff, too. Like, just think about it from a different.
[98:12] A: What might be another stuff, a different stuff that we haven't talked about that you have been thinking about applying.
[98:21] B: I don't know. I could probably think of more, like, scenario, like just anything.
[98:24] A: What's another scenario? Let's think of one of those.
[98:27] B: Um. Okay. Like when my. Like when my daughter acts a certain. No, but that's more than my daughter.
[98:43] A: And my mom.
[98:46] B: Like, their. Their interaction. Or sometimes my daughter, she can be very mean to me. And then I, you know, and then I, like, I personalize it. I'm like, okay, she's probably being that way because of something that I've done in the past.
[99:01] A: Let's think of something that she might say that's mean to you.
[99:05] B: Okay? Like the. Okay, so she came to Selah, and I was trying to tell her because she's, like, 12 now, so she's got, like, these boyfriends or whatever, right? And so I was like, telling her to be more careful, and she's like, well, that wouldn't happen. I told you this. That wouldn't happen to me because I wasn't high. Okay, you're right. You weren't. But you could be, right? Or, like, it could happen. So let's look at it from that point, right? Like, you're not. You're not mean.
[99:30] A: Right.
[99:30] B: And you're not high. But let's look at it from, like, that. That could be. And a lot of things. So, like, it's like. Or I'll tell her something and she doesn't hear it, and then, like, my friend will say it. Or like, one of the people at Salah will say it and all of a sudden, like it clicks and I'm like, I just said that.
[99:47] A: Right?
[99:47] B: So maybe it's not about.
[99:49] A: Right. Her not getting it from you isn't about you. It's about her being 12.
[99:54] B: Yeah, yeah. That. Not everything. Like, I think that she, like I, I all the time thinking she dismisses stuff because I've been like a bad parent.
[100:02] A: Like shit has happened to me.
[100:03] B: I feel like she just dismisses it because it's coming from me. But maybe it's not just because it's me.
[100:08] A: She's 12. Notice how you get the feeling.
[100:10] B: Yeah.
[100:11] A: Good. Close your eyes. Let that feeling tone guide you back. Let it guide you back and grow you younger. Cause now we're getting to the guilt over what you've been thinking in terms of having been a bad parent.
[100:27] B: Okay.
[100:28] A: What's it taking you towards? What's a moment?
[100:33] B: It's not really about me. It's maybe my mom being a bad parent. Like when I told her I was being judged, like what was happening to me, and she's like, you were high. That didn't happen. But it did happen. And I'm telling you, no, people don't do that. You, you put you on drugs.
[100:48] A: So. Right. So when is this happening? About how long ago?
[100:54] B: Like four years ago.
[100:55] A: Right. And you're telling her that I got trafficked? Well, no, cuz it was. You were high, right? Yes, but I was high and they were like doing stuff to me and my body.
[101:04] B: Yeah, no, people don't do that. You're just high.
[101:07] A: Right. So you can remember mom saying that. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[101:12] B: I don't know. She probably just gave up. Yelled at her, walked away.
[101:15] A: Right. And then that ended. And then later on you did something more fun. Like grinding coffee.
[101:19] B: Yep.
[101:21] A: So you're like grinding coffee and then you might yell at her and then she's like, yeah, no, that doesn't happen. You're like, yeah, but no, that they were like doing this stuff and they were doing this stuff to my body and. No, but it could. It was just. You were high. No, I know I was high. It's part of how they get people in this thing. Right. Because people when they're not high don't go. You know, it'd be really cool. I'd like to have strange people that I don't know do stuff to my body.
[101:44] B: Right, Right.
[101:44] A: Some of them might be okay. Some of them are like really disgusted that they're doing this stuff to my body.
[101:48] B: Yeah.
[101:49] A: And that's what I'd like. Give me more drug. Right, Right. So you can remember mom saying that?
[101:54] B: Yeah.
[101:54] A: Right. You can remember putting your shirt on. Well, stop putting on your shirt.
[101:58] B: I'm so happy right now.
[101:59] A: Right. Well, then stop mom from saying that.
[102:01] B: I can't.
[102:02] A: She's not saying that.
[102:03] B: Right, Right.
[102:05] A: Where is that moment? Say it no longer exists.
[102:07] B: It no longer exists.
[102:09] A: Does that have to do with mom not believing you?
[102:13] B: I don't know.
[102:13] A: Notice how it feels like it does.
[102:15] B: How it what?
[102:16] A: It feels like it does.
[102:17] B: Yeah.
[102:18] A: Have to do with mom not believing you?
[102:19] B: Yeah.
[102:20] A: Does it have to do with mom not believing you?
[102:23] B: No, I don't think so.
[102:24] A: Watch. Right here's what's gonna happen. It has to do with mom.
[102:30] B: Okay.
[102:32] A: And what it would mean about mom if that were to be true.
[102:39] B: Okay.
[102:41] A: That not only was her daughter using.
[102:44] B: Right.
[102:45] A: But she was also being trafficked.
[102:47] B: Right.
[102:49] A: One was her choice.
[102:52] B: Right.
[102:53] A: Using the other one was stuff that was happening to her.
[102:57] B: Right.
[102:58] A: Right. And what that would mean about me as a mom if that were to be true.
[103:04] B: Right? Right.
[103:08] A: Right.
[103:09] B: I feel bad for her.
[103:10] A: I remember working with this kid who. Who told mom that Uncle Tony molested me.
[103:17] B: Okay.
[103:18] A: And mom's response was, don't you dare lie about my brother. Fuck.
[103:25] B: Right.
[103:26] A: That's really the response. Like, fuck. It was so hurt.
[103:32] B: Right.
[103:33] A: Mom didn't say that because she didn't believe the kid. Mom said that because mom couldn't be with what it would mean about her.
[103:41] B: Right.
[103:43] A: If that was true, that her own brother was molesting her kid.
[103:46] B: Right.
[103:47] A: She can be with it.
[103:49] B: Right.
[103:49] A: Got it.
[103:50] B: Got it.
[103:53] A: Does mom have some, you know, religious slant to her at all?
[103:58] B: Yeah.
[104:01] A: Right. What that would mean there are, like, people out there that do that kind of stuff.
[104:06] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. She wouldn't like. Yeah.
[104:10] A: Do you follow me with that? So did it have to do with that she didn't believe you, or did it have to do with mom's own crap?
[104:16] B: Yeah, now I see that.
[104:18] A: Right. Good. Close your eyes. Picture the earlier you just after saying that stuff to mom and let. The earlier, you know, what you know now had nothing to do with me. Your mom's lack of belief in me had everything to do with that part. Being off with Mom. Mom's not well there. Right. So that the earlier you get to. It's not about me.
[104:39] B: Right.
[104:40] A: Right. There we go. And notice how it's getting in. Right. How's your body feeling now?
[104:52] B: Better.
[104:52] A: It is, isn't it? Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[104:57] B: Yeah.
[104:58] A: Right, Right. Because there's been lots of different things that happen to your body. There's lots of different things that people have done to your body. Some of it you're willing. Some of it you weren't so willing. But it all happened, right? Some of it was stuff that they had you do to them. Some of it was stuff that they did to you. Some of it was where they put different things within different parts of your body. Right. Some of it I was willing. Some of it I wasn't. Right? Like we got all that. Right? But here's the key thing. What if they never touched you?
[105:35] B: Right. I love the way you say that.
[105:37] A: What if they messed with your stuff, but they never got you? Right? I'm gonna show you something. Take your hand, hold it out like that. Look at that spot right there. As you look at that spot. Spot. I'm going to take my hand from here. Right? You stay looking there. I'm going to bring my hand closer. As my hand moves closer, you're going to notice it getting closer as you are. And then before it ever touches your hand, you're going to notice it. That's right. You can feel it.
[106:04] B: Okay.
[106:04] A: Isn't that cool that you can feel the warmth?
[106:08] B: Right?
[106:09] A: Right. This means I'm coming closer to touching who you really are.
[106:14] B: Okay.
[106:15] A: Than anybody that ever messed with your body or hurt your feelings. Because you can feel this.
[106:20] B: Right?
[106:21] A: Right? The touch. You can feel this because this touches with respect.
[106:25] B: Okay?
[106:25] A: Mutual admiration.
[106:27] B: Right?
[106:28] A: Got it?
[106:29] B: Yes.
[106:30] A: So we're joining. You don't have to have me touch your finger to feel it.
[106:37] B: Right?
[106:39] A: Right.
[106:40] B: That's cool.
[106:41] A: Isn't that cool? So watch now we'll set that down for a moment and just repeat these words. I have a nose.
[106:47] B: I have a nose.
[106:48] A: I have 10 fingers, two elbows and 10 toes. But I'm not my nose or my fingers or my elbows or my toes. Right? I have a vagina.
[107:01] B: I have a vagina.
[107:01] A: I'm not my vagina. It's totally mine.
[107:04] B: It's totally fine.
[107:04] A: But it isn't actually me.
[107:06] B: It's not me.
[107:07] A: Right?
[107:07] B: So they mess with my stuff, but not me.
[107:10] A: Right. They hurt my feelings. It screwed up my thinking. They mess with my body, but they never touch me. Right? Because who I am can't be touched in that way.
[107:17] B: Right?
[107:18] A: Right. And as this is getting in, close your eyes and think back to the earlier you. Whether it was when you were being trafficked or other stuff or other sex stuff that you didn't want. Let the earlier. You know what? You know now they messed with my stuff, they never got me. Screwed up my thinking and feeling, but they never touched who I really am. There's not a part of me that's the same as when they were doing that stuff to my body. All of it is transformed and changed. They never got who I really am. They never touched me. And you can say it. They mess with my stuff, but they never got me. That's right. And as all of this begins to integrate again, what's happening with the feelings. Yeah. Because you're becoming much more emotionally present here now, seeing things clearly for what they were, not about me. Right.
[108:24] B: Right.
[108:26] A: Yeah. So that things begin to lighten up. Right. Notice how there's more room. And so there's. Here's the cool other part one. That stuff that we cleared can't go back the other way.
[108:46] B: Okay.
[108:47] A: So you can think about the thing in the alley. You can think about them doing the video. You can think about other stuff that happened that we didn't even talk about. You can think about that stuff and try to feel bad about it. Try to really feel bad. Try to feel really scared about the knife. Try to feel really bad that you did that stuff. Right. So it can't go back the other way. Because once the brain gets that it's data, it can't go back to thinking it's happening.
[109:13] B: Right.
[109:14] A: Once you know that Santa's make believe, you can't go to believe in them. Right. Because if you totally believe in Santa, your kids get no gifts. I don't know, sweetie. I thought you were a good girl, too. Look what Santa got me, though.
[109:35] B: I love it.
[109:36] A: You know, but I hated Santa as a dad for my little kids because Santa got all the credit. Santa got all the good gifts. Oh, yeah, we put a tree swing up. Yeah, we. I put a tree swing up. No, it was Santa and the reindeer that put it up the night before. No, it was dad at midnight on the ladder with a light in his mouth trying to figure out how to hook this. Fuck Santa.
[109:55] B: Fuck Santa. I love it.
[109:59] A: He's a weird guy anyway, you know, always watching little children.
[110:01] B: Children, yeah. Writing their.
[110:06] A: Put kids on his lap. What are you doing? Putting on Stranger Danger. You know why little babies always cry in Santa's lap?
[110:13] B: Stranger Danger. That's not okay, right?
[110:15] A: Here, kid, let me give you a present.
[110:17] B: Yeah. No, get away from me.
[110:21] A: Comes to your house in the middle of the night, nobody knows that he's there. Wears fucking gloves.
[110:25] B: Yeah. It's not okay. It's not okay. That's crazy.
[110:31] A: Yeah, but notice what's happening inside. Right. Things are beginning to light so that you're gonna notice. But here's the other thing. You're. This is going to be both a immediate but also gradual.
[110:43] B: Okay.
[110:45] A: You're going to notice in the moment. Situations that normally were triggering you aren't going to be triggering you. You're going to notice it after the fact. Hey, normally I would have been, and I wasn't. You're going to notice, seeing things more clearly going, hey, Huh? I didn't. And that's going to be okay. So light bulbs are going. Going to be going off, and then there's going to be the gradual change. So if two ships are set out to sea on parallel courses and one gets adjusted by a degree.
[111:13] B: Okay.
[111:13] A: They leave away from the port. It doesn't look like they're moving different. But we know that the farther they go out in the water. Yeah. And the more they go vastly different their course is.
[111:23] B: Right.
[111:24] A: So we've done a course correction in changing the trajectory of where you're headed. Because what do we want for you? We want you to be at peace, more comfortable, more uptime, more present. So that you get to be directing how you want life to go, not based on what it used to be like, but like, how do I want it to be? How do I want it to go? And we're interested in you having that much more freedom in dealing with stuff that might show up with Mom.
[111:55] B: Okay.
[111:56] A: Because guess what? There's probably going to be. Yes. Right. Got it. And that we're gonna have the lens that Mom's not. Wellness isn't about me and doesn't need to bleed into me like it always has.
[112:16] B: Yeah.
[112:17] A: Got it.
[112:18] B: Got it.
[112:18] A: Because with mom when I was a kid, I was able to notice her mood and adjust, but I can't do that with all of life ahead of time. Have to know everything instead. What we want installed in you. And this is what's starting. This is where the gradualness of the change is. I have what I need to deal with, what might show up. So I don't need to be so worried about what might show up. Because what we do know is that you made it through a lot of difficult stuff, and there are a lot of difficult stuff that you made it through that you weren't sure you were gonna make it through. There were times, like when a knife was there or when other stuff was going on that you weren't sure you were gonna survive it.
[112:55] B: Right.
[112:55] A: That you were gonna make it through it.
[112:57] B: Right.
[112:57] A: Got it. What do we know you did?
[113:01] B: I did.
[113:01] A: Right. So what do we know that you had back then that you weren't sure you did? Yes. Got it. So what do we now have installed in you? I have what I need to deal with what might show up. So I don't need to be so concerned with what might show up. Because regardless of what shows up, I have what I need. Got it?
[113:23] B: Got it.
[113:24] A: Yeah.
[113:25] B: Yeah.
[113:25] A: Cool.
[113:26] B: Cool. Thank you.
[113:28] A: You did great.
[113:29] B: Thank you.
[113:30] A: Yeah. So, any questions for me? Anything left for today that we didn't get to. That you wanted to.
[113:37] B: No, I think you got it.
[113:40] A: You did great.
[113:40] B: More.
[113:41] A: Good job.
[113:42] B: Yeah. Am I going to see you again?
[113:43] A: You can. Absolutely.
[113:44] B: Okay.
[113:45] A: I didn't know you're actually on my calendar again already.
[113:47] B: Oh, okay. Great.
[113:48] A: See, there you go. Cool. Yeah. You can come with me.
