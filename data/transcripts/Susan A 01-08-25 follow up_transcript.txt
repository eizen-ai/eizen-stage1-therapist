[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 8th of January.
[00:05] B: It's not December, it's the 8th. Okay, I believe you.
[00:08] A: Well, the 6th was my daughter's birthday on Monday, so it is the eighth.
[00:12] B: Okay.
[00:12] A: Yeah. And Susan, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that.
[00:15] B: Yes.
[00:15] A: And given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:23] B: Yes.
[00:24] A: Cool. So how did our last session leave you? What have you noticed for yourself? How have things been?
[00:29] B: You know, honestly, when I left, I felt like a weight has been lifted off of me. And. And I always think back to what you said about, you know, play it through, what happened then what happened then what happened. And it's worked out for me. And I would suggest this for anybody. Really? Really. Because I was quite surprised that when I left how I felt. You know, like this stuff. Yeah. And stuff you say, like, about my son and his father, that all just made sense to me. It's like, you know, all these years I couldn't figure that out. And so that really helped.
[01:05] A: Yeah.
[01:06] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:08] A: So cool. When you're thinking about those things that we talked about and we unplugged, those things don't have the same feelings anymore.
[01:14] B: No.
[01:14] A: They don't hurt like they did. No. You don't have the same bad feelings. You're not ruminating about the same stuff. That's really cool.
[01:20] B: Yes, yes, yes.
[01:21] A: Yay.
[01:23] B: Yeah.
[01:24] A: Yeah, yeah. What else have you noticed for yourself?
[01:29] B: I don't know.
[01:31] A: Well, like, how have things been for you in your day to day life?
[01:34] B: Well, I just have some issues. But other than the issues, good. You know, just doing the next right thing. Keep moving forward, you know?
[01:42] A: Yeah.
[01:43] B: Try to stay away from negativity, that kind of stuff, you know, but my brain is warped, but. So I don't know if this all is going to make sense to you, and I hate to bring this up, but, you know I was diagnosed with late stage syphilis. Right.
[02:02] A: Okay.
[02:02] B: It was ocular, and that was a year and a half ago. So I just got out of the hospital last week because I had a MRI in my brain. Something's not right. But, like, right now I cannot hardly see you. And I have these readers on, but I have contacts that I could finally wear back at home today. So I feel like I'm in fog. I just. It's crazy. I don't even know how to explain it. And it's all really a Mental. A medical issue because of what's going on. So I'm trying to get to the bottom of it. You know, he said. They said that I don't have it anymore. It's cured, but I get residuals because this is the third time I'm in the hospital, so. So that always brings me down. You know, anything is like, it was there last night. We had our group, and it was about what's real and what's not real in my head, because I feel, like, paranoid.
[02:58] A: The group is about what's real and what's not real.
[03:00] B: Well, in your head. Yeah.
[03:04] A: And they made it all about you.
[03:07] B: Yeah, yeah. No, about us, our heads. You know what I mean? So.
[03:11] A: Yeah.
[03:13] B: So I don't know if I'm making any sense, but I just have to make it clear because I am not right like I was before this happened. And. But also, you know, I used and I got sober, and I'm now, like, 14 months sober. And it feels good. And, you know, it feels good to have my life back. But in the meantime, I just like to use stupid things. So I work. I work at Dirt Dutchman, you know, my job, and. But I do stupid things, you know, and I can't even explain them.
[03:43] A: What does that mean? Well, what's a stupid thing that you do?
[03:46] B: Thing is, like, ringing up something wrong that's messy. It was a mistake. I don't know how to explain myself after you. Really.
[03:56] A: You're doing a good job.
[03:57] B: I am.
[03:58] A: You are. So that one's not doing something stupid.
[04:04] B: No.
[04:04] A: Although you might have said I was stupid, that I made that mistake.
[04:07] B: Right.
[04:10] A: So you might be still saying I'm stupid.
[04:13] B: Yeah, probably. Yeah.
[04:14] A: Even though I know I made a mistake.
[04:16] B: Yeah.
[04:17] A: So you're a little hard on you still.
[04:19] B: Yes.
[04:20] A: Okay, so one thing we want is you to be lighter and easier on you.
[04:25] B: Yeah. Yes.
[04:27] A: Yeah, that would be better.
[04:29] B: Why don't. Why don't I think about that?
[04:32] A: Well, because when you're stuck.
[04:34] B: Yes. Where's that? Yeah.
[04:36] A: You can't see a solution. That's why you're stuck. Right. It's like somebody coming in and you ask them, well, how do you want to be? And they have no idea how they want to be because they can't even see that because they're stuck in the middle of that's going on for them.
[04:53] B: Yeah.
[04:56] A: Sometimes it takes somebody on the outside to see it. All right. What other things have you done that you're stupid?
[05:02] B: Well, these are gonna sound stupid, but.
[05:07] A: Like, I'm glad that the Stupid thing. So skip it now.
[05:11] B: Like, I have two signs and they're gone. They're 41 and 38, married and kids and the. But we're very close. And so I'll send a text to one of them, and then I'll forward it to the other one, then forward it to the wise report, and I end up sending the wrong one and blah, blah, blah. I do this stuff all the time, and it's stupid.
[05:31] A: Oh, yeah. That you send one of them the message that you meant for the other one.
[05:35] B: Yeah, yeah. Or stupid stuff like that.
[05:38] A: What's the stupid stuff?
[05:39] B: That I sent the wrong message to the wrong person. But it's. It's not just that time. I do it all the time. And they kind of know.
[05:47] A: We just need to have a group chat. Then you only have to send it once.
[05:52] B: I know, but my son Sean doesn't want to be in a group chat, so. Because he works a lot, he's. What?
[05:59] A: What does that mean? He doesn't want. Yeah.
[06:01] B: Take me off of this chat, he says, because everybody, the four of us, my two sons, their wives, and the five of us are myself. Will keep answering. And it's funny and it's funnier and funnier and shut. Like, take me out. Because he works. He's a nurse, and he's in with a brain trauma surgeon he works for, and he can't have that kind of stuff going on through today, so. So.
[06:22] A: Well, he can put it on do not disturb.
[06:24] B: Well, this is true. But he chooses to say, do not put me on this chat. Take me off this chat. So, okay.
[06:34] A: I might tell him to put his phone on do not disturb when he doesn't want to be disturbed.
[06:37] B: That's a great idea. And actually, I haven't done a group chat with him for a couple years because. Yeah, somebody's Good idea. It's a lot to go through to send each and everybody.
[06:48] A: It's too much.
[06:49] B: Yeah.
[06:49] A: Yeah, I agree. It's too much. Send it all together.
[06:54] B: Yeah.
[06:54] A: In particular, if it's the message that they all need to get.
[06:57] B: Yeah.
[06:57] A: I don't want to send it here. Here.
[06:58] B: I mean, here.
[06:59] A: I just want to send it.
[07:00] B: Most people would agree. Not now.
[07:02] A: Okay.
[07:03] B: He's a little difficult sometimes, but sometimes.
[07:06] A: I'm glad that he's taking ownership of it, though.
[07:08] B: Yes. Oh, my God, I feel so stupid.
[07:12] A: World change for me.
[07:14] B: I know.
[07:15] A: I know.
[07:16] B: Exactly. Yeah. So other than that, things are pretty good. I'm gonna be moving out of the halfway house and moving in with a friend and That's a little. I'm excited, but, you know, hope I'm doing the right thing. But I. I think I am.
[07:34] A: So how do you know?
[07:36] B: How do I know? Well, because everything I want to move forward in is there. I don't want to be stuck in this halfway house. I've been there for six months. I've been. I was in treatment for seven and a half months.
[07:48] A: Yeah.
[07:49] B: It's like it's time, you know, I'm tired of drama and, you know, get on with other women. Yeah.
[07:59] A: But you're gonna go live with another woman.
[08:01] B: One person. I live with seven. I don't. I can't afford to live on my own.
[08:05] A: Yeah.
[08:07] B: Yeah.
[08:08] A: Okay. And this friend, like, is a good friend. You've known them?
[08:13] B: Yeah, actually, I've known her probably six years.
[08:17] A: Okay.
[08:17] B: But not so close until I got back this time.
[08:20] A: Okay.
[08:21] B: But she's a very good friend.
[08:22] A: Yeah. And location is fine. Where she lives in comparison to where the house is and my work. And work.
[08:32] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[08:33] A: So that all works okay for you?
[08:34] B: Yeah.
[08:35] A: Okay.
[08:35] B: Yeah.
[08:36] A: So, I mean, when does that happen?
[08:38] B: Whenever I wanted to. I've been kind of putting it off. Putting it off. And I don't know why, but I just had a talk with. With her out there and I don't even know her name. Charisma. Charisma.
[08:49] A: Could be.
[08:50] B: That's a funny name. She got a lot of charisma. Yeah, that's her name. So anyway, I feel kind of stupid sitting here talking about nothing. I feel like it's stupid stuff. Yeah.
[09:05] A: It's the stuff that you're dealing with.
[09:07] B: Yeah.
[09:07] A: That you have some uncertainty.
[09:09] B: Right.
[09:09] A: And you want to make the right decision for you.
[09:11] B: Yes.
[09:12] A: I mean, check that out. I have uncertainty whether it's the right thing or not to move in with this long term friend. Because I want to do what's right for me.
[09:24] B: Right.
[09:24] A: It's important.
[09:25] B: Yeah.
[09:26] A: I've been at this for a while and I've been taking the right steps. And you just do the next right step. Right. I don't know whether this is the next right step. So I'm a little bit hesitant.
[09:36] B: Right.
[09:37] A: Because I don't want to make a wrong step.
[09:38] B: Right.
[09:40] A: Do you get it? That's not talking about nothing. That's talking about the distress that I have over a current situation and decision that I've made in making. Yes. Right. I don't want to make it out of. Oh, I just don't want to be in the halfway house anymore.
[10:02] B: Right.
[10:03] A: Right. So we don't want the decision to move in with the friend to be a. What I would call an away from.
[10:09] B: Okay. Yeah.
[10:10] A: Right. It's away from what I don't like, so I'm just going to move away from it. We want it to be. If it's going to be something that it's towards.
[10:19] B: Okay.
[10:20] A: Towards what I want from you. Maybe what I want for me is more independence. Whatever that does this lead to, Is it a towards or is it an away from?
[10:33] B: No.
[10:33] A: And not that it can't have some away from. Like, I'll be glad that I don't have to deal with that.
[10:37] B: Right.
[10:38] A: But it's not like I can't deal with that, so I have to. Do you follow me?
[10:42] B: Yes. Yes. No. That's a good way to look at it, too, because. Yeah. It's what I want to move forward with in my life. And it's not like I gotta get out of there. I mean, I can tolerate it.
[10:51] A: Right.
[10:52] B: But I don't have to anymore.
[10:54] A: Yeah.
[10:55] B: Yeah. And if I didn't feel like moving there was gonna be good for me. I wouldn't even consider it.
[11:01] A: Yeah.
[11:02] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:04] A: And is this somebody that's also in recovery? Is this somebody?
[11:08] B: Yes. She was my sponsor. She's no longer my sponsor because we're two good friends.
[11:11] A: Okay.
[11:12] B: So. And she's my age. Well, actually, she's a few years older than me and she's been sober 28 years. Yeah. Yeah. So it's all good, you know, I mean, it beat a lot of sobriety and. Yeah. So I'm excited about it. You know, I don't know why I'm not allowing myself to be excited.
[11:27] A: Oh, well, you just said you are.
[11:30] B: Oh, yeah.
[11:30] A: Excited about it.
[11:31] B: You're really good. Jeez.
[11:36] A: You're excited about it.
[11:37] B: I am.
[11:37] A: Right. You've been hesitant about sharing that you're excited about it.
[11:42] B: Yeah.
[11:43] A: Because you don't want to jinx it.
[11:44] B: Well, yeah. But also, I don't want to hurt my friend who's at the house with me. We've been through treatment together, blah, blah, blah. But she's gonna be upset that I'm gonna leave, but I gotta take care of myself first, so that's.
[11:57] A: Well, you didn't go to treatment with her, did you?
[11:59] B: No, I met her there.
[12:01] A: Right, right. You didn't go to treatment. Right.
[12:04] B: And my plan in life was not to be everywhere. You know what I mean? I gotta move on, and it's time to move on.
[12:13] A: I don't know whether it's about moving on. Check that out for just a moment. You and her got to rehab at a similar time, and so you went through the rehab process together. As you move through the rehab process, you also then moved into a halfway house, which is the step from treatment into a less restrictive environment, but still supportive of sobriety.
[12:44] B: Yeah.
[12:45] A: You guys have just been following the same path.
[12:47] B: Yeah.
[12:49] A: Right. You're not forging a new path.
[12:52] B: No.
[12:52] A: You're not leaving her.
[12:54] B: Right.
[12:55] A: Your paths are moving in a little bit of it. Because, like, this is the next phase. The next phase was not the two of us find a place to stay.
[13:05] B: Well, yeah. Okay.
[13:07] A: Oh, it was.
[13:08] B: Yeah.
[13:08] A: But how do you know?
[13:10] B: Well, we had talked about it.
[13:11] A: Oh.
[13:11] B: But so when I move, I'm gonna save money while I'm there, and I think I'll be able to save more money while I'm there. And my thinking is that she can save money, you know, and then if. And when the time comes that we have enough money together to get our own place, and that will happen, but I just don't feel like I need to stay there and wait for that to happen.
[13:38] A: Okay, so the challenge that you're having with this is that you already made an agreement with somebody else that you're going to move with them when it was time for you to move.
[13:45] B: Yeah, yeah.
[13:50] A: Yeah. And we don't really like conflict.
[13:53] B: Well, it's really. I don't mind conflict because I'll tell you how I feel, but I just don't want her feelings. She's young. She sees you too. And I kind of been there for her. Like, her fiance died while we were in treatment and kind of stuff like that, you know? So kind of, like, felt like she. I kind of carried her under my wing a little bit. But the bottom line is I have to think of myself, and I don't want to live there anymore. I want to move on with my life, and I'm not. I don't want to wait until she's ready.
[14:22] A: So is she not ready financially?
[14:25] B: No.
[14:25] A: No.
[14:25] B: And I don't see that happening because she blows her money and stuff, which is perfectly fine for her. You know what I mean?
[14:30] A: I'm not sure it is.
[14:32] B: No, it's probably true, but I'm not.
[14:34] A: The one to tell her it's not your job. But not a good idea if she's just blown.
[14:39] B: I know.
[14:40] A: I mean, people. It's really interesting. And money is a very. It's. It's. It's laced with a lot of, like, emotion. Topic one, we have horrible education around how money works and what to do with money and how to use money as different vehicles and the purpose of money. We have the second thing that, like, it doesn't matter about behavior anymore and whether you're an upstanding individual. If you've got money, then you can do whatever and act any way you want. Like, it's crazy. Like, we're worshiping the that. But the flip side to that is people who are good with money don't think about money on a day by day, week by week basis. They kind of think about it in a broader sense and kind of plan for things in the future and do other stuff. People have a problem with money are looking at it day by day, week by week. Okay, I got this bill coming up. I got to get enough money to pay that. Oh, no, this bill's doing that. I got to figure out. How am I going to figure out the money, where I'm going to take that. So they're focused on a very small thing, not a bigger picture. Right. It's hard to kind of steer where you're going if you're always in the engine room.
[15:46] B: Yeah.
[15:47] A: Trying to figure out how to get the next thing to pay the next thing. They're not good at budgeting. They're not good at. So I'm sure that gal doesn't know she makes money. She's got no intention of. What does that mean? To save? Where do I put it? Like, how do I.
[16:01] B: Right.
[16:01] A: It's getting spent.
[16:03] B: Right. And so, you know, I've noticed it along the way. And, you know, so I don't know that I even really want to end up moving in with her. But I'm not saying I'm not. So I just want to go to where I want to go. And, you know, if she wants to then start saving money and then we can move in. And she says, and, you know, honestly, I don't want to live with somebody because I did this before. I had a roommate and she never had enough money, blah, blah, blah. And I just don't want that to happen again. Yeah. And it's nothing against her, so it's just not the way I live. I choose to live. You know, my bills are important, this, this and that. So.
[16:40] A: Right.
[16:41] B: Yeah.
[16:42] A: You may have different goals. Okay, so what do you think will happen if you tell her, hey, I got this cool opportunity to go live with this gal that I've known a long time who used to be my sponsor, that we're really good friends, and she's got a place that I can be at. That'll enable me to start saving more money.
[17:02] B: What do I think she will say?
[17:04] A: Yeah, how do you think she's gonna be?
[17:05] B: I don't think she's.
[17:06] A: You fucking bitch.
[17:08] B: No, I don't think she'll be, she'll be, she'll be like, oh, my God, you can't leave me. That kind of stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And feel sorry for herself and blah, blah, blah, blah. So, yeah, that's what I don't want to have. But I know. Don't know for sure, but that's what I'm thinking is going to happen. And because I had mentioned it last week, I said something about she, you're not going to leave me. I'm like, yeah, I am.
[17:35] A: I'm sorry, but no, you're not leaving her.
[17:37] B: Right. We're still friends.
[17:39] A: Right. I'm just moving to a different location.
[17:43] B: Right.
[17:44] A: Which means if I move to a different location, even though we're friends, we won't see each other as much.
[17:49] B: Right.
[17:51] A: Not because we're not friends, but because I live in a different location.
[17:54] B: Thank you so much.
[17:56] A: You get that? Like, I mean, that's, that's why we won't see each other.
[17:59] B: Yeah, right, right.
[18:01] A: Like, you know, when I had a college roommate, we saw each other every day and then we went home for the summer. I didn't see each other.
[18:07] B: Yeah.
[18:08] A: We were still really good friends.
[18:10] B: Yeah, I know.
[18:12] A: We don't see each other as much now that I'm an adult and they're an adult and I live in a different place that they live. You don't see each other.
[18:19] B: Yes, I. I get it. I get it. Yeah.
[18:21] A: Yeah. Okay. So we might want to soften it a little bit for her so that she can kind of get it. Hey, this is what I'm doing for the short term.
[18:31] B: Yeah.
[18:31] A: I, I think it'll give me an opportunity because rent is even less than it is here, that I can save some more and plan is still, if it works, you know, for us to have a place. Right.
[18:43] B: Yeah.
[18:43] A: Then it's on her.
[18:45] B: Okay.
[18:46] A: To do what she needs to do to have the money and the savings.
[18:50] B: Yeah.
[18:51] A: To be self supportive and carrying half of rent. Right, right. Like it just gives an opportunity for me to do more of the saving.
[19:05] B: Yeah.
[19:07] A: That I can hear. It actually cuts my expense a little bit.
[19:10] B: Right.
[19:11] A: So I can save more.
[19:12] B: There you go.
[19:13] A: Right. The goal is to still.
[19:15] B: Right.
[19:16] A: You know, we're not. I'm not. I haven't changed that. It just gives me opportunity to get to some of that sooner.
[19:21] B: Yes. Yeah.
[19:23] A: Right.
[19:25] B: Yeah. So honestly, I'm starting to feel like it's not going to be so bad, you know, because it's the Oz truth. And what can you say to that? You know what I mean?
[19:34] A: Right. Right. And she can be sad and upset and that's okay.
[19:40] B: Right? I know. Right?
[19:42] A: It is.
[19:46] B: Yeah.
[19:47] A: Yeah. Okay.
[19:49] B: Okay, Bye.
[19:52] A: So sometimes, you know, you do stupid stuff.
[19:54] B: Yeah.
[19:54] A: Like you ring in the wrong price for a certain thing.
[19:57] B: Well, yeah. That was just one time.
[19:59] A: I know. And then you realized it and then you stopped doing it. Which is smart.
[20:03] B: Yes.
[20:03] A: Not stupid.
[20:04] B: You're right.
[20:05] A: To learn from your mistakes.
[20:07] B: Yes.
[20:07] A: Is smart.
[20:08] B: Yes.
[20:09] A: Not that you make mistakes. See, you're not stupid if you make mistakes. You'd be stupid if you didn't learn.
[20:15] B: Okay.
[20:15] A: From the mistakes you made. That would be stupid.
[20:17] B: Right. Gotcha.
[20:18] A: But so you're actually being smart by learning from the mistakes that you make. Yeah, that's right.
[20:25] B: Yeah.
[20:26] A: Isn't that interesting?
[20:27] B: Yes.
[20:27] A: Yeah.
[20:28] B: Yes.
[20:29] A: Right. Because that's what you're doing. You're just learning from the mistakes and you can't not make mistakes.
[20:34] B: Right.
[20:36] A: Right.
[20:36] B: Yeah.
[20:38] A: It's like kids going into the school and the teacher thinking they should know the answers. I shouldn't know any of the answers. I just got here. I'm supposed to learn them if I already know the answer. There's never any learning if I don't make a mistake. There's never every learning. And you're learning and you're improving. You're getting better. Right. And that's a good news thing.
[21:02] B: Yeah.
[21:03] A: Yeah.
[21:03] B: Very good.
[21:04] A: Yeah. Right. You're not haunted by the stuff that happened. Even when you're in moments that are in situations that are similar to it, it's not reading as the same.
[21:17] B: Yeah.
[21:18] A: Right. You're not feeling bad about you.
[21:21] B: Yeah.
[21:22] A: You're not feeling it with so much your fault.
[21:26] B: Right.
[21:27] A: Right. And you are at least a little bit lighter and easier on you.
[21:33] B: A little bit. Yeah.
[21:34] A: A little bit. Right.
[21:35] B: Yeah.
[21:35] A: We want you to lighten up more.
[21:37] B: Yeah.
[21:38] A: So that you're more okay on the inside. Right. So that this decision that you're in the process of deciding when to go, what to go with this. Right. That we want you to be in alignment at a head, a heart and a gut level so that you're crystal clear and you're in alignment that it's the thing that's right for you. Because what's most concerning isn't whether she's upset or not. It's that you're doing the thing that is the next right step.
[22:13] B: Yeah.
[22:14] A: And I always talk about it and I don't use the word right, but that's a great way to say it. I say what is the smallest next step that's towards what you want because that's the only one there is for you to take.
[22:24] B: Yeah.
[22:25] A: Take the smallest next step. And you can't know what the next smallest next step is going to be until you take that one. Because we're a nonlinear system. It's not like things go abcdefgh. No, no. We're non linear. It goes all over the place in this silly example. I don't know if you know anything about golf, but I can't tell you that on the third hole my second shot is going to be with a seven iron. I can't tell you before I play that that's what's going to happen because I won't know until I hit the first ball on the third hole and it lands wherever it lands that's going to tell me where it is. And where I want it to go is going to tell me which club, the one that's right for me to use. I could have played that hole a hundred times and use the seven iron almost all the time. I can't know that time whether I will or not. Because my job when I get to the ball is to see where I want the ball to go and then select the club that gives me the best chance to get the ball to where I want it to go. Right. So human beings like the stock market, like the weather, is a non linear system. Nonlinear systems are not a straight line. Non linear systems are all over the place. You can't know what's going to come next. Right. That's why they say the stock market, the past is not a causal of future gains. Just because it did make money doesn't mean it will make right.
[23:59] B: Yeah.
[24:00] A: That thing goes up and down over. It's non linear. The weather's not linear. We're not good at predicting it far from today. Yeah, we're good at predicting it right now. Right. Five minutes from now we're going to know what it's going to look like.
[24:14] B: Yeah.
[24:14] A: Five hours from now we might not know. Yeah, right. Our accuracy goes out the window the farther we're out and away from right now.
[24:23] B: Yeah.
[24:25] A: Right. So as you're looking at where you want to go and what you're up to and you know that this is a solid woman with a solid place to live that you've Been friends with that has decades plus of sobriety. That is also support of you being clean and sober and clear.
[24:47] B: Right.
[24:48] A: Right. Is there anything about moving in with her that seems like a bad idea? No, there's not. Got it.
[24:56] B: Yes.
[24:57] A: Right. There isn't. Right. And you can check that at a head level. You can check that at a heart level, you can check that at a gut level because you're not. Right. You're not actually getting rid of the bumpers and supports that a halfway house has around it. Right. You're still with somebody that is in active recovery.
[25:21] B: Yes.
[25:21] A: That may attend meetings. That does speak the lingo. Right. Gets the language. Right. So you're not like, oh, I've just left the support structure that I had around me of sobriety.
[25:35] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[25:36] A: Follow me with that.
[25:36] B: Yes. Yes.
[25:37] A: Yeah. So we can check it at a head level. We can check it at a heart level. You can check it at a cut level. And I'm not leaving her. Right. I'm doing what I need to do to take care of me and letting her know that that's still in my future plans.
[25:55] B: Yeah.
[25:56] A: And it's really up to her. Because what I've been able to witness while I've been around her, that before I knew all of that is when I made the agreement that we would definitely, you know, find a place together sometime. I didn't know that she wasn't great with saving.
[26:13] B: Right.
[26:14] A: That she irresponsibly spends. That she seems to not ever have enough money. That, like, that's not where I'm at.
[26:24] B: Right.
[26:25] A: I didn't know that about her.
[26:27] B: You're right.
[26:28] A: Do you follow me with that? So you didn't know. Right. And you're like, I've had an experience where I've been with somebody that was like that and it wasn't a great experience. So, you know, I have touched the hot stove. That doesn't mean I want to go touch the hot stove again.
[26:42] B: Yeah. Learn from that experience. Right.
[26:45] A: That's what I mean. You're learning. And that's why this also appears and looking like a really good option.
[26:51] B: Yeah.
[26:52] A: Because it does take me out of that too. I don't have to do that. I'm doing this.
[26:56] B: Yeah.
[26:57] A: I'm not opposed to that. But some things gotta be demonstrated. That she's actually better with her.
[27:04] B: Yeah.
[27:05] A: Has better fiscal responsibility or knows what to do with her money or handles it better.
[27:09] B: Right. Right.
[27:10] A: All that's gonna make me feel a lot more comfortable.
[27:14] B: Yeah.
[27:14] A: With her. Does that make sense?
[27:16] B: Yes, it does. Yeah, yeah.
[27:20] A: Right. So check in as you think about moving because you can do it at any time. Right. With that friend that was a sponsor that you've known a long time that's really into sobriety. Right. And as you check in with you, what do you notice?
[27:40] B: That it feels right.
[27:41] A: It does feel right.
[27:43] B: Like on Wednesday nights, my home group, sunrise, it's at 7 in the morning every Wednesday they have a eating meeting and it's at somebody else's house or someone different in the, you know, members of that group. And it's just all, you know, oriented on sobriety.
[28:03] A: Yeah.
[28:03] B: And so I can't go wrong going there, you know what I mean? Because I want my sobriety. I love my sobriety and I want to keep it, you know.
[28:12] A: Right. You're keeping yourself engaged and being clean and clear. So.
[28:19] B: Yeah.
[28:21] A: That's a really good news thing. Yeah, it is, isn't it?
[28:24] B: Yeah.
[28:25] A: Yeah. Right.
[28:26] B: Yeah.
[28:27] A: Right. And it's easier to do it without the stuff. Recycling in you retriggering. You re.
[28:36] B: Yeah.
[28:37] A: You follow me with that? Notice how it's, you're a lot more clear than you were.
[28:42] B: I do, yeah.
[28:43] A: Yeah. Is that a good news thing?
[28:46] B: Yes, it is.
[28:48] A: Yeah.
[28:49] B: Yeah.
[28:50] A: Yeah. Cool.
[28:52] B: Yeah.
[28:52] A: So we think about that. Think about having the conversation with her.
[29:02] B: What do you notice that's really not. First of all, I don't need to be worried about her feelings about. Because I'm doing the right thing for myself. You know, I'm not doing anything to hurt her or harm her. You know what I mean? I just moving on for myself. And I, I, I, I guess you could say I'm codependent because I can't worry I'm gonna hurt her feelings.
[29:24] A: You can be concerned because it's somebody that you care about. You don't want them to hurt.
[29:27] B: Yeah. But still, like, I don't have to live there and not move on with my life. And that's kind of what I feel like I'm doing lately, is that I'm stuck there and it's just time to move on. And I just really. So what I think I'm meeting with Nancy tomorrow night and we're going to set up when I'm going to go. It's probably going to be this weekend because I'm off Friday, Saturday and Sunday. And I can't think of a better time to move because I got those three days off.
[29:55] A: Yeah.
[29:56] B: Yep.
[29:58] A: Right, right. And being there isn't keeping you still.
[30:06] B: Right.
[30:07] A: You're still moving and you're still growing.
[30:14] B: Yeah.
[30:15] A: Right. That might not fit you like it did when you first left rehab.
[30:20] B: Right. No, you're right.
[30:21] A: Right. I might have, like, grown out of the size.
[30:24] B: Yeah. No, you're right. Yep.
[30:28] A: Right. Doesn't make that bad or wrong. Just not fitting me and where I want to go. It's not that I'm moving on from that. I've been continuing to move on. I'm moving forward. There you go.
[30:41] B: Yeah.
[30:42] A: I'm moving forward in ways that are useful for me in my life, that I haven't always done that. Right. Now I am.
[30:53] B: Yeah.
[30:54] A: Right. And you get to feel good about that. Yeah, yeah.
[30:58] B: Yeah.
[30:59] A: Right. There we go. You get to feel good about it.
[31:02] B: Yeah. And I probably. I probably am gonna move this weekend because I don't have to sit here and just get it over with. Tell her. Because that's where I want to go and do it, you know, don't procrastinate. I'm not one to.
[31:15] A: Well, how do you want to be when you tell her?
[31:18] B: What do you mean?
[31:19] A: Well, like, if we could set it up. How you want to be feeling as you tell her. How do you want to be?
[31:27] B: I want to be. Like, it's a positive thing, you know, like, it's a good thing.
[31:31] A: Yeah.
[31:32] B: For myself. And she can as well, because she still has all those people in the house that she's friends with, you know, like, it's not.
[31:39] A: Not a good thing for her.
[31:41] B: Right. It's not. Not a good thing for her.
[31:44] A: Correct.
[31:44] B: It's probably going to help her grow as well, is what I would like to think.
[31:48] A: Yeah. But it's not. Not a good thing for her.
[31:51] B: Right, Right.
[31:53] A: It's. I had an opportunity that I couldn't pass up. Right. I'm still interested in this. Gives me the opportunity to save more.
[32:05] B: Yeah. That is how the conversation is gonna go.
[32:08] A: Right. And I care about you, and you matter.
[32:13] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[32:17] A: Right. So just because I move over there doesn't mean you don't matter.
[32:21] B: Right.
[32:23] A: Right. The. The kid leaves to go off to college and their little siblings home. It's not that they don't care about their little sibling.
[32:31] B: Right. You just gotta do what's right for them.
[32:33] A: It's time for them to go to college. People go at different times. Right. So you two may have entered rehab at a similar time, gone through the process. Gone to. But you're at a different phase of life than her as well. You've got, you know, a bunch of years on.
[32:56] B: Yes. Yes.
[32:58] A: Right. You know, and you're actually connecting with somebody who you're more at the same level. Age, Age.
[33:07] B: Right, right.
[33:09] A: So we like the same kind of music because we grew up at the same.
[33:11] B: Yes.
[33:14] A: I say to myself sometimes, I got a guy who I worked with who, like, he's having problems when he started dating somebody. Dating somebody who's like, you know, in their late, early 30s. And I'm like, oh, God, that's got to be awful. Like, I mean, sure, I get it. They're a hot girl. Like. Yeah. The period of time. I get that part. But like all, all the rest of it. Like. Like you don't listen to anything that I listen.
[33:33] B: I know. Just like. I know, I know, I know, I know.
[33:38] A: Like, that's just gotta be awful. I wouldn't want to do that.
[33:40] B: I know.
[33:41] A: That doesn't sound like fun at all.
[33:42] B: I know. And that's. That's kind of how I feel over there too. Everybody's young and. Which is fine, you know, but it's time for me to move on and be with my people. You know what I mean? Like, I don't like tick tock. I don't like rap, but they do. That's fine. But I'm just 65 years old.
[33:56] A: Right. That's not your thing.
[33:57] B: No. Yeah. So now time to do my thing.
[34:01] A: Yeah. Right. And be with somebody that has more similar likes and interests.
[34:06] B: Yeah.
[34:06] A: We might actually want to watch the same show.
[34:09] B: I know.
[34:10] A: And not just on our phones.
[34:11] B: Yeah.
[34:12] A: It's funny. Everybody, today's youth, they have no tv. They just watch their phones.
[34:17] B: Yeah. And when we're all in the same room, everybody's on the phone. It's like, why are you all in the same room then?
[34:22] A: Right. Exactly. It's crazy. I know.
[34:24] B: But. Yeah.
[34:25] A: It is what it is. You see people out at dinner.
[34:27] B: I know. I had a boss that said that when him and his wife and their friends go out to dinner, they all have to put their cell phone in the middle of the table and whoever gets it first has to pay the bill. I thought that was great.
[34:38] A: That's a good idea.
[34:39] B: I know, I know. But. Yeah.
[34:43] A: To teach discipline. I'm not touching that.
[34:45] B: I know.
[34:46] A: Buy really expensive wine. I'm really not touching. I know. Yeah. Okay, cool. So what else is going on? We got that. That. That's a big transition that you're up to.
[34:57] B: Yeah.
[34:58] A: That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. And you're feeling good about it now?
[35:01] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:02] A: It's not cool, right?
[35:03] B: I am. Yeah.
[35:04] A: Yeah. That's a good news thing.
[35:05] B: Yeah. So just that. What else Going on. Really? Nothing. I mean, I work, I go home, I go to meetings, I do my Zoom group, and I just can't wait to move because they gave me free. I could do what I want when I want, you know, mandatory. Got to go to this house, meaning got to do that meeting. It. I want to go because I want to go, not because I'm being forced to go. And so with that, I feel like I have more free time to do the things I like to do, you know? Yeah.
[35:39] A: What are the things that you like to do that you haven't been able to be doing?
[35:42] B: Okay, so, like, going to the beach or visiting with my son and his wife because I have a curfew, or going to Kissimmee to visit my grandchildren, my son and his wife. Those kind of things, you know, because.
[35:55] A: When you're in the halfway house, you have to be back at a certain time.
[35:58] B: Yes. And also, like, you can't use the phone in the comedy. So when somebody calls my. My phone, I put it on do not disturb. It's on do not disturb all the time. So I don't disturb anybody. It's just. But I've been living like that for so long. That just comes. Comes, you know, natural. But. Yeah. Just even to be able to have a conversation with somebody without everybody around, you know?
[36:16] A: Right. Like, you know, trying to do a session in the bathroom.
[36:19] B: Yeah, exactly. You remember that? Oh, man, it was so crazy. I was like, I can't do this. The wind's blowing out there, people.
[36:29] A: Welcome back. A tornado in the bathroom. Awesome.
[36:35] B: This is stupid. God. Yeah. Like that.
[36:39] A: It's funny.
[36:42] B: I know. Finally. I think I said you. I. I can't do this right now. Everybody's walking by, hearing every time. I'm, like, gonna hear everything I say. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, pretty much. I. I feel like sale of freedom is helping me a lot.
[37:01] A: Yeah.
[37:01] B: Even the Zoom groups we do on Tuesday nights, you know, I mean, a Christmas party. It's nice to get to know the girls there and also see where I came from and how it's not my fault, you know, and I'm not who I was. On drugs and, you know.
[37:18] A: Right.
[37:18] B: I don't want to live like that.
[37:20] A: Right.
[37:20] B: And I'm finally free of drugs, that I don't have to ever live like.
[37:24] A: That, you know, which is so cool. Yeah. Yeah. So did you do a genogram?
[37:32] B: I did.
[37:33] A: You did? Who'd you do that with?
[37:36] B: I don't remember her name. She has long hair. I think it was kind of Curly. What's her name? I don't remember her name.
[37:46] A: Okay. But somebody did a genome.
[37:48] B: Yeah.
[37:48] A: Those are really useful.
[37:49] B: Yeah.
[37:50] A: To kind of expose the situation that I came from that kind of led me to be in the situations that I wound up being in. Right. There's a huge component of grooming that I don't even know is grooming that's going on. And based on certain environments and certain experiences that happen to me, it looks like I have choice, but it's not really choice. I kind of, like, forced to either do this or that, and that's not really a choice. You know, if I give my kids, do you want to wear this outfit or this outfit? They get to choose, but not really. I chose that they were going to wear one of the two outfits. Right.
[38:29] B: Yeah.
[38:29] A: Yeah. So. So I think that a genogram is really useful and kind of getting a real good sense of where did I come from and what was the environment that I got born into Based on parents and Grant and extended family. That kind of led to why we had the.
[38:47] B: That happened with us, you know, and that genogram. Because I haven't thought about it much. But yeah. Really helped me a lot because about my mother, my grandmother, and, like, they've all been married five times. Five times. I've been married three times. Just the environment I've been around, the sexual abuse that I had to hear that my mother went through. And. And a lot of stuff. Like, I couldn't be around any relatives if they were men without her there. It always made me feel. Yeah. Because she was sexually abused by her grandfather. So it always made me feel like.
[39:21] A: She wanted to make sure that you did.
[39:22] B: Right. But at the same time, always felt like that's all men wanted or thought about was like, I can't be pretty because they're gonna abuse me sexually. Or I can't wear this because I can't be in the room with a man because by myself. So that's kind. Not kind of. That is how I grew up with my mother. I have a little sister. She didn't treat her like that at all. Only me. And I never thought about that until at Junior Graham. I'm like, wow.
[39:51] A: Yeah.
[39:51] B: I know where it all comes from.
[39:53] A: Yeah. Yeah. And so a lot of that learning was men's intention isn't good.
[40:04] B: Right. Yeah.
[40:06] A: And they only want one thing.
[40:08] B: Yes, exactly.
[40:10] A: The prized possession that I have.
[40:12] B: Yeah.
[40:15] A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But she didn't do it in a way that made it set up so that you're empowered.
[40:22] B: No.
[40:22] A: That you have the prized possession.
[40:24] B: No.
[40:25] A: Isn't that weird?
[40:26] B: Yeah.
[40:26] A: Because in my mind, women who have successful relationships with men are women who hold the keys if she didn't. And what I mean by hold the keys is the woman has the goods. If a guy is interested in you, he likes the package that you come in.
[40:40] B: Right.
[40:40] A: Because that's primary for men.
[40:42] B: Yeah.
[40:42] A: It's there for women, but it's not primary for women. It is primary for men. If the guy is interested in you, he likes what you look like.
[40:48] B: Right? Yeah, that's true.
[40:50] A: Right. Guy's not gonna go after somebody he doesn't like what they look like. Right. So women have the keys. The difference is a guy who's interested in a woman always wants to do it with that woman.
[41:02] B: Yeah.
[41:02] A: A woman who's interested in a guy doesn't always want to do it with that guy. So a woman is yes when she wants to and no when she doesn't. A guy is always yes. Right. So if the attractive gal that the guy is interested in says, hey, do you want to come home and have sex? He goes, yes. Like, there's no hesitation or twist my arm. Right. You can't say that to her.
[41:23] B: Yeah, no way.
[41:24] A: You don't get to go there for like a. So for the woman, the woman is the regulator. Because women are yeses when they want to and knows when they don't.
[41:33] B: Yeah.
[41:34] A: Because a woman doesn't always want to where a guy always wants to. If the woman wakes the guy up in the morning, 3:30 in the morning, going, I'm really, really horny and I want to have sex. He's like, okay, I'm in. I'm a dude. Doesn't take me long. We're good. Right? You can't wake her up.
[41:48] B: Right.
[41:49] A: Hey, 3:30 in the morning, get it away from me. Like, I'm tired. No. Right. Like, but the guy is always. Yes. Right. So for a woman, a woman is a regulator. Regulators are the ones that determine the where, the when, the with whom, the how much, and the how often not him. So women hold the keys. They've got the goods. They are to teach the man how I want to be treated. They've got the goods. They're the regulator. They're the ones that decide if she knows where she wants to go to eat. She lets him know, take me out here. If she doesn't care, she gives him a few places that she would be okay going to so that he can pick.
[42:30] B: Yeah, Right.
[42:32] A: When my mom goes out jewelry shopping with stepdad she goes to the jeweler and she shows the jeweler. These are the three things that I like. He can come back without me and pick one of the three things.
[42:44] B: Yeah.
[42:47] A: Right. So women hold the keys because they've got the goods. They're the ones that set the stage. But not because they need a man. Cuz a woman needs a man about as much as a fish needs a bicycle.
[42:59] B: I agree.
[42:59] A: I mean, the penis wasn't even designed for her pleasure. It was designed to make a baby. She's got a body part, sole purpose. Only thing it does is equal pleasure. So she doesn't need a guy for that.
[43:08] B: Right, right, right.
[43:10] A: So a woman isn't a damsel in distress, but a woman feels really good when she has a man that does. Caretaking opens the door, is polite, is kind, is. Is, you know, caring is chivalrous.
[43:22] B: Yeah, Right.
[43:23] A: And when a guy takes care of his woman, that woman will take care of her guy. True. Yeah. So in the world of worlds like we. We did the same thing. I got, I got a mom who's. My. My mom's been married three times. No. Yeah. Dad's been married three times. Mom's mom, wife's mom has been married five times. Dad was married four times.
[43:50] B: Yeah.
[43:51] A: So we went through that same thing. They all got divorced.
[43:53] B: Yeah.
[43:54] A: So when we got together, it was like, we don't want to do that.
[43:59] B: Yeah, I was gonna say we don't.
[44:02] A: Want to do that. I want to do that.
[44:06] B: Yeah. That's where my kids are at. Together with the same person forever.
[44:10] A: Yeah. It's a good thing.
[44:11] B: I know.
[44:11] A: Good for them.
[44:12] B: I know.
[44:13] A: It's, you know, good learning that you gave them.
[44:15] B: Right.
[44:16] A: Because here's the other part that I want you to get. As your emotional wounds heal, it heals it in a multi generational way. Right. Now you had boys, might have been different if you had a girl based on what your mom did and what you went through and what. Right. Like that might have been different. But if you're healing your emotional wounds, it does it in a multi generational. Both in the front, so towards kids and grandkids and. But also back up. Because trauma is multi generational. Right. It's epigenetics. And so as you heal it in one, it heals it in the generations of that family line. That's what you've been doing. Isn't that cool?
[45:04] B: Yeah, it is cool.
[45:05] A: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Because those things aren't troubling you like they did.
[45:12] B: Right.
[45:12] A: And you definitely have a better understanding of It. But it's not also emotionalized.
[45:16] B: Yeah.
[45:17] A: It's not charged.
[45:18] B: Yeah, yeah.
[45:20] A: Which is really cool.
[45:21] B: Yes.
[45:22] A: Yeah. Right, Right.
[45:26] B: That is cool.
[45:27] A: Yeah.
[45:28] B: Yeah.
[45:29] A: Because that's where it changes. And that's why the people who don't know you the most, they notice how much you've changed. Where people who know you better don't notice how much you've changed, not because you haven't changed, but because they have their own filters. So with their own filters, it blocks how much you've changed for them because they have an already always way of listening of how and who you are. Like that's their pre frame. So it takes them a little bit longer. Like the boys might take a little bit longer to fully know how different you are.
[46:07] B: Yeah.
[46:07] A: Because you might go, I'm really different now this time. Well, okay.
[46:10] B: Yeah, sure.
[46:10] A: Yeah.
[46:10] B: Yeah. I wouldn't even say that.
[46:12] A: Right.
[46:15] B: I won't even say that.
[46:16] A: Right. But that's part of it.
[46:18] B: Yeah.
[46:20] A: Because that'll be demonstrated over time.
[46:22] B: Right.
[46:22] A: And they'll be experiencing you in a new and different and better way. Right, right.
[46:27] B: Without me having to say.
[46:28] A: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Cool.
[46:33] B: Yeah.
[46:34] A: You're doing great. I'm really proud of you.
[46:36] B: Yeah.
[46:38] A: Yeah. I mean, think about it.
[46:40] B: Yeah.
[46:40] A: Right. Like, how long has it been now? Clean, clear, sober, 14 months, right?
[46:45] B: Yeah.
[46:46] A: Like well over a year.
[46:47] B: Oh, yeah.
[46:47] A: It's awesome.
[46:48] B: I know, right?
[46:49] A: When was the last time that you spent 14 months clean?
[46:53] B: Like 10, 12 years.
[46:57] A: Right. And this time around, you've actually done the repair work on the inside. You always had done the repair work on the outside.
[47:07] B: Yeah.
[47:08] A: You follow me with that? I went through the steps, I did the thing, but I never did the repair work on the inside.
[47:12] B: Yeah. And I think that what I've been missing all along is this.
[47:16] A: The repair work on the inside.
[47:17] B: Yeah.
[47:17] A: Right. Because that's what's been missing is having done the repair work on the inside now.
[47:22] B: Yeah.
[47:22] A: You've done the repair work on the inside.
[47:25] B: Yeah. You know, and I knew that was the goal for me is that, you know, I got to dig deep and get rid of stuff that I really don't even know that is there, but something's there. And that's what I said this time being sober, is that I need to really dig deep, you know, because.
[47:41] A: Yeah. And it wasn't even about digging deep. It was just. Just out. About unplugging.
[47:46] B: Yeah.
[47:47] A: Long or way early distant memories that were still active in you.
[47:54] B: Yeah.
[47:55] A: There are parts of your brain that froze. The awful moments that happened that didn't know those moments had ended. And what we did is we unplugged those moments. So the charge went away. Then the brain could see that it was data.
[48:11] B: Yeah.
[48:12] A: And then it went.
[48:12] B: Oh, right.
[48:13] A: And then it just gets filed as information about something that happened. And although I still might not like that it happened, I no longer have all the heaviness.
[48:22] B: Right.
[48:24] A: Isn't that cool?
[48:25] B: Yes. Yeah. Yes.
[48:27] A: Yeah. So this time around, even better than the last time, because what you've done is you've done the inside healing, and that makes you on a different trajectory. You're on a different course than you were. I don't know if I shared this with you, but if there's two ships set out to sea on parallel courses and one ship gets adjusted even by one degree at first, it doesn't seem like they're different. Those courses don't seem much different at all. Right. But we know that the farther and farther they move away from land, the more vastly different the course becomes.
[49:00] B: Yeah.
[49:01] A: You've put yourself on a different path than the one that you used to be on that would cyclically loop.
[49:09] B: Yeah.
[49:10] A: And have problematic using.
[49:12] B: Right.
[49:12] A: You're on a different path now.
[49:14] B: Yeah.
[49:15] A: You've changed the trajectory. You've transformed.
[49:18] B: Yeah.
[49:19] A: Right. Good job.
[49:21] B: Yeah. Thank you.
[49:24] A: Yeah.
[49:25] B: Yeah.
[49:26] A: Right. And you're on your way. And it's not that I'm leaving that person behind.
[49:30] B: Yeah.
[49:31] A: Because I'm not. I still want them to do well. I'm moving into something that's going to work better for me because I'm not her mom and I'm not running her life. I'm running mine.
[49:45] B: Right.
[49:46] A: And I still care about her and want her to do well.
[49:49] B: Yeah.
[49:49] A: Right.
[49:50] B: Exactly.
[49:51] A: Right. And when you come from that state of being.
[49:57] B: Yeah.
[49:58] A: Delivering what you're gonna say, it sets up how you say what you say to be different.
[50:04] B: Yeah. Yeah. Because right now it's totally different than the way I thought I was gonna say.
[50:11] A: Right.
[50:11] B: You know?
[50:12] A: Yeah.
[50:12] B: Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's like a relief because. Yeah.
[50:19] A: It's.
[50:19] B: It's a good thing. It's positive thing, you know?
[50:21] A: Yeah.
[50:22] B: And that's how I'm gonna. That's where I'm it. That's what it is. So.
[50:26] A: Yeah. I can't not do this. Presented with this opportunity, if she was. She also couldn't do it. Right.
[50:35] B: Right. Right. You're right. Yeah.
[50:38] A: I can't not go to college. I got accepted to. I can't. I love my sibling. They can't not go to college.
[50:44] B: Yeah.
[50:44] A: Like I gotta do the next right step for me.
[50:49] B: Yeah, Right.
[50:52] A: And now there's not hesitation and there's not a concern whether it's the right next step for you. Yeah, got it.
[51:03] B: Yes, I do.
[51:04] A: Isn't that cool?
[51:05] B: It's very cool.
[51:06] A: Right. Because now that's solidified.
[51:08] B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I feel good about it.
[51:11] A: I know.
[51:11] B: You know, I mean, I have felt good about it, but it was just worried.
[51:15] A: But notice the conflict that you had been having about it isn't there anymore.
[51:21] B: No, no, it's not. It all makes sense. And, you know, and I'm glad that I talked to you, you know, the, the mentor and I'm talking to different people about it, you know, because it's what I wanted to. And getting clarity that is, you know, I should be doing what I do.
[51:38] A: It's what works best for you.
[51:40] B: Right, Right.
[51:40] A: You're weighing it out. And the, the primary driver is what is the next right step for me?
[51:52] B: Yeah.
[51:53] A: And I'm checking. And we got it at a head level, we got it at a heart level, we got it at a gut level. And all of those are in alignment.
[52:03] B: Yeah.
[52:04] A: Right. If something's out of alignment and you can hear it in how people say it, I'll just give you this silly example. If somebody's got a really great idea and they're totally passionate about doing it, but they're just spinning their wheels, they're having a gut related issue because guts about traction and mobility. If somebody's got a really good idea and they're doing it, but they're struggling to chug along, their heart is not engaged because heart is about passion, love, connection, interest. Right. If they're fully engaged in doing something that they're passionate about totally doing it, yet it's a really bad idea, they're not using their head. So we want all three of those brains to be in alignment when we make decisions because then we know we're doing the decision. That's right. And best. That's the next best step. That's the next right step.
[53:09] B: Yeah.
[53:10] A: Got it. Cool beans.
[53:12] B: Yep.
[53:13] A: All right.
[53:14] B: Got it.
[53:14] A: You did great.
[53:15] B: Thank you.
[53:16] A: You're welcome. If anything else comes up along the way, you're welcome to get back in with me.
[53:21] B: Well, thank you so much. And honestly, you helped me tremendously. Like, and I can't say enough about you.
[53:28] A: Isn't that so?
[53:29] B: Really? Really? Oh, cool. Cuz it you. Yeah. I mean, really, seriously. Thank you.
[53:35] A: Oh, my pleasure. It's been an honor. Yeah. You did great. Cool. All right. We'll go out here and we'll be done for now.
