[00:00] A: Today is the 23rd of January, Sydney. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is really transformative, valuable, useful, life changing. The recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Sure. Okay, cool. So from what we've talked about so far, right, like one of the things that we want to do is we want to get the picker adjusted so that you're more good in you and that you're more uptime and outwardly focused. So that you're not spending a lot of time thinking or feeling about you, that you lighten up a little bit because there's been that tendency to get really down and hardening. Right. Two, we want to get the impact of the experiences, recent ones, ones a long time ago, where there's still been strong emotions. We want the effect that those things have had cleared and gone. Whether it be the stuff that you did that you wish you hadn't or stuff that happened to you. We want to get the effect that that's had on you cleared and gone. Got it. Three, I'm thinking that there's a little bit of like, you know, uneasiness in certain situations, maybe self conscious, maybe like anxious stuff that we'd like to get it so that that also settles down. Those are the big three that I'm remembering from our first meeting last year. Not really last year, but like it was last year because it was like, you know, a new year now. So that's what I'm remembering. Right. What other stuff kind of shows up? What else are we wanting our time to do for. I don't know. I'm not good at talking with people at all, if you haven't noticed. Are you better at talking to animals? Yeah, probably. Yeah. You just don't do that either. Should we do a telepathic thing? Is that better? Yeah. I'm glad. I'm only a person, not a whole group. And you only have to talk to me and you don't even have to. Right. Cause you don't actually have to be here. I do have to be here. You don't. You don't. I mean, there's other people that you could go see other than me, but you don't actually have to be. It's not you personally, it's just people in general. Don't take it personal. No, I wasn't. Yeah. Oh, so then that might be something that you want to get better. Oh. So that it's easier for you to talk to other people. Uh huh. That might be easier. Yeah. Because as you think about talking to somebody, do you get all this discomfort? Like is this thing running a mile a minute? Like worrying whether you're gonna say the right thing or not say the right thing or what is he thinking or what is he thinking about? That kind of thing's going on. Yeah. Okay, so we'd like to quiet that. Yeah. So that we could settle that down a little. What are some of the fun things that you find yourself saying to yourself? Because it's really hard to carry a conversation with somebody else when you're having that one going on within you. What's happening now? I don't know. Cuz I don't know what's wrong with me. I just don't. I can't. You already know there are glitches in the way your brain works. Yeah. I don't know. And that's not just what's wrong in you. But see all that stuff that goes on when the head does this and all the other stuff and that I can't actually mind read. That might be a good thing. But I can't really mind read them so that I know that there's something going on. But I don't know what's going on. And what could be going on is whatever it is that you find yourself saying to yourself or what you find yourself feeling. Right. Some people notice that their heart beats quicker. Some people notice that they become a little bit more jittery. Some people notice other kinds of uneasiness inside their body, different kinds of tension. Right. Even just thinking about telling me about something. What is it that you are noticing in you? That that thing that just happened, you know, when you were downright in the feeling that I like. I just can't even explain it. Like I don't know, but notice how I knew that you were downright in the feeling of it. I don't know how to talk about it. Like I don't know what's the it? Anything. Like I just can't communicate my own. Whatever. I don't know how to explain it. I know, but what is the it that you don't know how to explain when you say it? What is it what I'm thinking or feeling or I guess I don't know, I don't know what I'm supposed to say. Like there isn't. It's supposed to. That's part of the problem. You keep trying to guess what you're supposed to say to me as if there's a specific thing you're supposed to say. The thing that you're supposed to say is whatever the fuck's going on in there, which might be all I'm doing is worrying about whether I'm gonna say the right thing and what should I say. And I don't even know how to say the thing that. Right. That would be what there is to say. Right. That kind of uneasiness. Yeah. So with this thing that's been happening between us, because there's a saying. I don't know if you've ever heard it before, the saying is how you do anything is how you do everything. So part of what's been problematic for you in life is what's showing up in this dynamic. Yes. Like that whole internal conflict and turmoil over. Do I even have what there is to say? And I don't know how to express whatever it is that's going on with me. Cause I'm not even sure what the hell it is that's happening in me. That is part of what's been problematic for you? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And if that was no longer going on, meaning you no longer had that money, like, how would you actually be? I don't know. How would you be as a person, knowing that that used to be an issue where you didn't really know how to. That's no longer going on, and you knew that that used to be an issue, that it isn't anymore. Like, how would you actually be maybe kind of happy or something? Or just, I don't know, like, maybe kind of happy or something? Yeah. Yeah. What is it like when you feel kind of, like, happy or something for you? Because there's been moments you've kind of, like, felt happy or something. Yeah. Right. What's that like when you're actually feeling at ease, I guess, or just. Yeah, we got a. You. We're headed towards it. You're doing great. That's happy or something and feeling more at ease. Right. And you know when you're happy, it's happy or something, and, like, you're feeling more at ease. What's that like? Well, there's a good start. I can't put. I can't. So as the words come in, do you see them? Are they jumbled? Do you hear them? Just blank. And when it's just blank, how's your body feeling? Stressed out. Yeah, stressed out. Which is, like, more, like, tense. Yeah. Okay, so then we're on the right path when we say where we're headed is a you who's like, you know, feeling happy or something. Body's much more at ease. Yeah. A little more quiet, calm, maybe a little more settled. Because with all of that and you not feeling like you're expressing it, are you then also mad at you for not being able to express whatever it is that's there? So not only do we have this thing where it's not really, like, showing up, then I'm mad at me for it not showing up. Okay? Because we got a lot of, like, weight on this thing. And what we're doing today for you is far, far, far too important for us to be so serious. We need to lighten up. Because this shit that we're doing today, Sydney, is far too important for us to be so damn serious about it. So we need to lighten up. See, the only time you get to be serious is when we're having fun. Because serious fun is good. Right? And this is. I want you to get it. It's you and I collaborating on what's been problematic for you. You. And part of what's been problematic for you is feeling like I can't speak. What's really there? I don't know how to say or what to say or is to say or. Or. Or. Right. So it's really you and I, because guess what? Do you like feeling this way? Do you like it, like, not being able to? Right. Do you like that at all? No. So what if you're not the problem? You know how I know you're not the problem? You don't like it, so clearly you're not the problem. But instead, what's been problematic for you has been some glitches and errors in the way your complicated supercomputer of a brain has been working. And this is the issue that's on the table for us to get addressed so. So that it stops doing that to you. So where we're headed is a you that's like, you know, happy or something, feeling more at ease. Got it? And you don't have to know how we're gonna get there, okay? Because the question isn't how it's gonna happen. The question is, would it be. See, would it be okay with you? You know, would it feel happy or something? It would be okay. Right? And if we were to visually represent that problematic way brain works, that kind of thing, that if we were to represent it on, like, an artist canvas, right. Would it be more dark colors or, like, you know, to represent that problematic way more jagged or more Smooth. Right. So we're done. Right. Then we're headed towards the you who's, you know, feeling, like, happy or something, where her body's much more at ease. And knowing that that's okay with you. We have a green light to organize. One of the things that organizes brain and accelerates brain's response are things that are symbolic. I don't think I shared that with you before. But we know that our unconscious, emotional brain responds to symbols because advertisers use them. And if that part of our brain didn't respond to symbols, then they wouldn't use them at all. Right. It's why when you're driving down the road and you see a big yellow arch, you immediately think of McDonald's, even if you weren't hungry. Right. If you see somebody sneaker with the swoosh, you immediately think of Nike. Got it? Right. So they're symbols for the company. We want to get a way to symbolize the future you were headed to. Right. The one who's feeling happy or something. Body's much more at ease. And if we were to symbolize the future you, we can use either a wild animal or something out in nature, maybe something that grows from the ground, something up in the sky. We're gonna make it up to symbolize the future you who's feeling happy or something more at ease. Right. And if it were to be a wild animal or something out in nature, what is it that comes to mind to symbolize the future? Remember, we make it up now, which you may have done one before, but who cares? Right. We didn't have this outlined. Feeling happy or something more at ease. What represents or will symbolize for us this future you. And there's no wrong or right answer. A bird. I don't know. A bird. Beautiful. When you see the bird, is it moving or still? And, like, soaring or flapping? Yeah. So we got a soaring bird being a powerful sister, because we also think of the birds soaring, the birds free. And we're really interested in you being free because do you know what we like about not being in jail or prison? Right. We both know that. Right, Exactly. So we're organizing toward you becoming more free to be that much more okay in you, to lighten up on you, to be more at peace in you, to experience more comfort in you so that you're more at ease. Got it. And then we're going to utilize some brain levers. Neuroscience teaches us that when you use brain levers, it can put the body in states of rest. And whenever you Want to accelerate healing. We need to move from a stressed out state into a more relaxed state or a resting state. Because if I've got a cold or flu or after surgery they're going to tell me rest. It allows accelerated healing from within. So we've got some really cool levers. First one's silly. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. So it's not like ah, it's just a little. When you slightly lower your jaw, it activates the vagal nerve that connects to our enteric system which covers all of the vital organs in our body. So you slightly lower your jaw. Second lever is you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. That's right. So your jaw is slightly lowered and you rest your tongue. The third lever is we just begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower on the inhale and a little bit deeper, deeper on the inhale. So it's more of a. And then a little bit longer on the exhale. So go ahead and slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Breathe in a way that's a little bit slower, deeper so that you exhale a little bit longer. Right. And as you begin to breathe in this way, just check inside. How's your body feeling now? Again, more tense or more calm? It does feel a little bit more calm. Now we want to add our symbol. So what you're going to do is you're going to slightly lower your jaw and rest your tongue. You're gonna look up and think soaring bird. Take a nice slow breath in and then exhale so that you're now breathing a little bit slower, deeper and longer. Right. We add to that the next. So again, look up and out. Think soaring bird. Deep breath in and then long exhale. See, it's already starting to work. That's right. Without you having to do much at all and see where the change is going to happen. This is the cool part. It doesn't require effort. It doesn't take a lot of work on your part. Because where it's changing is that that automatic level, the inside level, how cuts heal inside out, not outside in. We're interested in adjusting things from the inside out so that your unconscious part of your brain becomes more responsive naturally to working the way that you want it to makes sense. So again, look up and out. Think soaring bird. Deep breath in this time, exhale and close your eyes. Good. And then you can open your eyes. Very simple, right? We want to repeat the process each time we add something to it. It's increasing mind response. So this time, again, look up and out. Face soaring bird. Deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Good. That's right. It's already working. You think that this yawning thing isn't part of the process? That's right. But are you consciously choosing to yawn? You're not, are you? But your body only yawns when it's trying to get to instead of rest. That's right. So your body, which is the thing that's most closely connected to unconscious processing, is becoming more responsive to you towards the future you that's been symbolized by the soaring bird feeling happy or something in love. So again, think soaring bird. Breathe in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Good. Eyes are closed. When your eyes are closed, notice that your eyes can rest. Because when your eyes are resting closed, you might realize you can also rest. You can hear my voice and background sounds. And even know how it feels to be seated in the way you are noticing them all at the same time. Take a deep breath in. And then a long exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And again. Those short moments eyes were closed, what did you begin to notice within yourself? A little bit more calmness. And we wouldn't want to feel a little bit more calmer even so. Because as you're calming down, it's increasing the other than conscious part of your brain's responsiveness. That part, by the way, Sydney has direct access to the control panels. It makes knows which buttons to press and knobs to turn. It knows which levers to shift and switches to flip. So it reorganizes your brain to work naturally more in the way that you would be wanting it to. That's right. And so one more time, think about the soaring bird. Breathing in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. Eyes are closed. They rest. When eyes rest, you can also rest. You're aware of your breath. You can hear my voice. You might notice thoughts, background sounds, and how it feels to be seated in the way you are able to notice it all at the same time. The unconscious parts of your brain are responding, Responding towards the future you that's been symbolized by the soaring bird. Feeling happier. Something much more at ease. Because everything that needs to happen has already begun happening from within. And what we know about change is that it happens at the deeper levels first. Before you ever even notice things are changing. That's right. Take one more deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And again. What are you noticing? Right side. How's your body Feeling now feeling a little bit more relaxed. It's feeling even a little more relaxed each time. It's kind of more and more and more because it's in the cons collaboration of what you and I are intending. We're intending the same thing. And do you know what happens when people bring intention together? When two people have the same intention and they're really interested in it and what they're doing is all for what they're intending. It no longer is a 11 which equals 2. It literally becomes exponential that 1 and 1 equals 11. Because it's in that intention, that collaboration, that begins to cause change. There's a great TEDx video, like 15 minutes of this guy, I think his name is Jonathan Hari, talking about the opposite of addiction is connection. Because they did research with a rat in a cage by itself with a, you know, heroin and water. And the rat will go to the heroin every time till it dies. But if you put that rat in a cage with lots of fun activities for rats like the loop de loops and the runny thing and other rats, that it knows and likes that connection threatening every once in a while, but not right. Not every 90% of the soldiers when they were in Vietnam were using heroin. And not 90% of the soldiers when they came back were using addicted. Isn't that weird? It's because they had other connections. And we as human beings were people who are interested in connection. That's the human nature. If I can't connect because of traumas or other things that have happened in life with people, then I might connect to the substance. Isn't that interesting? So you and I are collaborating towards this future. You. I'm totally wanting it for you. It's also what you're interested in. So we're bringing our energies together and energy expands. So now we want to do the same process. You're going to think about the soaring birds. You'll take that slow breath in. You'll exhale. That's right. Your jaw is slightly lowered. You rest your tongue. You can look across and see me in my nose. As you stay looking at my nose, my fingers are going to open out. Look at my nose as my fingers go out. You see them wiggling as you look at my nose. The sides of your eyes, your peripheral vision is picking up my fingers wiggling. That means you're in connection with more space. Notice that you can see me, but also pick up the side windows and doors. You can see the space beyond me. You can sense the space behind you. You know, there's space underneath you, and there's space up above. And that this space literally moves beyond the room, all the way out in all directions. This space is unending. Think about the soaring bird. Take another breath in this time, as you exhale, close your eyes. You might notice. That's right. That as your eyes are closed and resting closed, you can also rest, aware of the background sounds, my voice, how it feels to be seated in the way you are. Your unconscious now is responding towards what that soaring bird symbolizes, already beginning to make changes at the deeper levels while you rest. That's right. Which means lots is going on without you having to do anything at all. Just simply happening as you rest. Which means again that the next time your eyes rest closed, it'll be even easier to drift deeper inside side towards that calm and peaceful flowing energy. And then when you're ready, take a big breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. All right. And how's your body feeling now? It is feeling a little less tense. That's right. And so I'd like you to think of a time when you were outside and in nature and you see something beautiful. Like the moment you're looking at it, it's got your attention. You're like, what is it that you see? It's like a sunset. Like, I don't know. Yeah, it's a sunset. And what happens with the sky and the colors and the vibrant colors? Maybe the reds and the oranges and the pinks. Right? And in that moment that you're seeing the sunset and the sky with the vibrant colors you're feeling and the that moment, a sense of peace, all wonder, excitement. And somebody might say to you, well, duh, of course, seeing that is going to give you those feelings. But if we looked at it from a different lens, we could say that seeing that, experiencing it, being there, simply drew your awareness down and inside towards your center. Because what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited? Kind of like if I'm at the campfire and my hands are cold, and I say, boy, I need to heat them up. And as I bring them closer to the flames, I say, holy cow, the fire is getting hotter. And you simply say to me, no, the fire's not any hotter. I'm becoming much more aware of the heat because my hands are getting closer to the flames. So we could then say that in your life, there have been multitudes of occurrences, times and situations where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Stressors, upsets, angers, angst, guilt, shame, sadness, Hurts, pain. But no matter where awareness has been, what if always at your center, you're peaceful and excited in the same way, you can tell that two of us are in here. How do you know? Well, your senses bring in data. Your intellect organizes it. You look around, right? That we call knowledge. Sometimes people call knowledge light. We'll call it light of knowledge. Well, what if that at your center, that there's an even brighter light? It's the light of wisdom. So now we've got the light of knowledge, and we've got the light of wisdom. And I work with all sorts of people, have had all sorts of stuff happen. Recent stuff, long time ago stuff. I remember this one girl that I worked with, you know, when she was like 5 or 6, her older brother used to take GI Joe figures and park them in her. So she had a lot of duck around, all of that. But when we worked together, we completely cleared out all the pain, the disgust, the anger, the hurt, the shame was gone. And I asked her the question. I said, you know, all of that. I go, where was it? And she looked at me, she had this big smile on her face. She goes, it's gone. I don't feel it. I go, I know. Isn't that cool? She said, yeah. I said, but my question was, where was it? And the two of us started thinking. I go, was it at the surface level? And she's like, well, no, it wasn't an intellectual thing. I said, oh, well, then maybe it was hiding in your center. And she's like, come on, man. How could that stuff survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited? And I went, oh, well, then where was it? And this is what she said. She goes, you know what it was hiding? And the shadows between those lights, lights of knowledge and wisdom. I said, well, what happened to it? She goes, the lights were brought together. They joined. The shadows are gone. And I said, whoa, isn't that cool? And she went, yeah. And then we started talking about how people screw up their identity all the time. Happens to me in my world. People come in and they say to me things like, they're anxious, they're shy, they're depressed, they're obsessed with compulsive. They think that the way they feel is who they are, right? But you know, what if we're not any of those things? People oftentimes walk around thinking that I am my body, that my body is me. But what if you're not your body? What if you have a body that your body's totally yours? But what if it's not you, I know that to be true because my mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident. And when she visits people now, they don't say to her, suzy, I'm glad almost all of you showed up. She's all there, even though that part's missing. So you have a body. Your body is yours, but it isn't actually you. We have thoughts, right? Thoughts are things that we have. But are you actually a thought? Did you know that you're not even the thought thinker of your own thoughts? I mean, how often do you think, oh, I'm going to think this thought now? Never, right? They just kind of pop up. So you're not even the thinker of your thoughts. Your brain is the thinker of your thoughts. And what if your brain is not you? What if your brain is totally yours, but it's not actually you? So you're not your body, you're not your thoughts. Well, then maybe your brain what you do. Except you've done a lot of things in life, and when you stop doing one of those things to do a different thing. Did you stop existing? No. Weird, right? So if I'm not what my do? Well, maybe you must be how you feel. But shit, you feel different ways at different times, don't you? So you can't possibly be a feeling. Now the weirdness comes in. Because if you're not what you do, and if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not your feelings, and if you're not your body. Holy cow, Sydney. What the heck are you? Weird question, right? So for our purposes, let's just say that who you really are is what you became aware of as you see the sunset and the bright vibrant colors, the oranges, the pinks, the red, that the who you are is the light at the center. And you know what light that is you. It can't be touched, it can't be heard, it can't be harmed. It's whole and complete and totally indestructible. And I say that because people do screw up identity, right? I'm anxious, I'm shy, I'm depressed. If I go to the dentist and I'm upset, and you go, why? I say, you'll never believe what he did. And you go, what did he do? Well, he put me on a chair, right? And immediately as I sat down, my head is going down, my feet are going up, right? He positioned this light right in my eyes. I can't see anything. Blinded by this thing. Then he took a cold metal instrument, shoved it inside of me, and you're like, oh, my. In your what? I go, sit in my mouth, right? Because I have got one. I'm not. And you know what? That's the same thing that I said to the girl with the GI Joe figures and her brother. I said, when you were little, he messed with your stuff. And then she looked at me with that same smile and she goes, yeah, he did. And for a long time, that hurt my feelings and it screwed up my thinking. Then she went, but you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body. It screwed up my thinking. But he. He never touched me. And I said, whoa, that's cool. So again, think of the soaring bird, right? Look up and out. Think soaring bird. Deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes slightly. Lower your jaw and rest your tongue. Continue to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower. Deeper. Longer on the exhale. As you are, awareness can open up to notice more space all around you. In front of you. There, there's space underneath you, there's space to your right, there's space to your left, there is space behind you is space. Up above you. Space. And imagine now floating above and out of your body, beyond the ceiling and the roof, so that you rise way up above it all in the sky. You're having this bird's eye view. You're able to see everything as being under and below you. Because you're above, you're over it. And just like the soaring bird, you are imagining. Imagine being the bird now. Soaring free. Flying free. Gliding free. Up above and over it all. That's right. Your unconscious now is wonderfully responsive to you. Towards the future you were intending, feeling happy or something, and much more at ease. All of this is going on simply as you rest. That's right. That's right. And so, whenever you're ready, once again, as awareness drifts back down and inside, reassociating within you, you'll take a nice, slow, deep breath in. And then a big exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And again. Those short moments, what were you noticing within yourself? Sleepy. I wasn't focused on anything else. I was just all that crap running through my head. You didn't have all that crap, right? It was a little quieter and you were simply resting. Maybe even taking Gaja from sleep. I don't want to fall asleep. That'd be bad. He's really thinking he's boring. He already thinks I don't like him, right? So things are starting to settle Down. We're interested in organizing. There are three pieces that keep any emotional charge stuck in us. The first piece is when we go through something troubled, it short circuits the brain. At that level, part of the brain never knows that it's over. It's stuck on always. The issue is, that part got disintegrated from the rest of my nervous system. So I moved forward. That part didn't. And it's constantly looking for anything that's a reminder of what I went through that was bad. So that's the first part. Therapy missed the boat because they go, well, you buried it. You got to get it out. Swallowed the conflict. We got to throw it up. None of that actually works to get people to feel better because people didn't swallow the emotion and they didn't lock it behind closed doors, and they didn't shove it on the carpet and they didn't repress it. It's literally that when it happened, boom, it short circuited the brain. And that part, no, got that. It ended. Even though I know crazy, right? Second thing that keeps it stuck. When we're little, we're trained to believe, lied to by the people that matter to us, that life is good. Good things happen. Because I'm good, great. If life is always good, right? Little kids learn that it's my world, everybody else lives in it, right? We have the longest incubation period where people have to constantly tend to us because we go. And everybody comes rushing. Do you need food? Do you need changing? Do you need hugs? You need. Right? So we live in that. It's my world, everybody else lives in it. So I become real self conscious. And then if it's bad, it's totally my fault. Totally my fault. All the bad stuff is my fault. Not that I don't know differently when I'm an adult, but because that's what I learned first. That's what still sticks. So whenever we go through something bad, it totally feels like it was about me. When mom and dad get divorced, it doesn't feel like it was a mom and dad issue. It feels like if daddy cared more about me, if I was more lovable, then dad would still be around. It must have something to do with an inequity. Something that's not okay in me. Isn't that crazy, right? So now we got a bad thing that happens. The meaning gets attached, makes me feel worse about me. And then, of course, because my brain is about keeping me alive, it scans, it searches, it looks for anything that's similar to anything that was Painful, constantly confusing. Similar as saying, right? The dramatic example is the soldier diving on the ground when the firework bursts in the air. Because he was at Disney with his young daughter. Now he knows he's at Disney, he knows he's with his young daughter. But because it made a similar sound, that other part of his brain dove him to the ground, going, incoming. And everybody else looks and goes, what is wrong with him? That's one of the things, right? And that's a big and dramatic, but it could be little. The guy's making out with the gal. He's totally into her. She's totally into him. It's feeling really good. She touches his inner thigh and he gets tense and he goes, what the hell is wrong with me? The girl who I'm into is touching me in a way that, you know, should feel good. And I did this. Yeah, but is there any similarity to Uncle Mike when he was 11? Well, yeah, Uncle Mike did the same thing. And then. Yeah, but Uncle Mike had big sausage fingers. This was dainty female with pretty nails to matter, hand is assumed as hand. Make sense. So that stuff continues to run us over and over and over again. We'll call them the unconscious blueprints that we don't even know that we're on. Right? Because the things that control us the most are always the things that are most unconscious, right? But see, that's really cool because the unconscious part knows how to heal itself. It also knows which experiences that have happened in your life would be useful to unplug and clear. Right? Because what we do as human beings is we learn ways to not think about the shit that makes me feel bad. Do that on purpose. Because like whenever I do think about it, I feel bad. So why the hell would I want to do that, right? So instead we learn ways to not think about stuff. The problem is we can't always not think about it. Because sometimes something reminds me of it when I didn't even want it to. And sometimes I think about it. At times I didn't want to be thinking about it, but I did. That's what we want to get shifted so that that stops. Make sense? So one more time, let's think of the soaring bird. Look up and out. Soaring bird. Deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Eyes are closed and resting. Closed. Lowering the jaw. Resting the tongue. Breathing slower, deeper, longer. At the same time that you're resting, your unconscious is organizing towards what the soaring bird symbolizes this future you feeling happier, something much more at ease, quiet, calm, clear. Just like the Ocean that no matter what's at the surface, rough, stormy, choppy water. No matter what's going on at that level, at the bottom, the deepest lover, like at your center, it's always calm, peaceful, clear. So that your beginning to lighten up on you are becoming more okay inside. Your unconscious now has everything it needs to make adjustments. And your unconscious now might surprise you by bringing a moment to your awareness that you might not have thought about for a long time. That would be useful for us to unplug and clear so that as we do it frees up energy and resources to restructure and reorganize your brain so that it becomes more optimized to naturally work more in the way you want. All of this Sydney's happening now at many different levels and layers, whether you fully realize it or not. Which means the next time you rest and eyes are closed, it'll be even easier to just drop, drop down, all the way down and in towards delight at your center, that calm and peaceful, ongoing, easy flowing energy that is you. So as ever so slowly begin by taking your time to very slowly find your way back up and up and up. Or really quickly back up and eyes are open. Sorry, you're trying to go to sleep on purpose. No, I'm just interested in things common down inside so that we get to different brainwave states and can access information that would be really useful. Right. So as you and I are organizing towards the future, you symbolized by the soaring bird, you know, feeling happy or something much more at ease. Your unconscious conscious travels back down the timeline of experiences in your own history. Shit that happened that sucked, stuff that you did or happened to you where there's still strong emotion. It's going to begin to gather and group those moments. But then it'll narrow, pinpoint and bring a particular moment to your awareness for us to clear. Right. What moments coming to mind now? Yeah, that one happened when you might have been howled. Don't worry if it's like donkey, pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me. Because we know more than one comes to mind. Lots for people. So one that come to mind happened when you might have been how old or about how long ago? Fourteen. Yeah. And the feeling tones as you think about it. Is it feeling of hurt or sadness or anger or grief or resentment or pain or guilt or shame or a combination? Grief, sadness. Yeah. So first question, Would it be okay to get the grief and sadness gone? And if the grief and sadness was gone, would it in any way, shape or form mean that what happened Was okay. Right. You get to be okay. Even though. Though that wasn't. So to clear thing really, really simple requires one thing, you to have the intention of being with me. And the reason that you want to be with me is that this is what's happening and that isn't. Two, we're working on the goal that we both want for you. And three, I'm hoping to be at least a little more fun than a sucky moment. Got it. Second, you're going to tell me just facts. In a minute or less it'll go, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened and was done. Three, if it happened when you were 14, there have been many things you've done after that that were more enjoyable than that. What's one thing anytime from 14 until yesterday that was more enjoyable than that moment? More enjoyable than that moment? Yeah. For you, anything in life that was more enjoyable from 14? Well, we know going to Kohl's and buying those sneaks, way more enjoyable. Right. So we got buying the sneaks way more enjoyable in the moment. Right. Good. It was, wasn't it? Yes. Yeah. Good. Something else. So we don't have to go to top tier experiences. Just, you know, something getting your nails done. Yeah. Way more enjoyable than that moment, wasn't it? Yes. Yeah. Right. And one other thing. I can't think of stuff like that. Well, of course you can. Doing something with a friend, having a nice meal. Yeah. Going out to dinner with my friend. Yeah. Going out to dinner with your friend more enjoyable than that moment. All those things happen after that. There's a part of your brain that froze it and doesn't know anything beyond that moment. So we have good news to get in. Right. So when the moment happened and you were 14 when it happened, you were where? So you're in South Carolina. Right. Were you in a house or an apartment house? Right. And was it daytime or nighttime? And you're wearing the house, like kitchen, living room, dining room, bedroom. Right. You're in a bedroom. Right. And you're wearing the bedroom, like on the bed, on the floor, in a chair. You're on the bed. Right. And like under the covers or over the covers, just sitting on the bed. So you're sitting on the bed. Right. Good. And then what happened next? Or you're sitting on the bed. Right. And then what happened? What do you want? Somebody came in wearing a clown nose? No, no, that's not what happened. So then tell me what happened. That was when my dad died. So you're sitting on the bed Right. In your dad's. Where? In a hospital bed in the house. Right. Good. So you're right. And then dad stopped breathing at some point. And then they came over and told you. Who came over and told me? I don't know. You were sitting on the bed in your bedroom. Yes. The whole family was there. Right. But you're in the bed in the bedroom, sitting on the. Oh, you're sitting on the bed with dad. The hospital bed. I'm sitting on my parents bed. Oh, you're sitting on your parents bed. Right. Yes. There we go. See, now I'm getting detail. Now I'm getting what happened. Good job. Remember, I'm not so good at that migrating thing. I don't know if I'm doing this right. And we're in Beaufort, South Carolina. Right. So you're sitting on the bed. Right. Other people are also in the bedroom. And dad's in a hospital bed in the bedroom. Got it. Okay, now we got it. Right? There we go. And then what happened next? Well, then dad's body. Then dad stopped breathing. Right. And like you were there. Right. And then did you like touch dad's body? Right. And notice how he didn't feel quite the same? Right. Because dad wasn't in there anymore. Right. And then other people were crying. You might have been crying. Then what might have happened next? Be here because I'm fun. At least more fun than that moment. I don't have to try hard. That was a sucky one. So be here. Right. And then what happened next? Everything changed. Well, then people walked out of the room. Right. Did an ambulance or hospice people or whatever. They would have been there. Right. And then somebody might have taken the body. Right. And then that moment ended. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to Kohl's to get sneaks, you know, get your cool nails done. Right. Have a nice meal with a friend. Right? Now notice as you were telling me about it, there was discomfort. Not because that was such a sucky moment, but because your brain was confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience. It's actually causing the discomfort, trying to motivate you to get that moment to stop. Good news. It has. So here's a crazy part about memory. Have you ever noticed nobody tells a memory in reverse? Nobody tells it from the ending all the way back to the beginning. Everybody tells it from the beginning towards the ending. But when you go backwards, it literally unplugs the memory and it takes away the charge. Right. So we're gonna go backwards. So we Got having that meal with friend. We got getting the cool nails done, right. We got going to the Coles and getting the sneaks, right? And then before that, you know, the body was taken, right? And then they might have gotten there. And then people were crying, right? And then you touch dad's body and didn't quite feel the same. And then dad's body, he took it. Dad's body took its last breath, right? And then you were all sitting there. And then somebody said, you need to come in because we think it's towards the end, right? And then before that, all relatives came over. And then before that you were off doing whatever you're doing right now. As I ran through it backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it? Same. More or less same. Was it identically the same as when you told it to me? Really? No way. No way. Come on. It was different. The same. Oh, it was different. But the same. But the same. Same information? Yes. Different feeling. The feeling was exactly the same. I mean, don't tell me what you think I want to hear, right? But check it out. Notice. Notice how it was a little different even though you thought it was the same? No. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. You're doing great. Cause it's fun. Well, more fun than that was. I mean, being here with me. Way more fun than that, Right? Cause then we have the whole part that everything changed. We haven't gotten there yet. We'll get to that a little bit. Okay. But first we gotta unplug the memory. Because it doesn't mean that the memory didn't happen. And we're not going to erase it because we can't get that moment to have not happened. But there's a lot of context that you didn't know at 14 that you can learn now. Right? And the deal with all emotion is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening have been glued together. So at that level, anytime you thought about it emotionally, your brain is thinking, your dad's dying then. Now. Got it. Is dad dying now? He died then. But anytime you think about it, your brain is thinking, your dad's dying now. Then hurry. Whole thing is screwed up. Got it. And it's only because we got this logical brain that can time travel and this emotional brain that works like an animal. That's only now make sense. So we want to get that adjusted. So where the brain also screws things up is that it screws up things in that the pattern of association, the memory and the experience glued. There are things you can remember doing today that you know you're not doing, like putting your sneaks on. You can remember doing it. You might even remember where you were when you did it. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your snakes sneaks on. And then I went, sydney, stop putting on your sneakers. You go, I'm not putting on my sneakers. Because you know there's a big difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually doing it. They're not the same thing. Right? You can remember that happening, right? Dad's body taking its last breath, right? You know, touching dad's body and it not feeling like it was when dad was there. But you can remember that happening. Remember the family members being there and the people in the field, right? You can remember all that happening. You can remember putting your sneakers on. Sydney, stop putting on your sneakers. Say, I am not putting on my sneakers. Say that. I'm not putting on my sneakers. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you are not putting on your shirt. Well then you stop putting on your pants. Say I'm not putting on my pants. Say that. Well, stop me from putting on my pants. Say you're not putting on your pants. We'll stop dad's body from taking its last breath. It's not taking its last breath. Say that. Well then stop that from happening. Say that's not happening. Well then you stop putting on your sweatshirt. Say I'm not putting on my sweatshirt. Well then stop that from happening. Say that's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Think of which is what we want to get in, right? We want to get in that. It's data, memory and info about something that happens happen that sucked. What we don't want is your brain continuing to play it as if it's happening. Oh, there's a good. Alright, we're getting there. You're doing great. I'm so proud of you. I really am. Right, right. Because there's a couple other things. Do you have any like any beliefs about what happens when people die? You know, that at least provides some sort of comfort? No, I need religious beliefs. Anything like that. God, Heaven. Heaven? Where's heaven? Freaking far away. Yeah, right. No wonder why I don't feel him with me if I think he's way there or way down there. I mean, who knows, right? I know we think he's way out there. Okay, but see, there's a thought, right? I'm going to give you a thought experiment. So if we did a kind of cool thing with a kid we took a glass of ice, we put it out on the patio, right? To kind of show him something. Hour goes by, kid comes back, looks the ice is gone, water's there. And he goes, holy cow, somebody stole the ice and replaced it with water. And we would say, no, they didn't replace it with water. We know it evaporated. It went from the. No, sorry, it went from. It went to liquid. So it went from the solid state of ice into the liquid state of water. What is the same. The molecule that's making up the water is the same molecule that made up the ice. Our perception of it totally changed. Kid goes, alright, I get that. We now leave that glass of water out on the patio. And a week goes by and the kid comes back and says, somebody drank the water, the water's gone, somebody stole it. And we would say, no, nobody drank it, nobody stole it. And the water's not actually gone, it evaporated. It did go from liquid state into gas state. But again, the H2O molecule, the thing that makes it up totally the same, our perception and how we pick it up completely change. Now the kid is looking at us like we're crazy. Because if I don't see it, how can I feel it? We go, oh, right, you live in Florida, it's all around you. And then we put him in the desert of Arizona and we go, you don't feel any of it here, do you? And we bring him back to Florida and we show them the rain clouds and we capture the water and the kid discovers, oh, my goodness, it's all the same thing. So what if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, it's that their body stopped and because they're no longer in need of it, they exit it. We don't pick them up in the same way we used to, but it doesn't actually mean that they're not here. See, we got this representation. Representation that heaven's far above. But what if it isn't so far away? What if it's right here? We don't pick it up in the way that our five senses pick things up. But our five senses, we already know, are very limited in what we can perceive. Right? Because we can go out to your car, turn the radio on and music will start playing. Right? But wasn't the radio wave there before you turned on the car? Before we turn on the radio? It's here right now. Do you feel it? I don't feel it, no. So there's a limit in what we can perceive, even though we know that things are here. Same thing with cell phone. We know there's some sort of frequency that allows this thing to pick up. Go to the Internet, do all. Do you feel any of it? I don't feel any of it either. Right. And we know that dogs. I can blow a whistle and we're like. And the dog is going, is the whistle not making a sound or is the sound outside of our range? Right. You and I can be walking off the plane and this other guy's carrying something. The dog's like, I didn't smell the coke. The dog certainly did. Right. So notice that our senses are limited in what we can pick up, but we know that there's a lot of things here that we can't pick up. So what if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, it's that their body stops and because they're no longer need of it, they exit it and see what happens? Frequently it's the shock. Boom. Of having known them in our. In their body that blocks our access to experiencing them with us in an ongoing way. That's what we call frozen grief. Right. I worked with a guy, married 42 years, wife got ALS. She died horribly grief stricken. Every time he thought about her, completely in pain because every time he thought about her, the moment that kept coming up first was him kissing her cold forehead as her body was wounded. With that moment there, what was it blocking access to? All the other moments that he experienced in being with his wife through 42 years of marriage, in which is there more of that one moment or all of the other moments that he experienced? Right. So when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop. And what do we actually get from the people that matter to us? Is it the trinket? Is it the. Is it the things or is it the experiences? Right. And once you've acquired an experience, Cindy, can you actually lose the experience? No. Nobody can take away me going to Disney for the first time when I was 7. So I can't lose the experience. Can you lose things that you don't yet have? Can you lose something you've never acquired? No. Weird, right? So if you can't lose what you've acquired and you can't lose things that you've never acquired, then where's the loss? What if it's when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop, it's that their body stop and what's in the way is the shock of Knowing them when they were in their body that we don't feel them with us. Einstein, really smart dude, right? You've heard of him before? I know that he was really smart. Because anybody who's super smart now, what are they called? Frickin Einstein, right? So the dude had to be brilliant. He said two things that are real important for our conversation. One, energy plus matter equals this physical touchable difference, right? And then what became the second law of the thermal dynamics? Energy cannot be destroyed, it transforms. So what if when people's bodies stop, it's not that they stop, it's that their bodies stop, right? No longer in need of it, so they exit. It doesn't mean that he's not here, right? And he's been doing better with this thing than you have for a while. And he's actually interested in you, doing really well with it. Because he's not interested in your hurting. Because here's the deal. Your sadness, like shows up, like why I feel sad. Sad is for my love. Like I love my dad, right? And the sadness is my badge of honor, showing you how much I love my dad, right? But it does the sadness serve him? Is he better off with you feeling crappy? Are you better off feeling crappy? Wouldn't it be better to feel him with you, right? Which is what's starting to happen by beginning to unplug the memories. Because you can remember it happening. You remember being there, sitting on the bed, like their bed, right? Him in the hospital bed. Remember all the family there, right? Noticing that his body took its last breath, right? People start crying, you go and you touch dad and you. Dad doesn't feel the same way he did, right? Wasn't computable. Wasn't understandable. But what you didn't know in that moment is that when dad's body stopped working. It's not that dad stopped, dad simply exited it, right? And I'll show you something that I think is really cool. So this is a ping pong ball. Most people play ping pong at some time, right? But this ping pong ball is different because it's got metal pieces on it. But what's cool about the ping pong ball is when you touch the metal pieces, it makes noise, right? So if you took that finger and touched the middle piece, it doesn't do anything. Isn't that weird? But if you keep your finger there and touch with the other finger, other hand, touch this over here. That's weird. Isn't it cool? How is it doing that? Right? How is it doing it Energy. Yeah. So think of it. Electric current. Electric current. A light switch, when it's off, has an opening. So it's off. When the light switch is turned on, it connects and the energy flows. When we're here, it connects. When it was the opening, it didn't. When we connected, the energy was flowing. Isn't that cool? So again, who we are is energy plus matter equals the physical existence. And because we live in the world of COVID we have to do these things. I get in trouble if I don't. But who we are is energy plus matter. And see again, what that younger you didn't know is that when dad's body stopped, it's not that he stopped. Right? Because check it out. How many years ago is that now? A lot of years. And let me just check for you. Has your love diminished? Do you love him any less now? Right. Like you didn't stop loving him Right. Now that he's no longer in his body, that didn't stop your love. So your love right now is as strong as it's always ever been. And he fully feels it. The flip side is his love for you is as strong as it's always ever been. The difference is that you haven't been fully feeling it. Not because it's not here, but because the shock of knowing him the way you did blocked access to experiencing more of who he is. Because who dad is for you is in the experiences you acquired in being with him. I remember a woman came into my office and I thought she was confessing. She says, you know, my parents are in my closet. And I went, what? What? She goes, no, no, no, the remains of my parents are in my closet. I go, no, your parents are not in your closet. And that's not what remains of your parents. Your parents weren't even their body to begin with. Your parents are in the experiences. Right. So who is dad for you? As you think of the experiences that you acquire in being with. Who is dad for you? My daddy. He is your daddy. Right. And in the likes and the things that are the similarities, the stuff you got from him. Right. What is it that you and dad enjoy doing? Just going, doing stuff together. Just being. I know. Just going, doing stuff together. Right. Was there a specific thing? Going fishing. Going fishing. Yeah. Right. He kind of taught you what to do? Uh huh. Yeah. And for you that was a fun experience? My dad did that to me and it was not. And I wanted to touch the worm and piss drink, you know, that's me. This is a good one for you. Right. See, I wonder what it would be like to send Stad with you anytime you fish, anytime you see one of those ponds, rivers or lakes, even though you're not in South Carolina that you know he would love to be. Right? Right? And see, the last little part is that 14 year old you and I know, lots of things changed, right? But the 14 year old, you didn't know that she was going to be okay. Now, okay doesn't mean great. Okay? Doesn't mean like life is grand and everything works when wonderfully and nothing but, you know, milk and cookies and peaches and cream. But see, what we know that the 14 year old you didn't know, right, Is that you're okay. That you didn't actually need him to be in his body, to know him the way that you did. In order for you to be okay. In order for you to grow up. Right? Do you have kids? Huh? Do you love them? Sometimes. That's what I say, have time. It's not that I love them sometimes. Sometimes they're really hard to love. How old are yours? 12 and 23. Yeah. Okay, so you get it, right? Right? That the 14 year old you didn't know, that you didn't need him in order for you to turn out okay, to love your own kids, to get really cool nails done, right? Pick Cole's books, right? Right. So in a moment, what's going to happen is you're going to close your eyes. You're going to picture that younger 14 year old. You're gonna let her know that that moment is over, finished, completed. That it no longer exists. You're gonna let her know that dad is much more than his body. That who he is for you is much more than that moment. Right? You're gonna let her know that you're okay. You're gonna let her know about her own kids. You're gonna let her know about coldplux. You're gonna let her know, right? About having a nice meal with a friend. You're gonna let her know that you're okay. So go ahead and close your eyes. Imagine picturing the younger you back then, just after that happened, all the feeling letters. Let her know that that moment is over, finished, completed, that it no longer exists. Let her know that dad first you is much more than that moment. That your love for him is ongoing just like his is for you. Let her know about fishing. Let her know about her own kids. Let her know. Fucking cool sneaks. Let her know, put him nice meal. Let her know that you're okay. That you didn't need him to be okay. Right. And as that starts to get in to the earlier you, what do you notice happening to her face? I'm supposed to answer that only out loud. Why do you know? Because I'm supposed to be focused here. Only one of us can screw this thing up, Amber, and it's not you. I don't know about that. No, it isn't, because it can't be you, because you don't know what we're doing. The only one that can totally screw this thing up is me. Yeah? What'd you notice happen in the earlier you? She getting older, maturing. I don't know. She looking so troubled. She's not looking so troubled. She isn't, is she? Right. She's getting that she's okay despite having a really yucky thing happen. Right. Not that she'd sign up to go through it again, but the only people who sign up to go through adversity to get stronger are the Navy SEALs. Because those guys are crazy. The rest of us don't sign up for it and get it anyway Shit. Right? Yeah. Right. And even as you're checking in with that memory, that moment now, what are you noticing? A little bit of weight lifted onto the heart. It is, isn't it? Isn't that cool? Yeah. And see, what started to open now is your connection. See, the connection with dad has always been there. It just got a little bit, you know, dust. We're just polishing the connection so that you can sense and feel his love for you. Really interested in what you're doing now. Really interested in you doing things to have your life work better for you and those that matter you. Really interested in your becoming more okay with what happened. Because he also doesn't like that it happened. But he's been more at peace with it. Because where he got to that you hadn't been, but are getting to now is. Although none of us like that, it happened. It couldn't have not happened. And as we get that deeper level of understanding, it opens up access to the connection that's always been there. That's right. What's happening now? See, Wouldn't dad be proud? Isn't he proud of what you're doing now here? Yeah. Knowing that this is totally not the thing you want to be doing, you're doing it anyway. How cool is that? Right? Right. So check it out. What are you noticing? That's a good breath. Look a little better. You do. Yeah. Well, we're on our way then. Yeah, we are. Right. So Again, think of that soaring person. Take that deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Eyes. Rest. You rest. Drifting deeper and deeper down and inside towards this calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy. Expansive energy. That's right. More and more healing is underway as you rest. And because your unconscious knows so much more than you on how to heal itself, it knows which moment would be most useful to bring to your awareness. Now. That's right. You can begin to find your way back up and out. And there we are. Right. And again, as that unconscious travels back, what moment comes to mind now? Another one of those moments that I don't like to think about. Those. Not, not that one. Stop eating. You totally are though. You're doing it. You're here. Uh huh. Right. What moment comes to mind now? Am I supposed to be acknowledging a bad moment again? Oh yeah, we want to bring another one. Let's not do another one. Well, of course we do. Wouldn't it be better to get them better? Oh, by the way, we're already started. Did you know that it makes it easier? Did you know that it's like kind of like when you start something, it kind of builds on itself. It makes it easier. Right. What's another one of those moments that we don't like to think about? Because when we do is cut all that. You know, go for a good one. Cut a lot of. I mean, I don't know, like just. Oh, you got one. Good. That one that just came to mind happened when you're doing Karina. I'm really proud of you. Right. That one happened when. I don't know you. You do. You can't miss it. Cause I know they're doing the donkey. Pick me, pick me, pick me, pick me. Shrek. Yeah. I mean the only thing that really pops into my head at this moment is just me starting to use drugs and going down that path of destruction. You know, like just that whole. That moment happened when you were how old? It started like when I was 15, 16. I put my dad. Right. So. And where were you? What's the moment that comes to mind in South Carolina? Beaufort. No, Myrtle Beach. Oh, Myrtle Beach. Right. Try to remember. I go to Pawley's island and Merle's Inlet and boy, has Myrtle beach changed. Oh no. When I used to go there as a kid, like we used to go there like before it was like really commercialized. Now it's like crazy down there. Yeah. So the time that comes to mind that you know, 15, 16 year old you. What was it that she used? Crack. Yeah. Good. Right. So at that time when she was doing that back then, right, at 15, 16, did she have the knowledge that you do now, did she know what doing that was going to lead to? Right. She had no idea about that. Right. So first if we could float back along the timeline, right, kind of you float up and back growing you younger and earlier prior to being with whomever you were with that you know, got access to the crack and some said let's try this thing, right? If that you back then had known all of what you know, what it led to then what it had you do and then what it led to, what it had to do, all that, if she had known it back then, what you know now, would you have done it? No. No. Right. But she didn't know that. Right. So I wonder what it would be like for you to lighten up on that earlier you. Because right now and for a long time you've been kicking her fucking idiot. Dumbass. The fuck were you thinking, right? You're 15, 16, you weren't. Got it. Because you know, do 15, you know, 16 year old kids make, you know, really well formed a lot of forethought decision. They're not impulsive, not really. Right, got it. Right. Right. So I wonder what it would be like for you to lighten up on that earlier you because she didn't know and what was she looking for a way to change how she was feeling or like hey, let's try something, right? Make sense. She didn't know what it was going to lead to, Right. So what would it be like for you to lighten up on that earlier you because we can't have regrets and remorses about things we didn't know was going to happen. It's only from here that you can look back and slap her for being an idiot. Right, Right. Make sense? Yes, it does. Yeah. So now we just want to lighten up on that earlier you. Right. Because again we can get at a deeper level with all the factors that were going on back then, the situations, the circumstances, whom she was around and what was going on with all of that happening then back then she did what occurred for her to do and she couldn't have not done that even if now we wish she hadn't. Got it. And as you get it, go ahead and close your eyes, picture the earlier you letting her know that you know that she didn't know. Right. Let her know that you know she just didn't know. That's right. Let her know that you're okay. I don't know about the really cool snakes, nails. Right. And again, as this gets in, what's happening to the earlier you, you know, because all the adult figures around her at that time, they were all emotionally stable and well, mom. Totally emotionally stable and well. No, no, Right. Mom probably would have been maybe a little bit of a train wreck. Yeah. Uh huh. Right. So who had to parent you? Right. And how well do 15, 60 year olds parent themselves? Right? You mean I get to eat chips and Doritos? Fuck yeah. I'm eating. Right, right. Got it, got it. Yeah. And as you're lightening up on her, what's happening in you? You lightening up on me? You are? Yeah. That'll be nicer. Better to have more ease inside when you lighten up on you. Yeah, Cool. What's another moment that comes to mind? We know we got some. I know you pretend that you got none, but guess what? We all got some. There's not a single one of us that doesn't have any. If you meet somebody that tells you they got none, run really, really fast because they're a fucking psychopath. They don't think they got any. Come on. Things that I don't like to think about because when I do, I feel bad. Things that I did, things that happened to me, stuff that happened to my body, stuff that happened to my body that I didn't want to have happen to my body when it was happening to my body. Like one of those. Yeah, I mean the whole sex, you know, for money deal and all that, I mean, that's. So now think of one time that it happened and you might have been how old? I was in the 20s. Yeah. Right. And this one you might have been where? In Bradenton. In Bradenton. Right. So you're in your 20s, you're in Bradenton and you're wearing Bradenton. Like were you with somebody and said, hey, you need to be doing this thing in order to get. Or was it like, hey, I could do this thing. It's a quick thing that I could do to get money to get the drug. Like, what was it that was running? Right? Because nobody, like, you know, at 6 or 7 or 9 or 12. Because you know what I'd really like to do? Like to move to a new city and, you know, do transactions. My body and whatever they're going to do to my body for some money so that I can get. Right. That's not part of the criteria. Looking at when we're little, I would like to have transactional relationships with Ben. Right? Like nobody goes that Would be great. Cool. Yeah. And we already know because this is the world of how it works. There's some that I did stuff with that was a little bit easier for me to do because at least there was some kind of, like, interaction that was like, okay about them. And then there's some that I had to do stuff and I really didn't want to. Right. We know that we got all those because that's kind of how it works. So they don't get to just say, maybe at first I get to say, like, nah, I'll do that. Not that, this. But over time, it winds up even when I didn't want it. Or would that some people who are smelly or, or. Or. Or. Right. Like all that kind of grossness. Right. But that particular time your brain didn't. Right. Was that time when you were using. Yeah. Yeah. And so you're needing to get funds for stuff. Yeah. Right. And so where were you? In Bradenton? Were you at, like, a club? Were you on the street? Were you at a house? On the street. On the street. Right. And like, walking? Not necessarily. Uh huh. Ran into some people, I guess. Right. I don't know. Somebody might have said, hey, can I spend some money with you? Really? I don't know. They asked me if I wanted a party. Whatever it was. The cool thing, Sydney, is you can make it up because it's gonna be structurally similar enough to clear. Because it's never about the content. It's about how it got coated just the whole. You're doing great. Notice how there's more than one that keeps popping. I mean, there's been a lot of situations. I mean, of course, we're just thinking one time, and we can make up the one time. And it can be a conglomeration of many times. But why we want to do one time is because that's what the brain works with best. Just like when you learn how to tie sneakers. Was on one pair. Learn how to ride a bicycle. Was on one bicycle. Once you got it, brain generalized out to all things with wheels or laces. Right. So let's think of a time. One time you're in Bradenton, you might have been on the street. Did you have an apartment then or a house, hotel room that you're staying in? What was. Nothing. You're just on the street, street now, trying to survive. Right. And having, like a addictive kind of thing going on. At that time, you were using heroin. Heroin, crap. Whatever I could find. I was indiscriminate at that point. Something to stop Me feeling for a little bit. Right, so you ran into some people like this. Daytime or nighttime? Afternoon, Morning, Afternoon. Right. So you ran to some people, Guys, gals. It's not just the whole process of it, like just the dudes, you know, I was never fortunate for me. I was never raped or anything like that. It was just. It's just a shitty situation I put myself in, you know, or you know, an ex would put me in or whatever, like go do this, you know. Right, right. You might not think that you were ever raped, but you kind of were coerced into doing something that you didn't really want to have to do. Right. And it wasn't about you, your pleasure. Who is a. Are you done yet? Luckily, it's guys are pretty quick. Are you done yet? Kind of thing. Right. So think of a time in an ex. Boyfriend, Daddy. Yeah, right. So he might have done what you might have been where? And he might have said, what? Go get. Go do. Go do what you got to do. Get some money, you know, and so you can bring something back, you know? You know, Right. Beat your ass, that kind of thing. Right. So you might have said, I'm gonna beat your ass. Go do what you got to go do. Right. So then you went out, try to find. Right. Somebody came up to you, my car, walking. Yeah. Right. And they kind of asked. And then you got in the car. Right. And then they went, you did in the car or you went? Probably, yeah, probably did whatever you did in the car. Could have been oral, could have been hand, could have been other stuff, whatever. Right. Then they paid or they paid first. Usually pay first. Yeah, right. Duh. Cuz they don't pay first, they might not pay at all. That's right. Made that mistake once. Damn it. Right, and then they did the thing. Right. And then you got out of the car and then you went and got stuff and then you came back home. Right. And you can remember doing that. Right. And you can remember putting your jeans on today. Stop putting on your jeans. Say, I'm not putting on my jeans. Well, stop me from putting on my jeans. Okay, okay, I get it, I get it. You don't have to go through this again, okay? It's in the past. I don't have to. Oh, no, it's not. See, that's where you don't get it, but it isn't. No, see, this is the problem. You keep saying it's in the past. Do you know how my brain hears that? I've got a credit card in my wallet. What does that literally mean you can open up my wallet and get a credit card out. Is there a place that we can go to right now to watch you do that? No, there is no place that we can go to right now to watch you do that. Back then. Oh, yeah. No. No. Right. But I have money in my wallet. I have a credit card in my wallet. When you say that's in the past, your brain thinks that there's a place called the past that it's contained in. What if the past no longer exists? What if it is and that's what we really want to get in? That's why I'm doing the silly exercise. Not just so that you can get that. I'm not putting on my pants. I'm also not doing that thing with that guy in the car. Well, stop that X from telling you that. Stop baby daddy for making you do that. Say, he's not doing that. He's not doing that. Well, then you stop putting on your sneaks. I'm not putting on my sneaks. Right. Well, then stop doing that. I'm not doing that. Right, then where is that? Say it isn't. It no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. Because that wasn't ever who you are. That was just some shit that you did. It's not your identity. It's not who you are. It's shit that happened and shit that you did. And what we want to get at a deeper level is we want your brain to read it as info about something that happened. Because all of the discomfort is still there. Not because of what I did or because of what happened, but because my brain doesn't emotionally know that what happened ended, that it no longer exists. That I'm not doing that. I totally know that I'm not doing that. You and I can sit here and know that that's not happening. Got it. Right. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know that that's not happening. That's why it's causing you to feel discomfort when you think about it. Not because it goes, hey, let me have her feel discomfort, but it's actually trying to motivate you to get you to stop doing that. Hurry. Wait a minute. You already have f. Okay. As soon as your brain gets it, Sydney, boom. The feelings will go away. Because it's not making you feel it because it wants you to feel bad. It's just trying to get you to get it to stop. It doesn't know. Your brain doesn't know that it stopped right Stop him from hitting you. Say he's not hitting me. Right? Well, then you stop putting on your sweatshirt. I'm not putting on my sweatshirt. Well, then stop him from doing it. He's not doing that. Where is it? Say it doesn't exist. That's what we want to get in. That's the part that we want to get in. Because as soon as that gets in, notice what starts happening with the feelings. Right? See, that was a great answer. You know who answered that? Was it you or your unconscious? No. You didn't consciously disappoint to take the deep breath in and the long exhale. You know who did? Your body. You know what your body's most closely connected to your unconscious. Right. Where do I want to get the information in? Up here, where Sydney already knows, or in here? There we go. Exactly. That's what's happening. That's why things are starting to change. That's why you're noticing feelings different. That's why when we talked about the dad thing, you said, oh my. It feels like there's a weight, some of the weight getting lifted off my heart, off my chest. Right? That doesn't come from knowing it up here. That comes from changing it in here. Right? That's what starts to change it with that younger you who didn't know at 15, 16, what doing that thing was gonna lead her to do. Because it churns up a thing that I need to have more of that thing that I'm doing to relieve the feeling of having. Right. Nobody would wash with soap that later on made them dirtier. Fuck is this shit? Now I'm dirtier than I was before I washed. Right? But that's what these kinds of substances do. Nicotine is the best example. Cigarette, right? I have a craving for a cigarette. Why? To get rid of the craving for the cigarette. So then I do it and I get rid of the craving, which then increases me having more cravings to have. Like, what the. Like I'm doing the thing to get rid of the thing that. That then causes me to want more of the thing. It's a crazy dynamic, Alec. Right? And that's why we want to get this shifted. Because that's also impacted how I felt about me. It's impacted things about my own level of esteem and my own sense of self worth. Right. That I wound up doing that kind of stuff. And of course, when was it the hardest to do? The first time or the 50th time? 50th time. What was it harder to do? To turn a Trick to do a sexual thing with somebody that you didn't really want alone. Was it the hardest? Yeah. When I was sick, probably when you were sick, right? Yeah. And it also was harder when I first did it. Right. Because then I got a little bit used to it. Even though I didn't want to do it, I knew kind of what to expect. Right. Because the first time you go into something, you're not really sure what to expect. It's like the first time I rode rock and roller coaster at mgm. And I don't know why I didn't know that it was going to take off like a bat out of hell when it started because no. Roller coaster, roller coaster kind of roll, right? And then you go up the hill, man, it goes. No, that thing, you sit there and then boom. This is not fun at all. Why did I not see that the first time? Like, we're in line. You should be able to see that. Right? Like, pay no attention to that. No. Right. Go on it the next time. All right. I'm a little prepared for it still. Third or fourth time. Okay. I got this thing. You follow me with that, Right? Right. Even though I might not like, it's easier because I've already done it. Kind of know a little bit more of what to expect. Make sense. Right? But that's also what fed the awkward stuff. And the picker of wrong guys. Right? Because I picked the guy and then I'd give him the keys. And I don't know why he's treating me like crap when I'm the one that does good. I'm the one that's doing all the work and he's treating me like an asshole. What? How does that work? Follow me with that. So for women, we always want to hold the keys. Don't ever give them to the guy. If you give them to the guy, know that he's going to drive recklessly and you're going to get hurt if you hold the keys. Hey, dude, I got the good. And we know how it works. Women aren't turned on by men. That's not it. Women actually turn themselves on by being a turn on, a tease, a flirt. They have to be interested in the guy, clearly. But like they're. The turn on the guy isn't what turns the woman on. The woman is what turns the guy on. Guys are turned on by women. You're beautiful, sensual, provocative. You're shapely. Your body moves in different ways. Right. That gets turned on by women. Women do not get turned on by men. Thank goodness. Because There'd be like three guys that have all the women. Thank goodness that's not it just by what we look like. Right. But it is for the guy. So women have the goods, they've got the parts. They've got what the guy's interested in. They're the regulator. They hold the key. They need to be a little less available than they. Than he would want them to be. They need to teach him that. If you want to go out with me on Friday night, you need to ask me by Wednesday. Tuesday preferable if you don't ask me till Thursday. Sorry, I'm busy. Even if I have nothing to do. Got it. Right. Those are things that we want to start shifting. We want to begin to lighten the load so that you're more clear, so that you're easier on you. Because a lot of what's been going on is that you've been kicking you for having done the shit that you did. You've been really mad at you for having gotten into the stuff that you got into with the people that you got into it with. Because now from this vantage point, you're like, God, that fucking made things a hell of a lot harder. Life is hard to begin with. And I really just added fucking piles of difficulty to my world, right? But now what are you doing? You're doing things to change your life for the better. What was it that got you arrested, that had you go to the jail, that had you even get connected to Seva and join Thailand? What now? You know, stealing. Stealing for drugs. Yeah, yeah, right, right. See that? 15, 16 year old, you didn't know that that was gonna be a problem long term. Make sense now we know we're getting more space and separation. How long has it been? What's that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's kick ass, right? Congratulations on that. Thank you. Yeah, it was really, really cool, right? And we know that with distance, right? But we also still have to stay a little vigilant, right? Because the voice still there. This is a good day. This is a bad day, any day, right? That's why meetings, that's why we have sponsors, why we have people to support us. But it's also about you creating a new version of you. The you who's feeling like, you know, happy and right. Who's more at ease, that we're all about engineering a new version of you, that you're living towards. That. That stuff just doesn't fit with who I am and who I'm becoming. Make sense. That's what we're interested in doing. Because we want your life to work in a way that's best for you. We want that strength and resiliency that you clearly have had being able to make it through shit fully installed so that you have it here. And we're not so concerned about what might show up because I have what I need to move through. We want that, too. Make sense? Yeah. So just check. Think about the things we talked about. Whether it be, you know, being there with dad, whether it be, you know, that 15 or 16 year old you, or even what happened with that baby. Mom died. What do you notice? It's not. It's not controlling me. Are you controlling my thoughts or. I don't know. Yeah, well, check inside. How's it feeling now? Feels better. Yeah. Are you feeling so down on? You okay? Isn't that cool? And notice how that's different and really different than it's ever been. Yeah. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we're on our way. You did great today. Thanks. Yeah. So we're gonna have you out and live life for another few weeks and then we're gonna get back together. Okay? Got it? Got it. Cool. Come with me.
