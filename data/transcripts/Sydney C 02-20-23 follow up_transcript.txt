[00:01] A: So today is the 20th of February Sydney. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes. Yes. Cool. All right, so the things that I wrote down. So one dad, when you think about that, what do you notice now?
[00:29] B: Okay. Like, it's not. I don't know, Like, I don't know how to. I don't know how to explain it.
[00:39] C: Yeah.
[00:40] B: But I'm just, you know, like, it.
[00:42] A: Doesn'T have the same.
[00:42] B: No, it doesn't.
[00:43] A: Wait, you're more even keel.
[00:45] B: Yeah.
[00:46] A: That's cool. Okay, how about the ex boyfriend that was violent?
[00:54] B: That doesn't bother me either. No.
[00:58] A: How about stuff with trafficking dude or even, like, the first time you, like, had to turn a trick. They don't have the same feeling tones either. Isn't that cool?
[01:11] B: Yeah.
[01:11] A: That's different then. That's a good news thing. Yeah. How about, like, overall, like, day to day functioning? How have you been around? Because I know that anxiety is something that goes on and, like, even sometimes worry about what others might think about me and whether I'm able to actually say it.
[01:30] C: Yeah.
[01:30] B: It's like, my job is stressful.
[01:35] A: What are you doing?
[01:36] B: I work at Applebee's.
[01:38] A: Okay.
[01:39] B: So.
[01:39] A: And are you serving? That's stressful? Yeah.
[01:43] B: It's not necessarily serving. Serving this stressful is people I work with.
[01:48] A: Oh, the other staff?
[01:49] B: Yeah.
[01:50] C: Oh.
[01:50] A: What makes them so stressful?
[01:51] B: They're just. They're assholes. I don't know. They just stress me out, that's all. They give me a hard time. Kitchen staff, they're picking on me, and they're not doing it being mean. They're just, you know, they're just kidding around. But they. It sounds serious to me, so I take it the wrong way. I get in my feelings.
[02:17] C: So.
[02:18] B: But other than that, I mean.
[02:20] A: So they're actually joking because they like you?
[02:22] B: Yeah.
[02:23] C: How?
[02:25] B: Cause I'm the only one they do it to.
[02:30] A: They don't joke with anybody else?
[02:32] C: No, only you. So.
[02:36] A: So they like you?
[02:37] B: Yeah.
[02:37] A: Do they do it with an upward turning of the cheeks Sometimes? Like a smile?
[02:41] B: Sometimes they have a serious face.
[02:43] C: Yeah.
[02:43] B: And that's when I get in my feelings.
[02:50] A: So what's something that they might say that gets you in your feelings?
[02:57] B: Just, like whenever I need something, like I need freaking barbecue sauce or French fries or whatever stupid stuff. Is stupid. But it's like, I'm busy as hell out there. I got five or six tables, right? And yes. And I go ask for something, you gotta wait. But the next person walks up and they give them what they want right away. You know, like they're just. They're doing that on intent. They're doing it on purpose. Just get a reaction out of me.
[03:24] A: That's what I was told.
[03:25] C: By who?
[03:28] B: The manager.
[03:29] A: Oh, the manager told you?
[03:30] B: And them.
[03:30] C: And them.
[03:32] A: They just do it to get me all worked up.
[03:35] B: I don't know why. And I told him. I told him last night. I was like, listen, I was like, when I'm busy, I don't have a.
[03:40] A: Damn sense of humor at all.
[03:43] B: But when I'm busy, I'm like, last night I had a 45 minute ticket. You know, like if I'm. If we're busy, your screen's full, my screen's full, Whatever. Like, just wait till we're not busy to joke around like that, you know? I just can't. I can't. It's ridiculous. I know.
[04:06] A: I don't know whether it's ridiculous.
[04:07] B: It is ridiculous. I'm over it. It's fine. Yes, I talked to them. I told them and we're good, so.
[04:19] A: Well, they're still gonna do it.
[04:22] B: Only when we're not busy.
[04:24] A: Or they might do it when you are.
[04:26] B: I'm just gonna walk away.
[04:27] C: Oh.
[04:28] A: Cause what do you normally do when they. You're gonna need to wait.
[04:31] B: I usually cuss them out.
[04:33] A: Say, bullshit, give me my fucking fries.
[04:37] B: Yeah, I usually cuss them out. So I had to talk with them, so we'll see. Yeah, I'm only working there three days a week now, so.
[04:51] A: Because it was more.
[04:53] C: Why are you.
[04:54] B: I was working like five or six days. I got another job.
[04:56] A: Oh, other than Applebee's, Okay. What else are you doing?
[04:59] B: I'm a server at the Point in Osprey.
[05:03] A: Okay. Is that a similar or different kind of restaurant?
[05:07] B: A little bit more upbeat, like seafood, Little fancier.
[05:11] A: Okay. So higher dollar bills.
[05:15] B: Absolutely.
[05:16] A: Better tips.
[05:17] B: Yes.
[05:25] A: How many days are you getting there?
[05:28] B: I'm only working there two days.
[05:29] C: Okay.
[05:31] A: Because they're gonna check you out to.
[05:32] C: See whether you're.
[05:36] A: Doing it right. And then they may give you more days.
[05:39] B: No, that's the only. I only want two days right now because I have another job and I want a couple days off.
[05:44] A: You got another job other than Applebee's?
[05:47] B: Applebee's. And the point.
[05:48] C: Right.
[05:50] B: So I work three at one, two at the other. So that leaves me two days off. So that's. That's what I want. I don't want to work anymore.
[06:02] A: What happens if you make more tips at the point? Will you want to work less hours at Applebee's?
[06:08] B: It's an hour away, though.
[06:09] A: Oh, my. Yeah, for hell. That's a commute. An hour one way.
[06:16] B: Yes, but I. But I work doubles.
[06:18] A: But I work doubles every day so that you're there. Okay.
[06:21] B: So it's not only for, like, three or four hours.
[06:24] A: That would suck.
[06:25] B: Yeah.
[06:25] A: So you work lunch and dinner shift.
[06:28] C: That's better.
[06:29] A: Okay, I get it. Then I wouldn't want to do more. Tz. Do you work doubles at Applebee's too?
[06:36] B: Sometimes. Maybe once or twice.
[06:41] A: Is the evening better there?
[06:43] B: Mm, I don't like days. Daytime sucks.
[06:46] C: Yeah.
[06:47] A: Cause, like, nobody's there.
[06:48] B: Yeah. And the staff, the girls that are on during the day, they don't do nothing. They're lazy, so.
[06:54] A: Oh, so they're not, like, filling up things or making sure that it's set up for when people come in for dinner? Yeah. I worked at a restaurant where you had to do the fold thing of all the napkins. You had to put the stuff, like, roll em and do the thing, like, oh, my goodness. Jeez.
[07:10] B: I'll have to do that too.
[07:11] A: To be ready for the next. People have to, like, clean out the. They had to have glasses on the table. It was one of those restaurants that was a PETA.
[07:19] B: No, we don't do that.
[07:21] A: And to make sure that they looked right, because you don't want to leave a glass on the table. That's not. You know, you send them through the dishwasher, and sometimes they get clean. Sometimes they're not as clean as they should have felt.
[07:30] B: Stick on the glass.
[07:31] A: Exact. You're like, oh, well, crap. This one's not gonna work out well for me. Yeah, I did that for a while. Started, like, doing the dishwashing thing. Didn't like the dishwashing thing. That was not as much fun. Then I moved to, like, bussing, and that was a little bit better than the dishwashing thing. And then I did the waiting stuff. That was better. I could, like, talk to people, but, man, some of those trays that we had to carry were freaking heavy and filled with stuff. And you're like, oh, my good. I got a whole, like, tray of, like. You're like, okay, don't move one off at the wrong time, because it's like playing a game of Jenga. You know, If I pulled the wrong one off, the whole thing's in balance. It was awful.
[08:23] C: Oh my goodness. Yeah.
[08:27] A: Cool. So. So if they are, if you're the only one that they, they joke with, they joke with you to get a rise and it happens, you get mad at them or like say something, but they're joking with you because they like you.
[08:47] B: I guess, yeah.
[08:48] A: Well, as an adult, do you joke with people you don't like?
[08:51] B: No.
[08:52] A: No. Isn't that weird?
[08:53] B: Yeah. I don't know.
[08:56] A: It is weird, right? Because with an adult, the only people, if you joke with somebody when you're an adult and you're not really joking, then they'll want.
[09:05] C: Right.
[09:05] A: So as an adult, you only get joked with with people who like you. The problem is that it feels like being picked on, right? That's the issue, right? Like that's where it goes off is that it feels like I'm getting picked on, but I'm not actually getting picked on. I'm being joked with, but it feels like I'm getting picked on.
[09:26] C: Right.
[09:26] A: Cuz I probably had been picked on, right? And so then it's very similar. So I wonder what it would be like if you could hear it, that they're joking.
[09:42] B: If I could hear that they're joking?
[09:44] A: Yeah, if you could hear it like they're joking. Because they are. Instead of feeling like I'm being picked.
[09:49] B: On now that I know that, like I can, you know, put two and.
[09:54] A: Two together maybe, but not in the moment, right? Because I would have college buddies that I was really good friends with, they would say things that sounded really similar to a mean thing that somebody would say when I was being picked on. But I. And so I would read it that way and get my feelings. I get into my feelings, right? And that's what happens. It's not like you go, okay, so when they say this thing, I'm going to get in my feelings. They say it and boom, I'm in my feelings. I didn't even decide to, I didn't want to. And I'm already in them right now. I gotta figure out a way to get out of my feelings. But I didn't choose to get in in the first place. So that means it's not conscious. Did you know that? Because if I'm not choosing to get in them, right.
[10:45] B: I get in.
[10:45] A: Then I didn't consciously decide to let that affect me, right? Because that's what we say as well, you know, I'm just letting it affect me as if, like I'm welcoming. Go ahead, come on. Affect me. I really want to be affected by this right now.
[10:59] C: Right.
[10:59] A: That's what people say, though, all the time. They go, I'm letting it affect me. I'm like, bullshit. There's no letting. It's affecting you whether you let it or not, because it's unconscious. So what if we could change the way that your brain reads that information? Be great that they're joking, you know, because they like me.
[11:20] C: Right, right.
[11:23] A: And then how might I respond if I know that they're joking because they.
[11:27] B: Like me, Might laugh or.
[11:29] A: Right. I might laugh. What would it be like to, you know, in the middle of a stressful, busy shift, laugh?
[11:35] B: That would be great.
[11:36] A: Oh, it would be, wouldn't it? Yes, it would. Great, wouldn't it? Yeah. That's the part that we want to get shifted, because that's the programming. So think of, like, by experiences that I went through at left, this unconscious blueprint that causes me to get in my feelings when I don't even want to be in them.
[11:56] C: Right.
[11:56] A: I get personally offended, that kind of stuff. And.
[11:59] C: And that's the deal.
[12:00] A: Like, you know, when. When we're little kids pick on kids. Kids are mean. Kids say mean and hurtful things and our feelings get hurt. And if it happens to me more often than somebody else, I start feeling it's because there's something wrong with me. Maybe it's because I am a loser. Maybe it's because I'm not good enough, or maybe it's because I'm too fat or too skinny or too.
[12:21] C: It's.
[12:21] A: There's something in here wrong with me. But in all actuality, when people get picked on, why does one kid get picked on more than the other? Because they like kid more. No, not kids. Oh, no, they're mean. Kids are jerks. Yeah, but why does one kid get bullied, picked at more than another?
[12:44] C: That's simple.
[12:45] A: If we have a large red barn and we have a small, tiny Coke can, and we're taking rocks and we're trying to throw and hit the target, which of the two targets could hit more frequently?
[12:57] B: A big one.
[12:58] C: Why?
[12:59] A: Because it's bigger, bigger and easier. Yeah, it's an easier target. Why does one kid get picked on more than another? They're an easier target. Why are they an easier target? They show. They show that it bothers them. Right. Got it.
[13:12] B: Yes.
[13:13] A: So in showing that it bothers them, they get it more often than somebody who doesn't show that it bothers them. Got it.
[13:22] B: Got it.
[13:22] C: Right.
[13:22] A: And that. Yeah.
[13:23] C: Right.
[13:24] A: That's the Programming that got installed through different experiences where it comes in internal so it feels like it's hitting that same nerve, so to speak. People call it that. Whatever I get in my feelings hits that nerve. Right? It's the same thing that's going on where I'm starting to feel bad, even though I don't want to feel bad. That's what we want to get shifted. So we want it to be read that, you know, as an adult, people only joke with people that they actually like. Right? And what if, like, they're joking with me because they like me and instead of my reaction is, fuck you, asshole. Give me my goddamn fries?
[14:00] B: I laugh.
[14:03] A: And I could actually say the same thing, but be laughing, not pissed.
[14:13] B: I'm working on that.
[14:14] A: No, I know, but that's something that you don't need to work on. It's all about changing the programming. Because when it's read different, then you're free to be different about it. Right? Because again, you're not choosing to get in your feelings. You're not going, hey, you know what? I really like to get in my feelings right now. No, you're just finding yourself in them. But not because you wanted to. Not because you chose it. You just find yourself in it. That's what we want to get shifted. So if that was no longer going on and you were reading it more accurately, like it's because they like me, like, how would you actually feel? Like, people saying that kind of stuff because they like you, like, what would that be like.
[14:58] B: Be better? I mean, it's. I'd be happier, I guess. I don't know, like, just less stressed.
[15:03] A: What would it be like to actually, like, laugh? Well, you know, while you're in the.
[15:07] B: Kitchen, what would it be like?
[15:10] C: Yeah, nice.
[15:12] A: Or would be nice.
[15:13] C: Yeah, Right.
[15:13] A: What's it like for you when you laugh? How do you feel?
[15:16] B: Happy.
[15:17] A: Oh, you feel happier, right? What's it like in your body when you're laughing?
[15:21] B: Lighter, right?
[15:23] C: Yeah.
[15:24] A: Because we don't want to be so serious. That's right. We want to lighten up a little. So let's think of you lighter, a lot less serious.
[15:31] C: Right.
[15:31] A: And being able to laugh.
[15:33] C: Right.
[15:34] A: Because what I'm hearing from them is that they're only doing it because they like me. And maybe I can even say, oh, gosh, you know how to make a girl's day. Right? I mean, that would be really, really silly to say instead of, you fucking asshole. I just asked for barbecue sauce. It's not fucking hard to give me the barbecue sauce. Right, right.
[15:57] B: I feel like if y'all don't like cooking, go find another job. Like. Like they're miserable. Like, that's your job. You chose to cook. Why are you bitching about it? You know? Like, that's just. I don't get it.
[16:09] A: Well, there's people in my life.
[16:10] B: It's because they're. They like me and they're just giving me a hard time.
[16:13] A: Well, there's people in life that just like to bitch.
[16:15] B: Yeah, that too.
[16:16] A: Even though they like the job, you know, they come to you and they start bitching about you. Like, why don't you leave that tonight? I really like it.
[16:22] C: Really?
[16:22] A: This does sound like if I don't like it at all. Right. There are people that do that.
[16:28] B: Oh, I know.
[16:33] A: So we think of you as lighter and you're actually reading it accurately. Just because I like me. And you actually get a belly laugh. That'd be better.
[16:42] C: Right.
[16:43] A: So then as we think about this, we just want to organize your brain towards it. That's where you go through the process. You slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper. And we're only doing this process because what we want to move from beta waves down into alpha waves. Alpha waves are correlated with zone resting.
[17:07] C: Alert, wide open space. Right? Right.
[17:15] A: We want to settle the body because that's what accelerates healing. Because again, this situation that's happening with them, A, it's not the first time it's ever happened. B, it's not the last time it'll ever happen.
[17:30] C: Right.
[17:31] A: So we want to read information accurately. Right. Like, they're doing it because they like me.
[17:41] C: Right? Right.
[17:46] A: That's right. So then what you want to do is as you get yourself into that. That state where you're slightly lowering your jaw and you're resting your tongue, can you breathe a little bit slower and deeper? There's a better breath.
[18:00] C: Right.
[18:00] A: You know exactly what to do now.
[18:03] C: Right.
[18:04] A: And see, you can look across and you can see my nose. You can see my fingers. You can see my fingers move out wide. You stay looking at my nose, but with the sides of your eyes, you pick up my fingers moving.
[18:17] C: Right.
[18:18] A: As this starts to happen, your body settles down. And the coolest thing that happens when your body settles down is your mind starts to quiet. Not because you're quieting your mind, but because you're settling your body. Anytime our mind is overactive, we can't change it at an overactive state. We have to go into our body and begin to shift how we breathe. And the fastest way for me to get somebody into that kind of state. Do you know what the fastest way to do breathing? Yes. But the fastest way for me to get somebody into this state is to do what? Go first.
[18:58] B: Okay. Go first.
[19:00] C: Right.
[19:01] A: See, I have to start changing my brain. I have to start opening up my field awareness. I need to shift me into the state so that we're both in the right states for healing.
[19:19] C: Right? Right.
[19:20] A: You just checked. How's your body feeling now? How old are the kids?
[19:27] B: My kids?
[19:28] C: Yeah.
[19:28] B: 12.
[19:29] A: I mean, those are the ones that you care about hanging out with, right?
[19:31] B: Yes.
[19:31] A: No, that other person's kid's over there.
[19:34] B: 12 and 23.
[19:35] A: Holy cow. That's a big difference.
[19:37] B: I know, right?
[19:38] A: The 23 year old is where at?
[19:40] B: Miles.
[19:41] C: Oh my. Lucky you.
[19:43] B: I know, it's great. He plays video games all day.
[19:47] C: Really?
[19:47] B: When he's not at work. Yes.
[19:48] A: He's working though.
[19:49] B: Yes, he is.
[19:49] A: As a cook. That's the asshole that keeps calling me.
[19:52] B: No, he's not a cook. He works at Marine Concepts Boats.
[19:56] A: Oh, nice. Does he like it?
[19:58] B: I think so. Yeah.
[20:00] A: But he's a big gamer. Is he Xbox or PlayStation?
[20:04] B: He's got a PlayStation right now.
[20:05] A: Okay, so he's a big gamer. Yeah. Both my kids are the 12 year old also. Boy too?
[20:12] C: Yep.
[20:12] A: Oh boy, oh boy.
[20:14] B: I'd rather have boys than girls. Girls are trouble. They are. I would know.
[20:20] A: That's what I said. I would rather have girls than boys.
[20:24] B: You would rather have girls than boys?
[20:26] C: Why?
[20:27] A: Because boys are awful.
[20:29] B: So are girls.
[20:31] A: I didn't know that. So you've got two boys and I've got two girls.
[20:35] B: Yeah. Got what we wanted.
[20:37] A: Damn it. My favorite line in all of that is, my wife wanted to have four kids. I wanted to have one. And then she said if the second one came first, we'd only have one.
[20:47] B: The second one came first. You only have one?
[20:49] A: Yeah, because the second one's real hard for her. She's not a. She doesn't mind. She doesn't do what she's told or asked. I mean, even this morning when she's off school today my wife's taking the day off to be with her. She's like, I'm just going to go drop her off at the daycare. I can't get like. Maybe you just need to like not be so particular about how the day supposed to go. But they, they are stubborn. So they got head slots. I'm not nearly stubborn like she is. So we don't put heads as much. That's kind of how it works. So again, you slightly lower your jaw and you rest your tongue. That's right. And you breathe a little bit slower and deeper. And see, you can get the feeling because you already had the conversation with them yesterday. But you know what it feels like when they're giving you the needle.
[21:40] B: Yeah.
[21:41] C: Right.
[21:41] A: Kind of like poking at you.
[21:42] B: You're the president.
[21:43] C: Right, Right.
[21:45] A: And that feeling tone that you get when they're poking at you, it's not the first time you've ever had it.
[21:50] C: Right.
[21:50] A: So I wonder what happens if your unconscious travels back down the timeline in your own history. Because we all have had experiences where different people have done different things that were mean, that maybe, you know, got me into my feelings that made me feel bad. Maybe it was things that they said or I was excluded.
[22:11] C: Right.
[22:12] A: Your unconscious is going to travel back to an earlier time only because we could do the one that just happened, except that's so close.
[22:21] C: Right.
[22:22] A: And we know that when we provide distance from something, two things happen. One, the further away it is, I can see it more clearly. Two, the longer ago it was, the less intensity it has on me. Right. When I'm heated, like it's really in my face. Right. So we want to go to other time that you've had that same kind of feeling transporting you back earlier and younger.
[22:47] C: Right, Right.
[22:52] A: That's right. And what moment starts to come to mind if you just slid down like a zipline?
[22:59] B: I went ziplining.
[23:01] C: You did.
[23:01] A: How fun was that?
[23:03] B: Terrifying.
[23:04] A: It was terrifyingly fun. Okay.
[23:06] B: It was terrifying.
[23:08] A: You didn't like being hooked up to the thing?
[23:11] B: I don't like being that high in the air.
[23:15] A: Well, have you been in an airplane?
[23:17] B: Yes.
[23:17] A: You go a lot higher.
[23:18] B: I know, but still.
[23:20] A: But you know the difference? You're not connected to the ground.
[23:24] B: True.
[23:25] A: People don't have fear of heights when the thing that they're up high in isn't connected to the ground. So if we went up in a hot air balloon, we would not have a fear of heights. If we went up in a hot air balloon that was at a fair that was still tethered, we could have fear of heights because it's still tethered to the ground. That's why somebody in a tall building can have fear of heights, but not in an airplane. That interesting. Because I'm not connected to the ground. That's why zip lining can be fearful. Because I'm up high connected to something that's connected to the Ground.
[24:16] B: You confuse me sometimes.
[24:17] A: Sometimes only on purpose.
[24:19] B: Yeah.
[24:19] A: And then sometimes not. I'm confused too.
[24:23] C: Right.
[24:23] A: When did you go ziplining?
[24:25] B: Friday.
[24:25] A: Oh, just recent. Oh, where'd you go?
[24:28] B: We went to Ocala.
[24:30] A: Cool.
[24:30] B: The canyons, I think.
[24:31] A: Okay, that sounds like. That would be like, really neat.
[24:35] B: It was interesting.
[24:36] C: Yeah.
[24:37] A: What was the longest line? Did you have to go?
[24:40] B: It was like. It's the longest one in the state of Florida. Like, I don't know. I don't remember. I don't remember how long it was. Long, though.
[24:52] C: Yeah.
[24:52] B: Longest in Florida, so.
[24:53] C: Yeah.
[24:55] A: And they just kept you going and you had to climb up trees and then.
[24:59] B: Yeah, they have steps and stuff. Yeah.
[25:01] C: Yeah.
[25:03] A: But is it one straight line or do you have to stop at a tree and then they loop you on another one and then go.
[25:08] B: Yeah, it's five different ones. Go up one, you go down one, and then you go on another one and you go on another one. It's just like a. They're all connected. So just go from one to another.
[25:18] A: That's cool.
[25:19] C: Yeah.
[25:20] A: My kids want to go ziplining. The youngest one isn't old enough to quite do what the older one can. It's kind of like the tramp place. 14 and 10.
[25:30] B: 14 and 10?
[25:31] A: Yeah.
[25:32] B: You never know.
[25:39] C: Yeah.
[25:40] A: So you can think about, you know, being, you know, going to the kitchen. All I need is like the broccoli that they didn't give me.
[25:46] C: Plate the person had asked for.
[25:51] A: And they might say something. Well, you gotta wait because they know you're rushing in there to get it back out there. Yeah. No, you gotta wait.
[26:02] C: Right.
[26:02] A: Got the feeling, Tom. Good. Close your eyes, grab a hold of that feeling and let that feeling guide you back.
[26:09] C: Right.
[26:09] A: Let the feeling tone take you back. So it grows you younger time where it might not affect. Fair bullshit.
[26:18] C: Right, Right.
[26:26] A: What does it take you back towards?
[26:32] C: I don't know.
[26:33] B: It is. I'm confused.
[26:35] A: You are?
[26:36] B: Yes.
[26:36] A: I'm confused.
[26:37] B: Am I supposed to be going back to where I was picked on, like, as younger could have been? Well, yeah, I mean, I was picked on when I was younger. Yeah.
[26:44] C: Right.
[26:44] A: Yeah. So what's it take you. What's the structurally similar one that it took you back towards? No, but they have some structure. Notice how the same feeling tones come up. The content will be very different. What they say, what it was about the feeling tones are what?
[27:06] B: Yeah, I mean, it still has the same. It's still.
[27:08] C: Yeah.
[27:09] A: So what does it take you back towards?
[27:24] B: I mean, back when I was like, they used to pick on Me, because of my cleft lip.
[27:29] A: Stop. Okay, good. That's perfect. Right, so when that happened, you might have been how old?
[27:39] B: 13, 14.
[27:40] A: 13, 14, right. And that you might have been where? School.
[27:44] C: Right.
[27:45] A: And they might have said what? Like you would have been in a classroom or hallway, whatever, somewhere. Just high school.
[27:51] B: Yeah, yeah.
[27:52] A: So what?
[27:53] C: Class?
[27:54] A: Hallway.
[27:55] B: Hallway.
[27:55] C: Yeah.
[27:55] A: She met him in the hallway, right? Yeah. And what might have happened?
[28:00] B: Just said something about my lip.
[28:03] A: They might have said what? Sydney, you have no lip.
[28:07] B: They used to call me no lip or whatever.
[28:09] A: Ah, lipless. No lip. Yeah. Right, so they might have called you no lips.
[28:14] C: Right.
[28:14] A: And then that might have hurt your feelings.
[28:16] C: Right, Right.
[28:17] A: And then what might have happened next?
[28:19] B: I probably would have walked away and.
[28:21] A: Cried or something, you know? Right. And then that moment would end.
[28:24] C: Right.
[28:25] A: And then later on you did something more fun, Right?
[28:27] C: Right.
[28:27] A: Like I don't have your kids.
[28:31] B: Yeah, sure.
[28:31] C: Right.
[28:32] A: Go zipline, huh?
[28:34] C: Right.
[28:34] A: Something else more fun.
[28:37] B: Something else more fun.
[28:38] C: Yeah.
[28:38] A: Get cool air maxes.
[28:40] B: Yeah.
[28:40] A: Go shopping. You got going shopping, getting air activity, kind of having kids. You gotta go on zipline.
[28:46] B: Right?
[28:46] A: And then you might have cried, then you would have walked away, right? And then they would have called you like lipless, no lip.
[28:52] C: Right?
[28:53] A: And then you would have been in the hallway and then you might have gone to school. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, what do you notice?
[29:06] B: Think about it like that.
[29:07] A: Well, of course not. But there's still the feeling to it.
[29:10] B: Well, yeah, but I just. Something happened.
[29:14] A: Notice how that's a little bit less. See, there's an interesting thing. I remember a gal that I worked with, right? She's in her, I don't know, mid to late 40s, and she's like, yeah, no, I don't really have anything that ever happened. And then all of a sudden thing comes up where, where when she was a kid for a period of time, because she had scoliosis, she had to.
[29:36] C: Wear a back brace, right?
[29:38] A: So you think about like 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 year old, 12 year old kid wearing a back brace.
[29:44] B: I'm looking for a chapstick. I'm sorry, I can't probably let you in the car. My lips are chapped. I've been sick for two weeks.
[29:51] A: That sucks.
[29:52] B: I know it does.
[29:52] C: Yeah.
[29:53] B: I finally got all the crap out.
[29:56] A: Well, it should come out this way, not that way. I mean, if it's crap.
[30:03] B: I mean.
[30:08] A: So as we're thinking about this, right? So she had to wear a back brace. You know what they used to call her? Turtle people Are so mean.
[30:17] C: Right.
[30:17] A: Mean. Right. They called her turtle and she felt like that, that meant like, you know, there was something wrong with her.
[30:24] C: Right.
[30:25] A: But was there?
[30:26] B: No.
[30:27] C: No.
[30:28] A: Would they have done that to anybody else who was also wearing the back brace at that time?
[30:32] B: Probably.
[30:33] A: Probably.
[30:34] C: Right.
[30:34] A: Cuz it had nothing to do with her. Had to do with her wearing the back brace. Got it.
[30:42] B: Got it.
[30:42] A: Right, as we're looking at this, did it have anything to do with you? No.
[30:48] C: Makes sense.
[30:49] A: Had it. Wait, they would have said it to anybody that had whatever they had at that time going on with their lip. Makes sense.
[30:57] C: But the.
[30:58] A: You didn't know that.
[30:59] C: Right?
[30:59] A: Right. So close your eyes.
[31:01] C: Right.
[31:02] A: Picture the younger you first of all. Let her know that that moment's over, finished. That it no longer exists. And that them saying that had nothing to do with you. Because it wouldn't have mattered whether it was you or anybody else that had whatever was going on then. That's what they would have done. Let her know how much better it is now. Right? That's right. Let her know how much better it is now.
[31:22] C: Right.
[31:23] A: So that she gets how much better it is now. That's right. Now all she deals with is chat, flip sometimes. I know that's right. Which is still better than that.
[31:32] B: Yes, that's right.
[31:34] A: And as the earlier you get it, what do you notice happened to her face?
[31:40] B: Just.
[31:42] A: She doesn't look so troubled anymore.
[31:44] B: Yeah.
[31:44] C: No. Right.
[31:45] A: Because she's getting. It's not about me.
[31:48] C: Right. Right.
[31:50] A: Now close your eyes and shoot your consciousness into the younger you. So you kind of like inhabit her.
[31:56] B: Okay.
[31:57] A: And you're gonna grow her up from then until now. Grow up with that same wisdom.
[32:09] C: Knowing.
[32:09] A: You know, what's changed, how much better things are now.
[32:13] C: Right.
[32:14] A: So that she gets it all the.
[32:17] C: Way to a grown up. Right.
[32:20] A: And even knowing that she really only jokes with people that she likes now. Maybe one of her girlfriends or someone that she knows, she might actually joke with them.
[32:29] C: Right.
[32:29] A: But when she's joking, it's only because she likes them.
[32:34] C: Right.
[32:34] A: Because like friends that joke with you, it's because they like you.
[32:37] B: Yeah, apparently.
[32:39] A: Isn't that weird?
[32:40] B: Yeah.
[32:40] C: Right.
[32:41] A: Which isn't the same as when it was when I was little. But the difference is back then it felt like it meant that there was something wrong with me.
[32:49] C: Right, Right.
[32:53] A: And as this is getting in, what do you notice happening with the feelings inside you now?
[32:58] B: They're not. They're just not.
[33:01] C: Right.
[33:02] A: So then we can think about being at work, you know, when it's Busy. And I'm rushing around.
[33:07] C: Right.
[33:07] A: I'm trying to, like, serve people in a timely manner, and I realize, oh, my goodness, they didn't give me the extra order of like, cheese fries. So I'm going back to the kitchen. Where's the cheese fries? You're gonna need to wait.
[33:20] C: Right.
[33:20] A: What did you just notice?
[33:24] B: Okay, I'll wait.
[33:25] A: You know, like, notice how it didn't do the same thing. And we know that because you. You one first giggled, which was different than it was before. Because before it's like, yeah, right.
[33:42] C: Right, yeah.
[33:44] A: And then you'd be like, yeah, yeah, no good. I wanted a break anyway.
[33:52] C: Right, right.
[33:55] A: So just check it out.
[33:56] C: What do you notice?
[34:03] B: I guess.
[34:05] A: Who else lives with you? We got like 23 year old. We got 12 year old. Yeah.
[34:09] B: And my mom.
[34:10] A: Mom.
[34:10] B: And a puppy.
[34:11] A: And a puppy.
[34:12] C: Holy cow. What kind of puppy?
[34:13] B: Toy poodle.
[34:15] A: Like baby. One big. One tiny little thing.
[34:18] B: Yeah.
[34:19] C: Okay.
[34:19] A: My mom's got a. It's called a teacup golden doodle. Looks like a little teddy bear.
[34:24] C: Oh, God.
[34:25] B: I wanted a teacup. A teacup poodle, but too expensive. I mean, this doll cost $2,300. Me and my son got it for my mom for her birthday.
[34:40] A: That's a ship. I know.
[34:41] B: For Christmas. For Christmas. Her birthday's coming.
[34:43] A: Well, it should be for her birthday and Christmas.
[34:46] B: Right. I might have to tell her that. Christmas, birthday. Christmas and another birthday.
[34:54] C: That's right.
[34:55] A: This, we got you. This is a present that's gonna last for four good years of presents.
[35:00] B: Absolutely.
[35:03] C: Wow.
[35:03] A: Does mom love it?
[35:04] C: Yeah.
[35:06] A: Is mom retired or she working?
[35:08] B: She's retired. She's almost 80.
[35:09] A: Oh, my.
[35:10] C: All right.
[35:10] B: She's really my grandma.
[35:11] C: Okay, so grandma got it. Well, that's nice.
[35:18] A: Does she, like, help out around the house?
[35:20] B: Yeah, she's still. She's still getting it.
[35:23] C: Yeah.
[35:23] B: Yeah.
[35:23] A: I feel like she, like, will help cook or clean or.
[35:25] C: Yeah.
[35:26] A: Can she drive? Yeah.
[35:27] B: Oh, yeah.
[35:28] A: Oh, cool. So she could like pick up your 12 year old every once in a while if she needs to. Well, that's cool.
[35:35] C: Nice.
[35:36] A: I like that.
[35:37] C: Me too.
[35:40] A: We have a grandparent around.
[35:42] B: Yeah.
[35:42] C: Yeah.
[35:43] A: That's really helpful. My mom got my children on Saturday, which allowed my wife and I to have adult time.
[35:52] B: Yeah.
[35:53] A: Which, you know, is needed sometimes.
[35:55] B: Yeah.
[35:57] A: To hang out with adults and have adult conversation and so do the 23 year old and the 12 year old play the same games?
[36:08] B: Similar. Yeah.
[36:10] A: Do they have their own PlayStations or do we.
[36:13] B: Yeah, they have their own.
[36:14] A: Yes, of course they do. Because we can't just use the same one.
[36:17] B: No, because it's two different PlayStations.
[36:19] C: Right.
[36:20] A: Because what if I want a game and you want a game, but we don't want to play the same game? Back in the day, it was like, you know, you got one, you got a Nintendo. That's it. You're not getting no more.
[36:32] B: I didn't get a Nintendo. I got a Playboy. Not a place in a Playboy. No. Game Boy.
[36:38] A: Game Boy. You got a little Playboy.
[36:39] B: Play game.
[36:40] A: Nintendo.
[36:40] C: Game Boy.
[36:41] B: Yes, yes.
[36:42] A: Right. With this small, little screen, that kind of thing. Yeah. I never went to Nintendo, Rod. I got a Sega, which is the opposite version. It's like Xbox versus PlayStation. Sonic, right. I got to play Sonic the Hedgehog a lot.
[36:55] B: I like Sonic.
[36:56] C: Yeah.
[36:56] B: I like Super Mario, though.
[36:58] A: Yeah, I missed out on Super Mario. But we had arcades. We used to go into the arcade and put quarters in machines to play video games or tokens. Oh, that was the worst. The worst is when you had to change your money in for a token, which is worth nothing, out of this. Out of that place.
[37:21] B: So you can get tickets.
[37:23] A: Yeah, I didn't like the token thing. The arcades that we had growing up, they. They took regular quarters. Now the arcades are all tokens. Or now they're. Now they're all the cards that you swipe. Joke. That is not good.
[37:38] B: Sometimes.
[37:39] A: No, no. I actually worked at an arcade for a period of time. Used to have, like, this belt. It had the cash that you could get out, quarters that you'd have to count out to people.
[37:48] B: A little clicker on the belt.
[37:51] A: Yeah, no, we actually had to. We had to reach in and count them out, which, you know, your hands were really clean afterwards. So think about being at work, right? You know, because there's gonna be a time when you're really busy and stress because, like, people are asking and this person's like. But I didn't get my. Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry. Let me go back into the kitchen. Get it. Nope, you're gonna have to wait, Jenny. Sure. You can get whatever you want.
[38:20] C: What do you notice?
[38:24] A: How did you guys know? I needed a break.
[38:27] C: Yes. Thank you.
[38:28] B: I need something to drink. Let me go get some French fries with a prank for a minute. I'll go print some chicks.
[38:35] A: That's right.
[38:35] B: Go ahead.
[38:35] A: Take your time. Notice how it's not making you feel the same way. Isn't that weird?
[38:45] B: It's nice.
[38:46] A: It is nice, isn't it? Those are the kind of things that are fast to change because it's just about slight little programming.
[38:54] C: Right.
[38:55] A: So the brain starts to read it. Like if people are joking with me, it's totally because they like me as an adult. My 12 year old might get picked at. And it's not because those kids really like them. Because kids are me.
[39:10] C: Right.
[39:11] B: Kids are me.
[39:12] C: Right.
[39:12] A: Nobody wants to go back to being 12 or 13 or 14.
[39:17] C: No.
[39:18] A: My daughter got bullied when she was 13 that year. I didn't even know it was happening. It's not that we didn't even ask. We did, but she didn't like.
[39:27] B: Yeah, she's not going to tell us.
[39:28] C: Tell us.
[39:29] A: How'd you find out? Another parent told us.
[39:33] B: Oh, was it the parent of the kid that was picking on her?
[39:37] A: One of the kids? Yeah.
[39:38] B: Oh, really?
[39:39] A: Is that crazy?
[39:39] B: That is crazy.
[39:40] C: Yeah.
[39:40] A: Because they were good friends and now they're not friends at all. And then the parents aren't our friends either.
[39:44] C: It's weird.
[39:46] A: But you know, it's okay. Seventh grade drama. It's awesome. Glad she's in eighth grade.
[39:57] C: Yeah.
[39:57] A: Then we got to look for high school. Oh boy. No, nobody misses that.
[40:03] B: I hated school.
[40:04] C: Yeah. Yeah.
[40:07] A: I didn't do well in school.
[40:11] B: Like being in front of people, talking in front of people.
[40:15] A: Well, right. We all know why that was. That's not the same anymore.
[40:20] C: Right.
[40:22] A: Because there was a lot of self conscious. What are people thinking about my lip? Right. Which is why I wouldn't want to talk. Hello, everybody. How are you? I've got my piece of paper off that I'm reading. Right. That was what was causing a lot of the concern.
[40:46] C: Right.
[40:47] A: And a lot of the self consciousness. And see, again, you can even think back to being like in middle school, high school when you'd have to be in front of people knowing what they were thinking.
[40:58] C: Right.
[40:59] A: And worrying what they were thinking about me. But we already know now that it wouldn't have mattered whether it was you or somebody else. That it wasn't really about me, it was about what my lip looked like then. That it doesn't look like that now. That's right. So again, close your eyes. Think back to that younger you back during those middle school, high school days where she was really, really nervous about being up front of people because she'd rather hide out and not say anything because then they'd really like see if she was talking. Right. Let her know how different it is now. I mean, her lip, that is not necessarily talking. Right. That she's a grown up. Right? That's right. And that it's a Lot easier right now. That's right.
[41:43] C: Right.
[41:44] A: Because that didn't have anything to do with you.
[41:48] C: Right?
[41:49] A: Oh, what's happening now?
[41:57] B: Sometimes I don't know what to say.
[41:59] A: Like I know, right? That's why. But here's the cool part. Sometimes you don't know what to say. As if there's some sort of thing that you're supposed to say, but there isn't ever a thing that you're supposed to say. Do you want to know why I asked the question what's happening now?
[42:19] B: Why?
[42:20] A: Because it brings me and the other person into now. Okay? Because the person's gotta check what is happening now. Now they're checking what's happening now versus they could have been floating in their mind or in their body or anywhere else. What's happening now brings me and them to now. Why do we want people in now? Well, it's the only time we can do anything, right? I can't do effective change work later or yesterday. I can only do it now. So I asked the question, what's happening now? And then the second question I ask a lot is, well, how's your body feeling? Because again the people kind of like check inside. Well, how is my body feeling? Because most of the time, guess what? We don't pay any attention to how our body's feeling unless our body's hurting. That's when we pay attention to it. Right. Normally throughout our day to day life, we're not paying any attention to how we're walking or how our body feels unless it's hurting. As soon as our body starts hurting, we're paying attention to how our body feels. But it's the only time that we do. But sometimes we want to check in. Well, how's your body feeling?
[43:26] C: Huh?
[43:27] A: I didn't realize that it had been more tense enough. It was intention. Now the tensions could have gone, right. Isn't that cool?
[43:39] C: Yeah.
[43:40] A: Those are the things that are changing. And that's why when we do work with people, we don't want to work just up here. Because you can talk to somebody and you can tell them all the different things and they can understand it up here, but doesn't change how they feel in here. We always want to do the work that's going to change how they feel inside. Because then once that changes, they think different, they react, they respond, they deal with things in a different and better way.
[44:09] C: Yeah.
[44:10] A: What are the busy nights? What nights do you have? At the point? I would always walk around, welcome to the point. Do you see my point? Hey, welcome to the point.
[44:21] B: No, I work Wednesday and Thursday there.
[44:24] C: Okay.
[44:24] B: And it's. Listen, last two weeks, it's been busy at night time. Yes.
[44:30] A: She's gone. Lots of people and it's just gonna get busy.
[44:33] B: Listen, the whole. Like at 4, 30, ish. 5.
[44:37] C: Yeah.
[44:38] B: Like everybody comes at once because it's Venice.
[44:40] A: Yeah.
[44:41] B: And they're coming for the sunset, so they all come at once. All the tables get sat at once. Like, they don't put a hold on the door.
[44:46] C: Jesus.
[44:47] B: They don't put a hold on the door. Like, you know, it's gonna be about 15, 20 minutes. No, they just see every single chair in the house, two stories.
[44:55] A: Oh, my. And then you gotta get everybody their stuff.
[44:58] C: Yeah.
[44:58] A: Cause that'll be.
[44:59] B: And then the cooks, they're pissed. Yeah, absolutely. They're overworked, so.
[45:05] C: Right.
[45:06] B: But they don't. At the point. The kitchen staff isn't like at Applebee's. Different.
[45:11] C: Totally.
[45:13] B: They just keep cooking and it's nice.
[45:16] C: Yeah.
[45:17] A: Well, it is theirs faster. I mean, some seafood is faster.
[45:21] B: No, not really. It's longer ticket times, but it's better food. And they kind of.
[45:28] A: And people are going there knowing.
[45:30] B: Yes.
[45:30] A: That they're going to have a restaurant experience.
[45:36] C: Right.
[45:36] A: When you go to a restaurant to have a restaurant experience, you know, you're gonna get there, you're gonna go ahead and order your drink. You're gonna. If you get most get an appetizer. Right. And you know that once you get your appetizer, you can have your meals gonna be in, but it's gonna take a little long, so you have a longer period of time. You work, go to some place like Applebee's. Like, I actually have 20 minutes to get my meal and out of here. So.
[45:59] B: Yeah, they're very impatient.
[46:03] C: Yeah, right.
[46:04] A: Because they're not there for a restaurant experience. They're there to eat dinner.
[46:08] B: Get the hell out.
[46:09] A: Get the hell out.
[46:09] B: Right.
[46:10] A: Where. When you go to some place like that, they're there for a restaurant experience. Very different.
[46:16] C: Yeah, yeah.
[46:19] A: And it's Venice. So you're dealing with people that are older.
[46:22] B: Some.
[46:22] C: Yeah, all of them, aren't they?
[46:25] B: A lot of people, they're on vacation or whatever. Or snowbirds. Yeah, yeah.
[46:31] A: I thought, you know, just a different.
[46:33] B: It's not hood. Like, it's not ghetto.
[46:36] A: Right, right, right. You're gonna get a different clientele go there. Then you're gonna get to go to Applebee's. And the per item price is a little bit higher there than it is at Applebee's. Which is different than even, like, Hyde Park Steakhouse.
[46:56] B: Oh, yeah. I've never been there.
[46:59] A: Yeah, Downtown Sarasota, but I mean, you're not going to get out of there. One, the drinks are all way more money. Two, the steaks are 40, 50 bucks a piece.
[47:11] B: I'm not going there. I'm not going there.
[47:14] C: Mom.
[47:15] A: We could have gone to the steakhouse, but we got you a damn dog for the next eight birthdays and Christmases.
[47:21] B: He's good.
[47:23] A: Good.
[47:23] C: Thank you. Right?
[47:26] A: But that's the difference.
[47:28] C: Yeah.
[47:30] A: Cool. How much longer you have in your outreach program with Selah?
[47:34] B: I'm in phase three.
[47:35] A: Phase three? Are there only three phases?
[47:38] B: Yep.
[47:38] A: All right, so then do you go in front of judge, and judge says you can.
[47:44] B: She'll graduate me whenever it's time. I don't know. I'm probably having more classes I gotta take. I don't know.
[47:49] C: Okay.
[47:50] B: So tonight's our last or tomorrow night's the last night of our how not to Marry a Jerk.
[47:55] A: Oh.
[47:56] B: So I don't know what's after that.
[47:59] C: Okay.
[48:00] A: Cause graduation is gonna be coming up. I could have sworn I got an email with a hold that saved the date.
[48:06] B: I don't know. They just do it whenever. I guess on Wednesdays when we have court.
[48:12] C: Okay.
[48:12] B: It's like.
[48:14] A: Yeah, but then you should be able to get stuff wiped off.
[48:17] B: Hopefully.
[48:20] A: Cool. Well, you did great. I'm really proud of you.
[48:22] B: Thank you.
[48:22] C: Yeah.
[48:23] A: Really good connecting with you.
[48:24] B: It's nice meeting you.
[48:26] A: All right, well, we'll stop with that for now. If other stuff pops up, you're.
