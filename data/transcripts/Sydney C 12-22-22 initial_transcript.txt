[00:00] A: Today is the 22nd of December. December.
[00:05] B: Wow.
[00:06] A: Jeez. Sydney. This is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful and valuable, transformative, that might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Cool. So I'm really interested in learning what you think would be useful for me to know, to understand how things have bed. Right. So some people tell me that they are more on edge. They're more easily irritated, agitated, aggravated. They're quick, they're short tempered, they're reactive. They do. They say shit that later on they wish they hadn't. They'd like to get that subtle tonsil. Some people are more tense, nervous, anxious. They get racy thoughts. Sometimes it affects sleep, sometimes it moves into panic. Sometimes it's uneasiness in certain social situations, worrying about whether they're going to be or say the right or what other people are thinking. Like there's all that kind of self they don't want to be feeling like that. Some people go, well, there's shit that's happened that although it's over, it still bugs me. I don't think about it all the time, but if I do, it's still there. I think like that gone. Some people go, for me, I'm more down, depressed. I just sad. I don't know why. I had energy to do things and now I don't. Some people are like, well, for me it's like loss. Like there's people that were really close to me that now aren't around and like I have a lot of like upset about that. So those are like the big categories. Okay. That I know how to get better.
[01:32] B: Okay. It's a lot.
[01:35] A: That being said, what would be useful for me to know? What do we want our time to do for you?
[01:40] B: I have like the uneasiness. I have like social anxiety real bad.
[01:43] A: Okay. How so? I don't know.
[01:47] B: Like I have like anxiety, like my head. I don't know how to explain it. Like I have cloud in my head constantly. It's hard for me to focus. I get racing thoughts sometimes. Social anxiety? Yeah.
[02:05] A: How does the social anxiety happen? When do you know when to do that?
[02:08] B: Like right now. I mean it's not even social. It's just me and you.
[02:13] A: But still I'm like, like, are you now having thoughts about you? Are you feeling tension in your body? Just like tension. Where do you feel it?
[02:23] B: Here and here.
[02:23] A: Like a new chance.
[02:24] B: Yeah.
[02:25] A: And then there's a lot of stuff. Is there pressure here or just a lot of noise up there? Just.
[02:34] B: Just like, like I'll have stuff in my head and then when I go to say, it just disappears. Does that make sense? I don't know how to explain it. Like, I don't know, like I'll have something to say, but then I'm nervous about it.
[02:51] A: Nervous about whether it's gonna be okay to say it right, if it's gonna.
[02:54] B: Come out right or, you know, I don't know if people's gonna think what I said stupid. It's just, it's dumb. I don't even know like how to comprehend it.
[03:03] A: So a lot of self consciousness.
[03:05] B: Yes.
[03:06] A: We'd like you to stop thinking about you so much. Yes.
[03:13] B: I'm not good at this kind of stuff.
[03:15] A: I don't know whether that's true. I don't know either. Right. You don't know whether you're good at this. I'm not good at this topic. You don't know whether you are or not. I don't know whether you know that you're getting confused. You might be getting confused and that's okay. Sydney. Uh huh. So there's a lot of self consciousness. That's what I mean by. We need you to stop thinking so much about you or worrying about what others might be thinking about you. We want you to be more uptime and outwardly focused. Does that make sense? So that you're outwardly focused, you're not spending a lot of time worrying about them, what they're thinking about you, whether you'll say the right thing or. Or. Or. Got it?
[04:11] B: Yeah. Okay.
[04:13] A: So that's one of the things that we want our time to do. We want to make it so that it's easier for you to interact in group or social situations. That even in those moments you have more comfort in you. That sounds good so far, doesn't it?
[04:38] B: Yeah.
[04:38] A: Okay. What else do we want our time to do? What else would be useful for me to know?
[04:49] B: Um, I guess I'm kind of depressed a little bit. I don't know. I'm just tired all the time. Just down. Like I don't have energy. I feel like.
[05:08] A: Okay, so you've been feeling tired and down and you haven't had the same energy. Okay, so give me kind of like a, like just a headline view of like what's happened over the past couple years.
[05:30] B: Past couple years.
[05:33] A: Right. Like that got you to time.
[05:36] B: So I broke the law, of course. And then I was in my addiction.
[05:42] A: Broke the law by, like, stealing shit. Broke the law by stealing shit?
[05:45] B: Yes. Okay. I was stealing shit to support my addiction.
[05:49] A: And what was the drug of choice then?
[05:51] B: I was doing heroin and ice.
[05:56] A: An ice. Heroin and ice? Yeah. Interesting. Okay.
[06:02] B: Yeah, yeah. Heroin and ice was my last addiction. So I was doing that pretty heavy for, like, three years, and then broke the law. And then I was on probation. I got charges in Manatee and Sarah Services. Sarasota put me on probation, so I got a lawyer in Manatee county, and they got me in a title court, so. And then they sent me to first step for 28 days.
[06:30] A: Okay.
[06:31] B: So. But right before that, you know, I was just. I was just. I was trying to quit, but I was just substituting one for another, you know? Like, I wasn't. I just couldn't quit on my own because, you know, the heroin addiction is a lot physical, you know, and it's. I didn't want to do it, but I did want to do it, but I couldn't do it. So I ended up going. They sent me to jail for seven days, like, on a safety warrant because I didn't finish my detox, and then I went to rehab. They sent me back to detox, and then I went back to rehab. So then here I am now.
[07:13] A: Okay. So how long has it been now? Clean and clear, like, eight months. That's pretty cool. Good job.
[07:21] B: All on my own without being sent to jail or rehab, you know, like, as long as I've actually wanted to stay clean.
[07:27] A: Yeah.
[07:28] B: Yeah.
[07:28] A: That's really cool. Good job. Thanks. Yeah. Okay. And we don't kind of head down that pathway of that kind of stuff unless there was other stuff that happened along the way. I mean, I'm pretty sure you probably grew up with a really stable household.
[07:49] B: Yeah, I did.
[07:50] A: Right. Mom and dad. Never any fighting.
[07:56] B: My dad died when I was, like, 14, so.
[07:59] A: Okay.
[07:59] B: I think that's kind of where.
[08:01] A: Well, that's pretty troubling.
[08:02] B: Yeah.
[08:05] A: Okay. Were you there?
[08:07] B: Yeah.
[08:08] A: Did you find him?
[08:09] B: He died. He had leukemia. He died in our home. So he just.
[08:13] A: So it was a progressive.
[08:15] B: Yeah.
[08:15] A: Okay. So that's kind of sucky. I bet, even thinking about it now, they're still heaviness.
[08:20] B: Yeah.
[08:20] A: Okay. So we'd like to lighten the grief. Yeah, that would be useful. Right. We want to get it so that you're more at peace and that you can have a more ongoing connection with him. Because right now, anytime you think about him, it's that Loss, that kind of clouds any joyful moments that I had in the 14 years that we were together. We'd like that thing to not be so in the way. Okay, cool. I know how to do that too. That's great. It is. It's really good. Yeah. Hey. Okay, so then that was 14. And then was mom off kilter after that?
[09:04] B: She wasn't the same.
[09:06] A: You know, you have siblings? They're half siblings, but dad's moms.
[09:12] B: See, my mom and my dad, they adopted me. They were my grandparents.
[09:15] A: Got it.
[09:16] B: So they were my adoptive. My mom, my biological mom was my grandmother. That was my. Her daughter was my biological mom.
[09:23] A: Yeah. But.
[09:24] B: Yeah.
[09:25] A: And that she didn't. She had issues, Challenges my biological mom.
[09:29] B: Yeah, she still has issues.
[09:31] A: Still. Okay. Yeah, so we have some contact with.
[09:34] B: Her, but yeah, she'll be here Saturday.
[09:37] A: Okay, good. Awesome. Woohoo.
[09:39] B: Yeah.
[09:39] A: Love holidays with family. Well, yeah, baby.
[09:43] B: Yeah.
[09:45] A: Okay, so she had problems growing up. And then you were adopted by grandparents. Got it. And then grandpa, who was dad, he died at 14. Got it. Okay. And then grandma wasn't the same as mom. And of course mom, whose birth mom, bio mom has never been. Okay, and are they all Floridian people or. Where'd you come from?
[10:12] B: No, we're from South Carolina.
[10:13] A: South Carolina. What part?
[10:15] B: Marion.
[10:16] A: Marion, South Carolina. All right. We go up to Paulie's island in South Carolina. Done that for like eight years.
[10:28] B: South Carolina's great.
[10:30] A: South Carolina is great.
[10:31] B: It's great.
[10:33] A: Yeah. Okay, so Mom's coming from South Carolina?
[10:39] B: No, she lives in Lutz, Florida, in a nudist colony.
[10:43] A: Oh, she lives out there in, like, Lake Como, that whole thing. Yeah. Well, good for her. Yeah, right? Yeah, sure.
[10:52] B: Each is home. We went there during the hurricane.
[10:57] A: Oh, good. So you got to take your clothes off.
[10:59] B: I didn't. Everybody else did. Bunch of old people walking around naked.
[11:06] A: Yeah, that's exactly what I want to be seeing. Okay, what else would be useful for me to know? Well, does it ever seem like things that you've gone through, although they're over, continue to impact you?
[11:35] B: I mean, not so much. I mean, I think about stuff that's happened in the past, but, like, I kind of, like, I don't know, I try not to let it bother me, you know?
[11:52] A: Like, it doesn't matter whether it does.
[11:55] B: Right.
[11:55] A: You try not to let it bother you, but it still does sometimes a little bit.
[11:59] B: Like the criminal part bothers me. Like, because, you know, I have to get a job, you know, I mean, I have a job, but you Know, trying to get a new job. You know, sometimes I do background checks. I mean, that's part of the past. It bothers me sometimes.
[12:12] A: Like, bother you? Like, guilty bother you?
[12:14] B: No. Shameful. Frustrating.
[12:15] A: Just. Okay, yeah, it's just frustrating.
[12:18] B: But, I mean, I've tried to, like, not let the past affect my future. If anything, I try to not things that are happening now, you know, if something happens now, it reminds me of my past. I try to just cut it off, you know, Like, I'm not gonna live, like. Like, say, a past relationship. I'm with someone that is an alcoholic, you know, Like, I try to wipe it out, you know, like, just leave him. Yeah, I'm working on it.
[12:57] A: Huh.
[12:58] B: He's leaving it the first of the year. He's got his own place. So I've. Yeah, he's just kind of waiting till the holidays are over.
[13:08] A: But we still are. Got a picker that's off?
[13:12] B: Yeah.
[13:13] A: Because I keep finding myself attracted to these guys that are that way. Right. That's where it's still impacting.
[13:20] B: Yes.
[13:20] A: Right. So we all have. And here's the key thing to understand. Physical wounds are the wounds that we all say heal over time. Because we have the saying, time heals all wounds. But we only were talking about physical wounds. So if I broke my foot because I tripped off a curb, that happened when I was 11. If I was as emotional right now as when that happened to me at 11, you'd look at me like, I'm freaking crazy. What's wrong with this guy? It's fine. But if I told you about something that my uncle did to me when I spent the week at his house over the summer when I was 11, and I started to get all emotional, he. You'd be like, well, yeah, of course. Weird. Why does the emotional wound not heal? We don't even think it will. So the emotional wound doesn't heal. Not because it can't. It's literally because when I went through it, part of my brain short circuited. An emotional part got stuck. And that emotional part of my brain doesn't know that moment has ended because that part of my brain has no access to time. So at that part, it's perpetually ongoing. Always now. That's only that part the rest of me moved forward. The rest of me knows that it's not happening. The rest of me knows that it's data. The rest of me might even know that it happening wasn't my fault. I don't feel that way. So part of the error is that our Brain doesn't get the good news that it's over. Where therapy got it wrong is it thought I buried it and repressed it, and we gotta get it out of me. We don't have to get it out. We want to do the reverse. Get the good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know the negative thing is over. That's a very different thing. Follow me with that. Right. So where most people go, oh, you need to tell me about what happened while being in the emotions of it, because we need to get those feelings out of you. We're coming from a different view, that we don't need to get the feelings out that we need to get the good news in. So the part of the brain that doesn't know that moment has ended gets that the moment's over. Soon as it realizes that it's over, all the emotion that was attached to it goes away. Your brain hasn't been making you feel bad about that stuff because it's wanted you to feel bad. It's actually been causing you to feel bad to try to motivate you to get that stuff to stop. The error is that it doesn't know that it already stopped. It's trying to get you to get it to stop. It's not that it already stopped. We don't even need to get it to stop because it's in a time period that no longer exists. That's what we want to get into that part of the brain that, yes, I have data about something that happened that was yucky, but the data memory that I have is not the same thing as the yucky experience. And as soon as your brain reads what happened is data as memory, the feelings go away, and we can do it in a painless way, which is pretty cool. So that's one. We want to get the impact of the prior stuff that has happened, whether it be stuff that you did that you felt bad you did, or stuff that happened to you. We want to get the effect that that's had cleared and gone. We want to get the picker adjusted so that you're finding yourself more attracted to and attracting guys that are more. Well, got it. Like, that's one of the things we want to get adjusted so that you become much more okay in you. You become more at peace, more comfortable in your own skin. Yeah. Okay. What else, Sydney, would be useful for me to know what else are we wanting to get better for? I don't know.
[18:15] B: It's hard to think about.
[18:17] A: Do you have children? I do you do? Okay. How old are your children?
[18:22] B: 12 and 23.
[18:23] A: 12 and 20. So really close.
[18:27] B: 10 years apart.
[18:28] A: This is great. I can't even imagine that 10 years after have another hole. Oh, I thought four years was really far. Oh my. Yeah. Okay. So are they with you? Are they elsewhere?
[18:44] B: They're with me at home. I live with my mom. We all live in my mom's house.
[18:48] A: Okay.
[18:49] B: They've been with her pretty much all their lives. I've been in and out, you know, cuz my addiction. But yeah.
[18:57] A: Okay. Okay. Are there things that you've done that although they're over, there's still like regret, remorse, disgust, anger. Me. Yeah.
[19:12] B: There's things I'm embarrassed by. Yeah. You know, not being there and just not being a good mom at times? Yeah, of course.
[19:22] A: Okay. So getting that stuff cleared up would be better too. Because they're not better off with a mom who's guilty. Right. We don't make best decisions. We don't perform our best when we're feeling guilty or having a lot of remorse or regret or shame over stuff I didn't do or should have done or didn't or got it right. The field goal kicker for our favorite team. We don't want him feeling really horribly bad guilty about having missed the one at the end of the game when he's lining up for the game winner in overtime. Oh, if I had already made that one, it wouldn't even be here right now. What if I missed this one? Right. We don't want him feeling bad. Got it. So we want that shifted too. That doesn't mean that your absence was okay, but we want you to be okay now. Even if what happened back then wasn't because you're better off and so are they. Okay, cool. Any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know?
[20:47] B: Not right now. Maybe once we move along, maybe something else will pop up. I don't think of anything right now.
[20:54] A: Okay, cool. So then really the things that we want to get shifted and better one is you recognize that there's been a tendency in certain situations, individual or group, that you've got lots and lots of discomfort in your body that you feel in your chest, some up here, raciness, lots of worries about what others might be thinking about you, some awkwardness and whether I'm going to say or do the right. That's something that we want to get cleared and gone so that you're much more at peace and more comfortable in you in those situations, much more outwardly focused so that you're not spending time thinking about you and that you've got more ease in moving through it. Like, this is quiet, right? So that's one of the things that we want to do. Two, you mentioned that. Well, there's still some stuck grief around loss, so we want to get that shifted. There's been several things that have happened that still have a haunting underneath the surface effect. Even when I try not to allow it, there's the error in my picker that I keep finding myself picking. I'm getting better at knowing it. That's a good thing. So I don't stay in it as long, but I'd like that to get adjusted. So that's different. Right. We want to get it so that you're having more energy and interest and zest in doing stuff. Those are the big pieces that I remember out of what I said. Is there anything I missed? Okay, so a couple things for you to know before we go about doing change work. One, the lens that we're gonna look at this stuff through is different because normal lens goes. That thing makes me feel this way. That person said that I felt this when I did that. I made me do this. Me not being causes this. The stuff of life makes me feel whether it's the past stuff that happened, the current stuff that's happening, the future stuff that it's stuff that causes feelings. That lens is not wrong, but it doesn't give us much power because we only have two things that we can do. One, try to change it. We work real hard to change the stuff. If I can't change it, get the hell away from it. But you already know in life, there's some stuff I can't change and other stuff I can't completely get away from. A bunch of past stuff I can't get it to have not happened. We got to do something else. Right? Where we're coming in is getting that a lens like lion and zebra, right? If we look from the lens that the lion makes the zebra scared, which makes sense. Or we look through the lens that it's zebra's brain causing zebra to feel alert, motivated, and stronger, scared. Doing it as soon as zebra sees senses, feels, smells, or thinks lions coming. So that's the lens we want to look through. That there's ways in which your brain works that causes you to feel bad in response to this stuff, and that some of the ways it's suboptimal. We want to adjust those parts make sense. Just like as the adult you, you know that bio mom not being around had nothing to do with you or her love for you, or your good enoughness or lovability. There were moments when you were young that it did feel like if I mattered, then she would be you. Follow me with that. So you can know that up here, Sydney, but still not feel that in here. The change that we're interested in having happen is to change how you feel in here. That way, when I encounter the similar situation, it's not setting this off. Does that make sense? Cool. So if we look at it from the lens that your brain makes you feel. First question. Do you really think it wants you to feel bad?
[25:44] B: Say that again.
[25:45] A: Sorry.
[25:46] B: My brain goes.
[25:46] A: Where'd you go?
[25:47] B: I don't know.
[25:48] A: It does that. Z.
[25:52] B: My brain loses focus.
[25:53] A: Sorry. There you go. And you brought it right back.
[25:55] B: Okay.
[25:56] A: Isn't that good? See, the issue isn't that your brain loses focus is that when you recognize that it has. You bring it back. Right. Because your brain is designed to lose focus. That's what it does. It thinks thoughts which may have to do with what we're doing or nothing at all to do with what we're doing. And both ways are okay. Right. The thing you want to do is when you notice that you're off track, you bring it back. Which is what you did. That's the good part. Even though you just did it. Yeah.
[26:33] B: Especially like when I'm talking to somebody and then like I don't not try to be rude, but like I'll just. My brain will just go somewhere else and I don't even know what I'm thinking about. Like.
[26:42] A: No, you got went down a different track.
[26:44] B: Yeah.
[26:44] A: Whatever was said, turn me down. Open up that lane. Went down the different track.
[26:48] B: Yeah. I don't know why it does that.
[26:50] A: Right. Like me blinding following the Google maps when it's still not sending me in this place that I need to go. But this is what it said to do.
[27:00] B: Yeah.
[27:01] A: Where am I? I don't know. I'm back now. Yeah.
[27:08] B: Okay.
[27:08] A: Repeat. Yeah. So we're looking through the lens that what causes you to feel bad is something your brain does to you. Even though it does it in response to stuff. And by bad, we may mean like, you know, thoughts of using. Right. So your brain causes different things. Right. If we look at it that your brain makes you feel bad, the first question is, do you really think it wants you to feel bad? No. Do you think it would want you to feel good? Most people say yes, but it's no. See, this is the problem. What we have learned in working with thousands of people. You're a bright gal. I'm a pretty bright guy. Most of our brain emotionally works like the brain of an animal. So our brain doesn't make us feel because it's concerned about our mood or our sense of self esteem or sense of self worth, or whether we feel lovable or good enough or smart or pretty or taller causes it to motivate us. Just like the animal to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. When the rabbit sees a fox, the brain makes it experience fear to get it to run away, not because it wanted it to have a bad day. Squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire. Pain. But not because it wants a squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid, dumb moron. And now it's embarrassed because it's mortar on all the other squirrels. Simple. Get the tail out of the fire. All the negative emotions we experience, hurt, sadness, sorrow, grief, anger, guilt, shame, regret, remorse, angst, upset, worry, pain, all that shit is caused by the same part of our brain that works just like an animal for the purpose of motivating us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. The error, as I outlined earlier, is that many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem that we can't solve. That's why we feel shitty about the same things over and over and over again, right? Good news, Sydney. Many of the things that we feel shitty are either A, in time periods that haven't happened yet, or B, in time periods that are already finished. So we don't need to solve the problem. We need to update the timing. And that's the error is timing. And the reason why timing errors is that we've got this other part to our brain, our intellect. And our intellect gives us knowledge, time. You know, you're sitting here with me, you can think of something you did this morning, you can think about something you're going to go do later. No other animal can do it. Not a problem if it's positive or neutral. Because then our brain knows the difference between the memory of it and it, right? I tell you about a story of me going to Key West. We get the boat across, right? We went and saw Hemingway's house. We went out deep sea fishing. We saw Florida marlin. We didn't catch it, but we saw one, right? Like we went down, up and down Duvall street, all right? We got this really cool like candle that's of like I tell you about all the whole thing you took our picture next to the sign, right? But you know that I know the difference between the memory of doing it and doing it. It's totally clear. Somebody's telling you, though, about something that was awful, bad, weird, confusing, upsetting, horrific, catastrophic, traumatic. Brain will confuse the memory, the data, the info about it, thinking it's it. So a guy tells us about being mugged, happened 22 years ago. He happened to be in Albuquerque, right? He gets to the part where the guy has got the knife up at his throat, whispering, can you breathe in? This guy's face is white, his voice is choked, his arms are trembling, he's got tears. We're nice. What the fuck is happening? Right? And people go, he's reliving it. But what's really going on is part of his brain is confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience. That's why he's having the reaction. Makes sense. We can tell it's affecting him when he was talking to us because we see it, but it was also affecting him even over the weekend when he was playing Frisbee with his son. It was under the surface up here. The dude knows he's safe, he's with us. It's over. He survived. There's no freaking knife. We also know that part of his brain never got the good news. That's the error. Make sense. So the first thing is the brain doesn't know that the moment over, second thing that happens. What are we trained to believe when we're little? Good things happen. When I'm good, I get toys, I get presents, I get candy, I get kisses, I get hugs, I get great things, I get praise. Everything good happens when I'm good. Good things happen because I'm good. Great. If life is good and nothing but good, I never met anybody, right? But what does that reinforce? If good happens because I'm good, bad only happens when I'm bad. And I know that because I got a big spanking when I was coloring on the wall. I did something I wasn't supposed to do. Mommy was mad. Mommy spanked me. Bad things happen when I'm bad. So now my nervous system learns that if it's bad, it's totally my fault. It's because I must have done something wrong. I should have known better. So now the dad used to be involved in the family. Dad's gone, not there anymore. Kid doesn't go, oh, well, Dad's a drunk and alcoholic. That's why he's not around. No kid goes, if I was more lovable, Daddy would Be at the event. Daddy would take me to Disney when he said he was going. And daddy would watch the ball game. No, not there. Feels like it's about me, right? You know, girl goes out on a date with a friend of a friend. Seemed to be great. She went to the restroom. She had no idea that he was going to put something in her drink. But you did. You know, she woke up after he raped her, like, what the fuck? But of course, she's blaming herself for having been so stupid and careless. She never should have got the cocktail, should have taken it to the bathroom, right? Because she should be thinking that a buddy's friend is going to, you know, fuck. But because it's bad, it's my fault. Got it. So with all the bad stuff, it gets layered in that it means stuff about me. And then because those two things are active, my brain is looking for it, scanning for anything that's similar, but confuses similar as same. That's why the soldier dies on the ground in the firework burst. Not because he doesn't know it's the 4th of July. He lit it different part of his brain confused thumb with grenade. Got it. And that's the dramatic. But it could be smaller, could be something that co occurred. I remember a woman telling me about getting mugged by somebody wearing a hoodie in TJ Maxx. Right? Now her best. Her. Her son's best friend is coming over to the house. He's nine. He's wearing a hoodie. She's panicking. Now we know that the issue for her when she was mugged was not what the guy was wearing was what he did, but because they co occurred, they got merged. That's why times of day or times of year can be triggers for people. Make sense, right? Different sounds, different smells. Even things that weren't a part of the problem get merged. Like the woman who was really troubled by Nilla Wafers. Come to find out she happened to be eating one when her mom and dad told her they were divorcing. She can't go near those things. So pissed off that her best friend put him in banana pudding. What's wrong with her? Could she do that to me? Now we know as an adult that Nilla Wafers don't make parents divorce. But that part of the brain is not logical make sense. So that's what got in stuck. And then we even layer it in because you know, all the roots of. Of everything bad that happens is because of you women. You didn't know that was totally your fault. I mean, you brought the apple to Adam, and if you hadn't brought the apple, then Adam wouldn't have eaten the apple, and then we wouldn't be in the situation we're in. But, you know, if Eve comes over with an apple and she's like, hey, Adam. Oh, you're not gonna eat the apple? You're not gonna eat the apple. You're not gonna have any of the apple. Adam's like, well, I'm eating that fucking apple. Right. But we get it layered all in, so, of course. Well, you know, the guy, you know, manhandled me. Yeah, but what were you wearing? What the fuck does that matter? I was wearing a very pretty dress. Yeah, sure, it showed a little cleavage that didn't give him the right. But still goes back to Ivy. Right. So all of that stuff, stuff gets stuck. We want to get that cleared. We want to get it so that you're in the right state. And that's why we create. How do we want you to be. Because if you weren't finding yourself having that anxious nervousness in those social situations, that that thing wasn't on overdrive, if you were feeling that you were more grounded and centered inside, you had access to more of your energy, that you were more at peace with the stuff that you did in the stuff that happened to you, like, what would that actually be? Like, you don't know, do you? But, like, might it be desirable, even if you don't know what it would be like to be free from the effect of the pasta, to be much more emotionally present and outwardly focused, to be much more comfortable in your own skin, lighter, more and more present. Yeah. Knowing that you have what you need inside to deal with what might show up. Yeah. And actually feeling really good about what you're doing. Right. What you've already accomplished. Right. Which is like eight plus months clean, which is fantastic. Really good. Yay. Like, really cool. Yeah. That's huge. Right? We want to do stuff that accelerates where we're headed. Make sense. Yes. Yeah. So I'm going to teach you something that's kind of interesting. Because if we were to symbolize the future, you, who's more present, who's much more uptime and outwardly focused, who's much more at peace, who's free from the effect of the past, who's lightened up on herself. Right. And we were to symbolize this, you as a wild animal, something out in nature, something up in the sky, something that might grow from the ground. We're going to make it up. But let's symbolize the future, you wild animal. Something out in nature, something up in the sky. What comes to mind to symbolize the you who's at peace, who's clear, who's free?
[37:59] B: I don't know.
[38:01] A: I know. You don't know. We're making one up. If you were to symbolize somebody who's present and clear and free as a wild animal, what animal comes to mind?
[38:23] B: I mean, a bird would be a good one. Some kind of bird flying around.
[38:26] A: Oh, a bird that's flying. Yeah, a bird that's flying up above and over. Right, there we go. So now we've got a symbol. Now we're going to do a process that activates the symbol. It's very simple. You won't be able to mess it up. Okay.
[38:41] B: Are you sure I'm gonna messing stuff up?
[38:43] A: Well, I'm pretty sure you won't be able to mess this one up. I'm gonna describe it to you and then we're gonna do it together. So you know how to do it. So how it works is you look up with your eyes, not with your head. You don't have to do it yet.
[38:55] B: Okay.
[38:55] A: You're going to picture in your mind's eye or think soaring bird. Thinking as you do this, you're going to take a slow, deep breath in. And then when you exhale, you close your eyes. You'll keep your eyes closed as you take a deep breath in. You'll exhale. And as you do, you'll allow your eyes to open. Got it? So look up and out. Think soaring bird. Deep breath in.
[39:26] B: Oh, yeah. So let's close my eyes. Close my eyes.
[39:28] A: No, not yet.
[39:29] B: No, not yet.
[39:30] A: You're gonna follow what I'm saying.
[39:32] B: Okay.
[39:32] A: I'll tell you exactly what to do. You're doing great. So look up and out. Think soaring bird. Take a deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. Keep your eyes closed as you now inhale deeply. And then as you exhale. That's right. Allow your eyes to open. It's so good. I want to get it right.
[40:03] B: Excuse me. Okay. Are you gonna try it again?
[40:08] A: Yeah.
[40:11] B: Okay.
[40:12] A: Because it could get easier for you, right? Because all you're doing is just listening over here, right? Right. So you look up and out and you think soaring bird. You take a deep breath in. You exhale and you close your eyes. Your eyes close. They stay closed as you take another breath in. And then this time, as you exhale, you allow your eyes to open. Beautiful. That didn't take long. No. And as you did it this time, what did you notice happening in your body? Feeling more tenser, more calm?
[41:03] B: Maybe a little calmer.
[41:05] A: It was a little more calm, wasn't it, than the first time? Right.
[41:08] B: I'm thinking too much about it and.
[41:10] A: We can do it again. Well, you can't do it wrong.
[41:12] B: I was thinking about doing it wrong.
[41:15] A: The first time way more than the second.
[41:17] B: Yes.
[41:17] A: The second time you were just present. And now we add the neuroscience levers of slightly lowering your jaw and resting your tongue. Because when you do those things, it actually causes the vagal nerve to become activated and puts the body into parasympathetic response. So you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You look up and out and you think, soaring bird. Now take that deep breath in. And then exhale and close your eyes. Good. Keeping your eyes closed. Another deep breath in. And then as you exhale, allow your eyes to open. That was pretty easy, right? And notice that this time we did it, it was a little bit easier. And you notice feeling a little calmer. Right. Isn't that cool? So I'm going to show you one other thing that you don't even know that you're in. Because when we're stressed and anxious, we're in tunnel vision. So watch what happens when you stay looking at me and my nose. And then you see my fingers stay looking at my nose, but my fingers move out. As they move out, notice that with the sides of your eyes, you can see them wiggling. Right. Now you're noticing more space towards the side walls and doors, windows. Right. Lower your jaw slightly. Rest your tongue. Breathe a little bit slower and deeper in. Longer exhale. Right. Think about the bird. Take a deep breath in and a longer exhale. Notice the space. Right. Again, checking inside. What do you notice happening with your body? It is, but it's weird because how could it be right? Just by breathing? So the homework assignment is multiple times throughout the day. Look up. Think soaring bird. Breathe in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Breathe in. Exhale. Open your eyes. What that's doing is priming. Priming is setting up your brain so that when we get back together for our treatment session, we can move in and accelerated pace. Got it?
[43:52] B: Got it.
[43:53] A: Cool. And then we will get back together in the new year. We're gonna have like a two and a half hour chunk of time altogether. It won't even seem to you like it was that long. And we'll do all sorts of stuff to get things better. Cool. Really great meeting you any questions for me? No, not right now.
[44:16] B: I think I'm going to Yellow.
[44:17] A: Maybe you will.
[44:19] B: Okay.
[44:20] A: If you remember.
