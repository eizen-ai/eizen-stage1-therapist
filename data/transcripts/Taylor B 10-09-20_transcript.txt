[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 9th of October, Taylor. This is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that and given what we do is useful, valuable, beneficial, it may be made available in teaching and training other professionals and how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes, yes. All right, cool. So let's kind of get an idea of what we want our time to actually get accomplished. Accomplish for you. Right. Like, if we could really change ways that you feel, think, act, react that haven't been optimal. What do you want our time to do?
[00:38] B: Oh, my goodness. I guess I, like, should have prepared myself.
[00:41] A: Oh, I don't know about that. I mean, because like, if we think of it in generalities, like, some people come in and they're a lot more on edge. They're more easily irritated, agitated, aggravated. They're quick, they're short tempered, they're reactive. They say they do shit that later on they wish they hadn't said or done. They don't want to feel like that. Some people are more tense, nervous, anxious. They have racing thoughts, they have jitteriness, they have uneasiness, they have discomfort. In certain social situations, sometimes it moves into full fledged panic anxiety. Sometimes it affects them at night when they're trying to rest. It's just on. They'd like that to stop. Right. Some people go, you know, for me it's loss. Like, there's people that have died that every time I think about them, it still like kind of impacts me. I'd like that to. Some people go, well, for me, there's a whole bunch of shit that's happened. And although I try not to think about it or I don't think about it all the time, if I do or something reminds me of it, it's still all there. I'd like that to be gone. Some people are like, I'm just down, like depressed, I'm lethargic, I have lack of interest in doing things that I used to like. And some people go, you know what? I still, even though I know it's not a good thing for me, have problematic urges, cravings, desires to use. And I'd like that to stop when. So those are the kind of generalities. No, you're doing great. Yeah. So that's kind of the big picture. But as you're thinking of that, like, what is it that we'd be wanting our time to do?
[02:06] B: Well, with all that being said, two things come up for me. Yeah, my anxiety Which I have been trying to manage. I feel like it's better most days. At least I'm not at the point where I'm waking up having panic attacks.
[02:21] A: Okay.
[02:21] B: So it's gotten a lot better. I don't know the last time I had blood, so that's good.
[02:26] A: Okay, that's cool.
[02:28] B: But my anxiety stems from, like, if I'm in a social situation, it. Like, even going to church. Like, I started going to church with the women here is like, whoa. And, like, at one point, I had to, like, walk out.
[02:46] A: How. So what is it that happens when you. You're in that situation and you were like, whoa?
[02:53] B: Like, sweaty bombs? And my heart rate's fast and, like, I can't sit still and I'm fidgety.
[03:00] A: Okay.
[03:00] B: And I feel like I've been working on that. Like, I'm finally to a point where I can sit still. I think that also has to do with being sober, which last Thursday is two months from.
[03:16] A: Yay.
[03:17] B: Yes.
[03:17] A: Congratulations.
[03:18] B: Thank you.
[03:19] A: That's cool.
[03:20] B: So I've been taking. Why am I drawing a blank for my anxiety?
[03:34] A: How do you know it's yours? The anxiety. How do you know it's yours? Keep saying, it's my anxiety. Don't you take my anxiety. It's mine.
[03:47] B: You mean, like, if it's other people's.
[03:49] A: Wasn't it interesting? I mean, we relate it like, it's my hand.
[03:52] B: Mm.
[03:53] A: Can we get your hand and not be your hand?
[03:58] B: Hey, I'm sorry.
[03:59] A: I know. Isn't that a crazy question? See, you're relating your. You go, it's my anxiety as if it's this thing that I have, like my hand or my nose or this is my hair. These are my fingers. Right. Thinking of it as a thing that I have meaning, like it's a part of me.
[04:16] B: So say, like, I'm feeling anxious.
[04:19] A: Well, that would be a step.
[04:21] B: Okay.
[04:22] A: Different than. Different than it's part of you. Right? I mean, because if somebody comes in and she says, my name's Sally, I'm five two, and I'm shy. If Sally is thinking about her shyness in the same way she relates to her height, can she change it? No. But is her shyness the same thing as her height? No. It affects how she feels, thinks, and acts. But is it a part of who she is? Now, isn't that weird? Right. So some of what's been going on is you've been relating to it as if it's, like, part of me. My hand, my anxiety. Don't you take my Anxiety from me. It's mine. You can't have it. So we want to get it so that you have a lot more ease, freedom, quietness when you're in certain social situations.
[05:20] B: So a lot of what I have learned is, like, different grounding techniques and, like, breathing. Like, my four, seven, eight breathing. Like, if I'm in the midst of it, like, and nobody can even tell I'm doing it, you know, that's like, the awesome thing about it. And. But sometimes I don't remember to do it when it's going on. Like.
[05:44] A: That'S the problem with a conscious tool to change an unconscious response. Because it's not as if when you walked in, you said, okay, so in about five minutes, I'm going to really start noticing that my breath is really labored and I'm feeling really fidgety and uneasy. And you didn't say that as you're walking in. All of a sudden you were in, and you start it happening. Right. So the problem with an unconscious response is that I'm not choosing it. So sometimes, because I'm going to use a conscious intervention to try to combat an unconscious response, I forget because I'm at the effect of this thing.
[06:25] B: Yeah, you're just like, all you think about is that.
[06:29] A: Yeah, right. It kind of gets narrowed. So we want to have ways to change the programming so that even when the trigger happens, it doesn't cause the response anymore.
[06:46] B: Okay.
[06:47] A: Does that make sense?
[06:48] B: No, it makes sense. I'm just trying to, like, wrap my.
[06:51] A: Head around that because, like, the. How you would go about doing it. Yeah, well, you wouldn't. Yeah, I would. Which is weird because most stuff with therapy says it's your job to do the work, to change it. Recovery, it's your job to, you know, go through the steps, keep yourself clean and sober. It's all on you. When it comes to unwanted emotions, unwanted thoughts, if you're not choosing them, how can you choose to not have them?
[07:25] B: That's a good question.
[07:27] A: Right. Best dentist in the world. Is that dentist able to perform a root canal on himself? I mean, it's going the wrong way. He's used to doing this, not this. And he doesn't have the right vantage point. Constantly looking in the little mirror as he's doing it backwards. It's gonna be a lot harder. But he does when he's moving forward. Right. So if you're in it, it's harder for you to change it. It's much easier for somebody on the outside to change it for you. So what's different with this than therapy, than recovery, than other things that you'll be doing is that it's my job to do the work for you. Kind of like if you go to a dental hygienist, it's her job to clean your teeth. You're there collaborating and cooperating with her because you both want the same outcome, but it's totally her responsibility. Same thing.
[08:26] B: Okay. This is different.
[08:28] A: I know. Don't you think it is a little different because that is different than like what you've done before or even how you've thought about it.
[08:38] B: Yeah, I always like, you know, what you put into it is what you get out of it sort of thing.
[08:46] A: Yeah.
[08:46] B: You know, you don't know what you don't know.
[08:49] A: That's right.
[08:50] B: Like you can try to go about things like a certain way. Like, like the whole like well beaten path, like the way that you want, you want to react and like you want to handle things and then like you learn all these tools and stuff. Talking about myself like you're trying to like apply that to your new brain.
[09:09] A: Right.
[09:10] B: And like sometimes I can only do so much and like I don't want to be reliant on my anxiety medication. And part of that is I'm kind of like rabbit hole in here. But part of that's like my addiction.
[09:30] A: I guess comes to me yours it.
[09:32] B: Can, it messes with my head like. Cause I was taking it three times a day and so every time that 3:30 mark would come I'd get really anxious like how I would feel when I was about to use like the anxious, nervous like anticipating that's. I kind of related it to that and so it made me feel guilty for even taking something that was supposed to help me, you know. So now I'm only, I'm taking it twice a day but like I'm trying to like separate that thought. So it's, it's kind of hard for me.
[10:11] A: So sometimes because when you had been using you would get similar physiological kind of stuff that you had been getting with anti anxiety med you've been lengthening the time but there's some structural similarity there. So they kind of sometimes get pooped.
[10:38] B: Yeah. And I don't want anybody to think I'm trying to be reliant on there like you know, because that's not the case at all. When I first got into assessment like I physically could not be still and my anxiety like had me worked up all the time and I did tell a difference after like a month or so. And I Was just taking it once a day and then it was twice a day and it was three times a day. And I never took medication prescribed in my whole life, like even growing up, so. Because my parents just didn't really believe in that. Like.
[11:26] A: Use all the non prescribed stuff. It's much better. Oh, yeah, no, don't use any of that prescribed stuff. Coke, crack, heroin, fuck. Use them.
[11:37] B: Yep. Just go for the hard stuff. No, but I mean, it wasn't until I moved out that I did that.
[11:46] A: Yeah.
[11:48] B: So going from using and then getting on medication that's supposed to be, you know, healthy and helpful. Like, I have like, conflicting feelings about it, but I know if I'm not consistent with taking it, then it's not going to do anything. So, like, sometimes I'd be like, oh, I don't feel like I need it or I think I should try to go without it. And I did that for like a week. I went like cold turkey without cold turkey without my medicine. And I went like way down there. Like it. It was out of control and I was like, I couldn't manage it. So I'm like, yeah, I need that again. But I think I also felt pressured because one of the advocates there does not believe in medication like that, like mental health. Like, and she was constantly questioning me.
[12:45] A: About, like, why I was taking assessment or at residential assessment. Okay.
[12:50] B: And so then it made me, like, whether she meant to or not, like, I felt kind of pressured to not take it and to try to just do it on my own. Part of me wanted to do it on my own because, like, that's all I ever wanted, like, to at least give myself that chance to try without it. And it's not like I needed it, but I needed it, you know, Like, I wasn't gonna die without it, obviously, or have like a. Whatever reaction.
[13:22] A: But what benefit do you notice? Does it make things quieter inside? Does it make you less fidgety? Does it make you less restless or uneasy?
[13:36] B: In a way, it kind of. At least in the beginning, it helped more with my focus on things, maybe more still. I felt like I could be in that social. Like, even if it was a group of six people, you know, I could sit there and like, talk and like something as simple as just sitting in a group and talking.
[14:02] A: I felt like I could do that better with it. Okay.
[14:07] B: Yeah, but. And I, I don't know, I feel like I've been like, all over the place. Like, I feel like I have my shit together and I'm all collected and calm and, oh, I might not really need it as much anymore. And then like the next say I'm like a complete mess and anxious or depressed or just irritable like all those things. And then I'm like, okay again the day after and it's hard to describe like where I'm at and I feel like I'm crazy.
[14:45] A: So you're not fully self regulated yet?
[14:47] B: No, I guess not.
[14:50] A: We've got a couple months. We've got a couple months off of all sorts of substances and then there's been ups and downs in what you've been taking and how much and how often. Right. So we're not quite fully self regulated. Okay.
[15:12] B: I can at least be honest about it. Like nobody can do anything if they don't know where I'm coming from. Even if where I'm coming from is here, here, here and here, you know, So I just.
[15:27] A: So if what we do for you gets you to be much more calm and settled with the flexibility to be still at times, that would be useful.
[15:46] B: Yes.
[15:46] A: Okay. Useful. Okay.
[15:50] B: I did talk to Dr. Lau and he actually didn't.
[15:57] A: Was that yesterday?
[15:58] B: Yeah, yesterday.
[15:59] A: Okay.
[16:01] B: He didn't say anything about the anxiety part, but we talked more about the sleep because I haven't been sleeping well.
[16:09] A: Say more about that.
[16:11] B: I've been having nightmares.
[16:13] A: Oh, those are fun.
[16:14] B: Yeah, very fun.
[16:17] A: No, like bad dreams about stuff that past. Stuff that's happened, stuff that doesn't make complete sense.
[16:27] B: Both.
[16:28] A: Oh good and disturbing stuff.
[16:32] B: Yes.
[16:32] A: And having you question why would I be having those kinds of dreams?
[16:38] B: Yes, exactly.
[16:40] A: Okay.
[16:42] B: I'm not the best at like going into. Especially when it comes to.
[16:46] A: Yeah.
[16:47] B: Like sexual type dreams like with my dad.
[16:50] A: Oh wow. Okay. That would be unusual. Weird.
[16:52] B: Yeah.
[16:53] A: Right.
[16:55] B: But since I was. I guess I can be up with you since I was that I am here. Since I was that sexual abuse with my mom's boyfriend and her dad. It's like the more I've been talking.
[17:09] A: About mom's boyfriend and mom's dad. Oh, fun. Yeah. Okay. That happened when you were little.
[17:20] B: Yeah.
[17:23] A: So bio mom's not all too well?
[17:26] B: No.
[17:27] A: Okay.
[17:29] B: I've been in contact with her the past two and a half years.
[17:33] A: Okay.
[17:34] B: I. I found her on Facebook.
[17:36] A: Yeah.
[17:36] B: And we actually had, I'd say a fairly good relationship. Like we get along, we talked every day.
[17:45] A: Yeah.
[17:46] B: There was some unhealthy stuff going on. Like I didn't use with her, but yeah, she was at. She was like trying to find me stuff and.
[17:57] A: Yeah, Mom's not well.
[17:59] B: No, she's by her mom? No, she's getting help. Or was her. I'm not sure where she is right now.
[18:05] A: Okay.
[18:06] B: At the time I last spoke with her a few days prior to coming to assessment, she was at a facility.
[18:13] A: Okay. But you didn't grow up necessarily the whole time with her?
[18:19] B: Oh, no. I was adopted when I was four and a half.
[18:22] A: Okay. Which got you away from the people that had been doing the yucky stuff to your body.
[18:27] B: Yeah.
[18:28] A: Oh, cool. Well, that's better.
[18:29] B: Yeah, yeah.
[18:32] A: That was actually the good news thing.
[18:34] B: Oh, yeah, yeah. That's the good now.
[18:37] A: Yeah. So we want to get the impact that that stuff has had gone.
[18:42] B: Yes.
[18:43] A: Because there's still yucky feelings attached to all that.
[18:47] B: Yeah.
[18:47] A: Even just the thought of it now. Yeah. Isn't that crazy? Do you know why?
[18:54] B: Why?
[18:56] A: It's gonna sound really weird, but the reason that people are troubled, haunted, pained, shamed, hurting, sad, angry, resentful over bad stuff that's happened isn't because it happened. It's not what happened. It's actually because when it happened, emotionally the brain short circuited. And what that means, Taylor, is at that level, part of the brain doesn't know that the negative thing stopped. You do. Part of the brain never updated, didn't get the good news. That's where it stuck. Happens with intense, emotionally charged experiences. It doesn't so much happen with physical experiences. So, for example, if I told you about falling out of a tree when I was 9 and that I broke my arm, if, as I was telling you about it right now, I started to feel emotional as it's happening, you. You would be looking at me like, what the fuck is wrong with him?
[20:09] B: Yeah.
[20:10] A: Right.
[20:10] B: Yeah.
[20:11] A: But if I told you about what my Uncle Ed did to me when I was nine and I started to get emotional like it was, he'd be like, yeah, of course. Isn't it weird? We have it in our world, in the lexicon of our culture that says time heals all wounds. Yeah, but they were only talking about the physical ones. Those fucking emotional ones, man. They're on forever.
[20:32] B: Yeah, I feel you.
[20:33] A: But it's not that the emotional wounds can't heal. They haven't. Only because part of the brain doesn't know it's over. A physical wound wouldn't heal if it was constantly getting injured too. Right. If a boxer is boxing and he gets his lip cut and he keeps going out there and it keeps getting hit, is that part going to heal? No. If part of the brain never got that it's over, how could it heal it. Isn't that crazy? Where therapy got it wrong is that therapy thought that I repressed it. I buried it. I shoved it under the carpet, I locked it behind the closed doors, I put it in the closet and that as a therapist, my job is to help dig out that uncomfortable, yucky stuff and have you throw it up, thinking that afterwards you'll feel better, which, you know, after throwing up, you feel a little bit better. The problem with past crap like that is that you get triggered by the same stuff. So it's not actually about getting it out. See, people don't repress or bury. It's different. If it's something that makes me feel bad, I learn other ways to not think about it. Okay, that doesn't mean I can always avoid thinking about it, because sometimes shit reminds me of it, right? And I'm in a program now that, you know, lots of people have had similar stuff. Oh, and then we talk about, you know, like, grooming, like, what got me to, you know, be okay with, like, having my body be sold for. I don't know where the fuck that came from. I don't know why I have fucking weird, fucking damaged relationships with men, man. Where the does that come from?
[22:22] B: We're always like, okay, so just. So it's not that it really matters. Like, so I'm good.
[22:28] A: Yeah, well, and that would up everything even more.
[22:32] B: Right? And so two things on that, like, I do know, like, people talking about, oh, so you go to the same, like, you're attracted to, like, the same kind of person. Like, no matter what relationship you go into. And, like, the physical abuse or the verbal ability abuse is, like, has been a constant for me.
[22:50] A: Oh, like, no matter who you've been with.
[22:53] B: Yeah.
[22:53] A: Oh, good. Yeah.
[22:55] B: Yeah, those, right. Like, I like you. You're fine. So just. I mean, I can recognize that. Like, do I like that? Like, am I attracted, like, oh, just want her to hit me? Like, I mean, not like that, but.
[23:14] A: Like, you know, well, maybe sometimes, but that's in a certain context, right?
[23:20] B: So. But like, why, Like, I step back and I'm like, why did I, like, always feel like I had to have that? Like, I guess that I just told myself that.
[23:31] A: I don't think you were telling yourself, hey, damn it. That wasn't. I'm going to tell you something. No, you weren't telling yourself anything.
[23:41] B: Okay?
[23:42] A: It was programming that got installed, so it's not what you wanted. It was what was familiar, what was.
[23:49] B: Okay, that makes sense.
[23:52] A: So people don't go for what's comfortable.
[23:54] B: Because that's not comfortable.
[23:55] A: No, they go for what's familiar. Even if it's uncomfortable, it's still familiar.
[24:06] B: Okay.
[24:07] A: Right. So again, we want to change the programming so it stops running you because it isn't anything that you've been telling yourself or even allowing yourself or somehow at some.
[24:22] B: You do kind of allow it, don't you? No, if there's not. Obviously not that. Okay. You can correct me if I'm wrong.
[24:30] A: You're doing great. I know.
[24:34] B: Like, if there's. If there's no sort of, like physical boundary, I guess, set there, or like, then you kind of allow. I kind of allowed anything to kind of happen.
[24:52] A: I don't think you were allowing it. I think it was happening not because you were allowing.
[24:59] B: Was happening because it was what was familiar.
[25:03] A: It happened because it was what was familiar, but not because you allowed it. Right. So people don't leave relationships that are horrific. Domestic violence 7 to 8 to 9 times. Trafficking 14 to 15 times horrific. People don't leave relationships that are not that bad. And if at some level I've got it, that I somewhat kind of, you know, deserve it, or maybe it's because I am not good enough or unlovable or some kind of thing. Again, programming that got installed in me, then I find myself being drawn to and drawing those people towards me. It's kind of like the picker got screwed up. I keep picking people who aren't well. Had a woman in my office the other day and she was telling me, I get these project guys, guys that I know could really use some help. And I get to feel good for a little bit because I'm rescuing and helping them. But then I get into it and I'm like, holy shit, there's a lot of problems here. Yeah, maybe you don't want to pick a problem guy.
[26:19] B: Yeah.
[26:20] A: Might be easier to pick somebody as well do projects at work. Right. So you have programming that got installed in you different than you, that have had you drawn towards and drawing in that kind of stuff to happen. Not because you were allowing it or wanting it, unless it was intentional on purpose in those certain situations. Because that was more about fun.
[26:53] B: Right, right, right, right. No, that. That actually provides me with clarity in the way I thought that through.
[27:03] A: Yeah. And we want you to be free to be in ones that work, that value you, because you value you, that honor you, because you honor you, that support you, because you support you, that love you, because, like, you're good with you. That's the stuff we want changed. You Follow me with that. Yeah, right. Like that's what we want changed. And that's why I say we want the impact that the prior stuff has had to be cleared so it doesn't cause any kind of disruption in you. Right. And we know that those dream state things haven't been happening because somehow that's some latent interest that I have.
[27:51] B: Right? Oh, yeah.
[27:53] A: I don't even. Like, guys, what the fuck am I. How does that happen? Right? So looking at it, it's not because there's some sort. Sort of. It's because your brain, now that you're in programming, is going, okay, well, like, how do we freaking get that better?
[28:10] B: It's like the wires are trying to reconnect.
[28:14] A: So all we're gonna do is tell that part of your brain that we're gonna put that part on pause and then you're actually gonna do something that gets that better so that you get to be free from it. Meaning you can remember that it happened, but it doesn't have any discomfort. So any of the hurt, the anger, the shame, the guilt, the resentment, the pain that's been attached to it, it's gone. You're free. You become much more emotionally present. Connecting to what is, without the effect of what has, that you're much more centered, peaceful, and still on the inside.
[28:56] B: Yeah, because even to a degree, when you said that and everything, even when I am, for the most part, like, still physically, it's like my mind's like going, going, going, going, going. Right. That in itself can be like so distracting for me. And like. Yeah, like it's. It's like hell trying to stay present. My mind's in like 10 different places.
[29:22] A: And that's where we're going to have things slow down so that it's easier for you to be now experiencing what is happening without the influences of what has or what might. That you get to be much more at peace, that it's quieter up there, that you're much more. Instead of inwardly focused, you're outwardly focused. Focused, meaning that you're not spending a lot of time thinking about you or worrying about what others might be thinking.
[29:53] B: About you, which I'm also still working on.
[29:59] A: Yeah, we just want to get it shifted. So it's not anything you need to work on, that it just changes. See, what we get to do for you that's different than you working on it is we get to accelerate it. Accelerate the change happening so that it happens faster, so that you become more peaceful, so that you have more ease and comfort. That's where we're headed.
[30:33] B: I like the sound of that.
[30:35] A: Got it. And those are the things that we can get shifted and changed. So again, you're becoming more at peace with you. Yeah. Okay. So he talked to you, not so much about the anxieties that you have been feeling, but kind of about the dreams. And what did he say about that? Because the dreams, when you've been having them, they've been waking you up, and then when you're woken up, it's been harder for you to get back to sleep. Yes. Oh, okay.
[31:17] B: And it's not so much the falling asleep. When I first go to bed.
[31:24] A: Yeah, that part's fine.
[31:25] B: Yeah. My cereclo and I go to sleep and. But it's when those dreams happen, like, I'll jolt up awake, and then I'm trying to toss and turn to go back to sleep, and I can't. Sometimes it'll take, like, hours, like, over two hours to get back to sleep. That is, if I do sleep in this maybe for an hour, and then I'm up again.
[31:49] A: There's no. If you're in bed for longer than 20 minutes, you need to get up and get out of bed.
[31:58] B: Okay.
[31:59] A: And then do an activity that's less enjoyable than sleeping.
[32:03] B: Sometimes I'm not sure if this is healthy or not, but sometimes, like, I'll work out till I'm tired.
[32:09] A: Well, that may or may not be the thing, because that's gonna increase. I'm thinking, like, if you were to read something that's boring.
[32:19] B: Okay. Like, I do that too sometimes. Read.
[32:26] A: It can't be a book that you like as a page turner, because a page turner will make you want to turn the pages. It's got to be a book that's, like, thick and dense. That, like, as you read it, you're like. It's like, not enjoyable for some people. I tell them, okay, what you want to do is you want to take out your pile of receipts and begin to organize them by date. Like, because that wouldn't be enjoyable. That's a lot less enjoyable than sleeping. You know, I've got to stand in tree pose.
[33:05] B: Okay.
[33:07] A: Okay. How long am I gonna do this? When it's in the middle at, like, 2:30 in the morning. Okay. Right. Like, so it's about doing something that's less enjoyable. But it's after 20 minutes, if you haven't gone and fallen back to sleep, then you get out of bed and you do an activity that's less enjoyable than sleeping. Like reading a dense, thick Book, an encyclopedia, a bible. A book that has like an academic book. Right. Not like a novel, like a math book or something. Yeah, like a math book. Right. That's, you know, talking to me about equations. Right. Because what that'll do is your body will go, oh, no way better to go to sleep and then you'll be able to go back in bed and fall asleep. But we're just going to tell you the unconscious, you know, part of Taylor to go ahead and put that stuff on pause because we're gonna get it cleared so that you're free from it so you don't have them anymore. Are we just gonna pause it until we get back together so we can clear it out so they're not a problem? Right. Well, I mean, really just asking the unconscious part of you because that's the part that's been bringing them up, wanting you to be free from it.
[34:38] B: If I may.
[34:39] A: Yeah.
[34:39] B: So with having these dreams and especially the using dreams, like at assessment, I wasn't, surprisingly I wasn't really thinking about it semester in the day when I was there. Like it wasn't like, like it was maybe the first few weeks and then like it kind of drifted off because it's maybe my focus was just elsewhere and I come here to. Not here, but at residential. And the using dreams are every single night. And so therefore, like I find myself feeling anxious and having thoughts of using during the day. And it's more. Even more so now. I don't really know where I was going with that.
[35:29] A: Okay, so because you've been having the dreams at night, you've been having thoughts about doing it during the day.
[35:34] B: Yeah.
[35:34] A: Even though, you know it's not a great thing for you to do and you really don't have access to it.
[35:40] B: Well, yeah, Here like no, I don't. That's what I'm saying.
[35:43] A: Right, right, right. So we want your brain to actually realize that you don't have access to it here. Right. Because Juno, that somebody who smokes cigarettes. Let's say there are two pack of smoke smoker a day. Right. That they don't actually have a craving for a cigarette when they're in an airplane six hour flight to California, they don't have any thoughts about smoking because I know they can't because it's out of the question. When something is out of the question, my brain doesn't bring it up as a thought.
[36:13] B: And then sometimes like I'll try. I'm not sure this isn't healthy, but sometimes my brain will like trail off And I'm like, oh, well, if you did this and this, and if not that, I want to leave, because I don't. But, like, when the using thoughts come up, I'm like, well, you could just go around and find it, you know, you could go down this way and walk, and if you really wanted it, you could find it, you know? And I'm like, no, no. Like, Taylor, it's not how we do things anymore.
[36:43] A: Yeah.
[36:44] B: And if I just. I know if I put as much effort into bettering myself than I did trying to find crack or trying to find meth, you know, then I have it. Like, then I have what I need. If I could just focus that energy on that I did the bad, then, like, that would be awesome. If I had my drive, you know, for the good, then.
[37:08] A: Right.
[37:09] B: But sometimes, like, it gets crisscross.
[37:12] A: I hear you. Okay, so that's the other part that we want shifted. Right. Is we want it so that those kinds of thoughts cease and that you're thinking about many other things other than that. Because there's so much else that's going on other than that that you could also be thinking about. Right? Right. I mean, like, even when you're having a thought of using, what are all of the other things that you could be thinking that have nothing to do with using?
[37:45] B: Where I'm at and what's going on, what I could be doing with my day.
[37:48] A: Right. And that's just. That's just a small little thing. Right. See, the way that you start to open it up is actually you open up the field. So if you look at me, you can see me, but if you stay looking at me, and then with your peripheral vision, you include my fingers out here wiggling. Notice how you can pick it up with your peripheral vision.
[38:09] B: Yeah, now I'm looking.
[38:11] A: Now you're looking. Right. See, looking makes me narrowed. So what happens when you stay looking at me but you include my fingers out here wiggling is you pick up more of the space. The thing that we disappear in the world is space. We only see the things that are the objects. We don't notice the space, like the space in between you and me. Right. Without even looking, you can kind of guesstimate how much space there is from the top of your head to the ceiling. So you can guesstimate how much space there is from the back of your head to the wall behind you. Right. You start to become aware of space. It opens the field. The deal with any kind of problem when we're having it, it can only Exist in a world of everything else that it's not, which is a weird way to say something. But a couch is an object, and we agree upon it as an object because there are also objects that are other things, like a cabinet or a chair or a desk or a lamp. There are all sorts of different objects. We've named it couch. But in the world, are there more couches or are there more every single other object other than a couch? No.
[39:39] B: Okay.
[39:39] A: But it sounded pretty tricky, didn't it?
[39:41] B: Yeah.
[39:42] A: Isn't there more objects that are not couches than couches? Not couches, yes. Everything that isn't a couch. So many more things. Right. So a problem can only exist as a problem in a field of everything else that it's not. So there's always more than the problem. What makes the problem feel big is when I narrow my focus, and that's all I see. So one of the things that you can be doing in those moments is to open your field a vision, because that'll expand things. What are many of the other things that I can be thinking about that isn't using all of the other stuff that I can be doing that's not that. And there's so many more things. Right. What we want to do is get it so that that turns way, way, way down so that on the inside you become much more comfortable in your own skin that you lighten up.
[41:03] B: I mean, because I can make the connection of using to feel comfortable or using to feel more open. Now I'm like, reversing it and trying to. And trying to learn how to do that without those things. And, like, right from myself.
[41:22] A: Right. Wouldn't it be better to just be comfortable in you regardless of where you are? That has nothing to do with the substance.
[41:33] B: Yeah. Yeah. That's where I want to be.
[41:36] A: So that's where we're headed is a you who becomes much more clear, comfortable in you, who's still on the inside as she's getting things done, who's peaceful, who's free from the effect that this stuff has had, who's directing your life in the ways that she wants to so that when she's doing the things she's doing, she truly feels good. Good about what she's doing. When she thinks back about what she's done, she's satisfied, not guilty. Yeah. There's peace, there's freedom, there's ease, there's comfort, there's access to more joy. This is the you that I'm seeing when we're done. Now, Taylor, you don't have to see this. You like me because the question isn't how it's gonna happen. The question question is, would it be okay?
[42:39] B: No. But you're right. Like, I don't mean to laugh, but I laugh at the worst time sometimes. But no, you're right. Like, would it be okay?
[42:49] A: Like, if it were okay, would it be okay for you to be free from the effect that this stuff has had, for you to be at peace and still on the inside as you're getting things done, for you to feel good about what you're up to, for you to have ease when you interact with others, for it to be quieter in here so that you're more emotionally present? See, that's where we're headed. And the good news, Only one of us in this room needs to be knowing what we're doing in order to make it happen. And I'm not expecting it to be you.
[43:26] B: Okay. Okay.
[43:29] A: Thanks for the clarification. Only one of us needs to know what we're doing to get you better. And the good news is I do know how to change all sorts of stuff to get things better, for you, to get you to be much more at peace, much more comfortable in your own skin, to be lighter, to be more free content. Right. All those strong and hard emotions gone. Right. So we're just going to tell the unconscious part of you that's been having those kinds of thoughts and dreams to put a pause on that for now until we get back together so that we can get it completely cleared and go on and you be free. Because the whole purpose of that kind of unconscious material has been to get you to be free. Right. The highest positive intention of what's been going on in those dream states is to no longer be troubled by any of the stuff. Right. It just hasn't been working.
[44:36] B: Right. And I know that, like, after I can reflect on it to an extent.
[44:41] A: Yeah.
[44:41] B: But of course, when it was going on.
[44:44] A: Yeah. So we just ask it to pause for now. Right. So that it stops. Because you don't realize this, but the unconscious part of you, you know, the part that directs the dreams, is also been listening to everything that I'm saying. That's right. See, that part of you that's been directing all of that is also listening to what I've been saying the whole time. Right. And that's why we're just asking the unconscious part of you to put a pause on that for now. Because what we're going to be doing is going to get the same outcome that that Wants for you. Right, Right. It's kind of like pain. We tend to have an adversarial relationship with it. Like people hear you hear people say, my knees are killing me, my back is killing me. But pain is not an adversary. Pain is there for the protection of the physical body because if the part is injured, it causes pain. So I don't continue to injure it. But if I'm responsive to the pain, I can quiet it down. Kind of like a teacher who's teaching and reading a story and the kids are listening. She can talk in a conversational voice because they're all paying attention. Right. If they get up and the book's over and they start changing to go to the next thing and they're making loud noise and nobody's paying attention to the teacher, what does she have to do? Raise the volume of her voice. Right. She has to get louder so we can quiet pain when we have the purpose of the pain. Realize that I'm on board with what your purpose is. So it quiets it because I'm doing things that are designed to heal. Right now you're beginning to do things that are designed to heal, which is what that part wants, is your healing so that you get to become free to be more of you.
[46:54] B: That's what I want more than anything.
[46:56] A: Yeah. And so does that part want it for you? So that's why we can just make the request to your unconscious to pause that for now because it's not helping you get better. What we're going to do is fully accelerate it so that when you leave, things are transformed different and better for you and it not be something that you then have to have a tool to remember. It's the same stuff will go on but no longer produce the response in you. That'll be a better way to go. You follow me with that? That's where we're headed. Yeah. Yeah. Well, cool. So then the next time that we get together, we're gonna do a whole chunk of. Of like work. So we're gonna get together for probably like a two and a half hour chunk of time, like all at once. Because in that chunk of time we can change things so that when you leave, it's different. And what people tell me time and time again is a. The stuff that used to really bother them, that had the intense emotion stuff or the troubling not bothering them at all. Two, the intensity in which they get stressed less. The frequency in which it happens less. The duration in which it lasts less. So it's not that they don't have stressors. Because they do. We always will. It's that they move through them quicker. That's where we're headed. Got it. Cool. All right, well, we will stop with that for now. You can come with me.
