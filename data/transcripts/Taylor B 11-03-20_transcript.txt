[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 3rd of November. It's election day, and we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. Taylor. That recording may be made available in teaching and training professionals in how to do what we do, given what we do is useful for you, and I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:18] B: Yes.
[00:19] A: All right, cool. So what's on the notes? Wow. Highlighted and everything.
[00:26] B: You know me, I can, like, go in circles and I don't. I'm not sure what to talk about first, but I guess, like, the main events. I'll start with that.
[00:34] A: Okay, you can do that.
[00:35] B: What recently has happened is I felt like leaving and. And then I didn't. And then.
[00:50] A: And.
[00:51] B: And now I'm here because I'm still there. And I just. I'm, like, trying to weigh out the pros and cons, and I'm just. I feel like I'm in a battle because, like, I just want to, like, run off. And that's one of the things that I wrote down. It's like, why do I want to run off so bad? And I said, why? Like, not so you can, like, give me a reason. But it's just like, how I thought.
[01:16] A: Yeah.
[01:17] B: Because I really. I mean.
[01:19] A: Cause that's the thing that happens.
[01:20] B: Yeah.
[01:21] A: When we get confronted.
[01:22] B: Confronted or just to where I'm uncomfortable. Yeah. I just want to run off.
[01:33] A: Right. That's the model of the horse and the rabbit. Yeah. They run so away from the things that make them uncomfortable.
[01:43] B: Yeah.
[01:44] A: Yeah.
[01:45] B: Which would be different.
[01:48] A: Has been making you. The program's making you uncomfortable?
[01:51] B: No, just. What's been coming up while I've been at the program?
[01:54] A: Oh, well, what's been coming up that's been making you uncomfortable while you've been at the program?
[01:58] B: Oh, there we go. There's a start. So first thing I put down is my anxiety. It's just really difficult for me to do, like, day to day things, have a conversation, do simple tasks, like making dinner for everybody. Like, I freak out and my medication isn't helping anymore. So, like, I almost just don't want to take it. And. Yeah. So that's on my anxiety.
[02:42] A: So there's lots of anxious feelings that you've been having. Sometimes you freak out when you're making food for everybody. Because that feels like a lot of pressure.
[02:50] B: Yeah.
[02:51] A: I put a lot of weight and.
[02:52] B: I've been told, like, I put a lot of pressure on myself. I don't do it on purpose, obviously, but.
[02:59] A: And then there's been challenges in Just like kind of expressing things to others for like fear of how they might respond or when you said talking.
[03:13] B: Yeah, just like. Or just being in a group setting. And like, I just get super nervous and like I'll either stumble over my words or I just like right before I'm about to go do something, like my heart's beating out of my chest and I just like. It's like every single time it could be something as small as that and like I've done it a million times. So it's frustrating feeling like if I could just get through like the basic stuff, then I don't know, be a lot smoother ride, I guess.
[03:51] A: Okay. It's not been as easy as you thought it might be?
[03:57] B: No. And I'm trying to like do like bring in all these healthy, healthy. I don't know what to call them.
[04:13] A: Just healthy habits, healthy tools, healthy skills.
[04:17] B: All of those. All the above. And I get frustrated when they don't seem to be working or doing anything when I want them to. Like instantly. Like if I felt anxious or felt like I hit my max capacity with something I would use. And now I'm not doing that. Instead I try to like breathe through it and then I'm like so focused on the feeling that like it doesn't do anything or. I don't know, I just. That's the whole instant gratification when I try to do something good that's supposed to help me. It feels like it's not doing anything.
[05:06] A: That you haven't done before. So it's like new.
[05:12] B: Yeah, I guess so.
[05:14] A: Right. Because you just said when my anxiety used to get really high, that would be a trigger or a tell for me to go use. I'm not doing that. So now I'm trying a different strategy, like breathing through it. But all I find myself focused on is the feelings. And then it doesn't feel like it's doing anything.
[05:38] B: Yeah, I guess. Cuz before I wasn't focused on feelings. I can see that. And I can bring all the logic into it and I still. It even confuses me more to make a decision.
[05:52] A: Make a decision. What does that mean?
[05:54] B: Um, sorry, I'm talking about the whole leaving stay.
[05:56] A: Huh?
[05:57] B: With the program. Yeah. Like I'll be like, well if I stay, I'll work through this and like I'll be able to get here. And like. And that's following through. Because I've had issues with following through on anything on a job, on just like anything. If I left, that wouldn't be following through. Like I don't have a big plan. And like.
[06:30] A: Of what you would do if you left?
[06:32] B: Yeah, like, I would just kind of wing it and let me go to my notes here. I just. For some reason it seems more comfortable to leave and to have to.
[06:58] A: I don't know whether it's more comfortable. It might be more familiar.
[07:01] B: Okay.
[07:02] A: Familiar because it's more of what you know. This is a lot more of what you don't know. And then have been feeling uncomfortable and.
[07:12] B: Still have to, like, process through it.
[07:19] A: The growing part. Do you know the story of the butterfly?
[07:23] B: What?
[07:23] A: Ever heard the story of the butterfly? When a butterfly. When the caterpillar starts to break out and if you were to open up the little cocoon that the butterfly was in, the butterfly would die. That what makes the butterfly stronger is it keeps. It strengthens its muscles by pushing against the cocoon for it to crack. Then it gets strong enough so that when it's finally strong enough, it's when it actually comes out and flies.
[07:56] B: Okay.
[07:58] A: Right. Isn't that interesting?
[08:00] B: Yeah.
[08:00] A: Right. So growth growing is challenging at times.
[08:11] B: I just, like. I feel like I hit my max capacity so quick and then I just go straight from frustrated to mad to. To then shutting down and like, not wanting to involve myself with the other girls or just the programming. Not that I've been like, too hard headed on that. Like, I still involve myself, but I still feel like I don't want to.
[08:46] A: Okay.
[08:49] B: Because I have part of me that realizes that I should probably stay. And if I walk away, then, like, I can't just. I can't undo that. And I'm. I am surrounded by people who care and are willing to, like, work with me. But it's like the more. The more, like, vulnerable I am, the more uncomfortable I am. Like, I just. I feel like I don't have anything left for myself.
[09:22] A: What does that mean?
[09:25] B: Like, I've. I know this probably isn't right, but I don't know how else to explain it. Like, I've kind of given part of myself away, in a sense.
[09:36] A: To whom?
[09:37] B: To everybody. Like, metaphorically.
[09:43] A: What part did you give away?
[09:46] B: Like, now they can see everything.
[09:49] A: Meaning they realize that you're not perfect?
[09:52] B: Well, I mean, yeah, but I don't want them to think I'm perfect. I'm just like. I feel like I've had that wallop because. Because just me in general, like the kind person I am. I don't know, I've been taking advantage of. And I know these people aren't gonna do that, but Part of me still acts like I have to protect myself, I guess.
[10:23] A: Protect yourself from getting well. Right. Isn't that interesting?
[10:30] B: Yeah.
[10:31] A: Protect yourself from getting well. See, there's a part of you that you just said has been realizing that I've got supports around me in a way that's very different than I've ever had.
[10:42] B: And that should be good. So why would I be mad?
[10:45] A: And they know more stuff about me because, like, I've been more open. You called it vulnerable, but it's been more open. Right. Yet despite that, there's this other part that's feeling like I need to be protected because it's, like, up for my best interest. Right. Yet that part hasn't realized that what it's been protecting you from is you becoming a better version of you. And you wouldn't want to do that, would you? Be a better version of you.
[11:21] B: Yeah.
[11:22] A: Right. So to the extent that you can begin to realize that part that's been protective is in direct conflict with your becoming a better version of you. Which means in doing that, there's a little bit of a struggle at times. The things that are really, truly worthwhile take effort. The person who, you know, grows up in the mansion and is given the, you know, hundred thousand dollar sports car when they turn 16 just because they can, they get the real value of it. Okay. So there's been lots of stuff that's been really confronting to you.
[12:18] B: Yeah.
[12:19] A: And you felt very vulnerable, and then you felt like you need to be protected.
[12:25] B: Even though they're all good things, they're not bad.
[12:28] A: Yeah.
[12:28] B: And like, I know that, but it still doesn't change.
[12:31] A: Well, that part of you that's been trying to protect hasn't known that.
[12:39] B: Okay.
[12:41] A: So to the extent that you can realize that part that's been protecting you is in direct conflict with what you really want.
[12:50] B: Yeah. And I feel like it outweighs what I should do rather than, like, what I think I want to do. Even if it's like, you're gonna struggle with this, you're gonna struggle with that, and you're probably gonna go back to that. And it's like, oh, that sounds a lot better than this staying here idea, which is like, I know is better, and, like, I can have the clarity on that.
[13:14] A: But, like.
[13:19] B: Not to, like, jump the gun here, but, like, after I get back, I have to call my outreach case manager, and she's gonna want to know, like, how I am, like, where I'm at with my thinking.
[13:33] A: Who's your outreach case manager?
[13:35] B: Bri.
[13:36] A: Bri.
[13:37] B: Yeah, you know her?
[13:39] A: I do.
[13:40] B: I actually have known her since.
[13:42] A: I know you told me that you guys have known each other a really long time.
[13:47] B: So yesterday I talked to her.
[13:49] A: Yeah.
[13:50] B: Told her I was staying and I like just have to think for the day and everything. She's like, well, I'll talk to you tomorrow. And I was like, yeah.
[14:01] A: I feel.
[14:02] B: Like that's a lot of pressure and like I have to make a decision and.
[14:06] A: Well, you already did.
[14:10] B: I keep saying that even though I'm still here.
[14:12] A: Isn't it interesting? But you already did make a decision. Do you know the decision that you made already? What was to enter the program. I mean, that was the decision you made when it was presented to you. Hey, we have this program. You can go to assessment. You can have time, space. We have this residential program. Is it something that you'd be interested in for you? And you went. Yes. So you made that decision already.
[14:40] B: Yeah, it's just sticking with it.
[14:42] A: But you've already made the decision. So you keep thinking, I've got to make a decision. Right. It's interesting. You've already made the decision. It's whether you're gonna change your mind.
[14:53] B: Okay.
[14:54] A: Right. Because you made the decision because you're here. I mean, you have like a room where you sleep and sometimes you make food for the rest of the people there.
[15:04] B: Let's not go there yet.
[15:07] A: Even though it's really stressful, you freak out sometimes when you're doing it. Okay, so there's been a lot of stuff that's been really confronting and really uncomfortable for you. And the normal way that you deal with discomfort, you're not finding yourself able to do.
[15:27] B: Correct.
[15:28] A: And then whatever it was that you thought would be helpful hasn't been as helpful as you thought. Like whatever breathing thing, whatever that means.
[15:37] B: Just anything that's not, you know, self harming or whatever. Like my old habits, trying to like use these new ones and use new.
[15:49] A: Tools and it's like whatever those are.
[15:51] B: Yeah, whatever that is. Are you asking?
[15:55] A: I mean, apparently you have apparently new tools.
[15:58] B: Yeah, I mean, just like going for a walk or, or just talking it through or just drawing or writing, which.
[16:09] A: Are all tools that you haven't used lots in your life. So they're unfamiliar. The tools are somewhat uncomfortable and they don't seem to give the immediate, like, oh, I'm better where the old tool that I used to use, I would.
[16:27] B: Oh, even if they're good.
[16:29] A: Huh? What if they weren't so mentally draining when you did them? Would that be Better.
[16:35] B: Probably.
[16:36] A: Oh, okay.
[16:37] B: How do we get to that point?
[16:40] A: You don't have to know. Only one of us in this room needs to know what to do. Okay, true. Only one of us.
[16:48] B: Spitting the facts.
[16:50] A: Yeah. So what else has been going on? Because I got, like, you've been really confronted as to whether this. What I decided to do is what I want to continue doing. And you've got uncertainty and you're not sure. And it seems like there's a lot of what I'm doing in this. It's been really uncomfortable. And so I'm looking back towards what was familiar to me. And what was familiar, although I know isn't necessarily best, has shown up as being more appealing because I don't have to do any of this if I'm right. Okay. So I follow you with that so far. Okay. What else would be useful for me to know?
[17:35] B: And I'm not really sure how to go about this, but there was a situation that happened with two girls there to some assessment at residential.
[17:43] A: Okay.
[17:44] B: And I made them uncomfortable.
[17:47] A: Okay.
[17:48] B: Obviously not on purpose, but okay. I can use names here, but with Taylor, I don't. I don't entirely know what I did, but she said that there was a situation where it made her think of another situation that happened to her, like, with a cousin or something. And that's as far as I can go with it. There were several things on the piece of paper I had designed. Something about showing my tattoo, hugging and winking. And, like, the whole winking thing is something I do when I'm nervous. And so, like, it wasn't meant to be provocative or anything like that.
[18:38] A: Okay.
[18:39] B: Or like, I was seeking anybody out. Even though when I brought those things up, like, she didn't, like, confirm. Like, she didn't tell me what it was I did, but I apologized for making her uncomfortable. And I just said, I take ownership for what. What I did. Which I didn't entirely know what I did, but just being more aware of her space and everything. And I made it clear that I wasn't seeking her out. She's like, oh, girl, I know that. So, like, we're cool. And that talk went well. Holly, on the other hand, I made a comment, and I totally forgot about it until she brought it up. And so I shared a room with her for a minute because we had to, like, quarantine out. And I said. She said something about the screen because I was, like, sitting on the bed next to her, and I was like. She's like, is that good? And I'm like, yeah, but I can move one more over. And I was joking. Like, I was totally playing around, and I didn't act on it. And she held on to that. And then she brought up, when her and I were discussing it, that she had a situation in prison where she was harassed, sexually harassed. And it just brought that back for her. And she's like, girl, I was trying not to. Trying everything not put my hands on you. She's like, is this. This girl just. You know? And I had no idea. And before her and her. Kayla and I had to talk. It wasn't told to me what I did, like, what Holly had said. And so when I was trying to take ownership for whatever it was that I didn't realize at the time, I. To make her uncomfortable, it seemed to her that I wasn't actually taking ownership. And she got really mad because I said, yet again, I apologize for making you uncomfortable. That's never been my intention or to seek you out in any way. And I deeply apologize. I said that what I did, that whatever I did. And I think that was the part that, like, made her mad, because I was acting like I didn't know, even though I really didn't know. And before she was about to get up and walk away, she was like, man, this girl needs to, like, process with an advocate again before we talk. She's like, because you know what you did. And, like, just very accusing. Wayne. I was like, I don't. Like, I really don't know. Can you please tell me? So I know. And she told me, and instantly I took ownership for it, because I know I said that, but I didn't remember until she told me. So. So those are the two situations.
[21:51] A: And now, like, so whatever it was, the impression that Taylor got, the impression that Holly got, is that you were kind of flirty and interested.
[22:00] B: Right?
[22:01] A: Okay.
[22:02] B: And. And it's clear that I'm not, because I brought up. Because, like, before Holly had said that I had the piece of paper in front of me that I had signed, and there was, like, bullet points of things that were said to the. To Deborah and them. And I was like, is it the tattoo thing? Like, me showing you my tattoo? Because I have one on my side. I'm like, because. And she's like, you never showed me your tattoo. And I was like, oh, okay. That. Like, awkward, you know, because I'm like, I was trying really hard to, like, pinpoint what it was and bringing those things up to Taylor. Like, she didn't confirm anything. So I'm still, like, when Chanel talked to me the other day about me and Taylor's convo. I was, like. It seemed kind of vague, and I couldn't give her, like, a. An exact answer on, like, what it was that I did. And she, like, seemed kind of confused by that. But, like, I mean, I guess we talked, like, Kayla was sitting right there, and the talk went well. But I don't know. Like I said, I've just been trying to be one mindful, and I was direct with the fact that I was not approaching her in any way like that or interest.
[23:29] A: Okay. But that was the thing that got triggered for both of them. Yeah.
[23:34] B: And I was like. And made me want to leave because one.
[23:40] A: It was confronting.
[23:42] B: Yeah, I was confronted. And I'm like, I'm not that person. Like, I'm not actively seeking anybody out or anything like that, so they can go on with that, you know? And I didn't know who it was, so I had to go back in the house, back in the main house. And with knowing that somebody said something and I didn't know who it was or what the whole spiel was about. And I just. I think what got to me is I've been on the other side of that because I had a similar kind of situation happen, that assessment, but I was, like, the one that was uncomfortable. And so, like, it really got to me when. Especially when I talked to Holly and hearing what she had to say, because I felt like I could relate. And even though I've always had good intentions, you know, I think that's what upset me so much, because I had to process with Kayla after, because I was, like, all teared up and, like, emotional about it. And I have utmost respect for the girls there.
[25:02] A: Yeah, they just had the experience of unwanted advances.
[25:10] B: It doesn't mean that, like, I wasn't gonna own up to those things, because, like, I did.
[25:15] A: Yeah, but. And then they told you about it.
[25:18] B: Yeah.
[25:19] A: And then it was confronting again. Right. And then you had to, like, have the conversation, which is also uncomfortable. I didn't just give up. Isn't that cool? You don't want to actually feel good about that. No, don't feel good about that. Right. You know, any amount of growing you don't want to actually feel good about, you actually went through something that was uncomfortable, that normally, if you were in a different situation, you would have just left.
[25:53] B: It's like, I don't know. I don't feel like I'm to where I can, like, acknowledge it. That's, like, a good thing.
[25:59] A: You wouldn't want to actually feel good about, like, actually staying and dealing with discomfort. Because normally when you get uncomfortable, you leave or you use. And you didn't do either of those things.
[26:12] B: Right?
[26:12] A: Yeah. I don't know. I mean, you might want to actually start talking about that. That might be a good thing.
[26:16] B: Yeah. I mean, I'm trying to jump on.
[26:18] A: That van to realize that you're changing. Growling I have to.
[26:21] B: I have to celebrate the small victories I know about, but most times that's harder to do than it actually is said. But yeah. And then, like, after all that, Kayla and I had, like, a little victory bar. We called it a victory bar. And, like, I stuck a little candle in it, and I was like, yeah, because I guess she wanted to get through me that, like, the small things are a victory and it's worth celebrating about, you know, even if it's just for you, which is the whole point, you know?
[26:54] A: Right.
[26:55] B: You chose to do something different that you normally don't do.
[26:58] A: Right.
[26:58] B: Yay. You know, I guess to try to get me in that mindset. And it's like, I almost don't want to acknowledge to myself when I. When I. When I do something differently that I normally wouldn't do because I'm like, oh, well, what is it?
[27:14] A: Change. Growth. Right.
[27:19] B: Yeah.
[27:20] A: And that's the part that you actually get to feel good about. Then I'm changing and growing. Like, I'm not the same as I was when I entered.
[27:29] B: That's what I want yet.
[27:31] A: Right. But it's been confronting and uncomfortable, this change. Right. Which the problem is that you weren't thinking it was going to be somewhat uncomfortable.
[27:46] B: Okay. You're right. I keep staring at this paper because I have so much on it.
[27:54] A: Yeah. Well, what else has on there?
[27:56] B: Do you want to read it?
[27:57] A: No.
[27:58] B: Okay, let's see my next bullet point. There's been a lot of shit, man. Okay. Eating habits.
[28:08] A: Okay. What does that mean?
[28:12] B: I've since. At a younger age, I've struggled with bulimic.
[28:17] A: Okay.
[28:21] B: But I feel like this is different. I feel like this stems from.
[28:30] A: Of.
[28:31] B: Course, when I was using and, like, also not having much food in the house. And so where I would eat, like, I would, like, gorge myself because, like, I guess essentially I didn't know when I was gonna eat again. And. And now that I'm somewhere where, like, we're overflowing, literally, food is falling out of the fridge. It's hot. Much food we have, like, I. I'm overeating and, like, making myself sick, but not on Purpose.
[29:04] A: How do you know you're overeating?
[29:06] B: Because I'm getting sick.
[29:10] A: Because you're getting sick. What does that mean?
[29:13] B: Like, I throw up.
[29:14] A: Okay.
[29:16] B: And like I eat really quickly.
[29:19] A: Uh huh.
[29:20] B: Like I don't know how to, like I know how to slow down or. I'm working on it.
[29:25] A: Okay.
[29:25] B: I just, like, I feel like, like I wasn't eating three meals a day and snacks and stuff. Like I might have been. I might ate like one meal a day, you know? And like I've just noticed that. I don't know, it's like my body's still adjusting to like being normal, I guess. So it's not even a. Like I'm making myself throw up because I don't, I don't like my image, which is like where it started from. And I mean, I still struggle with my image, but that's not.
[30:06] A: Does that make sense? You struggle with your image?
[30:11] B: With my, with how I look.
[30:13] A: Huh.
[30:15] B: But that's, I don't feel like that's.
[30:17] A: How are you struggling with it?
[30:18] B: Huh?
[30:19] A: How are you struggling?
[30:21] B: I don't like myself. I don't like how I look sober.
[30:26] A: You don't like how you look?
[30:28] B: Yeah.
[30:29] A: Okay.
[30:29] B: And I know that's like. Isn't that what you just said? Yeah, but this time, like, I'm not forcing it, it's just happening.
[30:37] A: You're not forcing yourself to throw up. It's just happening.
[30:43] B: Yeah.
[30:44] A: Okay. And you're thinking it's because you don't like how your body looks?
[30:50] B: No, I just. I don't know, I'm confused now. No, I just, I guess I was still making the correlation with when I didn't like how I looked. So I was.
[31:06] A: Would force myself to throw up.
[31:11] B: Now. I. Okay, I'm still getting sick, but it's not because I'm forcing it. But I'm also dealing with the whole self image and like how I look and that, I don't know, I'm trying to say that there's not a correlation there.
[31:36] A: It's not because of the same reason.
[31:38] B: Right.
[31:39] A: Okay.
[31:39] B: It's because like, I'm trying to like, catch up and I don't know, like eat in a healthy manner and like, I don't know, I'm just getting sick, I guess.
[31:56] A: Okay.
[31:57] B: Like it feels like too much food, but it's not too much food. I'm just eating normal like everybody else. And like. And now that I brought that to attention, like I have to check in with an advocate after sober at the end of the day and I Have to for an hour, like do something to distract myself. And I'm like, it's not always like on the point, like every single time, but like I've been more mindful and now I'm like, now I'm legit, like looking on, looking on the back of stuff and like looking at the calorie count or like I have to like take a bite of my food and count in my head to 10 and then take another bite. Like, so I'm not eating so fast. Like I'm trying to do everything right. But like, if I just eat once, you know, like I'm still hungry. And I think because I have put on healthy weight, I've like put on like £15 since I've been in the program and I just, I feel hungry all the time still. So I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm doing everything right and I'm still like having issues.
[33:18] A: Okay. So not every time, but sometimes after eating you feel overfull and then you've done purging, which frequently people do because they are uncomfortable with conflict.
[33:40] B: Okay.
[33:43] A: Right. The mechanism that tends to cause bulimia more so than other things is that there's conflict in the home. Conflict going on. And that person swallows conflict and they purge it. So not unusual somebody who is being called like you are out on things where you're being conflicted.
[34:20] B: Yes.
[34:21] A: And it's uncomfortable for that to be a way to cope.
[34:27] B: And they want me to like, pay attention to like what I'm doing before it happens. And I'm like, I don't know that. Just I don't really know how to go about that because I think that if I can just figure out like if it's. They used to go into therapy as an example. Like if it's on a day of therapy and like, and then you find yourself, maybe it's because like you're really anxious. Could be I'm like, I don't know. So like. Or I'm just really stressed out. Which that is true that I am really stressed out, but I just don't find the correlation. I don't know. I feel like I don't need to think on it too much and like I'm having to think on it too much.
[35:17] A: Wouldn't it be better if it just stopped? Yeah. Meaning you stopped doing it and you are more comfortable. Yeah. Huh. Like more comfortable in you.
[35:34] B: Yeah. More comfortable in my own skin.
[35:36] A: Yeah, that would be useful. Uh huh. Okay.
[35:40] B: The only time I feel good about myself is when I work out and I love working out.
[35:45] A: Okay.
[35:46] B: So. But then at the same time, that's been like an addiction in itself. Like, it can become that, like, I can overdo it because, like, it'll be the only thing that I think is positive that I can like go to. And like, I guess that's too much of something, even if it's good, isn't healthy. So, like, I know that. So I've been extra mindful about that.
[36:18] A: But, you know, I mean, if you're going to do something and there's one of those things, exercising more is probably the least of the bad.
[36:32] B: Yeah, they pay attention there. You know, like, if I were to like frequent, like at the gym, like three times a day, you know, they'd be like, you know, we need to talk to you about that. And I'm like, I thought that was a good thing. You know, I didn't think that, like, you could like work out too much. But it's been brought up that that's like another form of your addiction, like coming out, like to find something to like, to go to. I don't know.
[37:02] A: Versus just you. Being comfortable in you.
[37:05] B: Yeah.
[37:06] A: Right. Okay, so the purging has been problematic too. And then you haven't always liked what your body looks like. Okay. What we really want is for you to be comfortable in you.
[37:25] B: Yeah, I really want that.
[37:27] A: Okay, we can do that. What else is on your. Lots of stuff. Listen.
[37:42] B: We'Ve kind of already talked about that. I said, why does going and not having a solid plan excite me? And why in my head does it sound better than making good changes instead? Yeah, we've discussed that. Self damage running off. I feel like I've covered most of this. The whole instant gratification and relating to using healthy coping mechanisms. Getting frustrated when it doesn't instantly make me feel better. Situation with Holly and Tangler, self image and recovery, confidence and talk about relationships. So I just think overall I just. I doubt. I doubt myself and I minimize anything that's good. And my confidence is low in myself and I feel like that prevents me from just everything, especially in social settings. The way I hold myself, like, I can recognize that there is room for growth there. I just don't know what to do differently. Especially with my anxiety. I feel like it gets in the way. I'd like it to just not be there. That has never seemed to happen. It just not be there. Well, in a good way. Yeah.
[40:01] A: There are times that it's not times.
[40:04] B: It'S a little less. It's there There. But it's less like if I'm by myself. I'm not so anxious compared to, like, I'm hearing noises, like, in the walls.
[40:23] A: You are? Yeah.
[40:24] B: Am I?
[40:25] A: And every once in a while you hear a. Yeah, it's all normal.
[40:31] B: Okay, wait, what was I saying?
[40:37] A: What were you saying?
[40:39] B: Okay, don't do that. Confidence in how I. I know. Okay. So one thing I've been practicing is because I would get super anxious when I do check in with Deborah and Madeline. And I would sit, like, with my knees up and, like, my arms, like, wrapped around because I was just like, comfortable like that. And so just forcing myself to sit in a more like, open position. Like, in a way, I feel better about myself and I feel more comfortable, but it doesn't last very long. It's something I have to, like, practice doing. So that's like, I don't know, because I'm so soft spoken, especially when it comes to groups of people. Like, I don't know, my confidence is, like, shaking because I'm supposed to, like, project my blanket voice and like, I don't know. It's frustrating.
[41:56] A: According to whom?
[41:57] B: To everybody.
[41:59] A: Everybody. All people?
[42:02] B: Maybe not everyone, but, like, I've been.
[42:05] A: Told that a lot since you've been in program or prior to.
[42:13] B: Prior. And I still think I need to, like, I let it end in April, the other week.
[42:18] A: You did?
[42:19] B: Yeah.
[42:19] A: Huh.
[42:21] B: I know, right?
[42:22] A: Like something new, right?
[42:24] B: One under my belt and another step.
[42:26] A: Of, like, you know, growing, changing.
[42:30] B: So if every time you say that, I, like, feel some type of way about that.
[42:35] A: What. What's the way that you feel? You know, the type of way.
[42:41] B: Kind of mad, even though I shouldn't be.
[42:43] A: You get mad about growing and changing.
[42:45] B: Yeah, but it's good. And like, I can acknowledge that. And it's like this constant circle.
[42:50] A: If you were to go work out, right, and let's say you're gonna do, like, you know, bicep curls, but you're gonna use, like 2 pound bicep curls, and that's all you're ever gonna use. Does that, like, do anything to strengthen your muscles?
[43:11] B: No.
[43:12] A: No. What do you have to do? How do muscles get stronger? What do they do? You know what they do?
[43:20] B: What?
[43:20] A: They break down, don't they? Like, if I'm lifting weights, I'm going to lift more weights. It's going to cause my muscles to rip, so to speak, break down so that they can become stronger, lifting heavier weight, you know, and over time, continuing to lift a heavier weight, my muscles will grow and become Stronger. Am I also sore as they're doing it?
[43:49] B: Okay. Are you getting at growing pains? Is that what you're getting at?
[43:53] A: What I want you to realize is anything worthwhile. Anything worthwhile is at times confronting and uncomfortable. Yes. Like to get places it's uncomfortable so you can go back to what's familiar and you know, nobody will stop you from doing that. The question becomes really more, are you worth it to you to go through discomfort to become a better version of you? Are you worth it to you? Yes, you are.
[44:43] B: I get frustrated and overwhelmed so easily.
[44:45] A: Yeah. So let's do some things that are designed to get it so that you're not so easily frustrated and overwhelmed. Do you want to know what I wrote down on my paper the first time I wrote down? What do I want to do? I want you to be lighter and happier and easier on yourself, more content and comfortable in your own skin. Okay. On the inside.
[45:19] B: Okay.
[45:21] A: That was what I wrote down after our first conversation. Right. So there's a saying, and I don't know if anybody's ever shared it with you, but the saying is this. How you do anything is how you do everything. Ever heard that before? So what you had been doing, which is when I get confronted, when I'm uncomfortable, I flee.
[45:49] B: I would rather leave too, than it be the other person. Like I'd rather take control and leave the situation before, like, I guess whatever it is presents itself to where I have to leave or something happens. That's not just me, I guess.
[46:19] A: Right. But what you normally do is leave, use.
[46:29] B: You've learned that a lot.
[46:32] A: That's the normal operating. Right?
[46:35] B: Yeah.
[46:36] A: And despite that being the thing that's showing up, you're still here. Yeah. Uh huh.
[46:46] B: It sounded better when I had it all planned out in my head and then I went to pack my shit and like I couldn't finish packing it.
[46:52] A: Right. You know why?
[46:58] B: Because there's change happening.
[47:00] A: Maybe because you're worth it to you.
[47:03] B: And because I'm just starting to get there. I don't know, am I worth it? And like, I've asked myself that 20 times.
[47:10] A: Well, are you worth it to you?
[47:12] B: Yeah, I'm worth it.
[47:13] A: You are. Okay. Which is why you're still here. Even though there's been lots of thoughts that it'd be easier to leave, that I wouldn't have to be doing this stuff and I wouldn't be confronted, I wouldn't be uncomfortable. I mean it would bring a whole bunch of other things that would probably have discomforts and stuff with it. Too. But I want of these at least.
[47:39] B: Yeah.
[47:40] A: Yeah. Okay. Any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know before we kind of move forward with what we want our time to do for you?
[47:59] B: I don't think so. Unless there's something big that I missed, I feel like I've kind of covered everything.
[48:05] A: You did.
[48:06] B: Yeah.
[48:06] A: Cool.
[48:08] B: See, I don't need to doubt myself. Like. Yeah. I brought up everything that I felt like was important.
[48:16] A: Yeah. So we want you to be more comfortable in you. We want you to be lighter.
[48:28] B: I've been told that in the past.
[48:30] A: You just need to be kinder to yourself and more at peace. We want you to actually read and experience other people's emotional stuff as being about them, so it's not making you feel bad about you.
[48:46] B: Okay.
[48:49] A: We want this thing up here that goes really rapidly to actually be a lot quieter. We want you to be more peaceful. And therefore, as we do all of those things, the tools that you've learned can actually be more effective. Because if the part that's running all this stuff is actually way, way, way less, then the tools will work better. Don't you think?
[49:33] B: Yeah. Okay. I get what you're saying with that. And I would agree. Is this the part where, like, the whole consistency is key? Because, like, no, I feel like I'll do the same thing over and over and like nothing's like. It's like, oh, you just gotta be patient. Like that's all it revolves around.
[49:52] A: No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm not saying consistency is the key. I mean, it may be a key, but I don't know if it's the only key. The thing that I want you to begin to consider is you've been thinking. It's the circumstances, situations and things that make me uncomfortable. When this person brought this thing up, it made me feel this way. When I had to deal with that thing, I felt like this. When I have to do this dinner thing, I feel this way. When I'm in a group of people, I got all this stuff. So we're all looking at it, that it's the circumstances, situation and stuff that caused the feelings. I don't disagree with that. And that lens is fine, but it's small because it only gives us a little bit of power. I'm either going to work hard to change it or I'm going to try to get the fuck away from it, which is how most of us deal with stuff. But what we're going to add, Taylor, is the third dimension. Adjusting how your brain emotionally reacts to this stuff. I think I gave you the silly example of the lion approaching the zebra and how most people say the lion makes the zebra scared. We go, yeah, of course. But then we look at it from another lens. We go, wait, no. What if it's not the lion that's doing it? What if it's the zebra's brain that's immediately making the zebra alert, motivated and strong? As soon as the zebra senses, feels, sees, smells or thinks the lion's coming, it's the zebra's brain, not the lion, that's now making the zebra feel that way. Yes, it's doing it in response to lion approaching, but it's zebra's brain, right? What if there's been some ways in which your brain has been working that's been causing you to feel bad? By bad we're meaning that whole like discomfort in my stomach so I want to throw up. By bad we're meaning the whole discomfort has. People are bringing stuff to my awareness that I didn't even know I was doing that made them uncomfortable. By bad, we're meaning the overall anxious, I gotta like take care of the whole dinner thing. By bad we're meaning that I don't really know what to say to certain like. But your brain might be doing all that shit to you in response to stuff. The current, the past, the future. You definitely though have recognized that way of your brain working has been problematic. That's the issue that's on the table. See the one thing that you will always bring with you when you come here, you can't not bring it. We can't bring the stuff or the situations. You always bring this. And what we want is we want this part of your brain, emotional part of your brain, to work more in the way that you want it to. Because if we look at it from the weird lens, your brain makes you feel bad. First question, do you really think it wants you to feel bad?
[52:50] B: No.
[52:53] A: Your brain doesn't want you to feel bad. Right. Do you think your brain would want you to feel good? No. See, that's the fucked up part about the brain. See what we've learned in working with thousands of different people. You're a bright guy, I'm a pretty bright guy. A majority of our brain though emotionally works like the brain of an animal. An animal doesn't have emotions because the brain of the animal is concerned about its mood, its affect, its well being, how it feels about itself, its level of esteem, its sense of self worth, its self confidence, whether it's having a good or a bad day. The animal's brain causes produces emotion for animal for three reasons. Get the animal to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. It's that simple. When a rabbit sees a fox approach, the brain immediately makes the rabbit experience fear. Not because it wants it to have a bad day, but to make it run really fast away, right? The squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire pain. But not because it wants the squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid dumb moron. And now it's embarrassed around all the other squirrels. Mario just got low self esteem and hates his being so stupid. No, simpler, get the fucking tail out of the fire. It's literally that basic. All the negative emotions we feel, the hurt, the anger, the sadness, the sorrow, the angst, the upset, the worry, the grief, the pain, all of it is caused by the part of our brain that works like an animal. Purpose motivate is to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. You wonder what the error is. Many times our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem we can't solve. Have you ever noticed us as human beings, we have a tendency to feel shitty about the same things over and over and over again. Good news. Many of the things we feel really shitty about are in time periods that are finished. So we don't need to solve the problem. It's actually simpler. We want to update the timing. Timing is the error that malfunctions. Here's why. We've got another part to our brain, this essay intellect. Do you know what our intellect is able to do? It's able to know I'm sitting here now. It's able to think of a future thing I'm going to do. And it's able to remember stuff that I've done before. It's also able to conceive of outcomes that are different than ones that have already happened. And it can also think of things that I haven't done, but I could do. Animals can't do. That's not a problem for human beings if the experience is positive or neutral. Because when they're positive or neutral, our brain knows the difference between the memory of it and it. Somebody's telling us about a trip that they had to the Florida Keys. And when they were there, they took their picture next to the sign that said 90 miles from Cuba, right? They went out deep sea fishing. They saw Florida, Maryland. They caught those little blue lobsters. They went out on Duval Street. They rode the little One, right. They tell us about that experience. You and I both know that they know the difference between remembering being there and being there. It's totally clear. But if it's negative, and it doesn't matter whether it's a big negative or a small negative, it doesn't matter if it's one that happened a long time ago when I was a young child or one that happened heck yesterday. And it doesn't matter whether it was a one time occurrence or multiple times through many years. All the negative experiences, the painful, the bad, the sad, the awful, the scary, the upsetting, the traumatic, the horrific, the catastrophic. Our brain confuses memory thinking it's experience. It causes an emotional reaction trying to motivate us to get it to stop. Simple. What's that?
[56:34] B: Simple, like leaving.
[56:36] A: Well, it's causing all of that because it's trying. You have the two choices. Try to change it, get away from it. What sometimes seems easier, get the fuck away. Right. We want to adjust the way that your brain has been reacting to this stuff so that you have more ease. We want this thing up here to be quieter and you to actually be more comfortable in you. Right. People who have low self esteem tend to want to have high self esteem because they think it's the opposite. I want to feel really good about me. But you know what the opposite of low self esteem is actually? No. Self esteem. Meaning they don't spend much time at all thinking or feeling about themselves. They're not sitting there analyzing what others might be thinking about them or whether they're going to say the right thing. They're actually instead outwardly focused and comfortable inside. They're not spending much time thinking about themselves as they interact with others. They're just interacting with others and there's ease in how they do it. See, I think there's that sound, right?
[57:43] B: What is that?
[57:44] A: Oh, well, there's Bluetooth speakers and every once in a while, because I don't know why, they're cheap Bluetooth speakers. They go. Makes no sense to me. But that's what they do.
[57:56] B: I feel better that there's, you know, nobody listening.
[57:59] A: Well, we don't know whether that. So the cool thing is we want to get your brain to work more in the way that you want it to. Your brain is the thing that's been making you feel the discomfort. You don't like feeling the discomfort. Your brain hasn't been making you feel the discomfort because it's out to get you or it wants you to feel bad. It's because there's Errors. Okay, Right. So the deal is, a guy tells us about being mugged 22 years ago when he. He was in Oklahoma. He gets to the part where the gun is pointed at his head. And now his face is white, his voice is choked, his eyes have tears, he's trembling and shaky. We're nice. We were kindly listening to him. What the fuck is happening? We go, he's reliving it, but what's really happening, part of his brain, emotionally, is confusing. The memory, the data, the info about what happened, thinking it's happening. That's why he's having that emotional reaction. We notice it's affecting him as he was telling us about it. But you know what? It was affecting him even over the weekend when he was, you know, with his family, boating. It was just under the surface up here. At a logical level, he knows that he's safe, that he's okay, that he survived, that there's no gun. We're also learning that part of his brain never got the good news that it stopped. Yeah. So where therapy missed, they thought, I need to get it out, like purging. But then I get re triggered by the same stuff. It's actually the reverse. Getting the good news into the part that doesn't know it's over. Unplugging the memory. Once the memory is unplugged, the pain that was attached is gone and it doesn't reactivate. Oh, and we can get it done in a painless way. Two, when we go through troubling moments, you know what our brain does, it attaches a meaning to it, which makes me feel even worse about me. I remember this one woman that I worked with a long time ago. She walked across the parking lot, the one we have out here in a nice area. 4:30 in the afternoon, it was still light out. She simply went to go to her car. She was leaving work. Yeah. She happened to have been texting a friend. When she went to open the door, two men who were in a van jumped out, grabbed her, threw her in the back of the van, drove to a secluded area where they proceeded to beat and rape her. Now that is a fucking horrible experience. But if you can imagine what was worse is what she told me when she saw me. Because this is what she said. She goes, you know what? I am never going to forgive myself for that. I went, for what? And she said, clearly being stupid and careless and not paying attention, putting myself in a vulnerable, dangerous situation. I go, you mean walking across your parking lot during the day? But if you notice everything that she was telling me was meaning that it was her fault. Now why the hell does that happen? It's because when we were very little children, impressionable, we were lied to by all the people that matter. All little kids are lied to. Do you know what the biggest lie they tell us? Life is good. Fucking liars. And then they tell us that if we're good, our lives will be good and we'll get to live happily ever after. Fucking liars. And then all of society reinforces it. Every movie, story, book, TV show, game geared for little children reinforce the same message. Good things happen when I'm good. I get the prize, I get the reward. I get the present, I get the hug, I get the kiss. I get love. I get the money, I get the candy. Good things happen when I'm good. Great, if life is always good. Fuck, I've never met anybody where life is always good. Yeah, right. And the error isn't that we lied and told him life is good, it's that the other thing has to be true. Because if good things happen when I'm being good, what does that also mean? Bad things must happen when I'm bad or when it was my fault.
[62:26] B: So how come when something good happens to me, I feel like it's not gonna last long? Because normally something bad follows.
[62:32] A: Well, there you go. I don't know when you got that programming in you. Isn't that weird? Yeah, right. Wouldn't it be useful to get that programming going so that you could actually feel good instead of waiting for the other shoe to drop?
[62:50] B: And then it's like I make the connection that like, oh well, I must be self sabotaging, right?
[62:57] A: Yes, right. Because that's exactly what I'm interested in doing. Instead of me wanting to have really good things happen in my life, I want shitty things to happen.
[63:04] B: Yeah, let's see what I can do this time.
[63:06] A: No, it's just bad programming. See, you have to remember you're not the problem. You don't like this feeling. You don't like feeling so anxious. You don't like feeling all this discomfort. You don't like feeling the uneasy and not liking how I look. And you don't like any of that. You don't like feeling that way. So guess what? You're not the problem. You know what's problematic for you? Errors, Glitches, malfunctions in the way that your complicated supercomputer brain is working. So it's you and I joining to adjust errors in the way that your brain has been working. There's been programming that got layered in that have caused malfunctions. Right? One of the malfunctions being when I start to feel really good because something's gone, well, oh no, when is it going to fuck up? Right? That's not useful programming. We'd like to get that adjusted and I call it programming. Do you know why? Because it's not as if you're choosing it. It's something that's running you, not the other way around. We want to adjust the programming so it works more in the way that you want it to. Because you know what? Your unconscious brain wants to work in ways that are best for you. It's number one job is your survival. That's why it beats your heart and breathes. So it doesn't always. There may have been programs that got installed that worked to solve a problem when you were four that are still installed but don't work now. Okay, got it.
[64:54] B: I'm not laughing because it's just like makes sense, right?
[64:58] A: It worked at one time, but it doesn't work always on. So we want to get it adjusted so that it naturally works more in the way that you want it to. Got it. That's where we're headed and we're working on this thing together. We're collaborating and cooperating on a mutual worthwhile goal. It's my responsibility, not yours. But we're doing it together. See, the little 4 year old's parents get divorced and the 4 year old doesn't realize that it's a mom and dad issue and just knows that daddy doesn't live at home anymore. So the four year old doesn't think to himself, oh well, mom and dad. And dad has issues with mom, that's why he's not around. No, the four year old remembers that daddy got really mad because he left a toy and daddy twisted his ankle and screamed and yelled and then broke the toy. And the four year old's really thinking, if I had been a better boy, maybe daddy would still be here feeling like it's again about me now. At nine, the little boy didn't have a lot of interaction with dad. But dad promised, promised that when you turn nine, I'm taking you to Disney. And so that little boy was so excited that he's going to go to Disney with his dad and then his dad doesn't show. All day long, the day goes by, he's like heartbroken. Now the little boy's not thinking, well, I know my dad drinks a lot of Budweiser. It is a Saturday morning, Saturday, dad probably, you know, drank a shitload on Friday and you know, maybe he's in a drunken vendor. I mean, there have been weekends when he gets shit faced and he doesn't show up or call or anything like that. Right? Because I've got a fucking loser for a father. He doesn't get the joy of going to the greatest place on earth with me. That's not what the little nine year old is thinking. The nine year old would be thinking more like, well, see, if I mattered to my dad, if I was worth it, if I was lovable, Daddy would be here. See, it all goes back to being about me. Not about the universe, Right? Always about me. Right. The kid is. Now they're picking sides for kickball and he doesn't get picked, he gets picked last. The girl gets picked in front of him. Now he's not thinking, oh well, they want to win the game and I'm just not good at this game. So that's why I'm being picked last. He's going, it must mean because I'm a loser. I see everything bad goes to be about my identity, like there's somehow something not okay in me. So now we've got bad shit that happens. We've got that meaning that gets attached to it, that lives as if it's the truth. And then guess what my brain does On a hypervigilant super sensitive mode. It scans, looking for anything that's similar to anything that was painful. But it confuses similar as saying, right, the gal's making out with the guy, she's into him, she likes him. He gently touches her inner thigh and she freaks out. She's going, what the fuck's wrong with me? My guy is touching me in a way that should feel good. Yeah, but is there any similarity to Uncle Ralph? Yeah, it's a fucking hand on your leg. Similar enough to get confused. Make sense? Right? All of that stuff continues to run in us. The soldier dies on the ground, the firework bursts in the air. Not because he doesn't know it's the 4th of July and that he's at a fireworks celebration. He lit the fucking firework. Completely different level. His brain confused it. So all that kind of stuff runs, some of it we're consciously aware of. Most of it though is fucking behind the scenes fucking running us. Yeah, we can clear it all out so it stops running you so that it works more in the way that you want it to. That's why I'm saying the thing that we want to get accomplished like the you that I'm seeing when we're done, that kind of discomfort like you had when you were being confronted, like you had when you're having to make dinner. Like that feeling that you get. The you that I'm seeing, she remembers having had those kinds of feelings. But if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't know how to get it. The you that I'm seeing, that stuff's, like, completely clear. It's gone. Even if she's got a burst of anxious, it goes and then it's gone. It doesn't get as high. It's already lower. Even if it spikes, she's past it quicker. The you that I'm seeing is much more centered. She's at peace. She's comfortable in her own skin. She's a lot lighter. Right. The you that I'm seeing is outwardly focused, meaning she's not spending much time, if any at all, thinking or feeling about herself. Instead, she's good on the inside. She's outwardly focused. She's experiencing other people's stuff as being about them. The you that I'm seeing is having ease as she's navigating through the challenges that might come her way, knowing that as she's getting challenged. Just like, you know, when you said, you know, I'm vulnerable, Did you know that there's no freaking act of courage that doesn't require somebody to be vulnerable? If you want the light out of your eyes, by the way, you either need to move. I'm like that side of the couch because it might be there.
[70:27] B: Maybe until it brought. The sun moves again. Watch it out.
[70:31] A: So the thing, right, there's no act of courage that doesn't require somebody to be vulnerable. The you that I'm seeing is up for the challenge to become an even better version of herself because she's, like, at peace and good, and she's feeling good about the things that she's doing, and she's satisfied in the way that she's done them. This is the you that I'm seeing. Got it. She's free from the emotional effect that the past has had. This is the you that I'm seeing now. The question I have, Taylor, isn't how it's going to happen that I get you here. The question is, would it be okay with you?
[71:15] B: Yes.
[71:16] A: Any downside? No. No. So it's really okay? Yeah. And with it being okay, we have a green light. Your brain gets to organize towards it just by conceiving of it. And it becoming okay is already on the way to it. Right. Do you know what our brain responds to powerfully? Symbols. Not. But, I mean, it does, because it hears them, but symbols, it's. Why when you see a big yellow arch on the side of the road, you know it's McDonald's. When you see a swoosh mark on somebody's sneaker, you go, oh, that's Nike. But what does the yellow arch or the sneaker, the swoosh have to do with, like, cheeseburgers and athletic apparel? Not a fucking thing. But they're symbols of the company. Right. We want to get a way to symbolize a you who's cool, calm and collected, who's solid, who's good on the inside, who's at peace, who's light, who's moving through challenges with more flow. Right. And we could use a wild animal or something out in here, something that grows from the ground and natural formation of the earth to symbolize this. You. What comes to mind when you said.
[72:36] B: Grows from the garden? I thought of a tree.
[72:38] A: A tree? Yeah. Beautiful. What kind of tree are you seeing?
[72:43] B: I don't think just a tree.
[72:46] A: Yeah, well, I mean, there's different kinds. Is it a palm tree? No, no.
[72:51] B: It doesn't have so many branches. I like the branches.
[72:55] A: That's right. So you've got a tree with the branches. Right. And deeper roots. Because it's solid. Right. And grounded. Connecting something with thick roots. I guess that's right. Yeah. So we've got that tree becoming a powerful symbol. We're going to do some processes that are designed to increase your mind's response. They're very easy. First one is simple. You're going to look up, you're going to think tree. You're going to take a slow breath in. So look up, think tree, and breathe in. That was the first part. That was easy.
[73:29] B: Right.
[73:32] A: Second will be the exact same thing as that. This time, though, after inhale and you exhale. So look up, think tree. Breathe in and then exhale. Good. Third, exact same thing as that. This time, though, when you exhale, you close your eyes. So look up and out. Think tree, breathing in and then exhale and close your eyes. Good. You can open your eyes. Same thing as that. This time, though, when you close your eyes, keep them closed for just a few moments. Bring your awareness into your breath. So look up and out, Think tree, breathing in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. Now, with eyes closed, bring awareness to breath. Notice your breathing. Notice that as you are aware of your breath, it's influencing how you breathe. That you're actually making it happen now in a slightly different way than how you automatically breathe. Thus, it's altering your state of consciousness, beginning to fuel the transformation that's underway. Take a deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Good. Those few short moments that you had your eyes closed, what did you begin to notice within yourself? You felt lighter. Isn't that a good news thing? Right? So things are already organizing. One more time. Think about the tree. Take a deep breath in.
[74:53] B: Good.
[74:54] A: Exhale and close your eyes. Good. Eyes are closed. Eyes can rest. As your eyes rest closed, you can also rest. You're noticing your breath. You're hearing much voice, how it feels to be sitting in the way. You are able to notice it all at the same time. The unconscious part of your mind is organizing towards what the tree is symbolizing. A you who solid, clear, peaceful light, becoming more and more of this you that we're intending and collaborating on together without requiring much effort on your part at all. It's begun happening. That's right. And then, when you're ready, once again, big deep breath in. Good job. Exhale and open your eyes. Excellent. And how's your body feeling now? It is, isn't it? Kind of interesting how that's working. So next, I'd like you to think of a time when you were outdoors in nature. You see something beautiful. What is it that you see? Yeah. And isn't there a moment that as you're experiencing the sunset, you feel both peaceful and excited? And some people would say, duh, the sunset gives you those feelings. But if we looked at it from a different lens, we go, wait, no. Isn't it being there and the experience of it that's drawing your awareness down and in towards your center? Because at your center, you always are peaceful and excited. Kind of like if I'm at the campfire and I take my hands and I move them down towards the flames and I go, holy shit, this fire is getting hotter. Is the fire getting hotter? No, no. I'm becoming way more aware of it as my hands are closer to the flames. So don't you and I both know that there have been many times in your life, lots recent, where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. The stressors, the worries, the angsts, the upsets, the concerns. But no matter where your awareness has been, always at your center. You're peaceful and excited. And, you know, two of us are in here. How do you know? You look around, your senses bringing data. Intellect organizes it. That's knowledge. People Sometimes call knowledge light. We'll call it light of knowledge. We'll think that at your center it's a brighter light, it's light of wisdom. So now we've got light of knowledge, light of wisdom. And I remember this one girl I worked with, she had a lot of bad stuff happen. Like really lots of anxious stuff. Like, I mean it would churn all in her stomach, she'd get sweaty. Stuff like she'd be really worried about what others might be thinking. It even affect sleep. Like all sorts of stuff was going on, right? She had other ways that she coped that she knew wasn't good for her. But I mean, one of the things that happened when she was a little older, brother of all people used to take mashbox cars, drive them up her leg and park them. So you can imagine all the around that we work together cleared it, it's gone. All the discomfort, all the pain, all the. It's gone. So I'm sitting there talking to him and I go, you know all that? I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone. I go, I know, isn't that cool? She goes, yeah. I go, but the question was where was it? And we started thinking. I go, was it at the surface? She's like no, it wasn't intellectual. I go, oh, maybe it was hiding in your center. She's like, dude, really, how could it survive in a light where I'm peaceful and excited? I go, well then where was it? She said, oh, it was hiding in the shadows in between those lights. I said, what happened? She goes, they've joined knowledge, wisdom, They've joined distortion shadows. It's gone. I said, whoa, isn't that cool? She goes, yeah. And then we started talking about people's bodies. That too often people walk around thinking that they are their bodies. But what if you're not your body? What if you have a body, it's totally yours, but what if it isn't you? And the reason I know that your body isn't you is my mom crazy thing, when she was 17, lost the tip of her finger in a snow cone machine accident. And when she goes to visit people now, they don't say to her, susie, I'm so glad almost all of you could come over. They don't say that to her. Why? Because all of her is there. Even if that part of her body is missing. Neuroscience will tell us that there's no cell within your body that's the same as it was when you were born. They've all been changed millions of Times your feet alone are longer than they were when you were two. Yet despite the changes, you're still you. So we could say you have a body, it's yours, but it isn't you. Then people go, well, then I must be my thoughts. I go, wait, what if you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? What if your brain is the thinker of your thoughts and you have a brain? It's yours, it's not you. Just like you have a hand, just like you have lungs, it's yours, not you. So you're not even your thoughts. They go, well, then maybe I must be a feeling. But there's different ways that you feel at different times. Happy, sad, angry, glad, nervous, anxious. But no matter how you're feeling, aren't you still you? Weird, right?
[80:05] B: Yeah. Okay, so.
[80:07] A: And then they go, well, if I'm not all of those things, I must be what I do. I go, but wait, there's lots of things that you've done in your life. And when you stop doing one thing to do something else. Did you stop existing? They go, no. And then we go, whoa. Well, if I'm not what I do, and if I'm not my feelings, and if I'm not my thoughts, and if I'm not my body, what the heck are you? We're right. So let's just say for our purposes today, that the who you really are is what you became aware of as you see the sunset. That the who you are is the light at the center, that peace, that excitement. And see the light tailor that is you. It can't be touched or hurt or harmed. It's whole and complete. There's nothing missing. And I say that all the time because people come to see me and they fuck up. Identity, words. They tell me things like, I'm depressed, I'm anxious, I'm shy. Thinking the way they feel is who they are. But what if I go to the dentist and I'm upset and I start telling you. And I go, you'll never believe what he did. And you go, what did he do? Well, he put me on one of those chairs. You're like, at the dentist office, right? Yeah. Where my head goes down and my feet come up. He shines his light right in my eyes. I can't see. I'm blinded. He takes a cold metal instrument, he shoves it right up inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness. And you're what? I go, taylor, my mouth. I'm at the dentist. Yeah, but it's the Same thing I said to the girl with her brother in the Matchbox cars. I said, your brother, when you were really little, he messed with your stuff. And she said, he did. And for a long time it hurt my feelings and it fucked up my thinking and it screwed up a lot of what I did. Then she started to smile. Crispy. You know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body, it fucked up my feelings, screwed up my thinking, but he never got me. I said, whoa, that is powerful.
[82:24] B: Yeah.
[82:25] A: Yeah. And so I want you to think of the tree. Take a deep breath in, exhale and close your eyes. And with your eyes closed, they rest. So that as they rest, you also rest. Awareness can begin to drift down deeper inside towards delight at your center. That calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy that is you, capital S self, becoming more and more okay, grounded, rooted, comfortable in you. Beginning to lighten up. Transforming, organizing more and more towards this you that's been symbolized by the tree. And because your unconscious speaks a different language then you or I speak, it knows what to do on the inside to make the changes. It also has direct access to the control panels, knowing exactly which buttons to press in which order, which knobs to turn and how far, which levers to shift and switches to flip, to rewire and organize your brain to be optimized. Comfort, ease inside. All of this is happening now as you rest. That's right. And then in a moment, when you're ready, slowly take your time to find your way back up. That's right. And eyes are open. Good. Those short moments eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself? You're calm, right? What do you notice happening up here? You are, aren't you?
[84:30] B: Yeah.
[84:31] A: Becoming more calm and comfortable. Right. Isn't that kind of weird? Yeah, I know. And see, your unconscious can show you something else. So just go ahead and take your hand and hold it out like that. Alright, I'm gonna go ahead and have you slightly turn it and look at.
[84:50] B: That spot right there.
[84:52] A: Now, don't do anything at all on purpose to move that hand or those fingers. Just become curious when you begin to notice some of the small movements. I'm not sure when you'll notice the small little twitches or wiggles or jumps. That's right.
[85:07] B: I'm not trying to do that.
[85:08] A: That's right. That was unconscious response. It's a way to let you know that your unconscious is responding to you. That's right. See, each time you pay attention to movement that you're not doing. That's right. That's right. There's even more that's going on under the surface than you know, multiplied by 10 times 10 times 10 is happening at a deeper level. That's right. Because there's what you're consciously. That's right. Aware of. That's right. And then there's everything else that's happening that you're not having. That's right. To do and see. Go ahead and take a deep breath in, exhale and close your eyes. That's right. And you'll notice that with your eyes closed you don't have to. To see. That's right. That hand or those fingers. That's right. To begin to notice.
[86:08] B: I can feel it. But like I'm not trying.
[86:11] A: It's just another way to confirm that your unconscious is organizing towards what the tree is symbolizing. That's right. For you. Becoming more and more content. Growing grounded and rooted. Lighter. That's right. And more ease. That's right. Changing programming at a deep level. That's right. See, I'm not sure when you'll begin to notice that hand beginning to settle down, but only at the same rate at which you also drift down. Deeper down. That's right. That hand has now become more wax. Like. That's right. Almost doesn't quite feel like. That's right. Your hand normally feels. And so open your eyes and just kind of notice what you notice now, how different that hand feels. Isn't that weird? Alright, take a deep breath in. Exhale, close your eyes. And then as that drops, you also drop deeper. Deeper, deeper. Deeper down, down, down, down, down, if you want. Side towards delight at your center. That calm, peaceful, easy, flowing energy light that is you becoming more content in you. At the same time, your unconscious is traveling back through the experiences you've gone through in your own history that were negative. Beginning to categorize. And then on its own, it'll pinpoint an experience for us to clear so that you can free from the effect it's had in so many more ways than you know. And so in a moment, you'll begin to slowly find your way back up and up and up. You'll take a deep breath, breath in, exhale and open your eyes. Good job.
[88:43] B: The sun moved again.
[88:45] A: It did, didn't it? Yeah. So if you sit there or there. Right there. Yeah. And so what's going to happen is your unconscious is going to travel back through moments, experiences, things that have happened that sucked. Stuff that you try not to think about because when you do, there's a whole bunch and it's Gonna narrow, it's gonna pinpoint, it's gonna bring. That's right. A particular moment to mind for us to clear.
[89:19] B: Okay.
[89:20] A: What is it that comes to mind?
[89:23] B: Well, you said icky Ingrams and stuff.
[89:25] A: You got one?
[89:26] B: Yeah.
[89:27] A: The one that just came to mind happened about how long ago? Oh, good. So would it be okay to get the impact that that's had cleared? Yeah. And can we do it in a way that doesn't require you to ever feel bad? Do you know how to do that? I do. Do you want to know how to do that? Sure. Okay. So all you do is you intend to be with me here right now because this is what's happening and that isn't. Two, we're working on the mutual goal, what's been symbolized by the tree. And three, I'm way more fun than sucky moments, so I want you with me. Got it. Second, you're gonna tell me just facts about what happened, so it'll go, that happened, that happened. That happened, that happened, that happened, that was done. Three, if it happened when you were four, there've been many things you've done after that that were more enjoyable than that moment. Yeah? Yeah. What's one thing, anytime from when that ended until yesterday that was more fun than that?
[90:19] B: Like anything I can think of. I don't know. Family vacation.
[90:23] A: Yeah. Going on a family vacation was more fun than that. Good. Something else.
[90:26] B: Going to the beach? Yeah.
[90:27] A: Going to the beach is more fun than that. Something else.
[90:33] B: Meeting my mom.
[90:34] A: Yeah. Hanging out with Mom. Meeting your mom for the first time was made more fun than that.
[90:39] B: Yeah.
[90:39] A: Good. One other thing.
[90:48] B: Working on my brother's truck with him.
[90:51] A: Yeah. Working on your brother's truck. All of those moments, way more enjoyable than that. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond that.
[90:59] B: I just realized I said all family stuff. It's interesting.
[91:05] A: There's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond that. So we've got good news to get in. Like working on brother's truck, like meeting mom for the first time, like going to the beach, going on a family vacation, all of those moments way more enjoyable than that. Right. So when that one happened, you're where the thing at four happened, you're where?
[91:28] B: I don't know.
[91:29] A: Well, you remember it happening?
[91:30] B: Oh, yeah.
[91:31] A: Where were you when it happened?
[91:32] B: Oh, at my grandpa's house.
[91:36] A: So you're at grandpa's house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime? Nighttime. Nighttime. And you're where in the house you're in the bedroom, like your bedroom. His bedroom. Your bedroom. Right. And you're in bed.
[91:47] B: Yeah.
[91:48] A: Right. And you're, like, under the covers.
[91:49] B: Yeah.
[91:50] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next? And be here with me. Hi.
[91:52] B: Hi.
[91:53] A: Hi. Notice how you're going there? Yeah. I want you to be here. Hi. I'm more fun than that one. So be here with me. Hi. Notice that you're here. You're getting back to here.
[92:02] B: I'm here.
[92:03] A: Right? You are. Right. So you're in bed. Right. And then what happened next?
[92:07] B: He touched.
[92:08] A: So he came in.
[92:09] B: He came in.
[92:10] A: Right. To the room. Right. Good. Then what happened next? He came over the bed. Right. And then did he get in the bed? Right. So he got in the bed and he was laying there. Right. Good. And then what happened next? He touched your body. Like, touch your chest, stomach. He touched between your legs. Went right there first. No foreplay. Right. So he went right there. Right. Good. And then what happened next? Did he put his finger in your vagina?
[92:36] B: Yes.
[92:36] A: And that was uncomfortable and weird. And some of it might have felt good, but it was all weird.
[92:40] B: Yeah.
[92:40] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next? Right. Be here. Hi. Hi. This is so hard. It isn't that hard to be here. Hi. Hi. More fun. Hi. Right. You could be a mirror. Not a mirror, the guy, but like a mirror. Like. And if you were my mirror, what would you have to do?
[93:00] B: The same thing.
[93:01] A: Right. Which would mean if you're being my mirror.
[93:07] B: Right.
[93:07] A: Do you look like a mirror right now?
[93:09] B: No.
[93:10] A: Oh, see, there you go. Now you got it. Do you know how many people do this? And I go, what the hell?
[93:15] B: My mirror would fuck.
[93:17] A: Right. That would be even worse. Scary mirror. Right. So then what happened next?
[93:23] B: And then eventually it stopped.
[93:26] A: So then he pulled his finger out.
[93:27] B: Yeah.
[93:28] A: Right. And then did he have you touch his body?
[93:31] B: Yes.
[93:32] A: So he had you touch his penis? Did he have you put his penis in your mouth?
[93:36] B: No.
[93:36] A: No. But he had you touch it.
[93:38] B: Yeah.
[93:38] A: Right. And then stuff might have come out.
[93:41] B: Yeah.
[93:41] A: And that was weird.
[93:42] B: Yeah.
[93:43] A: Right. And then he stopped. And then he got out of bed. And then he left the room. Yes. And then that moment was over. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun, like meet mom for the first time. Or, you know, see go to the beach or work on your brother's truck or go on that family vacation. Right. Now, notice you were recalling it. Discomfort, but actually a little less because you were intending to be with me. Isn't that weird?
[94:09] B: Yeah.
[94:10] A: Right. That's because your brain is beginning to realize its data. Because you're not actually troubled because it happened. You're troubled because your brain doesn't know fully that it stopped. We're gonna get it in all the way now. Got it that it stopped. Right. So we never go backwards with the memory. We only go forward. But when you go backwards, it literally unplugs it. It flattens out the neurons. It takes away the charge. We're going to reverse. Right? So we've got, you know, well, we got working on your brother's truck. We got going to the beach. We've got going on the family vacation. We got meeting mom for the first time, right? And then he had left the room, and then he got out of bed, and then he had stopped, and then stuff. And then he had had his finger between. In your vagina, and then he put his hand between your legs, and then he got in bed, and then he came in the room. And then before that, you had gone to bed, and then before that, you went over to grandma and grandpa's, and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing right now as I ran through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it sound?
[95:14] B: A lot is more comfortable.
[95:16] A: Isn't that weird? Oh, right. It's becoming more comfortable. You're changing is becoming more comfortable for you. That's right. And I'm not saying there's at least two meanings to that, but you're changing is becoming more comfortable for you. Hmm. I wonder what it would be like for you to become really comfortable changing. Yeah, right. How much better would that be? That's right. So now the third part to this is we want to fully get it in. Remember the memory of what happened and the experience were glued together. So they're living as if they're the same thing. But see, there are things that you can remember doing today that you know you're not doing, like putting your jeans on. You can remember doing it even. Even where you were when you did it. But if I said, you remember getting dressed, putting your jeans on, then I went, taylor, stop putting on your jeans. You look at me and go, I'm not putting on my jeans. Because what's crystal clear is there's a major difference between the memory of you doing it and you doing it. They're not the same thing. Right? So remember getting dressed, putting your jeans on. You can remember grandpa doing that, right? Well, stop putting on your jeans. Say, I am not putting on my jeans.
[96:29] B: Say that I'm not putting on my jeans.
[96:31] A: Well, stop me from putting on My jeans. Say you're not putting on your jeans.
[96:34] B: You're not putting on.
[96:35] A: Well then you stop putting on your shirt. Say I am not putting on my shirt.
[96:37] B: I'm not putting on.
[96:38] A: Well stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you're not putting on your shirt.
[96:41] B: Not putting on.
[96:42] A: Well then stop grandpa from touching between your legs. Say grandpa's not doing that.
[96:45] B: I was just about to say, say.
[96:47] A: Grandpa'S not doing that.
[96:48] B: Grandpa's not doing that.
[96:49] A: Well then you stop touching grandpa. Say I'm not touching grandpa.
[96:51] B: I'm not touching.
[96:52] A: Well stop putting on your flip flops.
[96:54] B: I'm not putting on.
[96:54] A: Will stop me from putting on my shoes. We'll stop grandpa from doing that.
[96:58] B: He's not doing that.
[96:59] A: Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in, right? Isn't that a good news thing?
[97:07] B: Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[97:08] A: That's right. Now the last part to this is that you back then thought him doing that had something to do with you. Did it? No, I mean is there anything that a 4 year old's thinking, you know what? I'd really like an old man to come in my room when I'm trying to sleep and do that?
[97:26] B: No.
[97:27] A: No. Even if like she wore a nightgown, Right? Right. Well she's flirting. She wore a nightgown. She showed her legs. Yes. She's four.
[97:37] B: A four year old. Right?
[97:38] A: Right. Even if she crawled up and sat on grandpa's lap at one time. Right. Cause she's four. Is there anything sexual? No. She might have a hello Kitty. I got on. Uh huh.
[97:57] B: How sexual is that?
[97:59] A: Not at all. That's right. So it had nothing to do with you. It had everything to do with what was off with him. And see, it wouldn't matter whether it was you or somebody else at that age in that situation with that guy, that's what would have happened. So it had nothing to do with you had everything to do with what was off with him. But see, you didn't fully know that then. Alright, so I want you to repeat these four words after me. Here we go. It's. It's not about me. Right? It's not. Say that it's not about me. Right. It's not about me. That's right. Now close your eyes. Picture that younger you. Just after it's over, let her know that it's over, finished, completed, defeated. That it no longer exists. Let her know that him doing that had nothing to do with you. Had everything to do with what was screwed up with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it then let her know about working on her brother's truck and going to the beach, seeing mom for the first time. Let her know about a family vacation. Let her know so that she gets it. And as the earlier you is getting it. What do you notice happening to her face?
[99:13] B: I don't know. But she seems happier.
[99:15] A: She does, doesn't she? Right. You can open your eyes. She's not troubled anymore. Isn't that interesting?
[99:23] B: Yeah, it's interesting.
[99:27] A: That's right. Had nothing to do with you had everything to do with what was off with him. And see, that wasn't only one time that it happened. No, it happened more than once. Right. And you can think about till when you were how old?
[99:44] B: Well, I was four and a half when I was adopted.
[99:47] A: When you were out of there. So it happened till you left. Yeah. Oh, right. And you left, right? You did, right. I wonder what would happen if she realizes that you left and it stopped happening with him, didn't it, when you left? Yeah, that's right. It totally did. What's happening now?
[100:12] B: I'm not there anymore.
[100:13] A: You're not, are you? No. No. You're here. How's your body feeling, by the way?
[100:17] B: I feel pretty calm.
[100:19] A: I know. Isn't that weird?
[100:20] B: Yeah.
[100:21] A: Normally that's not how it is.
[100:22] B: I feel happy.
[100:23] A: I know. Normally that's not how it is. When you thought about that. Right? Right. I mean, because, you know, you're becoming more comfortable with changing for the better. And you wouldn't want to actually get more comfortable changing for the better. I mean, because you're worth it to you, aren't you? Yes, that's right. That's right. Okay. See, it's already happening. Right? Because when you think about that right now, and you can even think about another time that he did it, try to feel really troubled. Isn't that weird?
[101:02] B: I just kind of let the thought go.
[101:04] A: It's not there, is it? I mean, you can remember.
[101:07] B: Yeah. But there's no feeling.
[101:08] A: Yeah. It's not there, is it? No. Isn't that cool?
[101:13] B: Yeah.
[101:14] A: Yeah. I'm gonna show you something else. Take that hand again. Hold it out like this. Look at that spot right there. Now I'm going to take my hand, I'm going to move it towards yours, Right? You're going to see it with your peripheral vision. As my hand moves closer, as it gets a little bit closer and closer and closer before it touches your hand, you're going to notice that you can feel my hand, the energy. Cool. You can feel the energy in my hand without it touching. Isn't that weird? Which means I'm actually coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever met with your body or hurt your feelings. That's right. Because who you are can only be touched with respect and love. So repeat this after me. I have a nose. I have 10 fingers. I have two elbows and 10 toes. But I'm not my nose or my fingers or my elbows or my toes. Right. I have a vagina.
[102:11] B: I have a vagina.
[102:12] A: I'm not my vagina.
[102:13] B: I'm not my vagina.
[102:14] A: My vagina's mine.
[102:15] B: Vagina's mine.
[102:17] A: But it isn't me.
[102:18] B: But it isn't me.
[102:18] A: So he messed with my stuff. What? He messed with my stuff. And it screwed up my thinking.
[102:25] B: And it screwed up my thinking.
[102:26] A: And it hurt my feelings.
[102:27] B: And it hurt my feelings.
[102:28] A: But he never touched who I really am.
[102:30] B: He never touched.
[102:31] A: He never got me.
[102:32] B: He never got me.
[102:33] A: Why did he mess with my stuff? But he never got me.
[102:37] B: But he never got me.
[102:38] A: Because who I am. Because who I am can only be touched. Can only be touched with respect and love. With respect and love. So he messed with my stomach.
[102:46] B: So he messed with my stomach.
[102:47] A: But he never got me.
[102:49] B: But he never got me.
[102:50] A: All right, take a deep breath in. Big exhale. Close your eyes. Drift down. Down, down, down, down. Once again. Deeper. That's right. And deeper and deeper. Deeper inside. Towards that calm and peaceful, easy, flowing energy. Delight at your center. That's right. All of that is getting in, clearing, lightening up. Becoming more okay. And as you are now being, becoming more okay, you're unconscious again. Big deep breath in. Exhale and open your eyes. Can travel back. Because as you think about this now, what happened then, you know, with him? What? Do you notice anything about it troubling at all?
[103:50] B: No. I just know that it happened.
[103:52] A: Yeah, that's right. It's not a part of you. You know why? Because there's no cell. That's the same as it was back then. That's right. Isn't that a good news thing? Right. And you're becoming more comfortable in you. Isn't that cool?
[104:13] B: Yeah.
[104:14] A: Right. More actually comfortable. Changing.
[104:17] B: That part actually comes.
[104:20] A: I know. Isn't that cool? Yeah, right.
[104:23] B: It's different.
[104:24] A: It is different. And see, different doesn't always mean bad. That's right. See, it's been different for you in this program than what you've known. Right? But different isn't always Bad.
[104:42] B: Different is always.
[104:44] A: That's right. See, your brain again is going to travel back. Isn't that fun? Now the speakers won't work at all. The music's gone. Every once in a while it'll go pewdoop. Because it's going to try to connect again. I have no idea why it does that. I probably should have bought, like, nicer speakers.
[105:01] B: You jam out in here. Is that why you got all the speakers?
[105:04] A: No, I just like the sound every once in a while in the background. That's nice. So again, your unconscious is going to travel back, back through things that have happened, growing you earlier and younger and bring another moment to your awareness to clear one of those yucky things that we don't like thinking about, because when we do, it makes us feel yucky. There you go. You got it. The one that just came to mind happened when?
[105:34] B: Again, when I was about three, four.
[105:37] A: Yeah. And you're where and what happened?
[105:39] B: I'm at my mom's trailer.
[105:42] A: So you're at your mom's trailer. Good. And is it daytime or nighttime? Daytime. And you're wearing the trailer, I mean. Cause they're big.
[105:51] B: Yeah.
[105:51] A: Right.
[105:52] B: Like when you first walk in.
[105:53] A: Right.
[105:53] B: There's a bed.
[105:54] A: That's right. So you're on that bed. Right. Good. And then what happened?
[105:57] B: And Steve, her boyfriend, was sorry.
[106:00] A: So Steve was mad. Right. Good. And then what happened?
[106:02] B: He hit me with a lamp.
[106:04] A: So he smashed you with a lamp?
[106:05] B: Yeah.
[106:06] A: Right. And that hurt. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[106:11] B: I was crying.
[106:12] A: That's right.
[106:13] B: And he was still mad.
[106:14] A: That's right.
[106:15] B: And mom didn't do anything.
[106:19] A: And then he left. And then he left. Right. Oh, right. He left. Right. And then that moment was over. Right. Oh, you didn't realize that in mom not doing anything is what got him to leave? Isn't that weird?
[106:41] B: She would have done something that he probably wouldn't have.
[106:44] A: No, he would have continued to do hurtful stuff. Isn't that weird? So you can remember him doing that? Right. And then later on you did something more fun, like working on your brother's truck to the beach.
[106:59] B: Yeah.
[107:01] A: So we got going to the beach. We got working on brother's truck. And then before that he had left. And then mom and him were there. And then you were crying. And then he hit you with the lamp. And then he was mad. And then they were in an argument. Then before that they were doing whatever they were doing. Right. And again, as we go backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was felt so bad? Right. You can remember him Doing that you can remember putting your jeans on. Taylor, stop putting on your jeans. Well, stop me from putting on my jeans.
[107:32] B: You're not putting on your lamp.
[107:33] A: Well, stop him from hitting you with the lamp.
[107:35] B: He's not hitting me.
[107:36] A: So then where is it? See, it no longer exists. Right. And see, you didn't know back then because you thought mom needed to do something. Because her not doing something meant like she didn't care that you were hit with the lamp. Except in the not doing something got him to leave faster. It's kind of like the girl's like fighting the guy who's trying to rape her and then she just lets him do it and he's done because he's a guy. It's like that. She can't just fight him. It goes on longer. Isn't that weird? Yeah, right? That's right. Right, right. But you didn't know all that. So again, close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You let her know that it's over, finished, completed, that it no longer exists. Let her know that mom not doing anything had nothing to do with her not loving you, had everything to do with her wanting him to leave faster so that she gets it. And then let the you know about working on her brother's truck, going to the phone, seeing a beautiful sunset, hanging out with Bree. Right. And you can open your eyes and what are you noticing now?
[108:47] B: I'm happy.
[108:48] A: You are, aren't you?
[108:50] B: Yeah.
[108:50] A: Right. Becoming more okay with changing, aren't you? Isn't that cool how you're actually becoming more okay with changing? Right. And see, all we want is your changing to be a little less uncomfortable. Because it's not like there hasn't been any moments of discomfort as we've been changing. Right, Right. But notice how it's been less. Uh huh. Right.
[109:17] B: I won't stay.
[109:19] A: That's right. See? See, that's the whole thing about anxious moments. We might have them in life. Probably never gonna. Not like the likelihood of you never having an anxious moment in life ever again. Probably lower. But aren't we wanting to just move through them faster so that they don't activate? So high. That's the better way to go, don't you think?
[109:43] B: Yes.
[109:43] A: Yeah. And that's what's going on. Right? Because as you think about that moment with Steve now, what do you notice?
[109:54] B: There's okay, it was a thought and it happened, but it's not happening.
[110:00] A: Notice how it doesn't have any feeling. Notice how you're also not feeling like it was your fault. And Notice how you're also not feeling like mom didn't care.
[110:10] B: That was a big one for me.
[110:11] A: Because I know. Isn't that weird? But check it out. Cause if she had continued to fight with him, wouldn't he have stayed longer?
[110:21] B: Yeah.
[110:22] A: Right, right, right. So her not doing anything at everything to do with her caring about him getting the fuck out.
[110:36] B: Yeah.
[110:37] A: So it stops. Right, right. Because it's easy to go back and forth with somebody if they keep getting pissed. Right. But if somebody else is just, like, just taking it.
[110:54] B: Yeah. It's hard to keep it going.
[110:55] A: It is, isn't it?
[110:56] B: Yeah. Don't give them that fuel.
[111:01] A: That's right. That's right. Then they have to be with what they just did. Right. Right. So now, as we're seeing it more clearly, what do you notice happening to the bad feelings with Mom?
[111:20] B: It's not very good.
[111:21] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[111:23] B: Yeah.
[111:24] A: Yeah. Right. Especially for. And again, that happening. Did it have anything to do with you?
[111:30] B: No. No.
[111:31] A: It had to deal with whatever was going on with the two of them and really him not being well. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So the lens is also starting to get adjusted outward. Right. So that I begin to experience other people's stuff as being about them. Right. Becoming more rooted in you. That's right. Becoming more okay in you. Right. Rooted with flexible branches. That's right. And see, again, as we're organizing towards what the tree is symbolizing, the unconscious part, once again, can scan back through negative things that have happened. And we'll bring another moment to your awareness. Yeah. There we go.
[112:36] B: I don't like how you keep doing that.
[112:37] A: Isn't that cool? I'm not. You know who's doing it? You and I. Do you know why we're doing it? Because we're collaborating. You know what? Your unconscious wants to work in ways that are best for you. And you're just becoming more comfortable in changing, so the better. Mm. That's right. That's right. Cause it's different. What's the moment that comes to mind now?
[113:08] B: When I was really high and I busted somebody's windows out?
[113:12] A: Yeah. Right. So you've had bad feelings about having done that.
[113:15] B: Yeah.
[113:16] A: Yeah. Would it be okay to get it gone? And if you no longer felt bad, would it mean what you did was okay? Right. So what you did wasn't okay. And you know that now. Right. So is it okay for you to no longer feel bad? Yes. Right. Because you're better off if you don't.
[113:38] B: Right. And I was hallucinating really bad.
[113:41] A: That's right. So when that thing happened, that happened about how long ago?
[113:45] B: About two years ago.
[113:46] A: Yeah. And you're where, like out. Outside. Outside, Right. And what happened?
[113:53] B: Um, I thought I saw my brother being raped.
[113:58] A: That's right. Good. Right. So you had been using, and then you thought you saw your brother being raped, and so you were trying to save him. Right. And so you smashed the windows. Right. And then what happened?
[114:09] B: And then. And then I thought I called the cops.
[114:15] A: That's right. Good job.
[114:16] B: All the people that were there. And instead the owner of the house called the cops on me.
[114:22] A: That's right. He called the cops. I knew. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[114:26] B: And then when I was at the police station.
[114:30] A: Right, they arrested you? They took you to the police station?
[114:32] B: They arrested me.
[114:33] A: That's right. Good job.
[114:33] B: I went to the police station.
[114:34] A: That's right.
[114:35] B: And then I thought I heard them talk, the officers talking, saying that my brother had died.
[114:41] A: Yes. Good job. Good detail.
[114:43] B: That's important.
[114:44] A: Right.
[114:44] B: Because I really thought he died.
[114:46] A: That's right. And then you realized he didn't and.
[114:48] B: Yeah, then I realized he didn't.
[114:50] A: Right. Which is better.
[114:51] B: Yes. And. And then fast forwarding, I talked to my dad on the phone.
[115:00] A: That's right.
[115:01] B: And there was that clarity again, that he was okay and he was in the Bahamas.
[115:06] A: That's right.
[115:07] B: On a missions trip.
[115:08] A: That's right.
[115:09] B: So, like, none of that actually happened.
[115:11] A: That's right. And then you got out of jail.
[115:15] B: Then I got out of jail.
[115:16] A: Right, right. And so we got, you know, getting out of jail.
[115:20] B: Yeah, right.
[115:21] A: And then being in jail and then calling dad and finding out the brother's okay, none of that ever happened. And then going to jail, then thinking that the police said that he was actually dead, and then being taken to the police station and then being arrested and then them coming and then the owner calling, but you thinking that you called it on the people, and then you smashed in the windows to try to save them, and then you thought he was in there. And then before that, you had been using. Then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Right. And again, it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[115:52] B: Smoother.
[115:53] A: Right. You can remember doing that or you can remember putting your shirt on. Well, stop putting on your shirt. Well, stop putting the hair tie around your wrist. Well, stop me from putting on my watch. Well, then stop smashing those windshields or those windows.
[116:08] B: I'm not smashing those windows.
[116:09] A: Well, then where is it? Say it no longer exists, which is what we want to get in. Right? That's right. So that you're becoming more okay. Right. Because you being okay doesn't mean what you did was okay. Right. But you're better off no longer feeling bad over what you did then. Right. Because people don't do better with remorses and regrets and guilts and shames. They're not good motivators.
[116:40] B: No. They're just.
[116:41] A: Right. Right.
[116:44] B: So what is this?
[116:46] A: What is what?
[116:47] B: What is this? Why do I feel better then if it's not guilt and shame?
[116:52] A: Because it's. Well, because you're getting clear that it stopped. We don't feel guilt, shame, regret, and remorse because we did it. We feel it because our brain is trying to motivate us to get us to stop doing it. When your brain realizes that it stopped, it goes, oh, fuck, never mind.
[117:13] B: Yeah. Okay.
[117:15] A: It actually wants to work in ways that are best for you. Right. And that's what's happening so that you get to be more okay in you, present here now. Right. Too often with anxiety, we're too much in the future worrying about what could or what might or in the past, about what did. We want you to be more emotionally present here now, more and more comfortable in you. More and more okay in you. Right? Right. Because you're becoming more okay. Changing for the better, aren't you? Changing for the better. Right. Because when you think about the stuff that we talked about, stuff that happened with Steve, stuff that happened with Grandpa, that thing that happened with the car, when you think about them now, what do you notice? That's right. See, you just answered.
[118:13] B: I was like, I breathe every time I can say that. But that's how I feel.
[118:17] A: Notice how it's different? Lighter. Right. See, your body answered first. It did. And your body is the thing that's most closely connected to unconscious processing. Right. We want you to be more comfortable in you. Which is starting to happen. Notice how this isn't running so quickly, huh?
[118:42] B: Yeah, I'm not everywhere.
[118:45] A: You're here, aren't you? Right. Right. So again, as we're organizing towards the rooted tree with the flexible limbs and branches. That's right. Your unconscious again, can travel back through things that have happened in your own history. Right. And we'll bring another moment to your awareness. There we go.
[119:18] B: Mia's like, I don't have anything. Boop, there it is.
[119:21] A: Yeah, right. Well, that's the thing that just came to mind. Isn't it cool how responsive you your unconscious, your brain is to you. Totally interested in working in ways that are Best. See, it is a warehouse of everything that's happened. So it knows more than you or I. See, each time one of these moments gets cleared, all the energy that was stuck there is released to be used as restorative healing. Repairing energy so that in now you get to operate more in the way that we are both collaborating and intending. Like the tree. See, the whole purpose of doing any of the clearing of earlier stuff is to have your functioning now be better for you because you're worth it. Right. I know. Notice how that's actually feeling more true now. Yeah. Right. So what's the moment that just came to mind? Yeah, that one happened. When?
[120:35] B: Roughly two years ago.
[120:37] A: And the feelings, as you think about it, are feelings of what?
[120:42] B: Guilt. And I just. I just feel shitty.
[120:46] A: Oh, good. So would it be okay to stop feeling shitty?
[120:49] B: Yeah.
[120:50] A: Okay, good.
[120:52] B: So at this point, I just moved down the street from my sister that I just met. Okay.
[120:58] A: Yeah. Yes.
[120:58] B: I just had to move down the street. She helped me get a job.
[121:01] A: That's right. Good job.
[121:02] B: I started using again.
[121:03] A: Yes. Right.
[121:04] B: And I got fired from the job.
[121:05] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right. Then what happened?
[121:08] B: And then I went to go back to the house to get my stuff, and I was locked out.
[121:14] A: Yeah. So you're locked out. Right. Good. Then what happened?
[121:18] B: And then I walked to a neighbor's house.
[121:23] A: Right.
[121:24] B: And used again. And I ran off with him. Like.
[121:29] A: Yes.
[121:30] B: Met this girl.
[121:31] A: Yes.
[121:32] B: Ran off with her.
[121:33] A: Right. Good job, good detail.
[121:35] B: Went on a whole tangent of using and walking aimlessly.
[121:39] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right. And then what happened?
[121:43] B: And it's kind of a long story. And then I met one of my sister's friends. Friends. Other friends. And stayed with her and her boyfriend.
[121:59] A: And continued to use, write good jaga detail and hide out. Yes.
[122:04] B: And.
[122:11] A: Then what happened?
[122:17] B: Shit, I don't know. Like, it's where my timeline's messed up.
[122:21] A: Right.
[122:21] B: I know. I was there and then I wasn't, but I'm trying.
[122:23] A: You weren't. Right.
[122:25] B: Oh. Oh. And then I moved. Then one of the guys that came over while I was there, he reached out to me and he let me stay with him.
[122:40] A: Right. Good job. Good.
[122:40] B: Detailed to Daphne.
[122:42] A: Right. Good.
[122:42] B: And I was clean for a little bit.
[122:44] A: And then you were clean for a little bit. Right. Good. Then what happened?
[122:47] B: And then I got up and I. I didn't stay there long, and I left and I moved to Tennessee.
[122:58] A: Right.
[123:00] B: And then that was for, like, I literally stayed there for a week. And I had somebody come pick me up from Hendersonville Yes. And he drove me to Hendersonville, and I used again on the way there.
[123:13] A: Right.
[123:14] B: And then I. Then I met up with a girl that I was talking to, which is next now, and stayed with her and was clean for another good little bit. And then we moved down to Florida.
[123:41] A: Right. You and her.
[123:42] B: Yeah.
[123:43] A: Huh.
[123:44] B: And long story short, that we were both homeless. And then one of her friends reached out and sent us money so we could move up to South Carolina.
[123:57] A: Right.
[123:58] B: Where he then paid for an apartment for the year for us.
[124:03] A: Right.
[124:04] B: And wow, this is leading to one thing to the next, which. Then she was a piece of shit. And she. She only cared about herself and what she could get out of people and situations. And I. And I wasn't stable and. And so we get a notice on the door and I've just had enough of her and the way that she would treat me.
[124:48] A: Yeah.
[124:48] B: Her lack of bringing nothing to the table. And I met somebody else online.
[124:54] A: Yeah.
[124:55] B: Another ex, which then she came to South Carolina and picked me up and took me back to Alabama to live with her and her mom. And then that happened. Her, the whole situation, and me realizing that I was worth more than being treated like that. And one fight was enough for me. One physical fight was enough for me, even though I started it.
[125:26] A: Yeah.
[125:28] B: That's when I knew I was like, I. I would never put my hands on anybody. That made me realize that, like, okay, something's gotta give. And of course I was using. Well, I met her. And so a year and a half goes by and I moved down here because my parents reached out to me and Bray reached out to me and used again.
[125:57] A: Right.
[125:58] B: And then went to Salah.
[126:00] A: That's right.
[126:01] B: Fast forward to I'm here.
[126:03] A: You are. So now, as you told me about all of that stuff that happened. What. What is it that you've been feeling shitty about.
[126:16] B: That? Wow. Several. Several things, because me and my sister had just started developing a relationship with each other, like, not knowing each other for years.
[126:31] A: Right.
[126:31] B: And she helped me out. And the fact that I went back to more ways of, like. And I thought I could get away with using and being at work because it wasn't obvious to me that, like, I wasn't functioning anyway. So that led me to getting fired and then so, like, coming back and just when I was trying to get in the house to get my stuff and I was locked out, well, my sister was the one that picked me up from work. And then. And then I tried to get in the house and I couldn't, but she Already knew the situation of me using and I could like, I honestly, I didn't know what she was talking about and just totally in denial about the situation until it was obvious and I had to tell her just the disappointment that.
[127:26] A: Oh, so you can remember her being disappointed that you told her that you had been using and that you lost your job that she got you? You can remember her being disappointed when you told her all that? You can remember putting your shirt on today?
[127:39] B: Yes.
[127:39] A: Well, stop putting on your shirt. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Well, stop telling her all that. Well then stop her from looking that way.
[127:51] B: She's not looking.
[127:52] A: Right. So then where is that experience? Say it no longer exists. Right. By the way, her looking that way had everything to do with what, how she felt. Yes, it did. But why might she have been looking that way?
[128:14] B: I'm not picking up what you're putting down.
[128:16] A: You aren't, but you will.
[128:18] B: Okay.
[128:19] A: Right.
[128:19] B: She's looking that way because.
[128:29] A: Oh. Cause she's sad and she cares. Yeah.
[128:34] B: Because she cares about me. Because she loves me.
[128:36] A: Oh, right. Cause she's sad and she cares. Right. How much better do you think she'd feel now.
[128:46] B: Alone?
[128:47] A: You think?
[128:48] B: Yeah. She's really proud of me for coming here.
[128:50] A: Oh, she is, isn't she? Yeah. You know what's not connected to that face of seeing her really sad? She was sad because she cares about you. Not that she was disappointed, but that she cares. Right. And how excited she is now that you're actually choosing you instead of the drugs. Isn't she really excited about that? That you're choosing you because you're worth it? Yes, that's right. So close your eyes for a second. Think back to that earlier you who saw her sister being really disappointed and sad. Let her know that that moment's over. Finish that it no longer exists. Let that you know what you're doing now and how excited your sister is that you're choosing you over the drugs. That you're worth it to you. That you're really interested in your life, working better and that you're becoming more comfortable changing for the better, aren't you? Right. Seeing your sister really excited. Wow. You're choosing you. And then I get to have a relationship with you. You're pretty cool, right? And as you're getting it all right now. Right. What's happening inside?
[130:11] B: You know that? Like that. That.
[130:14] A: Yeah. What's happening now.
[130:18] B: That gets to me because I have an oldest sister still using.
[130:23] A: Uh huh. Oh, you mean you actually becoming clean could actually, you Know, lead the way. Yeah. Oh, right. That it's possible to get clean. Right?
[130:39] B: Yeah.
[130:40] A: And choose you. Yes. Uh huh. Right. Isn't that cool?
[130:47] B: Yeah, that's cool.
[130:50] A: That's right. There are.
[130:53] B: Yeah, it's possible.
[130:57] A: Notice how you're becoming more comfortable. Uh huh. Right. And how excited that sister is for you. Right. That you're choosing you. Right. That you're worth it. I mean, she's always thought you were. Now you do too. Right. Which is why you didn't leave. Uh huh. Cause you already made a decision that you're worth it. You just didn't realize that you were going to get confronted by myself. Right. You didn't realize that you were going to get confronted. Right. See, those are the things that are worth it. And when you have to work because then you feel you're worth it, you appreciate it more.
[131:59] B: Yeah.
[132:00] A: The kid that worked hard to get the car appreciates it. Well, more than the one who just got it given.
[132:06] B: Heck. Yeah.
[132:07] A: Right, Right, Right. So you notice what's happening in you. Mm. So we got. Right.
[132:20] B: That shit's like coming out. Like it makes me all emotional, but like, I feel happier.
[132:24] A: I know. Don't you? Right. Right. Isn't it okay to be emotionally happy? Yes. Mm. Right. And it's like relief. Right. That you're worth it to you.
[132:40] B: Yes.
[132:41] A: Aren't you?
[132:42] B: I am.
[132:43] A: Yeah. And notice how you're becoming more comfortable changing. Because there's been a lot of it today, hasn't there? Huh? Notice how you just went right through with it. Like that first time with grandpa. There was a lot of discomfort. We didn't stop, did we?
[133:06] B: No, we didn't.
[133:07] A: No. What did I say? Get here. Hi. Be present. Be with me. Hi. Be a mirror. Not a mirror, the guy, but a mirror.
[133:12] B: Yeah. Yeah.
[133:14] A: Right. And you did all of it. Right. You could have stopped. You could have ran away. You didn't. Right. Because you and I, just like the rest of the people here, are collaborating towards a mutual worthwhile goal. Right. You becoming more rooted, grounded, centered, calm, peaceful, outwardly focused, lightening up. Right. Notice how all that's happening. Right? And you realize from being with the gal in Alabama and being with the gal that you went with in South Carolina that, wait a minute, she was just all about herself. She can be violent. I'm worth more. And I came down here because somebody reached out, saw something in me. Parents free. Because I've always been worth it to them. Now you're becoming worth it to you. Right. Which is why you're still here.
[134:39] B: Yeah.
[134:40] A: Even if sometimes it's hard. Even if sometimes you'd rather run away. You didn't. Right. So, I mean, you wouldn't want to start to actually feel really good about that now.
[134:55] B: Yes, I would.
[134:56] A: That's right. And notice how you are. Right. Beginning to feel really good about it, aren't you? Yeah. And like good with what you're doing.
[135:06] B: Yes.
[135:07] A: And where you're headed.
[135:09] B: Yes.
[135:09] A: Isn't that a good news thing?
[135:11] B: Heck yeah.
[135:12] A: Yeah, Right?
[135:13] B: Yeah.
[135:14] A: Right. Right. Because they're all going through it themselves. Polly Taylor. Hi, Trisha. Huh? They're all going through it themselves. You know what? Nobody's journey is actually is identically the same.
[135:43] B: Right? Yeah.
[135:45] A: Right. But you're becoming more comfortable changing for the better.
[135:51] B: I am.
[135:52] A: You are, aren't you?
[135:53] B: Yeah.
[135:53] A: Right. Because notice how your body's feeling.
[136:00] B: I am this new person.
[136:02] A: Right. Notice how your body's okay. Right. Whether you're changing for the better.
[136:10] B: Angel. Love to throw that in there, huh?
[136:14] A: Yeah. Yeah. So you did great work today.
[136:19] B: Thank you.
[136:20] A: So one more time, I want you to think of the tree. Take a deep breath in. Exhale. Eyes are closed. Good. With them closed, they rest. As they rest, you also rest as what we've gotten done begins to integrate fully each and every cell within your body. Gaining that same knowledge, wisdom, healing. Becoming more and more okay with you on the inside. Lightening up. That's right. Grounded, rooted. That I'm okay on my way to becoming even more of who I really am. Becoming more comfortable, changing for the better. Even if sometimes it's hard. Even if sometimes there's a. I'd rather guilty. I'm worth it to me. Right? That's right. All of that is getting in to grading. That's right. Rooted with flexible limbs and branches. That's right. On my way to becoming even more of who I really am. Comfortable in me. That's right. And so as you take this time to enjoy the peaceful resting, knowing that there is more to come, thriving whenever you're ready, you can find your way slowly back up and out. And eyes are open.
[138:51] B: Not so bad.
[138:53] A: Not so bad, huh?
[138:55] B: Yeah.
[138:56] A: So any questions before we stop for now?
[139:02] B: Yes. Kind of non related.
[139:04] A: Okay.
[139:05] B: Your theme, I've been dying to know. The African sort of safari like vibe I'm getting. Where does it come from?
[139:17] A: Lots of extra pieces that my parents have had in houses that they keep shrinking where they live. And so it started with the big lion that's out in the front area. I said we're moving. We're not going to use that anymore. Would you like it for your office? And I went, yes. And then through the years, certain people have brought other stuff. And then through the years, like, my mom gifted me that as a present one time. And the desk she wasn't using because it didn't fit in the new place that they were living. And then other pieces of art, they're like, we're not gonna hang them, so you have room to display them. Isn't that cool?
[140:06] B: That is cool.
[140:07] A: The monkeys.
[140:08] B: Yeah. I keep looking at them. They're so cool.
[140:12] A: And then we thought, you know, like, 20 years from now, 10 years from now, if you have this kind of art, it doesn't go out of style. But if you get a theme or an era, then it goes out of style. But this doesn't. So that was the other. Yeah, yeah.
[140:32] B: But related to. No, I don't have any questions. I'm actually pretty at ease.
[140:37] A: I know. Isn't that cool? Notice how that's different than normal? Or maybe this is your new normal.
[140:44] B: Oh, I see what you did there. Okay. I like that a lot better.
[140:51] A: Yeah. And then we can get back together again. You did great today. So you can come with me.
[140:58] B: I am going to dispose of this.
[141:11] A: Go to the right.
