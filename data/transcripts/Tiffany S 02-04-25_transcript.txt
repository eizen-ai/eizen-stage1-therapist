[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 4th of February, Tiffany. This is our first meeting. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:17] B: Yes.
[00:18] A: Okay, cool. So first thing that you want to understand is it is a really weird concept, but why don't emotional wounds heal?
[00:25] B: No idea.
[00:25] A: I know. Is that weird, like physical wounds do? If I broke my foot when I was 11 and I told you about it right now, and I'm as emotional as when it first happened, you're going to look at me like I'm crazy. I've just seen this guy walk all over the place. Why is he still upset?
[00:38] B: Yeah.
[00:39] A: On the flip side, if I told you about what my uncle did to me when I was 11 and I started to get emotional about it, you'd be like, well, yeah, of course. But why? Why does this physical wound heal and that emotional wound doesn't? Even though we have the saying that time heals all wounds? That weird.
[00:56] B: Yeah.
[00:57] A: So what if emotional wounds don't heal? Not because they can't, but because part of the brain doesn't know it ended? I survived it. I made it through it. I'm okay that when we go through troubling moments, it short circuits the brain. The brain freezes the moment. The memory tends to be the worst moment flipped as a gif, like a short little replay of the worst of the worst of each of those things because the brain doesn't know it's over. Where therapy got it wrong, Tiffany, is that therapy thought that when we were going through difficult moments, we weren't able to fully express how it was making us feel. And so we buried it, or we repressed it, or we put it in the closet, or we locked it behind closed doors, or we put it under the carpet. And therefore, the idea of therapy is, well, we have to help the person dig up all of those bad and painful emotions to help them get it out of them, right? Which, after throwing up, I do feel a little bit better, but I still get triggered by the same bullshit. So what if we don't have feelings trapped inside of us that we need to get out? What if it's much simpler? What if what we want to do is get the good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know those awful moments ended? I survived it. I made it through it. I'm okay. What if it's easier? Because all we want to do is unplug the memory so emotionally the brain is able to read it as data about something that happened. I still don't like that it happened, but it doesn't cause all that that it has been. Does that make sense? Right. And that's the problem. What therapy does is therapy thinks that its job is to help the person get it out. But we don't have them trapped inside. It's simpler. We want to unplug the memory. Right. Therapists actually encourage people to kind of go back and kind of be in the moment of it again. We don't want to do that at all. I tell people, and I've worked with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of trafficking survivors. You already did the hard part. The hard part was making it through the awful moments. That was the harder part. Sitting here with me should be a lot easier. Easier than that. And I'm hoping because I don't set the bar very high, that being with me can be at least just a little more enjoyable than the worst moments of your life. I'm hoping that I can do that. Does that make sense?
[03:30] B: Yeah.
[03:30] A: And so that's what we want to do. We want to unplug the memory so the brain can experience it as data. But on the flip side, nobody would care about any of the fucked up stuff that happened to me if it wasn't negatively affecting now. Right. If I was dealing with stuff and feeling the ways that I wanted to and managing things the way, I wouldn't care about any of that. The reason we do is that we get it, that it's had some sort of an effect. And that's what I'm really curious about, because you said one thing that you recognize that that stuff has continued to have an effect on you is that you have night terrors and you get it that they've changed over time. But the consistency is that I find myself at night in awful moments and feeling you'd like that to stop. So that's my friend in the face.
[04:29] B: I don't even remember doing it. And he just had a bloody lip.
[04:32] A: I was like, oh, my God, I'm so sorry. You're welcome. You're welcome. Thanks for waking me up, by the way.
[04:37] B: Don't do that.
[04:38] A: Right. So. So we want it. That's one of the things that we want to get better. I know how to do that. But what else? Right? Like if we could change for you ways that you think, feel, act and react that haven't been Optimal. What do we want to get better? Right. Like so for some people, they're more edgy, more easily irritated, agitated, aggravated. They're like quick and short tempered. They don't want to be. So some people, they're more tense and nervous, they get racy thoughts, they get jittery, they're uneasy in certain groups or social situations and mind goes mile a minute. They don't want that to be going on. Right. Like so kind of thinking about you. What do we actually want to get better? Like, how do we want you to be when we're done? Like if we could really change stuff and we could organize, you know, your brain to work more in the way that you want it to. How do we want it to be? Yeah, like one. I get it. We want the night terrors to stop and we want the impact of what you've gone through to no longer be weighing on you. So it doesn't have any of that. I know how to do that. What else do we want Better.
[05:35] B: So I used to be fine. I used to love being around like crowds of people I didn't know. But now.
[05:41] A: Yeah.
[05:41] B: If it's like a lot of people that I don't know, I just kind of freak out and like, I've never had a stable family environment, so I don't do good with like holiday celebrations, family celebrations, around a lot of people, especially a lot of people. I don't know. I just kind of freak out and I don't know why.
[06:00] A: And what do you mean when you say freak out? Like, you get all like jittery.
[06:05] B: Everything's closing in on.
[06:06] A: Oh, it feels like it's closing in. Black. Got it.
[06:08] B: I feel real tense and I can't relax and like I can't breathe and.
[06:12] A: Yeah. Yeah.
[06:13] B: It's like a whole thing.
[06:14] A: Okay. So we'd like to get that to stop.
[06:16] B: Yeah.
[06:16] A: So that you have more ease in interacting with others, even if it's groups of others. Cool. I know how to do that. Cool. What else do we want to get?
[06:24] B: I think all guys are evil. Almost all guys.
[06:28] A: It's a better way to go.
[06:30] B: Yeah.
[06:30] A: Than thinking they're all angels because that's when you're going to get really hurt. At least if you think that they're all evil, you're kind of protected going into it. A little better than going, oh, no, they'll never hurt me. Yeah.
[06:43] B: I would like to not have the mindset of prepare for the. Or prepare for the best, expect the worst. You know? Like.
[06:55] A: I would rather have you be emotionally Present.
[06:59] B: Yeah. It's like, I like, have a wall up. Like, everybody, like, even my counselor just saying, like, I'm service deep. Like, not that I'm shallow, but they're like, I just don't let people in, like, past a certain point.
[07:11] A: Wasn't that smart? Yeah, right, right. And wasn't the other thing smart, learning how to dissociate so I didn't have to be in my body when I was doing this stuff in particular with the guys that I didn't really want to do it with? Yeah, right. Do you follow me with that? Like, that was a useful tool, but.
[07:30] B: Now I'm still using it.
[07:31] A: But no, watch. It was a useful tool. And the problem is that it's on all the time. That's the error. So it's not that I can turn it on or off. It's that this one's jammed on and it's on all the time and it's never off. Right. So what we would say about that is you don't have a lot of freedom. Right. I don't. People oftentimes go and say this where like, well, I know I need to learn how to trust. And I'm like, that is a really bad idea because we live in a crooked world. And I think that person is always going to have my best interest in mind is really dumb. Yeah, right. Where I want the trust is in me that I have the accurate ability to discern and that I'm seeing it further away from me instead of it getting to me when I don't notice it until it's right here. Right. That's where the problem lies. We all have fire detectors. Not because we think our house is going to catch on fire. Not because, you know, we don't put them, not because we think it never will catch on fire. They're not even there to prevent the fire. Yeah, right. What are they there for? To let us know at the earliest sign. So I have the most amount of options in how to deal with it. When we're at the effect of trauma and other things that have happened, we walk around with a lens like this because when we're tense, nervous, stressed, anxious, agitated, irritated, as you put it, it feels like things are closing in. It literally feels like I get tunnel vision. Right. And if I'm in tunnel vision and that's all I'm seeing, I can't see what's close to me until it's right in my face. Where if I'm out here, I can see it way off in distance. Right. So let's think of a you who's much more grounded and settled in you. Right. Who's much more okay and at peace in here, who's reading people accurately. Right. And steering her course makes sense free from the effect that the past stuff has had. So it's no longer running her. So that she's got that flexibility to move in and out of situations and feel okay. Right. Because it's not about, oh, I always want to be in large groups, but it's not about, I can't ever be in large groups. What we want in all of that is range that if it's an opportunity that makes sense, I'm free to. And if it doesn't, I'm okay. If I'm not, does that make sense? Cool. What else are we wanting to do for you?
[10:14] B: I don't know. I watch childhood drama.
[10:17] A: Yeah, right. So we'd like the impact that that's had. Gone.
[10:21] B: Yeah.
[10:21] A: Because that's also affected, like, the first thing that you said, which is wonderful, and you've got a great sense of humor about it, but it's kind of like a cutting sense of humor. Yeah. I was there six months and nobody came to visit. I just have a little bit of a band, just a smidge. Right. So we want to get whatever transpired back then to get unplugged and cleared up. So again, you get to be more okay and at peace. Not that any of it was okay, but that you're okay now, even though that stuff wasn't right. Because that's where conflict comes up sometimes, is, I want to be okay, but it's not quite okay for me to be okay. Because if I'm okay, that means what happened to me was okay and what happened to me wasn't okay. So how the fuck can I ever feel okay? Do you follow? Right. Like somebody says to me, oh, yeah, I was raped, and that's not okay. Well, would it be okay for you to no longer be hurting over having been raped? Yes, but it's not okay. Right. But you being okay now doesn't mean having been raped back then was okay. You get to be okay now even though that fucked up experience wasn't. Do you follow me? And that's what we're thinking about that in this way for you, that you get to be okay, you get to be more at peace. The weight of that stuff, the stuff that's really impacted how you felt about you. Right. Because with a lot of the childhood stuff, there's. You're going there, aren't you? I Want you here. Hi. Hi. Hi, Tiffany. Hi. You were there for a minute, right? I want you to be here. I'm going to pay attention just like I just did. So if I notice that you go anywhere, I'm going to do everything I know how to do to get you back here. Because I'm more fun. Because this is what's happening and that shit isn't. And you're not troubled by that shit because it was awful. You're troubled because your brain doesn't know the awful shit ended. That's why you're troubled. We have good news to get in. Like, really good news. That certain things ended. That you survived him, that you're okay. That'd be really good news. It's like the soldier who's in the jungle, has he got separated from the rest of the troops? So he's still in the jungle looking for the enemy and doesn't know that the war has ended in his side won. When we find him, don't we have kick ass good news, dude, War's over. We've won. Let me kick ass Good news. That's the same kind of good news for certain aspects where there's parts of the brain that don't know. Awful moments ended. Got it. We want to get in the good news. Yeah, yeah. Any other stuff that comes to mind in terms of what we want to get better for you, right? Not there, here. I'm thinking you are. I know you're doing great.
[13:21] B: Probably just like childhood trauma stuff. Yeah, trauma stuff with my trafficker.
[13:27] A: Yeah, well, those were going to get better. Do you know that that's actually really easy to get better? It really is. Yeah. I'm going to show you. We're gonna do one. Maybe more than one, but we'll do one and we'll get it better. And you won't have to be there because you'll be here. Okay. So the first thing we want to do is one, we're organizing towards how we want you to be. Right. And the you that I'm seeing when we're done, that kind of feeling that you got just a little bit ago when you're the you that I'm seeing. Right. She remembers having gotten those kinds of feelings, but if you asked her to get it, she would not again. Like, for her, that's just been cleared. It's gone. She's at peace. She's present, she's free. Right. The impact is gone. So that she's doing the things that make sense and she's feeling good. She's a Little bit lighter and easier on herself. She's clear in seeing situations clearly and reading other people's crap as being about them. So it's not making her feel shit about herself. This is the you that I'm seeing when we're done. Got it. You don't have to see the you that I just described, just like I do. Because the question isn't how it's gonna happen, it's would it be okay with you? Notice how it's okay? Yeah. And with it being okay, it doesn't mean any of this stuff was okay, but you get to be okay even though that stuff wasn't. Got it. And then all we want to do is we want to get your body into the right states for healing. And the right states for healing are always states of rest. It's why colds, flus, and surgery. What do we tell people to do? Right? So we have really cool levers that neuroscientists discovered by putting FMRI scans on people's brains. First lever, super silly. It's about slightly lowering the jaw. So I don't mean like, ah, I mean a little bit like this. Right? So when you slightly lower your jaw, it activates a nerve in your brain called the vagus nerve and starts to put your body into parasympathetic response. So you slightly lower your jaw now. Right. Second lever is you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. So it's like this. Right. And then third, you're going to begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale and then a little bit longer on the exhale. Right? So you slightly lower your jaw.
[15:55] B: It's lowered.
[15:57] A: You rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth and you breathe in a little bit slower and deeper than normal and then out a little bit longer. And just notice that as you're intentionally breathing in, a little bit slower and deeper than normal. And out. Out. How's your body starting to feel now? More tense or more calm?
[16:22] B: More what?
[16:23] A: Isn't that interesting? Then we want to move from narrowed into expanded awareness. So you continue to breathe in that slower and deeper way. In longer on the way out. As you look across and see me, you're going to stay looking at me in my nose. You're going to see my fingers. Fingers stay looking at my nose as my fingers move out so that with the sides of your eyes, you pick up my fingers wiggling out there. Isn't that interesting that you're becoming more aware of the space like the Space towards the side windows and doors. The space between us, maybe the space beyond me, underneath and behind you. Even above your head. Right. And as you're noticing more of the space, face again, checking your body. How's your body feeling now?
[17:13] B: Way more relaxed.
[17:15] A: Isn't that cool? Right.
[17:16] B: I didn't notice because when I first came in here, like, I was looking at everything. It's my first time in here.
[17:21] A: Right.
[17:21] B: And then I went. I didn't notice anything. Yeah, gone.
[17:24] A: Isn't that interesting?
[17:25] B: That's weird.
[17:26] A: Yeah. You're being present to what we're doing, which is settling your body. And it also quiets the mind. Right. And we want your body in a state of rest because that'll accelerate healing. Makes sense. So one more time. Have you ever heard the phrase, I'm under a lot of stress? Right. And in order to be underneath the stress, where must the stress be? Yeah. So we know the reversal is to get out from under and be up above it. The opposite metaphor of bird's eye view. I'm above, I see everything below. Got it. So one more time. Your jaw slightly lowers. You rest your tongue. You breathe a little bit slightly slower and deeper on the way in. And exhale a little bit longer on the way out. Noticing your breath. You can see my nose, my fingers. My fingers move out with the sides of your eyes. You pick up the wiggling. You notice the space in the room, but you also know the space goes beyond the room, literally all the way out in every direction. The space is truly unending. Outer space and beyond.
[18:31] B: Ending.
[18:32] A: So just for a moment, go ahead and close your eyes. Then imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body beyond the ceiling in the roof, so that you rise way up above it all in the sky. Having this bird's eye view, you're seeing it all as being underneath and below you, because you are above and over it. And just like the bird, free to soar through the space of the sky with big, wide, arching turns and curves. You soar, you glide, you fly, you move, you're free. Bring awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you. Then, when you're ready, a nice deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. And again, in those short moments, what'd you notice within yourself?
[19:25] B: Relax.
[19:26] A: Yeah. And so as your body's in. In this relaxed state, your unconscious, which has been listening to everything that we've been talking about, is going to travel back down the timeline of awful moments in your own history. Recent One Long, long time ago. And it's going to begin to group and categorize, and it's going to narrow and pinpoint and bring a moment to your awareness for us to unplug. Right. And you got one. The moment that just came to mind happened how long ago?
[19:54] B: I don't remember.
[19:55] A: Well, you might have been how old?
[19:57] B: Which one?
[19:58] A: Whatever moment that just came to mind. Right. As we organize towards the you being free and present, your brain's gonna bring a moment. Already did. To your awareness.
[20:09] B: I thought of a few things.
[20:11] A: You did, didn't you? Right. So we'll do one of those few. What's one happened how long ago you might have been how old.
[20:20] B: In the hospital when nobody showed up.
[20:23] A: Huh.
[20:24] B: Growing up in foster care.
[20:26] A: Huh? So notice how those are big generalizations of a lot of time. We're gonna narrow to a particular moment. One time, one thing happened. Yeah, that one. That one happened how long ago?
[20:47] B: Seven. Like, seven, eight years ago.
[20:50] A: Seven, eight years ago. Right. And we're just going to go through really fast the facts, because how you unplug something super simple. One, you want to intend to be here with me. The reason you want to be here with me is that this is what's happening. I'm a happening guy. And that isn't. Two, we're working on a mutual goal. And three, remember, I'm a little more fun than sucky moments, so I want you with me. Got it. Second, when you tell it to me, it's just the facts that'll go, that happened, that happened. That happened, that happened, that happened. Then it was done. Three, if that happened eight years ago. Ish. There have been things you've done after that that were more enjoyable than that. What's something you've done anytime from when that was over until yesterday that was more fun than that.
[21:32] B: Went to Universal.
[21:33] A: You're going to Universal. Way more fun than that. Go to something else. Yeah. Working at Olive Garden, getting out of jail.
[21:43] B: Yeah.
[21:44] A: That's way better than that. Right, Right. Good job. Right. Heck, even maybe going to Salem was better than that. Right, Got it. So all those moments happen after there's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond it. So we have good news to get in. Got it. So that moment happened. You somehow jumped out of a vehicle. That one. Didn't you get out of a vehicle or left?
[22:12] B: Oh, I jumped out the window.
[22:13] A: Oh, you jumped out of the window of the house?
[22:15] B: Yeah. Then I went. I saw the second story window. But I mean, I was Fine.
[22:19] A: Yeah. So you jumped out of the window, you went off.
[22:21] B: I OD'd and I died.
[22:23] A: Met with somebody, got drugs, did them OD'd.
[22:27] B: My heart stopped.
[22:28] A: Heart stop.
[22:28] B: They restarted my heart.
[22:29] A: They restarted your heart. Brought you to the hospital.
[22:31] B: And I aspirated.
[22:33] A: Right.
[22:33] B: In my lungs. I threw up my lungs.
[22:35] A: Right. Good job. To detail. And then they were working on that. Right. How you doing right now?
[22:40] B: Good.
[22:41] A: Yeah. Right here. Hi. Hi. Right. And then what happened next?
[22:44] B: I had double pneumonia.
[22:46] A: Right.
[22:46] B: Like, I don't really remember. First weekend with the hospital. I just remember.
[22:49] A: But then you were in the hospital, and then they were working on your body, and then your body was slowly recovering.
[22:54] B: Yeah. It was a long recovery.
[22:55] A: Right. And then you were there for a long period of time. Right. And you met with different nurses and different doctors and other techs and that.
[23:03] B: No family, though.
[23:04] A: Right. And then what happened next? And then you got out of the hospital. Right. And then that was over. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to Universal. Right. Or get out of jail. Right. Or go to Salem. Right. Or, you know, eat something nice or work on Olive Garden. Right. So notice how, as you were telling me about it, there was some discomfort. It was a little less because you're intending to be here. Now, the crazy thing about a memory is we never go backwards. But when you go backwards with the memory, it literally unplugs it. It takes away the charge. So we're going to go backwards.
[23:39] B: What do you mean backwards?
[23:40] A: I'll show you. So we've got, you know, getting to say we've got working at Olive Garden. We got getting out of jail. We got going to university. Right. And then before that, you'd gotten out of the hospital, and then your body was repairing, and then there was all those issues that were going on. And then you got brought to the hospital, and then somebody revived you, and then your heart had stopped, and then you'd obed. And then before that, you'd gotten the drugs, and before that, you jumped. You left, and then you jumped out of the window, and then you were brought there. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing as I go backwards, compared to forward emotionally, how was it? Right. Notice how it didn't have the same feeling. Isn't that weird? All right. Because your brain is beginning to read it as data. Okay. Third, the emotional brain doesn't get logic, but it does get patterns of association. And the error is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening are merged together. So they're living as if they're the same thing. But there are things you can remember doing today that you know you're not doing right now. Like, for example, putting on your sneakers. You can remember doing it. You can remember where you were when you did it. But if I said to you remember getting dressed, putting your sneakers on, and then I went, tiffany, stop putting on your sneakers. You look at me and go, I'm not putting on my sneakers. Because, you know, there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually doing it. They're not the same thing. So you can remember that happening. Overding, being in the hospital, the people not coming to visit, getting out of the hospital. You can remember all that happening. You can also remember putting on your sneakers. All right, well, stop putting in your sneakers. Say, I'm not putting on my sneakers. Say that out loud. Right? Good. Stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then you stop putting on your leggings. Say, I'm not putting on my leggings. Well, then stop oding. Say I'm not oding. Right? Well, then get them to come visit when you're there. Say that's not happening. Well, get them to not come visit. Say that's not happening. Well, then stop them from doing that. Say they're not doing that. Well, then you stop doing that. Say, I'm not doing that. Right? Then stop it from happening. It's not happening. So then where is that experience? It no longer exists. That moment no longer exists. And again, as that starts to get in, what do you notice? Isn't that interesting?
[25:57] B: Feel kind of weird.
[25:58] A: I know it does, doesn't it? Because there's a third part to this one that we really want to get in. You are an adult now, right? You know, as an adult, that your mom, dad, family, whomever, origin, stuff that you didn't come from, a lot of, like. Well, people, like, they're fucked up in their own ways, right? Some of them might have addiction issues. Some of them might have their own stuff. Some might have mental health stuff. Some, Right? But you didn't come from, like, you know, like, hey, man, these people had their life working and life was rocking and all that.
[26:31] B: Definitely not.
[26:33] A: You telling me I didn't come from the good side of Chicago? Like, there's. There's all that kind of stuff, right? So as we're looking at it, you know, as an adult, that they're not. Well, right? What? It felt like them not coming had something to do with you or their love for you or lack of love for you or, or, or. Got it. But when we look at it clearly as an adult, it doesn't have anything to do with you. It has to do with them not being well. Right. Kind of like the kid comes home with two D's, two F's and a CN as report card. Parents are both pissed, right? Dad comes home, mom tells him about it, dad is now really angry, takes his belt off, goes in the kid's room, yanks the pants down, whacks the kid with the belt. And the kid is totally feeling like I'm getting hit because I got bad grades. But is he? It has to do with what the fuck is going on with dad, not the grades. There's a lot of other ways you could handle bad grades other than the belt, right? So it didn't have to do with the kid, it had to do with dad. Got it. That earlier you thought that them not being there had something to do with you. But as we're looking at it, clearly it has to do with them not being well. Makes sense. But you didn't know that then, right? Because one of the things that gets slammed into us when we're little is we're lied to by adults in the world. And not just the ones that we know are lies. The ones that we believe, like life is good. And when I do good, good things happen. And that's why I get toys, presents, candy, praise. Once a year some dude drops off gifts because good things happen when I'm good. Which is great if life is always good. But it isn't. Yeah, right. And so of course if it's bad, it must mean it's my fault. So nobody's shocked when the four year old whose dad is now no longer in the picture blames feels like it's his lovability. And that's why dad's not there. When dad said I'll come to the baseball game, it never shows. The kid doesn't go, oh right, my dad's on a drunken bender. He doesn't get me to see me pitch at no haters. When dad said at 13, I'm going to take you to Disney. And dad doesn't show, he doesn't write. My dad doesn't get to go to the coolest place in the world with me. A little kid always feels that, oh, it has something to do with me. My worth, my loveability, whether I was good enough, whether they cared, whether I mattered. Follow me with that. All that stuff had to do with Them. Right. Because does it have to do with the kid's worth or does it have to do with dad being fucked up a little or a lot? Follow me with that. You didn't know that then. You're getting that now. And we're going to do a lot more because what we want to do is we want to heal the earlier wounds too. Make sense? But that you thought that them not doing that had something to do with you. As we're looking at it clearly now, did it have to do with you or did it have to do with them? Yeah. And them not being well and you didn't need them or them to be well in order for you to heal, in order for you to get out of the hospital. In order for you to choose to go to a program to heal. Right. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. So go ahead and close your eyes. Picture that earlier you back then letting her know that that moment is over, finished. Experience is defeated, completed. It no longer exists. Right. Let her know that them doing that not doing had nothing to do with you and everything to do with them not being well. And that you didn't need them to be there in order for you to make it through it and be okay to get out of the hospital to choose a program. Right. Let her know about going to Universal. Let her know about being out of jail. Let her know so that she's getting it. And as she's getting it, what do you notice happening to the earlier you? What happens to her face? She is, isn't she? Then you can open your eyes. Isn't that a good news thing? Right. Isn't it weird? Because normally I have a whole bunch of feelings about that. Now I'm thinking about I'm not having this feelings.
[30:56] B: Kind of changing my point.
[30:57] A: Of view 1 literally. Isn't it interesting? Yeah. Right. You're getting free cuz you're seeing it clearly. It was being read through the filter of it must be me. But we could look back and see a whole bunch of up they've done along the way and go wait a minute. No, that's not all me. That's.
[31:18] B: It's definitely not me.
[31:21] A: Definitely not me. Not a good news thing. Got it. Right. And that's one. Right. And that's just a small little. Because here's the cool part. We're able to. Once the ball is moving and your brain knows what we're doing, more and more gets cleared and you don't have to go through each and every and all experiences that somebody's ever gone Through. Right. If somebody was molested by their uncle a bunch of times when they were a kid from like age 7 to 12, do we have to go through every single time that it happened? No, we might want to go through a couple. But the brain knows how to generalize. It's kind of like when you learned how to tie a pair of sneakers once you mastered how to do it and now they got you a different color and they go, let me show you how to do these. You went, no, no, no, I got it. Yeah, but these are green. You learned on white. Yeah, okay, I know how to do the laces. Does that make sense? So your brain is going to be able to generalize and we're going to get a whole bunch of stuff clear so that when we're done, you're not having the night terror. Because there are three, maybe four major things that people tell me time and time and time and time again in terms of what they notice that's different and better when we're done. One, the stuff that used to really bother them, it's not bothering them at all. Meaning any of that past up where there's been any of the strong emotions, the anger, the hurt, the grief, the guilt, the shame, the regret, the remorse, the. Right. That's not like. It's not. They're not feeling that. That's one thing they tell me. And then what they tell me is that in their day to day life, the intensity in which they used to get thrown into it's way, way, way less the frequency in which it used to happen, which is, is way, way, way less the duration in which it used to last. Again, way, way, way less. So that even if there are things that it doesn't happen as often, it doesn't spike as much and even if it does, it doesn't last as long. So that's what you're going to notice about all sorts of things. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So, questions for me? Well, I'm really excited because I think we're going to make a huge difference and make lots and lots of stuff way, way, way better, hopefully and truly. Yeah. Again, I love that you say hopefully.
[33:42] B: Sorry, I'm kind of sarcastic.
[33:43] A: No, it's so perfect. But it's perfect because with everything else it would be a hopefully. Yeah, right.
[33:50] B: I've just had bad experience with therapists.
[33:53] A: I know, but not this time.
[33:54] B: I grew up in therapy.
[33:56] A: Oh, I'm so sorry.
[33:58] B: I'm sorry, Tim.
[33:59] A: Really sorry.
[34:01] B: It's not better.
[34:02] A: Right. That's because they didn't know how to do what you needed done. Right. How hard was what we just did about that? Not hard. Didn't take a long time. We did it in the first time we met. Right. You hadn't done that in therapy. Right. And the next time we're going to get together, we're going to have a chunk of time, like a few hours, like, all at once, and we're gonna get the whole thing, and you're gonna leave. You're gonna be like, oh, me so much better.
[34:33] B: Okay.
[34:34] A: Yeah. Cool. Cool. All right. Time to go. Because you got to make sure that you get to where you're going, and I don't want to be the reason that you're late.
[34:40] B: What time is it?
[34:41] A: 1:52. So we are at.
