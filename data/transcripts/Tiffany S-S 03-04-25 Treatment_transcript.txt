[00:00] A: Today is the 4th of March, and Tiffany, we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:17] B: Yes.
[00:18] A: Okay, cool. So I'm really curious, how did our last session leave you? What did you notice for yourself when you think about the thing that we talked about? What do you notice as you think about that now?
[00:34] B: I don't remember what we talked about.
[00:39] A: I'll read it to you. So the time that you went to the hospital after ODing and died and was brought back to life and there was like six months and no family came to visit. And that experience, when you think about that. Oh, you are so. When you think about that, it doesn't have the same feelings.
[01:00] B: I mean, it doesn't. It doesn't.
[01:03] A: It does and it doesn't. How so? I'm curious. That's great.
[01:06] B: It's hard to explain now. I'm kind of like, eh, it is what it is.
[01:09] A: You are kind of like. Which is different than you used to be about it.
[01:12] B: Yeah, I guess.
[01:13] A: Isn't that interesting because you weren't used to. You weren't like, eh, about.
[01:16] B: It so sucks.
[01:19] A: Well, it did suck. Certainly having gone through that and not having had them there did suck. Right. We don't take any of that suckiness that you went through away, but now it's not feeling so sucky, even though it sucked, then just trying to move past it isn't that interesting? Yeah. And the reason that it's not feeling so sucky is that your brain didn't know that sucky event ended, that you made it through it, that you're okay. And when our emotional brain gets that it's information, that it's data, that it's over, the feeling, the strong emotion that was attached to it simply dissipates. It goes away because it's not there because it wants us to feel bad. It's there to get us to do something, to get something to stop, to solve the problem. It's a weird thing that our brain does, right? So that thing doesn't have the same feeling tones that it did. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah. That is a much bigger person than the time. The one you had last time.
[02:32] B: You're very observant.
[02:33] A: The one that you had last time was this tiny little, like, hippie bag, which I'm not sure what you could fit in there because there's a diamond. Not my bad, right? This is much better. You can actually.
[02:43] B: I brought my day book in here. Makeup in here, Right? Pens, pencils.
[02:51] A: You got your. Yeah. You got like a. Yeah, much better. Right?
[02:56] B: The other one, I could hold nothing in.
[02:58] A: Nothing.
[02:58] B: Still carrying everything around, right? Strengthful.
[03:03] A: Much better. I like it. That's why I carry a backpack with me. So I can fit a bunch of stuff in it.
[03:08] B: Yeah, I usually have one, but myself.
[03:11] A: Yeah, whatever I need, I have with me.
[03:13] B: It's very helpful.
[03:14] A: Chargers, other kinds of things that you don't always use, but you might need them at some point. Yeah.
[03:20] B: I always wonder why they only made purses for girls and not boys. And then you started seeing guys with their man purses, and I was like, nope. And now I get it.
[03:27] A: That's why the guy with the fanny pack on.
[03:32] B: Yes. I'm like, no, that's not. It's not cute. It does not look good. Still.
[03:37] A: Still?
[03:37] B: Yeah. Just carry a book bag.
[03:39] A: Yeah, it's easier.
[03:41] B: Oh, but it says Gucci. So it's cute.
[03:43] A: No, no, not really. Not at all. The name on it makes it cool, but not. Not look good.
[03:49] B: What's on your ankle?
[03:51] A: This. This is a thing called Apollo Neuro. So Apollo nerves or something. Apollo Neuro is an app. It's a.
[04:02] B: Where it measures all your steps and all that stuff.
[04:03] A: It doesn't do that. I'll show you.
[04:06] B: There's so much stuff happening.
[04:08] A: So hold on to that. This thing does vibes. Vibes are things that you are wanting to. Let's see. So if I wanted to do. How am I feeling? So any of these things will vibrate that in a certain way. So let's say we wanted to focus. And it says, filters out distractions and settles your nerves for clear, calm, focus. Other uses pre athletic performance presentations. Productivity. To relieve headaches or mild nausea. We press play. And this will make vibration.
[05:01] B: That's supposed to help you focus.
[05:03] A: That vibration will help you focus. If we go to a different one, like, let's say we want to be social. It vibes in a different way. Isn't that interesting?
[05:19] B: Does it work?
[05:21] A: You know, I played around with this for a while and I think it will tell you in here, I got 16 minutes extra of sleep by having that on throughout the day. Interesting, right? Any time that I can get more sleep will be great.
[05:40] B: What's it called again?
[05:41] A: It's called Apollo Neuro.
[05:43] B: Apollo Neuro.
[05:44] A: Never heard of it. Yeah, it's a. It's. I don't know. I get into all Those, like, things that could come out and be neat and try them on. Of course, everybody thinks it's an ankle bracelet, but.
[05:56] B: No, I know. I've had an ankle monitor.
[05:59] A: You knew it wasn't that because you had a personal experience.
[06:04] B: Yeah.
[06:08] A: Yeah. So that's what that is.
[06:10] B: Interesting.
[06:10] A: Yeah.
[06:11] B: I like stuff like that, though. Sometimes they work, right?
[06:15] A: They're different. Like, how does it work? Does it work? Does it do the thing? This has it so that the phone will do it, too. And put the same vibes in a phone. Right. Like, you can not have it on that. And you can. It'll just be vibrating the phone in the same way.
[06:45] B: Interesting.
[06:47] A: Yeah. So somehow they've done research on that. The different kinds of vibration causes different things within your body and. Yeah, I figure if it gets me 16 more minutes of sleep, that's got to be a good thing, right?
[07:04] B: Every extra minute counts.
[07:07] A: Yeah. Yeah, for sure.
[07:08] B: Especially when you're busy.
[07:10] A: Right? Exactly. Yeah. So. So I know that, like, there's a whole bunch of stuff that has happened that we want to get the impact that it's had gone. But I'm also curious, how have things been and what kind of surfaces to the top? You said that you're now talking to Mom. What surfaces that would be useful for me to know and what we're wanting our time to do for you, because we got a good chunk of time, and I'm thinking we can make a really big difference. And I'm excited about that.
[07:39] B: Well, I'm, like, ready to pop off.
[07:41] A: Oh, good.
[07:42] B: Where I'm at.
[07:42] A: Well, tell me more. I want to understand. I'm just frustrated, like, how so a.
[07:47] B: Lot of stuff is going on. Like, they have a stupid point system. So, like, every phase is supposed to be a certain amount. Every two points you lose is one day you're held back for phasing up.
[07:58] A: Got it.
[07:59] B: You know, if you lose 15 points in one phase, you're automatically held back two weeks on top of however much time. Which if it's 15 points, that's already a week. So a week plus two weeks is almost a month that you're automatically being held back. And I'm not trying to do all that.
[08:17] A: And so you're trying to get out as quickly as you can.
[08:19] B: Yeah. This is a stage of my life. I'm trying to move past it.
[08:23] A: Yeah.
[08:23] B: You know, like, I'm court order on top of it. So I can't leave. Like, I'm just like. I mean, it's not.
[08:29] A: So you can't leave even if you get held back.
[08:31] B: But I mean, it's not a good idea for me to leave, but it's.
[08:34] A: Not a good idea for you to leave.
[08:35] B: I don't want to get hold back in the program. And I don't like the point system because I feel like they'd be power tripping and like do it just because they can. And they sit there just to with you.
[08:44] A: Yeah.
[08:45] B: And they'd be like, you don't have to be perfect. But by the way, if you're not perfect, point. And they're like, well, point is not a punishment. Like, then what is it? It's definitely a punishment. Like there's no other way to define it. It is a punishment. No matter what way you try and sugarcoat it, it's a freaking punishment. Just say what it is. Don't try and deceive me. People deceive me my whole life if you can't lie to me. I know what. I know what it is. We all know what it is. It's a punishment, you know, but it's just frustrating. Like, people are sitting back saying, we don't have to be perfect. As soon as you're not perfect. Point. You know, like, so it's just very.
[09:17] A: What have you been getting points about?
[09:19] B: Stupid things.
[09:20] A: And then I might be a stupid thing that you get a point on.
[09:24] B: Like, so now they have the other girls that are in the higher phases going around checking chores instead of staff.
[09:30] A: Okay.
[09:30] B: And if you don't, if you miss something in your chore point. Well, the way they explained it is they're supposed to go around. We say, check our chores at 9pm they're supposed to go around before 9pm and if they see anything you haven't done, have you correct it? And as long as you correct it, you don't lose a point. Well, they're just skipping that part and just checking the chores. Oh, you didn't do it. Point. You know, and then like, that's frustrating because they're not even doing how they're supposed to be doing it for one and for two, now they're being stickler because then they told the girls who are checking the chores. By the way, if we feel like you're doing favoritism, then you're gonna lose two points automatically. And so now they're being like, stickler and they're paranoid about not doing it right. Because then they lose even more points. So now everybody's losing points for Troys and they're not even checking it right. And it's just, I'm so frustrated and over it. And then there's a staff member. She took, like, four points from me.
[10:22] A: All at one time in, like, a day. All in one day.
[10:26] B: I lost four points in one day.
[10:28] A: What happened?
[10:29] B: Pissed. Because, like, so first of all, like, two weeks ago, she, like, we had got food from the Compassion center, and I was in the middle of cooking.
[10:43] A: When it came in.
[10:44] B: Yeah, when it came in. And they were like, well, if you don't go out and help, then bring in the food, you're gonna get in trouble. I liter had the stove running. It was like putting food on the stove. So I just left it. And I had my plate sitting right next to the stove. And, like, I had left my plate out because another one of the workers, like, I was eating, and she was like, well, she's like, it's not a big deal. Just leave it out and come back to it. And I was like, okay, fine. Because I was like, I don't want to get in trouble. No, it's fine. I said, it's fine. I was like, okay. Well, then another staff member came in, one I'm having issues with, and another one of the residents was just, like, trying to hurry up and get it done because, like, bringing the food in, and she wasn't paying attention. And she knocked my plate off the table, and it shattered and broke everywhere. And she just turns around and she snapped. Who did that? Why was somebody leaving on the counter?
[11:30] A: What?
[11:31] B: You're the one that wasn't paying attention to what you were doing. Like, what are you talking about? And then the staff member turned around and goes, well, whoever played that is. They lost a point. Like, what? You just walked in. You don't even know what's going on. Like, So I was, like, pissed off, but she called me out in front of everybody else, was like, you lose a point. First of all, they're not supposed to do that. You're not supposed to call other people out in front of other residents. You're supposed to pull somebody aside. So then she apologized for outburst and said, I'm not going to take a point, and I'm not. I was like, yeah, because you were wrong. Like, you know, she acknowledged. Yeah, and then. But then now she's turned around. She's done the same exact thing two more times. And, like, she, like, snapped at me in front of everybody and said she was taking a point. And, like, I walked away. I was like, I, like. But what frustrated me is she took a point because, like, they were saying I was giving them pushback or Whatever. Like, you can't have any opinion about anything. If they tell you something, you just have to say, okay and walk away. That's it. No opinion is allowed. Very frustrating. Whatever. I'll bite my tongue. So I said, okay, that's fine. I started to walk away. Well, that was the end of the conversation. I was walking away, and she asked me a question. And so I go to answer the question, and she asked me another question, and I answer that, and that tells me I'm doing a pushback. I'm like, what? I was like, I was trying to walk away. Like, what are you talking about? And so, like, I was like, okay, that's fine. Whatever. I'm walking away. And then she follows me into the other room and was like. And so I.
[12:57] A: Sounds like she was having a shitty day. I'm not.
[12:59] B: That's what I'm like, what. What are you. What is your issue? Why are you, like, singling me out? And, like, I thought it was just in my head, but a couple of the other girls were like, man, she's really just been picking on you lately. I'm like, okay, well, that's reassuring. It's not in my own head, you know? And, like, if other people can see it, then it's not just him.
[13:15] A: Yeah.
[13:15] B: It's not just in my head. And so I. I went to my case manager today about it because I'm like, dude, this has sent me over the edge, bro. Because, like, for one, I'm a perfectionist. I'm working on not being a perfectionist. But, like, she took four points from me in, like, a day, bro, and, like, that was not necessary. And, you know, like, that's why the.
[13:33] A: Point thing bothers you.
[13:34] B: Yeah. And it's, like, irritating me because I feel like people abuse it and they, like, power trip over it.
[13:39] A: Okay.
[13:40] B: You know? And it's just frustrating. Like, she's the newest staff member that's there, and it's like, she never apologized. She called me out twice in front of people, and then I, like, I had walked away. She followed me in the other room, and I was upset, you know, because she was telling me she's taking a point for me.
[13:54] A: Yeah.
[13:54] B: And then, like. And I was like, well, I'm upset. Can I please have a couple minutes and then we can talk? She was like, oh, can you please come out and talk with me? I'm like, I'm upset. Can you please give me a couple minutes? That's why I walked away. And she goes, well, I guess that's another point. I'M like, what? I was like, are you freaking kidding me? Because I'm upset, and I asked for a couple of minutes, you know, and so then I went outside. And then, like, I'm like, whatever, bro. Well, at the end of the night, she comes up to me. Oh, I take that back. It was like, four points in two days, not one day. And then she goes, yeah, well, I'm have to take two points from you because of that. And then, like, I was really upset, and I, like, stuck my feet in the pool, and she came to try and talk to me again. Lady, just leave me the alone. You know what I mean? Like, stop bothering me. Like, get off my ass. Like, I'm trying to get away from you. Why do you keep following me everywhere? It's so frustrating. And it's like, leave me alone.
[14:49] A: Yeah.
[14:50] B: And, you know, and, like, you can't say anything because I'll get in more trouble. And so I'm like, bottling all of this up. And it's like, I was like, that's.
[14:58] A: Why you said you're about ready to pop?
[14:59] B: Yeah, I was, like, ready to just pop off, bro.
[15:02] A: Even as you're telling me about this stuff, you're kind of.
[15:04] B: Yeah, I'm just, like, frustrated with the whole situation, and I feel like there's nothing I can do about anything. And it feels like no matter what I do, I'm wrong about something. And it's very frustrating.
[15:14] A: I'm, like, really hard for somebody who's a perfectionist. Yeah. Likes to get it right all the time. Like, I'm.
[15:19] B: It's not that. It's just, like, I'm okay with that. I just don't. Like, it's irritating. And it's contradictory when they tell us, oh, it's okay not to be perfect, and then as soon as you're not perfect, point punishment.
[15:30] A: And they're not perfect.
[15:31] B: Yeah, it's like, what? Like, I just don't get it. Like, I don't. I understand areas of growth, but there is, like, they overdo it. You know what I mean? Like, they just overdo it. In my opinion, it's not helping me grow. And ever since that situation, mentally, my brain, I can't focus on anything. It's just messing with me. Like, I can't think clearly. I'm not doing things right.
[15:55] A: Doesn't that suck?
[15:56] B: Yeah. And so now I just, like, continuously been losing, like, one point every day. And now I've lost, like, eight points in a week and a half. And I'm like, I still have five Weeks left in this stupid phase I'm only halfway through. So now I'm like, oh, God, I'm gonna get held back.
[16:09] A: And just, like, even the whole thing, like, oh, jeez. Right?
[16:13] B: Oh, my God. Like, how do I get out of this funk? Like, I've been trying to, and it's not working.
[16:18] A: We'd like to get you out of the funk so that you have more ease in dealing with frustrating stuff. So the frustrating stuff doesn't do this shit to you. Yeah, that would be way better, Tiffany, if what we're doing today gets it so that you've got more ease with that frustrating stuff.
[16:34] B: I'm like, I've left this situation with that lady. Like, I keep walking away from it, and she keeps popping back up. And I'm like. I feel like she's making stuff up. Like, she's, like, made. I can only think of one right now with the looking. Like, I was making sweet tea. And, like, the whole thing. I can't drink hot coffee. It upsets my stomach, like, really bad. Like, I cannot drink hot coffee. So I always do cold coffee wash after eating coffee, and now I drink tea because I feel like it's a cleaner caffeine and I don't crash, and I just like it better. And like I said, coffee upsets my stomach.
[17:04] A: Hot.
[17:05] B: Anyways, so, like, all of a sudden, she's like, oh, well, all the. There's a new. The newest girl. She drinks a lot of coffee. So they're, like, running through coffee now. Like, and I stopped drinking coffee, like, a month ago. Every once in a while, I'll drink it, but, like, I didn't drink it for, like, three weeks. And so, like, how is it that there's, like, twice as much coffee getting used? Like, that girl drinks a lot of coffee, like, whatever. But we consider it because they only buy so much. I mean, I don't grant money, you know, But I mean, like, she said something. She was like, oh, well, you know, we can't do that anymore because people are sneaking coffee. Because the new girl was also sneaking coffee. And then, like, it got. Somebody said something about. I was on seeing coffee. I was like, I have new drink drink coffee in three weeks. Like, what are you talking about? I'm not sneaking anything. But she, like, made something totally up because, like, first of all, she's the lowest man on the totem pole. And she tried saying that. Oh, they're. They were talking about taking the coffee away. First of all, if there was an issue like that, the coordinators would have had A house meeting and talk to everybody. There's a system to this crap. Okay? They wouldn't just tell you and then have you tell everybody.
[18:07] A: That gal, the new gal.
[18:08] B: Yeah.
[18:09] A: Really has gotten under your skin.
[18:11] B: It's the new worker, but she got there, like, a few months before I did.
[18:15] A: But, like, she's really getting under your skin. Yes.
[18:17] B: And it's like, we get along great sometimes, but then she's just. And then she goes on these stupid rants that nobody wants to hear where a situation should not be a big deal. And she goes on and on and on for 10 minutes. Nobody gives a fuck. Shut up. Like, that's what I want to say. And it's like, she'll, like, blow a situation up into something that shouldn't have been, which is what she's done with me the last three times. I'm like, bro, just leave me alone. Like, that's what I want to say. Just leave me alone. Like, I feel like she is trying to get under my skin. I don't know what her deal is, bro, but just leave me alone. Like, that's all I want to say.
[18:47] A: That's what you want to say, but.
[18:48] B: You haven't been saying, but I can't. Oh, I can't. I literally can't. Or it's called push back. Can I get. I get a point taken. So can't have an opinion. And I'm a very opinionated person.
[19:00] A: So isn't it interesting, right? Like, this thing that's going on with her, it's what's going on with her now. But the way that it has happened in your life. There have been lots of other experiences like this with others. Make sense.
[19:18] B: What do you mean?
[19:19] A: Right. She's not the only person that has ever felt like it gives you a hard time. If we look back through life, there have been others development, like. Like, this isn't the first time that I'm experiencing, wow, this is. Right. This is a commonality that goes on. Right? And I say that because there's power in that. And here's what I mean. In life, the lens that we normally look at stuff through is those circumstances, those situations. That stuff makes me feel the way that I'm feeling. When that person says that thing, it does this to me. That person doing that makes me like this. When this guy said that, it did this to me. Guys driving on the road, asshole cuts in front of him, slams on his brakes. He's mad. What made him mad? Asshole who cut in front of me, right? Normal lenses, we say stuff Causes feelings past, current, future. That lens is not wrong. It just gives us limited power because from that lens we only have two choices. We either try to change it or we try to get the hell away from it. But you've already discovered with this stuff is that I can't always change it and I can't fucking get away from it. Right, Tiffany? So we need to do something else with it. That's where we're going to come in today. Adjusting how the brain reacts and responds to it. So changing the relationship to it so that that stuff doesn't get under your skin like it has been. We still might not like it, but I got more space from it.
[20:50] B: It's just building up.
[20:51] A: It's like, I get that.
[20:52] B: That's what I'm chasing me and I can't get away from it.
[20:55] A: I know, that's what I mean. That's the thing that has. It's building up because it's not just that person, it's accumulation of stuff. That's why we call it build up. Right. We want to get that cleared and gone so that in those situations, people doing that doesn't affect you. Like it has been that you've got more space with it and more room to breathe that in you, you're more settled and measured.
[21:28] B: Like, I feel fine when, like, I'm away from her.
[21:30] A: Of course she's going, okay, yes.
[21:32] B: But then it's just like, I don't know, like now I'm like stuck in a funk and I'm. That's right.
[21:37] A: And isn't the interesting thing you didn't choose to get in the funk? So what if you're not the problem? You don't actually like being in the funk.
[21:48] B: I don't.
[21:49] A: I know, I get that about you. So. But. And you didn't choose to do it, so then who did it? Something that your brain did to you in response to that stuff caused you to be in the funk. In the same way, it's not the lion that makes the zebra scared, it's the zebra's brain. Yes. In response to lion coming. But it's totally the zebra's brain that's making the zebra alert, motivated and stronger to get it to run away. Right. So from that same kind of lens, what makes me feel the way that I feel, feel is something my brain does to me, even if it does it in response to the stuff. And what we want to set up in you is that you've got more space and room and freedom and ease in dealing with that stuff. So that emotionally it's experienced as being about them, not me. Right? Because a lot of it, you know, up here, because you're super bright, that it's not my, it's their. You said that earlier, like, you totally get it. But in the moment that it's happening at a feeling level, it somewhat feels like it is my. It feels like it is about me. Do you follow me with that? That's the part that we want shifted so that that's not running in you anymore.
[23:12] B: It's like my brain either wants to fix it or leave it.
[23:17] A: Those are the two things. That's how we deal with most stuff. Change, fix, get the hell away from it if I can. The third dimension is adjusting how the back brain, that automatic emotional, unconscious brain, reacts and responds to this stuff so that the same stuff going on doesn't press those same buttons at me. Right? The idea in life is we can't get rid of the people that press our buttons because as soon as we get rid of one, there's a freaking long line of them ready to press the same damn buttons. And like, what the hell? I just got rid of that one. Now there's another one, right? So instead we want to do the opposite. We want to go inside and unplug the buttons so then even if they're pressed, it doesn't cause that running of that programming in you make sense. So that's why I'm seeing a you where that kind of stuff with that this you. She remembers having all of that, that it asks her to get it. It's like she would know how to get it. She's clear, she's seeing that stuff clearly for what it is. And she's got room in between her and the stuff makes sense so that she feels more spacious and spacious inside. The you that I'm seeing is a lot lighter so that she can do things in a way that's good enough. And it doesn't always have to be perfect. Did you know that in order to pass a medical exam to become a doctor, that it's not the highest scores, it's a minimum competency test. You just have to pass, right? The standard is. Whatever the standard is, it doesn't matter what you get beyond that, you just have to pass. It's a minimum competency test. Isn't that weird? We're always striving to get to the thing, huh? For any degree. Same thing with the bar for attorneys. It's minimum competency and you just have to be just above minimum competency to pass.
[25:22] B: I Guess I'll be there.
[25:27] A: Yeah. So think of you. Who's lighter and is more okay and comfortable in her own skin and free from the effect that the past stuff has had, whether it be recent past or long time ago past, whether it be past of things that she's done or things that happened to her. We want the impact that that stuff has continued to have on you. Gone. So the weight is lifted. Got it. So that you're much more okay, you're lighter and then in your day to day interactions there's more ease. Last little part before we move forward. What would be useful for me to know around now you're talking with mom again. How has that been? What's that been like for you? Her like I'm curious. Your face is so perfect. Okay. I can't wait to hear.
[26:26] B: We haven't talked that much. I don't know, it's just like kind of annoying because whenever I talk to her, like I literally have to be like, can I say something please? Like, Cuz she'll just go on and on and on and on about random stupid things. And then it was frustrating cuz I got a hold of her so I could get a hold of my daughter. And then like I was like, well, can you please send me pictures of her? And she's like, well, I have to talk with Stephen, which is my child's father. And I'm like, why would you have to check with him? It's my daughter. You know, I'm like, I have these pictures on my Facebook too, so I could just go get them. It's just I have to go through staff to do that. So you can either make this easy or more difficult. And she still hasn't sent me the pictures. So I'm gonna have to go on my Facebook staff and get it the pictures of my kids so I can see pictures of my own daughter. And I'm just frustrated because she's like, oh, I don't even really talk to him anymore. Oh, that's great. So you don't even really have contact with my daughter. And that was disappointing. It kind of didn't surprise me though. I don't know. And it's just like it's always like.
[27:32] A: A letdown like when you talk to mom.
[27:35] B: Yeah, yeah. Like it's never, hey, how are you doing?
[27:40] A: What a great conversation we had. Wow. I feel really bonded to you. It's not that, like, not at all.
[27:47] B: Not at all. And it's just like why I was not pushing to talk to her because it's always a letdown, I guess. I don't know. I'm just to the point where I'm like.
[27:57] A: So there's like a hope that this time, because I'm different, this time mom will be different. And I keep getting mom the same.
[28:07] B: Way, the same way since I've known.
[28:10] A: That's like the letdown.
[28:11] B: She's not a biological mom. She's my doctor mom I adopted when I was 13. But yeah, we've just never, like, been close like that. Like, I feel like they've never really known how to deal with me, even before I had a drug addiction.
[28:24] A: Sure.
[28:25] B: And so then that just like.
[28:28] A: Right. And notice how because you're feeling like they didn't know how to deal with you, that also feels a little bit like somehow that must have been something to do with you.
[28:43] B: Well, it's hard not to feel that way.
[28:45] A: Did you get it?
[28:45] B: No one's been consistent your whole life except you.
[28:50] A: I've been pretty consistent with you. I mean, you can't get away from you too. Right? You're going wherever you are.
[28:57] B: You got a choice, right?
[29:00] A: Yeah. So we want the effect of those things to be lifted because there's been hope that they'd be different or it'd be different, and we keep getting the same thing. And that, like, has been making you feel bad.
[29:17] B: It honestly doesn't even like. Yeah, it lets me down, but I'm so used to it.
[29:21] A: Yeah, but you just said still sucks. But it does suck. Right. But there's a way that it's framed that I'm let down versus, you know, I'm expecting that's all that she's capable of. See, the. The problem with this one, and we're gonna get this shifted for you, is that it's not being experienced as that's all she's capable of. It's being experienced as if I was X, Y, or Z, then she would be.
[29:58] B: No, because it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how I am. She's always the same. And I need to remember that.
[30:05] A: Correct. It doesn't matter how you are. She's always the same. But you haven't been viewing it as her limitation. You've been viewing it as somehow that means something about my worth, lovability, good enoughness and such. We want to get that shifted so you're more at peace in you. We really want you to be more okay in you, right where you're at so that you feel really centered and grounded and good in you and that you're doing the right things and that you're taking the right actions. And it's not about getting through a program. It's about I'm doing stuff to change my life for the better so that I get to have a better life than I had. And that comes through going through programming. But that's not what I'm doing, is just getting through programming. I. My interest for you, Tiffany, really, is I want you to have a life that so works for you and that you're so, like, good in you and so vastly different from where you came from. Right. That's what I'm intending. That's what I'm wanting for you. Right. And, yeah, that may be through programming, but then I'm not so tied into. Oh, it's got to be in a certain amount of days that instead I'm into because, like, I want to be a better version of me. Like, I want life to work better for me. Right? You got born into up situations. No fault of your own. You didn't go, hey, let me get into this one. Oh, I got that right. Come on, man. He didn't get to pick. He didn't get to choose, right? So we want to get that whole thing shifted so that we get freedom and we get to be more okay inside and lighter and clearer. Right? So when we look at it from the lens that your brain. Right. Makes you feel bad. First question. Do you really think your brain wants you to feel bad? You know, the thing that beats your heart and breathes for you? Is it really out to get you to want you to feel bad? No, of course not. Do you think it would want you to feel good? And see, that's what most people say is, of course my brain would want me to feel good. But what we've discovered in working with thousands of people over time. You're a really bright gal. I'm a pretty bright guy. But most of our brain emotionally works like the brain of a freaking animal. A rabbit, a donkey, a goat, a sheep, a monkey. And their brain makes them feel to motivate the animal to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. That's it. So what if all the negative emotions we experience. Hurt, anger, sadness, grief, guilt, shame, regret, remorse, angst, upset, worry, pain. What if all those negative emotions are being caused by the same part of our brain that works like an animal to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem? Right. When the squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire, the brain of the squirrel makes the entirety of the Squirrel experience pain, but not because the brain wants the squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid, dumb idiot and be embarrassed because it was too close to the fire and angry at itself because it was careless. And now it's never going to find a mate because it's moored. No, the simpler reason. Get the tail out of the fire. That's the only purpose of the emotion. So that's what's going on in human beings. Our brain makes us feel to motivate us to do something. But here's where the error comes in. We have another part to our brain, this frontal cortex. And with this frontal cortex, it gives us access to time, right? You and I are here right now. You can remember doing something earlier this morning. Heck, we can both think about doing something later today. No other animal on the planet can do that. Really. They're always now. There is no future. There is no past because time is a left hemisphere of the frontal cortex.
[34:16] B: I didn't know that.
[34:17] A: Isn't that crazy? That's why you can't discipline a dog two hours after it pooped in your. Right away, but not two hours later because it's like, what? What are you doing? There's no recollection. It doesn't have memory, right? Those are our two superpowers. We have the ability to remember and we have the ability to imagine. But we abuse them because the things that we remember make us feel like shit. The things we imagine scare the shits out of us, right? But we don't have to use it that way, right? So with this frontal cortex and with access to time, that's where the error comes in. Because animals don't have time. That's not a problem if it's a positive experience or when it's a neutral experience. Because in those two instances, the brain distinguishes the difference between the data and memory and the experience, right? Somebody tells us about a great trip. Maybe they went to Key West. They took the boat from Fort Myers. They got there really quick. While they were there, they rented a moped, they drove around the island, stopped by the sign that said 90 miles from Cuba. They walked up and down Duvall Street. They saw Hemingway's house. They tell us all about it. But you and I both know when they're telling us about it that they know the difference between the memory of being there and actually being there. It's totally clear, right? Somebody's telling us about something that was awful. It's as if they're back in the moment. So the guy's telling us about Getting mugged. And he gets to the part where the guy's got him by the collar and they're. There's a knife at his throat, and his face has gone white and his voice is all choked up and his arms are trembling and he's got a tear, but we're nice people, and we were kindly listening to him. What the hell is happening? And we all go, oh, he's reliving it, but what's really going on is part of his brain is confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience. That's why he's having that reaction, which we can see it when he was talking to us because it was all over his body. But it was also affecting him over the weekend when he was watching some college basketball games. It was under the surface, up here. He knows he's safe. He's with us. He survived. There's no knife. The problem is that that deeper part never got the good news. It doesn't know that moment ended and it froze. That moment at the worst spot where the knife is at the throat. Yesterday, I worked with the guy who was a military guy, and he was in Vietnam. And one of the moments that came up was they got ambushed. And the memory literally went like this. It was like images. He saw the guy, the guy was running at him. The guy was on top of him, and it stopped. That's what froze. Right? So they get ambushed. He sees a guy run at him, and he's thinking he's gonna get killed. This guy, Amber tackled him. He's on top of him. Right. He didn't never finish the story. So you'll notice with a lot of troubling experiences that we go through, the story stops at the worst timing, at the worst part. That would have been the worst part, Right. And that's what looped on him. Image, image, image on top of me make sense? So we needed to connect it to his buddy shooting the guy, him getting him off of him, them surviving the ambush, him later on playing golf at St. Andrews, of all things. Right. Like. Because that's what's happening with our brain, is that when we go through particularly troubling experiences, emotionally, the brain short circuits and doesn't know it ended, even though all of me up here does. And that's why it stays on.
[38:10] B: My water bottle is leaking.
[38:11] A: How does that happen with a water bottle like that?
[38:14] B: Yeah, yeah.
[38:16] A: There's Kleenex there. I don't know.
[38:20] B: I'm like, what is going on?
[38:21] A: Right. That's weird. Who would have thought? You just can't you know, pour it in your mouth very well. I know. Right.
[38:34] B: Hand sanitizer by chance.
[38:37] A: No, my hands are all sticky now. They are.
[38:41] B: Cuz there's tea in it.
[38:43] A: Oh well. Go to the bathroom.
[38:47] B: I don't know what's going on with this stupid thing.
[38:49] A: I'll be right back.
[38:50] B: They have me and. Right in the front.
[38:52] A: Yeah. It. Yeah. So isn't it weird that that's like our brain makes us feel to get us to do something, to get something to stop to solve a problem, not for why we think we feel? Isn't that weird? Right? And there aren't any anxious elephants or resentful rhinoceroses in the world. There are no guilty buffalo. Right. They don't have those afflictions. But we do, right? Because we can imagine alternative outcomes to stuff that's already over, right. We can wish it hadn't. Like we can do all sorts of things that animals can't do, Right.
[40:00] B: Dogs are so happy.
[40:01] A: I know, right. And right. Exactly. Layered into that though, Tiffany, is that when we're little, right, the training up from birth to about age 7, right. Little kids are trained to believe that good happens because they're good. You get praise, you get presents, you get candy, you get love, you get cookies, you get hugs because you're good, right? And we hear it said, you're a good boy, you're a good girl, right? So they think my identity is good things happen when I'm good because I'm good, good things happen, which is great if life is always good. Unfortunately, I don't know anybody where life's been nothing but good. We all have fucked up shit, some more than others, some in bigger ways than others. But there's not a single one of us that hasn't had fucked up shit along the way, right? And the problem is if I learned that good happens because I'm good, bad must only happen because I'm good. Bad or it's bad means something about my lovability or whether I was good enough or wanted, cared for has something to do with me, right? Because when we're growing up, everything is about me. And it's my world that everybody else lives in. And sometimes that can create anxiety because I'm worried about what others might be thinking about me. Not realizing that they're not spending much time thinking about me because they're thinking about them just like I'm thinking about about me, right? So. But everything becomes about me. So if it's bad, it means that there's something bad in me. Right. So the guy who got molested by his uncle feels like somehow that was his fault, even though he logically knows none of it had anything to do with him at all. It had to do with Uncle. He knows some of it felt good, not because he wanted it, but because the body touched in that way is designed to feel. He knows all of that, but inside there's still that guilt, shame, hurt, pain. And that's because that deeper brain never got updated, never got the good news that it ended. So we have really old programs that are running us. Does that make sense? And we want to update to the current time so we're not there anymore, Right? Because even when you just think a little bit about some of that stuff, it's almost as if you're there again. Right? And what I want you to be is here with me because I'm at least a little more fun, I'm hoping, than sucking. Right? Because with those things active, that's why our brain scan sorts and searches for anything that's similar to anything that we went through that was painful. But similar gets confused as identical. Right? That's the thing that happens all the time. So I get a whiff of the diesel from the tanker that was filling up the gas station and I flash back to my buddy who got his hand shot. Now, the issue with that experience during that time, the thing that was troubling was not the smell of diesel, but my buddy's hand. But because they happened at the same time, they got merged. Make sense. So that's where we're going to be unplugging. The effect that that stuff has so that you're not finding yourself so freaking frustrated and annoyed all the time. Time with the ineptitudes of the freaking people not doing the things that they should do in the right ways that they should be doing it. Because the thing that keeps frustrating hearing a lot of the frustrations has to do with like the inequities and they're not doing it like they're supposed to be doing it and not doing how I would want them to do it. Like, it's frustrating that mom just wouldn't give me the freaking picture. Right? Like, right? Or it's frustrating that she wouldn't just give me space. Right? Like, so we want to get it so that. Because we can't always change the stuff, but the stuff has been pressing buttons in you, and those buttons have been making you feel frustrated. So that we're going to unplug the buttons so that you've got more ease in dealing with difficult shit, this doesn't trigger you like it has been. And then you have access to your wisdom. Right. Because when we get thrown into higher emotional states, we get also thrown into lower intellectual intelligence states. Right. When people are emotional, they're dumb because the emotional part of the brain that's running us is about at the same logical level as a three or four. Four year old. You follow me with that? Yeah. Any questions about any of that stuff? Okay. So again, as we're organizing, we see the you who's much more emotionally present and grounded and okay, experiencing other people's stuff as being about them. So she's got distance and space and is able to maneuver it better for herself. The effect that the past stuff has had have been lifted, light and cleared and gone. So that the you that I'm seeing is much more present and okay and excited about directing and organizing to have a better life than she's had. Right. Because she's worth it. That's the you that I'm seeing gets it that you're totally worth it to you. That's right. And this is where we're headed. Got it. And that question isn't the how it's going to happen, it's would it be okay with you? Would it be okay to be the way I just described? Of course. Yeah. See, I know we got a green light. It's awesome. And with the green light, we're going to do processes that organize the brain. So again, just like before, you slightly lower the jaw, you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth and then you intentionally breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and then a little bit longer on the way out. And see, what's happening is you're bringing awareness to breath. That's right. So good. And see, when you bring awareness to breath, you can intentionally breathe differently than automatically breath breathing. Right. Because if you're focused on it, your awareness is on it. And what we know about awareness is energy flows where attention goes. So if I have attention and awareness, I'm bringing more energy towards it. So it has to be happening in a different way. And when it starts to happen in a different way, it starts to alter your state of consciousness and body begins to become more in a resting state. And we want body to be in a resting state because rest accelerates healing. Cold flu surgery, get rest. Got it. So again, as your jaw is slightly lowered and you're resting your tongue and you're breathing intentionally slower and deeper on the way in, longer on the on the way out. Notice that you can look across and see me and my nose. Stay looking at my nose. As you see my fingers, my fingers are going to move out, but you stay looking at my nose so that now with the sides of your eyes, you pick up my fingers wiggling, which means as you do, you become more aware of the space in the room. And when you're aware of the space in the room, you notice it between us and beyond me, under and behind you, to either side and up above. And again, as you check in with your body, as you're noticing more space, how's your body starting to feel now?
[48:17] B: It works every time.
[48:19] A: It works every time? Yeah. So what are you noticing? How's it feeling now? Well, what's fine mean? It does feel a little more relaxed, doesn't it? Yeah, a little bit. Of course. Right? That's how it works.
[48:33] B: Yeah.
[48:33] A: Yeah. So a little more relaxed. And then I just want you to think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something that's just beautiful. Like the moment you're looking at it, it's like captured your awareness and you're like in the. Wow. What is it that you see?
[48:50] B: The mountains of Colorado.
[48:52] A: Yeah. And isn't there a moment that as you're seeing those mountains, you're filled with that all wonder, excitement. And some people would tell you, well, duh, Tiffany, seeing those are going to give you that kind of feeling. But if we looked at it differently, we could say that being there and seeing it, the experience of it, actually drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what if at your center you always are peaceful and excited in the same way. I'm at the campfire because I'm cold and I bring my hands towards the flames and then I say to you, holy cow, the fire's getting hotter. Is the fire actually getting any hotter? No, I'm becoming more aware of the heat. Right. So we know that in your life there have been many occurrences, many occasions, many situations where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Upsets, stressors, hurts, pains, resentments, frustrations. But no matter where awareness has been, then what if at your center you're always peaceful and excited in the same way? You know, two of us are in here, honey. You know, you look around, your senses bring in data that's intellectual knowledge. We call knowledge light. We'll call it light of knowledge at your center.
[50:05] B: Oh yes, I'm yawning now.
[50:07] A: I know it's a brighter light, right? You are yawning your system Is downregulating. Isn't that a good news thing?
[50:13] B: Yes.
[50:14] A: Yeah, it is a good news thing. Right. Because that's what we want to not have to always be is so darn up tight we want to loosen so that we're able to move the flow a little bit easier. Makes sense. Instead of hard edges and hard lines, we want to. We're not etch A sketches. Is that what they are? Remember the thing that you could draw in the sand kind of thing? I think it's called an Etch a Sketch. But they were, like, hard edges. Yeah. You didn't get it to curve.
[50:42] B: It's, like, impossible to curve it.
[50:44] A: Right. We want you to have more flow. Got it. Which is great. That's starting to happen in your body now. Right, right. So we think of that as light of knowledge at your center. That's a brighter light. That's light of wisdom. So now we've got knowledge and wisdom. And I work with all sorts of people, and you know that. I remember working with this one girl. She had an lots of awful stuff happening, but one of the things her older brother did is he took Matchbox cars and would drive them up her leg and then park them in her. So she had a Around all of that. But when we worked together, Tiffany, we cleared it all out. Like, all the hurt, the pain, the upset, the anger, gone. And so she was sitting across from me. There was this glow of, like, wow. And I asked her the question. I go, know all that? Ugh. I go, where was it? And she's like, it's gone. I don't feel any of it anymore. And he said, isn't that cool? And she goes, totally. I go, but the question was, where was it? And I started asking her question. I go, was it at the surface level? She's like, it wasn't intellectual. I said, oh, maybe it was hiding in your center. And she's like, really? How could that stuff survive in the light where I'm peaceful and excited? And so I asked her the question again. I go, well, then, where was it? And this is what she said. She says, well, all that stuff, it was hiding in the shadows in between the lights. I said, well, what happened? She says, the lights are touching, the shadows are gone. And I went, whoa, isn't that cool? And she's like, yeah. And then we started talking about how people tend to screw up identity all the time, thinking of the way that they feel, what they do, as if that's who they are. And one of the big ways we over identify Is lots of people walk around thinking that I am my body. I mean, I'm in it, but most people are thinking it's me. But what if, Tiffany, you have a body, it's totally yours, and it's the one that you're in. But what if your body's not you? What if it's yours, not you? And I say that because my mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident when she was younger. And when she visits people now, they don't say to her, hey, Susie, I'm glad almost all of you could come over today, right? They don't say that to her because all of her is there, even if that part of her body is missing. So you have a body, it's totally yours, but it isn't actually you, which is weird to think. And then we go, well, wait a minute. If I'm thinking that, am I the thinker of my thought or is my brain, see, what if you're not the thinker of your thoughts? What if your brain is the thinker of your thoughts and you totally have a brain and it's totally yours, but your brain is also not you. Your brain is an organ, not the one that played the lightning game, but an organ like your heart and your liver and your lungs. It's also yours, not you, which is a weird thought. So then we go, well, you're not your body, you're not your brain, you're not your thoughts. Oh, well, maybe you're how you feel. Except you feel different ways at different times, don't you? Angry, annoyed, happy, sad, frustrated. You're you regardless of how you're feeling. Which is another weird thought. So if you're not what you do, if you're not how you feel, maybe you're what you do. But of course you've done that and that and that. And when you stop doing this to do that, you didn't stop existing, right? You've done this thing. You might have worked there. You lived at this. When you stopped doing those things, you didn't stop existing. So the weirder question becomes, if you're not what you do, and if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not your feelings, and if you're not your body, then what the heck are you? It's a weird thought. So I'm going to give you a way to think of it just for a moment, because what if who you are is what you became aware of as you see the mountains in Colorado? See, what if in that moment, your Awareness was drawn in to experience that capital S self, that light at the center, which people in religious circles call it my soul. But let's not think of your soul as something you have. Let's think of your fingers and your toes as things you have. Let's think of that light as you and see, what if, Tiffany, the light that is you can't get touched or hurt or harmed, is already whole and complete and can only experience the love that it allows in with respect. That's a weird thought. See, what if who you really are can't be touched in those ways? And I say that because people, again, screw up identity. I go to the dentist. I'm upset. You go, why are you so upset? I go, you'll never believe what the jerk did to me. You go, what did he do? I go, well, the first thing he did is he put me on a chair that immediately my head starts going back and down and my feet start coming up in the air. And that is an unconscious, comfortable position. And you're like, but you're at the dentist. Well, then he takes this light thing on top of me, flips it on, puts it right in my eyes. I can't see anything like, you're at the dentist. Then I go, well, then he took this cold instrument and shoved it up inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness. And you're what, Tiffany? My mouth? I'm at the freaking dentist. But do you know that that's the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother in the Matchbox car? I said, when you were really little, he messed with your stuff. And she looked at me and she said, he did. And for a long time, that screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings. And then she looked at me and she had that again smile. And she goes, but you know what? Why? She goes, he never touched me. He messed with my body, but he never got me. And I went, whoa, that's powerful, right? Because every single cell that you're made up of, one year from today would be different if you and I, neuroscientists have proven that if we came back a year from today, 99.99999999 of the subatomic particles that are making us up would no longer be here. They don't all leave it once. It's like Star Trek, but all you are is always changing, right? And I'm going to show you something that's kind of weird, but it'll be interesting. So take that hand, hold it up like that, Right, Just like that. That we'll get it to a rest turn like that. Look at that spot right there. Okay. Just make it so it's comfortable. Look at that spot as you look at that spot. We'll just tilt the hand slightly. I'm going to take my hand from over here and I'm going to move it towards your hand. It's not going to touch your hand, but it's going to move in closer and you'll be able to see it with your peripheral vision. My hand getting closer to your hand. And notice that as my hand gets closer to your hand, that before it ever even touches your hand, notice how you can feel my hand. You can feel the warmth within the fingers and the palm of your hand. Notice that my hand feels like here and that it's different when it's there, that you feel it with it here. Isn't that weird? It is weird, isn't it? That you can feel the energy, which means I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that messed with your body or hurt your feelings. Because who you are can only be touched with mutual respect. Right. Or the love you allow in. Right. Isn't that cool? It is weird.
[59:03] B: I mean, I know like energy healing.
[59:05] A: And everything you do, don't you?
[59:07] B: I never had somebody like simplify it like that.
[59:10] A: Isn't that cool? Yeah. And so what we're doing is we're settling the body because we want to unplug moments of experiences that have happened. And because your unconscious is listening to everything we're talking about. Your unconscious first knows how to heal itself. That's why cuts heal from the inside out. That's why we put a broken bone into a cast. So that your body has the ability to heal and you don't screw up the healing. Right. So that part of your brain knows how to heal. It also is a warehouse of all the experiences that you've gone through in life. The good, the bad, the ugly. So it knows which moments in life left imprints that created bad programming in you. Right. And so it knows which experiences would be useful to bring into the light between us so that we can unplug them and in which order. All there is for you to do is just to have the intention of being with me. And the reason you want to be with me is that this is what's happening and that shit isn't. Two, we're working on a goal that we both want for you.
[60:14] B: Yeah.
[60:14] A: And three, again, I hope and set the bar very low that I'M at least a little more enjoyable than some sucky moments in your life. Got it?
[60:21] B: Yeah.
[60:22] A: Yeah. So as we're organizing towards the you much more present and settled and. Okay. Feeling more space, experiencing other stuff as being about them, having more ease in dealing with frustrating things, your unconscious is going to travel back down the timeline of moments in your own history of things that happened, that sucked. And it's gonna narrow. It's gonna begin to group and categorize different experiences, and then it'll bring one to your awareness that would be useful for us to unplug. And you got one. Good. The one that just came to mind happened how long ago you might have been howled.
[61:06] B: I don't know. Trauma. I'm confused. You lost me.
[61:11] A: I didn't lose you. You're right here with me. I know you are. Isn't that good? Right? You're not back there in those. You're right here with me. I didn't lose you. Right. I'm gonna keep you here. Your brain is gonna scan back and it's gonna select one of those yucky ones and it's gonna bring one to your awareness so that we can unplug you. And we're going to do one at a time or we're going to do several. And then as we do several, it's going to generalize out. Got it? Yeah. So as you're here with me and your brain travels back. Right. What moment comes to mind that happened more than once? Huh. So let's think of a time you might have been. How old?
[62:07] B: Hiding under the table at a family visit?
[62:10] A: Yeah. So this might have been. You might have been how old?
[62:13] B: I don't know.
[62:14] A: I was little. Yeah. Like younger than five. Older than five.
[62:17] B: Like six.
[62:18] A: Like six. Right. And this would have been where?
[62:23] B: Catholic Charities.
[62:24] A: Z. So you would have been at Catholic Charities and you would have been staying there. With whom?
[62:30] B: It was a family visit. We did it every other week.
[62:33] A: Huh.
[62:34] B: Sor. My siblings.
[62:36] A: So were you staying there or did you all go to Catholic Charities?
[62:39] B: We just went there to do family visits.
[62:41] A: Got. And who was. Who were you visiting? My biological parents and my biological siblings at that place. Okay, so somebody took you there, Right. And then you were supposed to be in counseling with bio Family.
[62:58] B: No counseling. Just a family visit.
[63:00] A: Okay. Just to go see them at a neutral location.
[63:03] B: Yeah. If they showed up.
[63:06] A: Oh, oh, so you mean there were times that they didn't show up?
[63:09] B: Yeah.
[63:10] A: Oh, okay. So you got there and then, like, you waited for them and then they didn't show. Up and then you left.
[63:14] B: Or my mom showed up all straight out, kicked out, and tell her to leave.
[63:19] A: Right. So that's a different time. So there was one time that you did it and they never showed up. There was another time that you did it, and mom showed up, but she was strung out on drugs, and so they had her leave and that canceled it. There was probably another time. There were lots of times. But you can remember that happening, right? And then you guys went back to wherever you were staying, and then that was over. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to Universal. That was more fun than that, wasn't it? What's something else that you've done that was more fun than that? Got a new purse that was more fun. One that I can carry in. Another one's like, I like, what is she got in that thing? Nothing. Can't carry nothing in that.
[64:09] B: It was really small.
[64:10] A: It was really small, Right. All right. Yeah. So what's something else you've done, you know, that was fun, at least? More fun than that?
[64:20] B: Having my own daughter.
[64:21] A: Yeah, having your daughter. Right, Right. So we got all those things that happen later, right? So, you know, we got going to Universal. We got having your kid. Right? Then you guys were back home, and then mom had to leave because she was strung out. And then mom had showed up, and then you guys were there. And then the other time you were waiting. Well, you guys had left, right? And then you were waiting, and then you'd gone there to meet them. Right. And then you had left the place that you were staying. Right. As we go backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it? I know. Isn't that crazy? You can remember that happening? You can remember, you know, Put on your flip flops. Tiffany, stop putting on your flip flops. I'm not putting on my flip flops. Right. Well, stop carrying your purse. Say, I'm not carrying my purse. Well, actually, I am. Right? We'll stop putting on your leggings. See, I'm not putting on my leggings. Stop mom from showing up. They're showing out. Say Mom's not showing up. They're showing up. Say that. Right? Well, then stop them from not showing up. Say they're not not showing up. Right? Well, then stop it from happening. Oh, that's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Right now that you, back then, was feeling that happening had everything to do with you. If I mattered more, if they truly cared, if she really loved me, then she wouldn't have been strung out on drugs. Right. But you actually know that that is not accurate. That somebody can really love you and be strung out of drugs in the same time.
[66:08] B: Unfortunately, no personal experience.
[66:11] A: You do, don't you? That you can absolutely love your kid and have been strung out on drugs. Like they're not mutually exclusive. Got it. You didn't know that then. Not only that, you felt like them being that way had everything to do with you or your lovability or your worth to them or whether they cared or whether you mattered. As we're looking at it, clearly, did it have anything at all to do with you or your lovability or worth? Or did it have to do with them not being well? And you didn't know that then. Right? So what happens if we let the earlier. You know what you're learning now? One, that it's over. That it no longer exists. Two, that them being that way had nothing to do with you or your lovability or heck, their love for you had everything to do with them being unwell. Got it. So close your eyes, picture that earlier you and let her know what you know. Now it's over. It no longer exists. Her being that way. That happening had nothing to do with me and everything to do with her being unwell. Then it's not about me. It's not about me that I didn't need her to be well in order for me to love my daughter. That's right. So that she's getting it. And as the earlier you is getting it, what are you noticing now? Well, does she look so troubled? Because there's one other thing that you're going to be doing as you're bettering you. Do you know what that is?
[67:55] B: What?
[67:56] A: You're going to be changing the narrative in the multi generational thing that goes on.
[68:01] B: I can't. That's the plan.
[68:03] A: Do you follow me with that? Like you're changing the narrative. There's what happened with mom that happened with me that we're making sure it's not going to happen with her because I'm getting well. Mom didn't get well, did she? Right, right, right. So as you're thinking about that earlier, you. What do you notice about her now?
[68:32] B: I'm not thinking about her.
[68:34] A: I know, but if you did, does she look so troubled, so sad, so hurt? Isn't that cool? Yeah. Right. So again, as your jaw is slightly lowered and you relax your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper in a little bit longer on the way out, you can see my nose and My fingers. You stay looking at my nose. The fingers move out. Sides of the eyes pick up the wiggling. You notice more space. As you notice more space, there's even more space beyond the room. And that space goes well beyond the room, all the way out to outer space and beyond.
[69:14] B: I can't see all that.
[69:15] A: You can't? No, not in your. Not with your eyes open. Right. But even with your eyes open, you can't see your face. I can see your face and you can see my face, but you can't see your face. So to you, you're actually faceless. The reason that you know you have a face is you can recognize what people told you your face was when you looked in a mirror. And they'd say, that's you. And you could recognize. Oh, but a dog has no face to a dog. They don't know what their face looks like. Why, when they look in a mirror, they don't know that it's a reflection of them. Isn't that weird? But we have the ability to know that we have awareness in different ways. Right.
[70:04] B: It's sunburning itches, huh?
[70:06] A: That's good. So again, right as we're organizing 20 towards the. You're becoming more okay in you. That other part of your brain can travel back down the timeline of moments in your own history. And we'll bring another. That's right. Good down regulation there. We like that. That's right. And what experience comes to mind now?
[70:34] B: I don't know nothing about anything.
[70:36] A: I know. I want Tiffany to think about where we're headed. And I want Tiffany's unconscious, not thinking about the past. I know. I don't want you to think about the past at all. I want you to think about where we're headed. Because I really want your unconscious to bring the moments to your awareness. Because your unconscious knows more than you do. Right. You haven't even been conscious of some of the things that are running you unconsciously. You're conscious of some of the things that are running you, but you're conscious of it. And then there's a whole bunch of stuff that's running in you that's unconscious that you don't even know. And that's where it is. The things that control us the most are the things that are most unconscious. Because when it's conscious, I have some awareness and can do stuff. When it's unconscious, it's just running me. And your unconscious knows which programs are faulty. Right. That are causing more high alert than need to be, that are triggering more Angst and irritation and frustration than need to be. Because we want you to have more flow, kind of more like water, just kind of able to move. Yeah. With the situations. Directive towards what I want from you is kind of have a bendability to it. Because the life that we live is non linear. Right. In linear systems, the fastest way from A to B is a straight line. In nonlinear systems, it's anything other than a straight line. Right. So as your body's feeling really settled and more calm, your unconscious will travel back, you know, to those moments that you never like to think about. Because anytime you do think about them, they make you feel really bad. We want to bring one of those up. Not so that you feel really bad, so that instead you stay with me because I'm more fun. And we begin to get the good news in. Because you're not troubled by any of the bad stuff, Tiffany, because it was bad. You're troubled now only because your brain doesn't know it ended. Right. We want to get that good news in two aspects of the brain that don't know. Certain awful, sucky things are over. You survived it, you made it through it. You're okay. Right. And that's why we're organizing towards the you having more freedom and flow and ease and dealing with difficult stuff or stuff that's undesirable or stuff that's contrary to what you want. Right. Your unconscious will travel back and will bring another experience to your awareness. Yeah. What's coming to mind now? That one happened. You might have been how old?
[73:52] B: Five years ago?
[73:53] A: Yeah. And again, you want to intend to be with me because I'm more fun. The feelings, as you think about that, is it feelings of hurt, anger, sadness, grief, guilt, shame, regret, remorse, anger, upset. Okay. So would it be okay to get that gone?
[74:10] B: Yes.
[74:11] A: Okay. And if it's gone, does it mean any of what you went through was okay? Or you get to be okay even though all that wasn't. Got it. So again, you want to be here with me because I'm more fun as you tell me just the facts, just what happened in like a minute or less. So that happened when? It happened about five years ago. You were where? So you were in a hotel room. Good. So it was morning or afternoon. Right. Kachavka detail. Right. And then what happened next? You woke up, you're in this hotel room.
[74:54] B: I didn't know where I was at.
[74:56] A: Right. And so like you were looking around, still in the bed.
[74:59] B: I was very confused.
[75:00] A: Not sure where you were. Really confused. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[75:03] B: Under the influence. And I didn't know of what.
[75:06] A: Right. So something was making your body be in mind. Right. Good job. Good detail. Right. And then what happened next? And be here. Hi.
[75:14] B: I was really confused.
[75:15] A: Notice how you're there a little. Yeah. Hi. I went to here because. Because I'm fine. Right. So you're really confused, but you're not confused now, are you? No. You're sitting here with me. Right. You were confused then. Aren't we glad that you're not confused now like you were then? Right. So you're confused. And then what happened?
[75:35] B: I had a seizure.
[75:36] A: And then you had a seizure, which was scary. Right. Then what happened?
[75:40] B: I end up in the hospital.
[75:41] A: Right. Then you were into the hospital. Right. And then what happened?
[75:43] B: I found out I got drugged.
[75:45] A: Right. And then you found out that you were given something. Right. Then what happened?
[75:49] B: I knew I was assaulted by somebody.
[75:53] A: While you were in the hospital?
[75:54] B: No, when I was drugged.
[75:56] A: Oh, before. So before the seizure, you had gotten assaulted. So somebody did stuff to your body they might have, like, put their penis in different spots, done whatever they did. Right. And you found out that when you were in the hospital because they did, like, a rape kit.
[76:13] B: Yeah.
[76:13] A: Right. So they did that. And that had you found out that somebody did something. Right. Then what happened next?
[76:21] B: I ended up getting out of the hospital.
[76:23] A: Well, and then you left the hospital. Right. Which is better than finding out all that information.
[76:27] B: Yeah. But like a year later, a video came out from the incident.
[76:31] A: Okay, so you're out of the hospital and that was done. And then later you saw a video.
[76:36] B: Somebody sent it to me.
[76:37] A: Somebody sent a video of what they had done to you.
[76:40] B: Not. I don't. I don't know who. I don't even know where they got the video. I guess it was posted online.
[76:45] A: Well, not the person, but of what? Whoever it was that did whatever they did. And so then you watch the video of what they had done. Right. And then what happened? And you're like, I don't need to watch that.
[76:56] B: Yeah, I was like.
[76:56] A: I was there.
[76:57] B: Why would you even say that to me?
[76:58] A: Right, right. And then what happened next made it more real. Well, then what happened next?
[77:04] B: I went down a dark path.
[77:06] A: No, then what happened next?
[77:07] B: What do you mean?
[77:08] A: Well, then that moment ended. Yeah. Right. Later on, you might have done other things. And then after that, you went to Universal. Yeah, Right. What's something recent that you've done that was fun? Did you go to the circus? Yes. Hey, you went to the circus. That was more Fun than that moment, wasn't it? Much fun. Right, Right. So we got going to the circus, right. We got being at Universal, right? And then you had realized that something had happened because somebody sent you a video of what had happened, Right. And then you had left the hospital and then you had learned from the rape grip that something had happened. And then you had gone to the hospital and then you had had a seizure and then you woke up feeling really weird, right? And then somebody must have done something. And then before that somebody had put something, giving you something. And then before that you were out doing whatever you're doing. As we go backwards compared to forward again, emotionally, how was it? Notice how it's getting less. You can remember that happening, finding out the rape kits and you can remember all that happening, Right. You can also remember putting on your tie dye top. Well, Tiffany, stop putting on your tie dye top. Say I'm not putting on my tie. I tell. Well then stop them from doing that. Say they're not doing that.
[78:27] B: They're not doing.
[78:28] A: Well then stop that from happening. Say that's not happening.
[78:30] B: That's not happening.
[78:31] A: So then where is that experience? Say it no longer exists.
[78:34] B: It no longer.
[78:35] A: Well then stop viewing. Say I'm not viewing that.
[78:37] B: What?
[78:38] A: I'm not viewing that I'm not viewing. We'll stop it from happening. Go. It's not happening.
[78:42] B: It's not.
[78:42] A: So then where is it? Go. It doesn't exist. Right. And as this gets in, what do you notice now? Right. All right, what are you noticing?
[78:54] B: I'm a little tense.
[78:55] A: You're a little tense, huh?
[78:57] B: Yeah.
[78:58] A: Yeah. And what are you tense about?
[79:00] B: I don't know.
[79:00] A: No, you don't know, do you? Well, how do you know that you are?
[79:04] B: Cuz I can feel it.
[79:05] A: Where do you feel it?
[79:06] B: My legs, my body. I'm stiff.
[79:08] A: Ah, so you can remember all that happening, like what they did?
[79:14] B: No.
[79:15] A: You can remember that it happened?
[79:16] B: Yes.
[79:17] A: Right. You can remember putting on your leggings? Yes. Right. Well, stop putting on your leggings. Well then stop them from doing that. So then where is it? Say no longer exists. Right. So now check. What about that happening then is troubling now?
[79:39] B: Because my friends knew that the guy was a creep that did stuff like that.
[79:43] A: See, notice the thing that's troubling you is no longer that it happened.
[79:48] B: Yeah.
[79:49] A: Isn't that cool? But what's troubling you is the thing that's left over, which is coming from the thought that it shouldn't have happened. They should have let you Know, or they shouldn't let you be in that sit. Right? Like, so here's the deal. Because your logical brain can conceive of that alternative outcome that would have been better because it would have prevented that from happening. Your emotional brain works like an animal. Your animal brain can only think of doing things that it can actually do. So the animal's brain lives that if I can think it, that means that I can do it. So your intellectual brain is saying, well, get my friends to stop me from being with them or telling me that this guy. Your emotional brain, because you can conceive of them having. Your emotional brain goes, well, then hurry. Get them to tell you what a creepy was. Get them to tell you so you didn't hang out. Right. Your emotional brain is trying to motivate to get that to happen. The timing is screwed up though. You follow me with that? Little late. Right? Right. So you know, get them to tell you what a creepy was five years ago, hurry. And you go, well, there's nothing to be done. So say there's nothing to be done.
[81:12] B: There's nothing to be done.
[81:13] A: No. Get them to make sure you knew all about him before you hung out with him five years ago. Hurry. Say there's nothing to be done. Well, then stop that. Say there's nothing to be done. No, come on, we'll go together. Let's do it. Come on. There's nothing to be done. As you're getting it, Tiffany, again, check in. What do you notice happening to the feelings? What do you notice happening to the tension?
[81:41] B: Just a little tense.
[81:42] A: So just check. What is the tension about? If you were to think about it, Better yet, where is it? In your body? In your legs. So now just focus on the sensations that you notice in your legs. Without trying to understand or figure it out, without even thinking about the situation, just focus on the sensations and get a little curious about how you're going to notice these sensations changing. Because sensations can't stay the same because they're in constant motion. They're always changing. So as you're noticing the sensations in your leg and just noticing, what are you noticing in terms of how they're changing? How are the sensations changing? The ones that you were noticing in your legs trying to move. You're trying to move, right? But without even doing anything with them, just notice that there are sensations in your legs, but also there are sensations in your shoulders because that's how you know where your shoulders are, because you can feel them. And then go back to noticing the sensations in your legs. And then notice the sensations in your shoulders and then notice the sensations in your legs. And then notice the sensations in your shoulders. And then notice the sensations in your legs and then notice the sensations in your shoulders and just get an idea of where do the sensations change?
[83:24] B: Want to pay attention to it?
[83:26] A: Yeah. And what are you noticing with the sensations in your legs? Oh, is it still there in the same way it will was Pretty much. Pretty much? Yeah. Oh. So not exactly. Oh, see, you're used to has got to be big change or no change. We're used to either or in life. But I want you to pay attention to the subtle nuances. Right. Cuz that discomfort. Right. Because when you think about all that stuff, is there anything about that happening then that's troubling you now? Isn't that weird and cool both at the same time? It's weird because normally it's troubling and it's not troubling, but it's cool that it's not troubling. Because you no longer being troubled doesn't mean what happened was okay. That's still not okay. Got it. But notice how you're feeling more okay. Even though that wasn't then. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So again, just notice what happens when you breathe. Little bit slower and deeper on the way in. As you relax your tongue and rest your jaw just a little bit lower, open up to notice more space. Right. The space between beyond and then even what might happen when you close. Close your eyes.
[85:24] B: You want me to close my eyes?
[85:25] A: Sure. And then with your eyes closed, Tiffany, imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body so that you rise up beyond the ceiling, up beyond the roof, so that you're way up above it all in the sky. You're having this bird's eye view. You're seeing everything as being underneath and below you. Because you're above, you're over it all. And just like the bird, free to soar and fly through the space of the sky and move in any direction in all kinds of ways. Free to glide and fly and move. That's right. Bring awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you. Then take a nice deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes again. Just checking your body. How's your body feeling now?
[86:38] B: Better.
[86:39] A: Better How? So that's better. It's more relaxed. Nice. And as your body's more relaxed, you're unconscious again. We'll travel back down that timeline of moments we don't like to Think about.
[86:58] B: Anything else?
[86:59] A: Of course not. We don't want you to think about any of them either. We just want your unconscious to. To bring it to your awareness so that we can unplug it. Right? Because the whole essence of it is there's parts of your brain that don't know certain bad moments ended. You're not bothered because they were bad. You're not bothered because of what you did or what happened to you. You're bothered because your brain emotionally doesn't know it ended. So we want to, in a painless way, unplug the effect that they've had so that you get to be more free to be okay in you, that you're free to read other people's stuff as being more about them. That the intensity of the agitation, the annoyance, the resentment gets to be turned way down so that you have more ease in moving through it. Right? This is where we're headed. All the moments that get unplugged have energy attached to them. We know it because not how often I think about it, but when I do, there's still a charge attached. So energy is ongoingly being used to deal with them, whether I'm thinking about them or not. So as those moments are brought into the light in between you and I and the impact that they've had unplugged, all the energy that was stuck and being used to deal with it is released to be redistributed, to be reallocated, to be transformed for renewable heative processes. So one more time, notice the space. Isn't it interesting when you notice more special than when you're like this? And see, when we're highly stressed, we don't even know it. It goes like this. When we open up space, your body becomes more settled. And what if in a way that has your body feel more settled, we can unplug the moment so that you're free? Because the reason they recycle or jump up is because your brain doesn't know it ever ended. Right? We have a huge opportunity because as you get free from that, it directs you more to this future you. Right? What's happening now? How's your body feeling?
[90:05] B: Chilling.
[90:06] A: It's chilling. That's right. And as your body's chilling, your unconscious travels back again. Oh, I didn't tell you this, did I? Oh, I did once. I'll tell it again because I think it's really useful. So your brain has the ability to generalize. Not from a bunch, doesn't do good with the generalization, but it is really Good. Taking a specific and then extrapolating and generalizing out to others that are similar. So if I was working with somebody and let's say their uncle had molested them between the ages of, you know, 11 and 14, like 50 times, do I have to go through every single time that it happened? Would it make sense to go through a few? That way the brain can generalize to the rest. Because generalization works really well. If I said to you orange, you don't know whether it's the fruit or the color. But if I said orange, apple, banana, you totally get that it's the fruit. And I don't have to list many more. If I said orange, red, purple, green, you'd get it's the color and I don't have to list many more. So your brain has the ability to generalize. So as we narrow, pinpoint, we're going to bring a moment to your awareness, that is that one clears. It's like sends the ripple out to heal even more in others. Right. We're doing a reconnaissance mission to get the good news in that the war has ended and we won. Right. If the guy is stuck in the jungle, doesn't know that the war is over, when we find him, we've got good news for him. There are aspects in your brain that don't know certain awful moments ended. And see, I'm wondering, and I want you to check here, and I want you to check in here and I want you to check down here. Would it really be okay for you to be okay, okay in you? Right. Well, check first. Check at a head level. Check at a heart level. Check at a gut level. Well, like you have a, you have different brains in your body. You have a head brain, which is your idea and your insight brain. It's your knowledge and your timeline brain. You have a heart brain, which is about love, passion, connection, action, interest, heartache, heartbreak. You have a gut brain, which is about well being, but also mobility and traction. Right? You hear it? That person's got guts. What does that mean? They're strong. Right. That person's got a lot of heart. They're passionate about it. Right. We have different brains in our body and we want them to be in alignment with you being okay in you. And what we're getting now is you're being okay in you. Doesn't mean any of this stuff that happened was okay. You get to be okay now even if that stuff wasn't then make sense. And we just want to educate the parts that don't know that you made It, Right. So your brain's gonna bring another moment to your awareness. And you got one.
[93:41] B: Do we have to keep doing this?
[93:43] A: Only if you want to get better. What's happening now? Because no, we don't have to do anything. But I'm really curious. What about doing this? Isn't okay, now.
[93:58] B: You just don't feel like doing it.
[94:00] A: Who would?
[94:06] B: Straining.
[94:07] A: Is it really?
[94:07] B: Yeah.
[94:08] A: Even though you're chilling, isn't it weird? Isn't it weird that you're chilling? It's still drained and energizing. Right. You know what's draining? All the power that the shit has had over you. See, I want you to run your life better for you. And right now the shit is running you. Right? There's a person sitting on top of an elephant. The person sitting on top of the elephant feels that they're in control when the elephant is doing what they want. And if the elephant is responsive to the rider and goes this way when the rider and that way when the rider and stops to load a passenger and walks forward, then the rider feels like it's totally in control of the elephant. But if the elephant gets spooked, then the rider is just going along for the ride. The work that we're interested in doing, whether we talk about negative shit or not, I don't care, you can do other things, is about rewiring the problematic ways that you automatically respond to shit so that you have more freedom and ease in dealing with the shit. And what if as that energy is drained, it becomes more energizing for you? Not tiring, because energy is being used to deal with that stuff ongoingly, whether you think about it or not. And all we want for you, at least what I want, I want you to be free to be more okay in you. Is there a thing about, like, is it going to be embarrassing or.
[96:06] B: No, I just don't feel like talking anymore.
[96:08] A: Huh?
[96:10] B: That's all.
[96:11] A: Okay, well, what if you don't have to talk anymore? Okay, well, then, you know, think about whatever you need to think about and feel some of the bad feelings.
[96:26] B: I don't know. Like, I'm pretty good. Like, I know stuff's not happening anymore. It just still sucks.
[96:36] A: What sucks? Is it sucky that it did happen?
[96:46] B: Yeah.
[96:47] A: Is that really where it's stuck again?
[96:52] B: I don't know. I don't really think about other stuff too much.
[96:55] A: Cause isn't it an interesting thing that there's troubling experiences and they're troubling because they happened, and then there's troubling experiences. And they're not troubling now because they happened, but because they shouldn't have happened. Right. Like you're not thinking that in the world of world you got the greatest hand dealt to you. You. Right. You had bio parents that were in active addiction that weren't present for you. Right. And then didn't you live them with grandparents for a period of time?
[97:39] B: My aunt and.
[97:40] A: For a period of time. Right. And then at 13 to that adopted mom who you still have some connection with but never really felt close to.
[97:48] B: I moved in with I thought the parents when I was like seven.
[97:52] A: Like seven. Okay.
[97:53] B: They just adopted me when I was 13.
[97:55] A: Got it.
[97:55] B: So terminated my biological parents.
[97:57] A: Right. Got it.
[97:59] B: And said I was never going home. Surprise.
[98:02] A: Right. Well, cuz. Only cuz they weren't. Well, yeah, not because of that had anything to do with you, but back then it felt like you not going home had a lot to do with you or them not wanting you or, or, or See, those are the things that right here, Tiffany, you do know differently. But notice how in here you don't fully feel differently yet. I really want what you know to be in here so that you feel it. Right. Because we didn't get dealt the greatest hand. And then as a result of that and not feeling super connected even though you were with them since like 7 and they fully adopted you at 13 because parents weren't well and are still around and still love you. Love you. Like they love. Which isn't how you really always want to be loved by them. But like we got that. Right. And then there's been other stuff that's happened along the way, right. I would imagine there's been stuff where there's been some form of sexual violence that's happened. Right. There's probably been some kind of abuse that's happened. Right. There was the whole moment of when you went to the freaking hospital. And that thing there's the thing that we talked about of having been drugged. Who knows whether there was a boyfriend or a pimp or any other stuff or I used that and got compensated. So I did those transactional relationships how.
[99:34] B: I got to Florida.
[99:35] A: That's how you got to Florida.
[99:37] B: I got traffic down here.
[99:38] A: Huh? Well, welcome.
[99:40] B: Yeah, welcome to paradise. Straight to Disneyland.
[99:48] A: Right?
[99:49] B: Literally.
[99:50] A: You would better.
[99:51] B: Holy shit.
[99:53] A: Make this up. Can you? No, no. Got a good story.
[99:56] B: Realize that is the dark truth of a lot of tourist destination destinations. Yeah, it's unfortunate.
[100:02] A: Yeah. They do know it about the super bowl.
[100:04] B: Everybody's like, oh man, don't you Just want to go to Disney. I'm like, yeah, not really.
[100:08] A: No. No. That's why I went to Universal.
[100:12] B: Literally, like, Disney is not fun. In my mind. That's why I came to Florida with my trafficker, was to go to Disney to get pimped out. So, no, I'm good.
[100:21] A: Yeah.
[100:21] B: Disney will never be the same for me.
[100:24] A: Right.
[100:26] B: It's just. I just know that, of course, the.
[100:28] A: Issue around there, again, isn't Disney.
[100:31] B: No.
[100:32] A: Right. But that's because it co. Occurred.
[100:34] B: It co. Occurred.
[100:35] A: Do you follow me with that?
[100:36] B: I know all the drugs that are around Disney, so I would never bring my child there because I never want her anywhere near any of that stuff. That's a dark, dark world. I got dragged into that. I didn't want her anywhere.
[100:47] A: You know what's really cool? Do you know what's really cool about that? You actually know, which makes you more wise and better able to steal your cores. Right. If there's a field filled with landmines and you know where they all are, you can maneuver your way around and avoid them. Me not knowing, I might step on one. Yeah, got it. So we want the moment of the stuff unplugged so that you're free. Right. There's the. The thing that keeps going on for me, and this is what I so want for you. And I will do whatever you want. Like, you don't want to talk. I don't care. Like you. We don't have to talk. But what I really want, Tiffany, truly, is I want you to be free from the effect. Because that shit's like controlling you and you're feeling like you gotta be controlled and controlling and like, you're not free. I really want you to be free. Totally. Whether we do it today or a different day does not matter. Right. I'm wanting your life to work better. I'm wanting all of you to fully realize you got away. And I don't know your whole story. I got. Okay, so there was that mom, right, that adopted you. Right. And then other happened.
[102:17] B: Like I moved out when I was 16 and then didn't hear from them for two and a half years.
[102:21] A: Yeah. You moved out of that adopted mom's place when you were 16 and you didn't talk to them and they didn't talk to you. And that, again, reinforces that they didn't really care, Right. In that, like, notice how that's kind of like the perpetuating story. Like people really don't care. Like, they pretend that they care, but they really don't Fucking care. So fucking good, isn't it?
[102:48] B: Seems to be a reoccurring theme in my life.
[102:51] A: Yeah. Huh.
[102:52] B: Just got some bad people around, I guess.
[102:54] A: Yeah. So what if that gets adjusted?
[102:56] B: Pick different people.
[102:58] A: Yeah. But see you got jammed and therefore the programming. Right. I. I get this a lot with people. The pickers up. I keep finding myself picking this up.
[103:09] B: I dated a straight sociopath that I thought was going to murder me when I tried to leave him. So yeah, I have quite the story.
[103:16] A: Good thing that didn't happen.
[103:18] B: I had to like mess his head and make him think he was leaving me when really I was trying to get him to leave me. Cuz I couldn't leave him because he was stalking me. I have quite the interesting story.
[103:31] A: Yeah. And the COVID source. Forceful you are. Yeah. That despite that happening, you figure out a way to get away. How cool is that? Good job.
[103:38] B: Yeah.
[103:39] A: Yeah. Good job. Right. How'd you get away from the trafficker guy that got you to Florida?
[103:44] B: I was in a car that got pulled over and I had a missing person's report out on me.
[103:49] A: And was that person in the car, the trafficker person or you were in a different car?
[103:53] B: No, I was with somebody else.
[103:55] A: You're with somebody else was watching me. Yeah. For the most there. Yeah. And so they had a missing persons. Yeah.
[104:06] B: I. Baby daddy figured it out somehow I think because I stopped talking to my daughter and he knew something was up. He knew that it was not normal.
[104:12] A: Yeah. So yeah.
[104:16] B: Disappeared and stopped answering the phone. Didn't stop talking to my kid. He knew something was up.
[104:21] A: Yeah.
[104:21] B: And like he knew like when I met him I was. Was like very like prude and like he was the first like serious relationship I was in.
[104:28] A: Yeah.
[104:28] B: And so then he just like when he found like the pictures online and the ad, he knew, he was just like, there's no way she's like doing this on her own.
[104:36] A: Yeah.
[104:37] B: She does not have it in her. I didn't at the time.
[104:42] A: Right.
[104:42] B: You know, it's like.
[104:43] A: Yeah. That wasn't ever you anyway. It was your. That you had to do.
[104:48] B: Yeah.
[104:50] A: Right. Wasn't ever you. Right. So how did you get connected to the trafficker guy that said let's go to the, you know, most wonderful place on in the world.
[104:59] B: Drugs.
[105:01] A: Drugs. So he was a person that you were able to get drugs from.
[105:04] B: And I was like dating another drug dealer that started messing around with benzos and we were. I had just really honestly started doing heroin.
[105:13] A: Like if you're gonna do heroin, might as well I mean, drug dealers. So you have really good access to it.
[105:20] B: Well, then he started doing benzos. And so then, like, I was dancing at a club, you know, and I went to work, and I came back, and somebody broke into the room that we were renting at this girl's house, where I guess she was an IV user. And I had no idea about any of that. So I didn't know. Like, we probably shouldn't say with this girl, you know what I mean? Because she had shady people over. Well, they broke, broken. And stole all his drugs off of him because he was knocked out because of the benzos and got mad at me and flipped out on me. And I was like, what? You ain't gonna get pissed at me? And he's like, I need your money to re up. I thought, you got me up. You ain't taking all my money.
[105:55] A: Yeah.
[105:55] B: And so then I went downstairs, and she had another dealer over. He was like, oh, just come with me. I'll keep you safe. I promise. I'll take care of you. And I was like, look, I start the methadone clinic tomorrow. I need to be able to go to the methadone clinic every day. Because I realized I was up, you know, I was like, this is not. And I didn't want to do this, you know, I left Colorado with my baby daddy to give him one more chance, even though I was about to have sole custody of my daughter again. He had a domestic violence of strangulation against me, and then domestic battery was severe bodily harm. They were trying to give him two years of prison. So he fled Colorado and was like, please, I'm sorry. I was drinking and using. I relapsed. And I was like, how did I not see that? You know, love is blind, though. And he's like, please, give me one more chance. And I caught him cheating on me in 48 hours and brought me straight back to the place that I ran from, got away from, because that's where I started using. I used heroin for, like, three months.
[106:52] A: So you found out that he did that, then went back to the place that you had been doing?
[106:57] B: Well, that's how I got with a drug dealer because, well, I left Colorado and I did not realize I was on Suboxone for a year. I was sober. I was over a year and a half. I was doing really good. Almost had sole custody of my daughter because my baby daddy got all of them sickles and then begged me for one more chance. And I gave him a stupid chance, and I followed him back to My hometown, you know.
[107:20] A: Hometown is where?
[107:21] B: Illinois.
[107:22] A: Okay.
[107:24] B: I should have never did that.
[107:26] A: Right.
[107:26] B: And so when I found out he was cheating on me, I just like.
[107:30] A: Did you go back to Colorado?
[107:31] B: I just fell apart. No, no, you just had convinced. Coincidentally ran into my old drug dealer the day before at the public health department trying to get my Medicaid transferred. And they informed me it would not be transferred and I would have to pay cash for the doctor, which was going to be like 3, $800. But I did not have. And so then I got sick from detoxing from the Suboxone. So I think my dealer could tell me, could tell something. I was like, I'm not on that. I've been sober. And he was like, well, here's a free bag. That's the only time I ever got free dope was when I didn't want it. And it started a dark path. But yeah. So he was the one that ended up doing the benzos and got all.
[108:11] A: Up and then you got melt the.
[108:13] B: Other guy and he got me so strung out on and it was all just a con. And I mean his uncle was some big guy drug dealer who got like kilos of dope. And so he just strung me that like kept me in a room so strung out that it's a blur. I don't remember shit. I don't remember almost anything. Like I would get so up, I would pass out, wake up. I don't. I lost so much weight cuz I wasn't eating.
[108:34] A: Sure.
[108:35] B: And then.
[108:37] A: How you doing right now by the way?
[108:38] B: I'm good.
[108:39] A: You okay?
[108:40] B: Yeah.
[108:40] A: You there a little bit? No, not really.
[108:43] B: Just a little bit.
[108:43] A: I mean, that's why I said it.
[108:45] B: Yeah.
[108:46] A: Because I saw that you were there a little bit.
[108:47] B: And I want you better.
[108:49] A: I know you are, but I want you back here with me. And just when we. I know when we start to have the intention of being here with me, your brain starts to read that as information about something that happened versus where it's been stuck inside is happening.
[109:04] B: Yeah.
[109:05] A: Good job.
[109:05] B: This is something I'm kind of.
[109:07] A: Good job getting back here by the way.
[109:10] B: I've been dealing with this. And we did ending the game, ecg. I don't know if you know.
[109:15] A: Sure. Yeah.
[109:16] B: The program is like the game is the lifestyle or whatever. And it made me realize how bad I disassociated from what happened to me. Because you know, even when I got away from him, I started escorting myself and I was like, oh, I'm making all this money. I'M cool, I'm sexy, whatever.
[109:31] A: Yeah.
[109:31] B: It's crazy how the brain plays tricks on you.
[109:34] A: Yeah.
[109:34] B: And like, I went. I had like a full blown banic depth. And I remember remembered all those feelings, that scary feeling I had the first time he made me see a client. Like, I literally did not have a choice. And like, all those feelings of like, I have to do this or I'm gonna die.
[109:47] A: You can remember that time when he told you that you had to go see that client? Yeah. And was it like in a hotel? Was he in the car?
[109:53] B: It was in a hotel and he.
[109:54] A: Was in the car with you or.
[109:56] B: Oh, take it back. It was a car. Yeah, he was in the car waiting for me. Parked right down the street.
[110:01] A: Right.
[110:01] B: See, the whole time where that other.
[110:02] A: Car was and you got out of the car and went to the other guy's car.
[110:05] B: Yeah.
[110:05] A: And had to do whatever it was, hand job, low job, sex, whatever.
[110:09] B: Came back, gave him the money.
[110:11] A: The money. You can remember all that happened.
[110:13] B: I know that. That deep feeling of fear that I had and this can't be my life.
[110:18] A: You can remember that happening, right?
[110:19] B: Yeah, I can remember that happening.
[110:20] A: And you can remember putting on your, you know.
[110:22] B: Yes, I remember putting my pants on. Those pants are not happening. This is not happening.
[110:25] A: We'll stop putting on your capris.
[110:26] B: I know. I'm stuffing.
[110:27] A: Yeah, well then stop getting in that other guy's car. Well, then stop him from making you do that. See, he's not making me do that. We'll stop that from happening. Go. That's not happening. Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Right. Is that your life?
[110:42] B: No.
[110:42] A: No, it's not your life at all. Not where you're headed an. Huh?
[110:48] B: No longer around.
[110:49] A: Right. And you were up then.
[110:52] B: Yeah.
[110:52] A: Right. How long you been clean now?
[110:55] B: Seven months.
[110:56] A: Yeah, Right.
[110:58] B: For my drug of choice, almost two years, but got it totally sober from alcohol and everything. Seven months.
[111:03] A: Isn't that cool?
[111:04] B: Yes.
[111:04] A: How awesome is that? Two years if I include weed and alcohol.
[111:09] B: Yes.
[111:10] A: Two years from the one that. Really?
[111:12] B: Two years from the one.
[111:12] A: Two years from the. Really? You up? Yeah. Good job.
[111:16] B: Me up? Yes. Two years.
[111:18] A: That's phenomenal. I'm so proud of you and it's so freaking cool. Yeah. Yeah, Right. And you can remember that happening and being really scared. Right. Coming back, giving them the money. Yeah, right. You can remember, you know. You know, I don't know. Putting your shirt on, you can remember that happening. I'll stop it from happening. Right. And as you're Getting it. What's happening to that memory now?
[111:50] B: It's just a memory.
[111:51] A: It's just a memory. Right, right, right. Because there's been a lot of stuff that's happened. Right. And then even after you got away from that guy, well then you were doing that as a livelihood and not having to give him the money.
[112:11] B: Yeah.
[112:12] A: Right. And that for a period of time, felt like empowering, didn't it? But I wasn't. But I was also like fueling my addiction. Yeah. Because I wasn't in like my right. State of mind as I was doing all that stuff.
[112:27] B: No.
[112:27] A: Right. Because that's not how it works for gals in the right state of mind. No.
[112:33] B: Having a super high just to do it.
[112:36] A: Right. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Right. And you can remember doing that stuff, but you know, you're not doing it now. No. Right, right. You can remember stuff happen to your body and guys might have put, you know, different parts of their bodies in different parts of your body. You can remember that that happened. Some of it was easier. Some of it was not easy at all. Some of it might have hurt. Some of it might have been disgusting and gross. Yes. Because guys can be disgusting and gross. Yes. And you can remember all that. Right. And you can remember getting, you know, bigger gauges in your ear. Well, stop getting bigger gauges in your ear and then stop them from doing that. Stop them from doing that stuff to your body. Well, then stop that from happening. Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[113:36] B: No longer exists.
[113:37] A: That's right. That's not me. That's not me. That was never you.
[113:40] B: That was never me.
[113:41] A: Right. It was just something you did. It was never who you are. That's right. What happens when she gets it? Realizing that that's never who you are. That's just something you did and some things that happened to you.
[113:58] B: Never thought about it like that.
[114:00] A: I know. But what starts to happen is you are thinking about it like that now makes more sense. Yeah. Cuz it was never who you are.
[114:08] B: Oh yeah. How did I do that? You know?
[114:10] A: Right? Well, you already told me. You dissociated. Yeah. That's a good way to be able to do something like that. Not be in my body as it's happening.
[114:17] B: Called it my game face.
[114:19] A: That's right.
[114:22] B: Like I'll put my game face on. They're like, what are you talking about? Like, don't, don't, don't worry about.
[114:26] A: Put the cane face on. Right, Right. Isn't that cool?
[114:31] B: Yes.
[114:32] A: Yeah. That you're getting free from all that so that you get to be more okay in you. Right. How old is your daughter?
[114:43] B: 10.
[114:44] A: 10. Okay. And she is with her father who's now clean. Yes. Isn't that cool? Over six years, five years, that she's gonna get both a clean and sober dad and a clean and sober mom.
[114:59] B: Yes.
[114:59] A: Isn't that cool? Right. Right. Because the key things in life isn't to try to be perfect. It's to know that you've got shortcomings. And when you up, you acknowledge and you own it and you change and you become better. And that's a better lesson. Yes. Don't you think? Yes. Right. Good job. It is. Right.
[115:26] B: Probation. What time is it?
[115:28] A: Not yet.
[115:29] B: Okay. I don't know what time they're supposed to get me.
[115:32] A: Yeah. Probably three.
[115:33] B: Okay. I know probation was originally supposed to be at 2:45.
[115:38] A: Let's see.
[115:39] B: That's why I don't know if they move the time or what.
[115:43] A: Yeah. Three.
[115:45] B: Okay. Can't be late to that.
[115:48] A: I know that's important.
[115:49] B: Otherwise I'll have an ankle monitor back on my ankle. We're not trying to do that. I'll be able to. We'll be twinsies. But mine will be black.
[115:57] A: Yeah. Right. And yours will not allow certain things.
[116:00] B: Mine will vibrate too.
[116:03] A: The same way.
[116:03] B: Only when I'm in the wrong areas.
[116:07] A: Yeah.
[116:08] B: I'm not trying to do that again.
[116:09] A: No. Right. Yeah. Right. So just checking in with you. What are you noticing now?
[116:15] B: I'm good.
[116:16] A: Yeah. See? What if those disgusting things that the guys did to your body never touched you?
[116:24] B: I guess they didn't.
[116:26] A: They messed with your stuff. Yeah. But there's no part of you right now that's the same as when it was then. It's all been replaced. Right.
[116:39] B: I knew that, but I guess I didn't associate it with that.
[116:42] A: No. But it's starting to get in. Not just here, but in here. Because you can say this after me. I have a nose. I have 10 fingers. I have two elbows. I have 10 toes. I'm not my elbows. I'm not my toes. I'm not my fingers, not my. I'm not my nose. I have a vagina. I'm not my vagina.
[117:05] B: I'm not my vagina.
[117:06] A: My vagina is mine, but it isn't me. That's right. So they mess with my stuff. And it screwed up my thinking and my feelings.
[117:14] B: Screwed up my thinking.
[117:16] A: But they never touched who I really am.
[117:17] B: But they never touched who I really am.
[117:19] A: They never touched me.
[117:20] B: They never touched me right?
[117:22] A: They mess with my stuff.
[117:23] B: They mess with my stuff.
[117:24] A: But they never got me right. Because who I am can only be touched with respect or the love I allow in. So they mess with my stuff, but they never got me right.
[117:39] B: Is that a poem?
[117:40] A: No, but it sounds like one.
[117:42] B: It does.
[117:43] A: Right? And now close your eyes and picture the earlier you when that stuff was happening and let her know what you know. Now it's over. It no longer exists. They never touched who you really are. They never touched you. That wasn't ever you. It was just stuff that you had been doing. That's right. And you're not what you do. There's so much more to you let the you know about being okay, changing your life for the better. Right. That her bio mom, dad that way had nothing to do with you, had everything to do with them not being well. Right. And even that adoptive mom loves you, but loves you in the way that a broken jukebox loves you. Just didn't know that you were dealing with a broken jukebox. That's why it hasn't mattered what button you press. Every time you try to be different and press the button you get the same same song. You keep thinking there's something wrong with you and it's just that the jukebox is broken. That's the only one they got. That's right. See, what if we're viewing her that that's her capacity. That's all that she's capable of. So I'm not left disappointed, hoping that this time she'll be more X or be more Y or be more. Be less X or be less Y. Right. But that's her capacity. That's her capability. Right? So that I'm not hoping that this time it's going to be different with her. I'm more expecting this is all that she's capable of. Right. Nobody thinks that the dog should be able to play checkers, let alone chess. Nobody's pissed off that the downs kid doesn't understand algebra. We go, oh, that's not in their capacity. Right. Nobody's pissed that the guy in the wheelchair isn't walking up the stairs. Yeah, we're going, what the. He doesn't have the capacity to do it. Got it. Right. That where it's been registered is her lack of capacity or capability means something about my lovability. And of course that would be the thing that got layered in because that's also how it felt with bio mom. Do you follow me with that? Like the meanings that got Attached when you were little. And that lack of attachment had it feel like it meant something about your lovability, whether you were wanted or desired or good enough. And as we're looking at it here, Tiffany, it had nothing to do with your desirability or your loveability, but had everything to do with them not being well. And you didn't know that they weren't well. You didn't know that it had to do with their capacity and their capability. But here's the crazy part in all of it. Because of the hand that was dealt, right, to your bio family and the one that you got adopted into, whatever. If you had to trade hands, if you got to trade hands, you could be any of the other participants in that thing. You could be bio mom or dad or this. Would you trade places? Would you rather be adopted mom than you, bio mom than you, bio dad than you? Huh? Isn't that weird that despite getting, you know, not the greatest hand in the world, you got the best one for you? Because you wouldn't trade, right? Even with the guy that had you strung out. Like there was your role in that and there was his role. Right. Would you rather be him? Isn't that crazy? Like, what would it be? Like what has to be going on in him or what happened to him that leads him to go, you know, it'd be a really good idea to do to another human being.
[122:14] B: Yeah.
[122:19] A: It'S crazy, right?
[122:28] B: Some people are just up in the head.
[122:30] A: Some people are just up in the head. Right? And you didn't know that then. Now you do. Mm, right?
[122:41] B: I would hope so.
[122:42] A: Right. Because it wasn't the Magic Kingdom, Right. It was what I was taken to the Magic Kingdom to do. The Magic Kingdom in Mickey Mouse is not the issue I was taken to do. Do you follow me with that?
[122:59] B: Yes.
[123:00] A: Right. Because you know, there might be some day that your 10 year old, as it gets closer, might want to go to Disney. And you know what's going to be really cool is that you're aware so you know how to steer your course away.
[123:19] B: At least I know where to bring her and where not to bring her.
[123:22] A: Do you get it? Isn't that a good news thing?
[123:24] B: Yeah.
[123:27] A: Right. Because the thing about Disney is it's all for pretend. When you see Goofy, it's not really Goofy.
[123:41] B: Yeah. There's some weird old dude.
[123:45] A: It's some guy playing Duke Goofy. So it's for pretend. When you see Cinderella or Belle or Ariel, it's not really them, it's just for pretend. Right? Right. So Just check in you. What are you noticing now?
[124:12] B: Hanging out. Sitting here hanging out.
[124:18] A: You are sitting here hanging out. Yeah. And as you're sitting here hanging out with. What are you noticing in you? You are. And notice how you don't spend a lot of time noticing what's going on in you. Sometimes you do. But now what we want to do is we want to apply it. So I want you to think about that advocate the one that kind of feels like they're like, you know, singling me out, and clearly they've lost their temper and they're new. Right. So they're probably not that great at it. They probably, you know, they've had a little bit of training. They're probably also, you know, like, you know, really in a seasoned.
[125:00] B: And she's a recovering addict and.
[125:03] A: Right. So probably has stuff.
[125:06] B: Yeah.
[125:10] A: Right. Right. So as we think of that, that what's something that typically might happen, you know, with her that normally will cause you to feel really frustrated?
[125:25] B: She goes on her little rant.
[125:27] A: So she might be doing what you might be. Where might be around the. The dining room table.
[125:33] B: In a car.
[125:34] A: You might be in a car, and she might be doing. Saying what? Like, what's her rant?
[125:39] B: Driving or in the passenger seat. I don't know.
[125:43] A: Everybody thinks so what might be a rant that she might go on?
[125:52] B: She, like, gets in bad moods and her knee always hurts and she's always, like, talking about her problems and just like.
[126:01] A: So she might be, like, complaining and telling how her body hurts and her knee hurts and this is.
[126:07] B: And like that.
[126:08] A: Right.
[126:08] B: And I'm positive poly. So we don't do that negativity.
[126:11] A: Uhhuh.
[126:12] B: I just don't like the negativity.
[126:14] A: So think about her doing that. Right. Feel some of the discomfort. Are you feeling it in your body now?
[126:21] B: I don't get tense.
[126:22] A: Yeah, but where she stresses me out. Where do you feel your whole body feels tense? Oh, I just get.
[126:27] B: She stresses me out.
[126:29] A: Like, I get that. Yeah. Well, how do you actually want to be whatever. What's it like for you when you're like, whatever, relax, relax. Right. So let's think of a you who's relaxed and like, whatever. Right. So it, like, turns down the volume and the intensity of her stuff. Got that right. And then do the same thing. Lower your jaw and notice how that'll water fix your yawn. It's really. When you lower your jaw all the way, it encourages a yawn or a deep breath in. Both of those two things down. Regulate the nervous system it's kind of like. And I don't think I shared this with you, but have you ever been around somebody who's like, hysterical crying, like Ryan, you. They're really upset and they do that double breath thing that's called the physiological sigh. And if you do it four times in a row, it'll down regulate the body. So we'll do it together. You breathe in. I'll show it to you first. And then at the top of an inhale, it's a quick breath in. So it goes like this. So do that.
[127:57] B: What is that supposed to do?
[127:58] A: It's gonna. We'll show you what it does to your body. You breathe in four times.
[128:09] B: Is that why after you do that, when you cry all of a sudden you. And wait. Long breath, fast breath out.
[128:18] A: It's a deep breath in. And then at the top of an inhale, a quick breath in.
[128:33] B: Don't make me yawn again.
[128:34] A: See, isn't that so good? See, Notice how it's already down regulating the nervous system, right? So as we're down, regulating the nervousness, and think about her kind of complaining about how her knees hurting. This isn't going well. And she's kind of frustrated by that and she didn't get enough sleep and whatever it is. And just notice what you notice. Notice the sensations. You can feel it in your body. Get curious about the sensations and just make the sound of curiosity go, hmm. Yeah, notice the sensations in your body and go, hmm. Right? And then make your eyes big. Because when you make your eyes big, it opens up the occipital frontal cortex and that brings your brain online again, right? And go, hmm. What do you notice happening to those sensations?
[129:33] B: What sensations?
[129:34] A: What sensations? Oh, they're not there anymore. Isn't that cool? So again, think about her. You know, there might be a time where, you know, she's on one of her soapbox things or, you know, going off on one of her rants and talking about her things, or, you know, complaining about this, complaining about that and how this doesn't work this way, and this is that. And how am I gonna. Whatever it is that she's doing, right? And feel again some of that annoyance or frustration with her. And it might even be one of those times where she's like, well, you know, I'm probably gonna have to. You need to stay here and talk to me. You're gonna lose a point if you leave. You're so good. See, notice what just happened. What are you noticing?
[130:16] B: She's gonna get mad when I laugh at Her.
[130:18] A: No, see, it won't work that way. But what I want you to. What I wanted to point out is you're laughing was how much that doesn't bother you.
[130:28] B: I hope not.
[130:29] A: Not that you're gonna laugh at her because it won't be appropriate for the situation. But you're. You didn't consciously decide to laugh, but your body did. Right. And another way of laughing is like, whatever. Like, so what? Because what's happening is these things are starting to read as information about them, not you, you. And that's where this has been off, is that a lot of stuff has been coming in at a feeling level. And feeling like it means stuff about you, even when you logically knew it had nothing to do with me, it's about them. And because of that programming that got installed with you little. Right, with bio folks and ants, that's what had that program running in you. That it felt like it meant stuff about me. Notice how you're now seeing that more as her stuff. Right. And as you're seeing it more about her stuff. When we interact with other people, we never learn anything about ourselves. We're always learning about that. I'm never learning about me. I might be learning about how they might be thinking or feeling about something I said or did, but I'm not actually learning about me. I'm learning about them. That makes sense. Right? So think of her. Right. Might be one of those times where, you know, you might be doing whatever you're doing and, you know, you try to make sure that you get right. Because, you know, the real emphasis is that I gotta get through this thing. But as we're looking at it clearly now, is it just about getting through this thing? I mean, definitely, we want to get through it.
[132:20] B: It's about me.
[132:22] A: Yeah. What if in getting through this thing, it's an opportunity for you to completely change the course of your life for the better for you and your daughter. Right. That you get to break the chain, the cycle. Right. That your mom couldn't do. Right. Isn't that cool? And that's why we're going through it. The other stuff kind of made it feel like I kind of have to a little bit. You follow me like, well, I'm court ordered, so can't really not do. Feels a little more like a I have to. But the opportunity is I could really grow and I can become a new version of me, a better version of me, a 2.0 version of me, 3.0 version of me. Right. That's what I keep doing. That's what I keep being interested in. I don't always get it. Right, but I want to be a better version of me than I was. I want to yell less than I used to. I don't get so fiery about shit. I want to be able handle things with more capacity. Right. And those are the things that you're going to start noticing. Because if you notice the things that would set you off, that would cause you to feel really annoyed and really frustrated were things a lot of times that you didn't have any say. Like you couldn't get it to be different. Right. Notice even just applying it to, you know, adoptive mom. Like, of course you can give me. Can you just go on my Facebook page, You're one of my friends, Pull the photo off, send it to me. Oh, well, I don't want to get in trouble, so I better check with him to make sure it's okay to send a picture of her. Right. And isn't that how she operates, adoptive mom? What about her? Isn't that how she operates? Yeah, I don't want to get in trouble, so I better make sure. Right. Isn't she. That's how she operates in life. Like she's pretty cautious and wants to make sure all the I's are dotted and the T's are crossed.
[135:07] B: Yeah.
[135:09] A: Makes sense.
[135:10] B: Yeah.
[135:11] A: So her not sending that to you, does that have anything to do with you?
[135:16] B: No.
[135:17] A: Right. Notice how in the moment, as you thought about it, even earlier today when you were telling me about it, it did feel. Isn't that cool? Right. And I can then even speak to that with her. Well, I know you want to make sure that you don't get in trouble. So instead of asking, I have already got it on my face, you can just pull it down from that because it would mean a lot to have a photo, even if it's an older photo of her. Got it. Notice how that's a little softer. Then why wouldn't you just send me? Like you can send me. I'm not gonna stupid yet. That's how she operates. She's like a by the books. Don't want to do it wrong. See, I know that rolling of the eyes. Tiffany was so perfect because you're like, yup. And that has nothing to do with you and everything to do with her. And when I learn that I'm learning about them and that it's information about them, you have more flexibility in how to respond to it. Because you can respond in a concerned, interested, caring. You could be firm, direct. You might not do anything at all. But we want you to have variability in how you respond to stuff. Right. Like even maybe with that advocate. I definitely will talk to you. I just need a few moments to, you know, gather myself and then I will. I get. It's really important to. Right as I'm saying all this stuff. I want you to just check what do you notice thing?
[137:20] B: Nothing.
[137:21] A: It's nothing. How's your body feeling as you're noticing nothing?
[137:25] B: Fine.
[137:25] A: No thess. We like. No thess. It's fine. Any thoughts going on? No, I'm not Cool.
[137:38] B: Don't know what time it is cuz I have probation. I'm freaking out.
[137:43] A: We have time. I'm managing it now. I managed it really well the last time too. To make sure that you didn't miss it.
[137:53] B: I just heard you don't always go according to plan.
[137:56] A: Well, on the front end.
[137:59] B: Dang it. How is this happening? What is going on with this water bottle?
[138:03] A: Sloppy water bottle drinker.
[138:05] B: It's not me.
[138:07] A: And unfortunately he just put water in it. It's tea. So now it gets sticky. Stupid tea.
[138:18] B: Rinse it out.
[138:21] A: Yeah.
[138:23] B: Stop it. See what is going on?
[138:28] A: Maybe the cap isn't on right.
[138:30] B: No, it's on right. I think something's wrong with the. You know, the sealant band thing.
[138:34] A: Could be that.
[138:35] B: I can't remember what it's called. I washed it with hot water.
[138:38] A: I think maybe the sealant is not in the right spot because you washed it.
[138:42] B: I just fixed it so I don't know how.
[138:44] A: Yeah, but sometimes when you squeeze it on there, it doesn't always go right.
[138:49] B: I'm not sure what's going on with this thing. I keep fixing it and it's just like not staying in the right spot now. It's rather annoying trying to drink my tea because don't let me forget that. I almost forgot it last time.
[139:11] A: I won't let you forget.
[139:14] B: Okay.
[139:18] A: You're so good. Yeah.
[139:25] B: I forgot I put the monitor in here.
[139:28] A: Isn't it an interesting thing, right? That whole world of like, you know, it's been hard to establish connections and trust because it's really hard to trust that the other person, you know, always has my best interest in mind.
[139:43] B: Because they usually don't.
[139:47] A: People will have your best interest in mind as long as your best interest has their best interest match. Yeah, right, True. See, what we want for you is we want the ability to discern. Right. A fire detector is useless if it goes off when there's not like signs of smoke. Cuz then we don't pay any attention to it anymore because it's like the little boy that cries wolf, there's a wolf and everybody runs out there. There's no wolf, there's a wolf. Everybody runs out. There's no wolf. Does it a bunch more times. Nobody's like, okay, whatever, this kid's lying when there's really a wolf. Fuck you. I'm not going make sense. So what you want to check with people is do their actions match their words? There's what people say, there's what people do. So. So do the actions match what people say? Because what you can always trust is what people do, not what they say.
[140:54] B: I should speak all words. What was I saying? What is it? I trust half of what I see and nothing of what I hear us are noises at.
[141:09] A: Yeah. And then the other part that we all want to understand because this is a crazy part, even if you think about that other advocate, everybody's behavior makes sense to them or they wouldn't do it.
[141:25] B: True.
[141:26] A: Right. So a way to understand other people is to begin to understand well what must be going on with them. That that's what comes to mind for them to do or what happened to them. Right. Because I don't know whether you realize the last part. What is that the circumstances that you got born into kind of groomed you to have the up that happened happen. You follow me with that. And now you can change and you already are because you chose to come to a program, you're choosing to do change work.
[142:19] B: I'm trying to go to school and I'll get spur.
[142:21] A: Phlebotom.
[142:22] B: Phlebotomy.
[142:23] A: Yeah.
[142:25] B: They're just worried I'm not gonna be able to find a job because I have two misdemeanors on my record.
[142:35] A: Okay. We're not there yet.
[142:38] B: Almost.
[142:39] A: I know, but we're not there yet.
[142:42] B: Definitely changing though.
[142:43] A: Yeah.
[142:45] B: They say a lot in the meetings is like old dreams awakening new opportunities around guys.
[142:50] A: Yeah. So true. Yeah. Right? Oh, a whole garden.
[142:58] B: I used to garden when I was younger.
[143:00] A: Did you really? How fun is that?
[143:03] B: They're like, is it? Are you new to this? I'm like, no, I used to garden.
[143:08] A: Yeah.
[143:09] B: I have a whole bunch of stuff growing.
[143:11] A: Nice.
[143:12] B: They're like, where'd you get all these seeds? I'm like, what are you eat every day? Seeds take it from food that we get.
[143:21] A: Yeah.
[143:21] B: Cuz they rely on grant me so seeds is not a priority. So I improvised.
[143:29] A: Yeah. So did you plant some at the house? What are you growing?
[143:33] B: I have Roma tomatoes. They flowered, so they're just about to grow. Tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, small cherry tomatoes. Seeds, large cherry tomato seeds, onions. I have some potatoes I'm about to plant.
[143:48] A: Nice.
[143:51] B: Scallions. Two apple trees, a lemon tree, yellow dragon fruit.
[143:59] A: Ooh.
[144:02] B: Strawberry and blueberry season. Doing anything. Cuz I guess I have to stratify them or whatever. You know, those, those. Those things just like a combination of honeydew and cantaloupe together.
[144:14] A: Okay.
[144:16] B: Apparently that's what it is. And I was like, I don't know. I think this is just a honeydew. But whatever, I'm gonna plant it and see.
[144:22] A: Okay, well, that's cool. Good for you.
[144:24] B: Yeah. Lots of stuff growing.
[144:26] A: Yeah. Well, you did great today.
[144:29] B: Yeah, thank you.
[144:30] A: I'm really proud of you.
[144:31] B: I'm kind of glad it's over. No offense.
[144:33] A: I won't take any offense.
[144:35] B: It's not you. And just a little. Yeah, I'm done for the day.
[144:40] A: Yeah.
[144:40] B: Ready to sign off?
[144:42] A: Well, that and just check how different things are. See, the thing that I want you to pay attention to is I want you to pay attention to what you can notice that's new and different in terms of how you feel in response to stuff. It might be in the moment where normally I'd be all, and I'm not. Or it might turn on and go right away. Or it might be after the fact that I think back and go, hey, normally I would have and I wasn't. I just want you to pay attention what you're noticing, that's different in terms of how you feel. Right, Right. Because notice how you weren't noticing how different the first thing was until I brought it up. Right. Look at all the ones that we did today and how that's changing wiring in your brain so that you experience other people's shit as being about them and you feel more space and you have more ease and you're able to go with more of the flow. It's not so hard. Edges on your way to becoming better versions of you getting free. You did great today. Thank you.
[146:06] B: Yeah, you did a great day.
[146:08] A: Awesome. We'll stop with that for now.
