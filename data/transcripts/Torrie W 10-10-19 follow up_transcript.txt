[00:00] A: Today is the 10th of October, Tori. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. Yes. That recording may be made available in teaching and training professionals. Given what we do is useful and valuable for you, I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:15] B: Yes.
[00:16] A: All right. So first, I'm really interested in understanding, learning. How did our last session leave you? What have you noticed for yourself? How have things been?
[00:26] B: It went great. It really did. Listen, I don't even get it. I don't. I told Christine. I was like, he's like a wizard. I mean, instantly, it was just bam. I had a whole month and a half before that. Just irritableness and just everything. And ever since then, it's just. I mean, I just. I can't explain it.
[00:46] A: It's like.
[00:47] B: Yeah.
[00:47] A: Yeah, it's great. Isn't that cool?
[00:49] B: Yeah, Yeah. I love it.
[00:51] A: Right? Yeah. So when you think about, like. And maybe you don't always think about. But if you do think about the stuff that we dealt with.
[00:57] B: Yes.
[00:57] A: What do you notice in terms of how you feel about it now?
[01:01] B: It doesn't bother me.
[01:03] A: Yeah.
[01:03] B: Yeah. It's crazy.
[01:06] A: Like the guy thing that happened at. What was it? The Safeway. Is that what it was called?
[01:10] B: Safeway?
[01:11] A: No, it wasn't Safeway.
[01:12] B: Oh, the sleep in.
[01:13] A: Sleep in.
[01:13] B: That's what you started with, an S.
[01:15] A: That doesn't mean the same thing. Right. Even when you think about what happened with mom and dad when you're five.
[01:21] B: Yes.
[01:21] A: Right. And the thing when you were a teenager.
[01:24] B: Yes.
[01:24] A: And then mom sending you.
[01:25] B: Yes.
[01:26] A: And even thinking about mom not wanting to have connection or contact right now based on her own gun.
[01:33] B: Listen, that's helped me tremendously. I was. Like I said, I can think about my family and this and that. Like, I celebrated my daughter's birthday. And your birthday just passed too, right? Yeah. Okay. My daughter's was September 30th.
[01:46] A: Yeah.
[01:47] B: Yeah. So I celebrated her birthday there. But I wasn't in a bad mood. I wasn't sad, even though, you know, so cool. It's nuts.
[01:56] A: Cool. What about thoughts about trafficker guy?
[01:59] B: Okay. I mean.
[02:03] A: You'Re so good. I love it. So good to see you. Good to see you.
[02:08] B: I. It's better. Like 10 times better. But I'm still constantly thinking about that. And I don't know if I'm necessarily thinking about that or the lifestyle in itself. I'm kind of daydreaming.
[02:20] A: Oh, right, because somebody bought you stuff with your money.
[02:23] B: With my money. Oh, yeah, right. About that.
[02:28] A: So good, right?
[02:29] B: Yeah.
[02:30] A: But it was great. He bought me stuff.
[02:31] B: I know.
[02:31] A: With your money, right?
[02:32] B: Yeah, exactly.
[02:33] A: You don't get to keep any of it. No, I mean, you get to work for it.
[02:36] B: Yeah.
[02:36] A: And heck if I've got somebody who's doing a lot of work for me, I'll buy him stuff, too, to keep them.
[02:40] B: Yeah. Then he takes it away, too, and gives it back. He does that.
[02:44] A: He would tuck away the stuff that he bought you.
[02:47] B: Yeah. With my money. I'll take your high.
[02:49] A: That's bullshit.
[02:50] B: I know.
[02:51] A: So what is it that you've been thinking about with him now around, like, lifestyle and all that?
[02:55] B: I just.
[02:56] A: Is it the Treasure island thing?
[02:58] B: Is it. I don't know.
[03:01] A: I mean, there's no treasure on that island.
[03:03] B: No, there's not.
[03:04] A: There is a Thunderbird, but no Treasure Island.
[03:06] B: There is a Thunderbird that I haven't even thought of. That's funny, right? I haven't even thought about that.
[03:18] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool? Yeah. And it doesn't even if you do have any of them.
[03:23] B: I just thought about it just now, and I'm fine.
[03:25] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[03:26] B: It's awesome.
[03:26] A: I know.
[03:27] B: I don't know how you do it. I don't know. I had to process. We did. But I had to process about this because I was just like, this is great, you know? Yeah.
[03:37] A: So tell me more about. What is it that you've been thinking or what do you want our time today to kind of be focusing on for you?
[03:43] B: Okay. Well, there's something I want to focus on that I really haven't even told anyone. Not anyone even at Salah, you know, so it's something that I've been dealing with that I tried to push it back. And I don't know if it. Okay, so when I was younger, really, I was like, older, though. I was like 13. My grandpa, my mom's dad, my pop. Pop, he like, molested me in a way, but I never did anything about it. It was like he always wanted to go to the Jacuzzi because my mom. Me and my mom got a big fight and I went to move with him and my nana and.
[04:18] A: And so he went and lived with Grandma. Grandpa.
[04:20] B: Yeah.
[04:20] A: For a period of time.
[04:21] B: For a period of time.
[04:22] A: And when you were 13.
[04:23] B: Yes.
[04:24] A: Okay.
[04:25] B: 13, 14.
[04:25] A: Did they live close?
[04:26] B: Yeah. To my mom. Yeah.
[04:28] A: Too. Okay.
[04:29] B: Yeah. Yeah. They were like. I mean, 10 minutes away. Wasn't it? Like my mom would still come every Sunday? Yeah. Still in palace. They were in Largo.
[04:36] A: Or, like, Marco.
[04:37] B: West Bay. Yeah.
[04:38] A: Yeah, I know that.
[04:38] B: So I know that whole area. Bel Air area. Yeah. Over there. So they. He would make me, like, get in the Jacuzzi with them at nighttime, and he would stick his fingers up, you know, And I just kind of, like. I don't know, I kind of went, like, numb, like, into, like, a. Is this really happening? You know, type of thing. And after that happened, he would always, like, it was just me and him home, like, try to walk around naked. I don't know. He was just very. Not what your grandpa's supposed to do. But, I mean, I don't know how else to explain it. I get awkward when I think about it. Oh, I know. I get very awkward when I think about it. Okay, I'm, like, sweating now, so I.
[05:24] A: We'll look at that. To stop, too.
[05:25] B: Yeah.
[05:26] A: So that you get free.
[05:27] B: Okay. Yes. And he. I remember telling my family. Mom. I told my mom, and she was just, like, not having it.
[05:37] A: You know, mom can't process computers.
[05:39] B: No. No one believed. No one believed it. My mom. If my mom says it didn't happen, and I was lying. So my whole family thinks that, you know.
[05:47] A: Okay.
[05:47] B: So after that, I just.
[05:51] A: Is that Mom's birth dad?
[05:55] B: No, it's. Mom's, like, adopted dad, kind of. I mean, stepdad. Okay. My mom's birth parents. My Grandma Connie had five sisters, and my nana is one of Connie's five sisters. Yes. And her husband is Kenneth. So when my mom was the youngest. I know my mom was the. My mom was the youngest. So she and my Grandma Connie couldn't, like, deal with all the kids, I guess. So my mom went to go live with Nana and Pop, who is really her aunt and uncle, but she calls him mom and dad. Nanner Pops.
[06:31] A: We have no idea whether he did anything with her.
[06:33] B: Exactly. We have no idea. But she. I mean, what she would think. No. You know, but my dad and my.
[06:41] A: Mom, the one that moved to Arizona.
[06:43] B: Yes. They. When I moved there, when I had the Treasure island thing happen, I moved to Arizona with my dad. I had, like, night terrors in the middle of the night, and my dad thought it was from what had happened.
[06:54] A: And.
[06:54] B: And he said that there's plenty of times that he walked into my room when I'm, like, screaming. I'm saying, no, Pop. Pop, no. You know, so he tried telling my mom that. My mom was like, no, you just meant. She just was defensive mode this whole time. So I literally, like, pretended, like, basically, like, they think I'm lying. I'm basically just gonna have to just, like, never bring it up again, you know? And so we'd still be doing family functions, and I'd have to be like, okay. Hi, Pop. Yeah. I love you. Merry Christmas. You know, acting like that, it was crazy.
[07:23] A: Uncomfortable.
[07:23] B: Uncomfortable.
[07:24] A: Like, way uncomfortable.
[07:25] B: Way, way. Yeah. Yeah. So weird. It's just. And I remember things like. Because I was always Pop Pop's princess. Like, he literally, like, I got everything.
[07:39] A: Even before 13.
[07:40] B: Yeah, even before that. So I don't know, like, if his. Like, it was, like, he always loved me since I was a little kid. And that grew into an infatuation when I started to, like, grow up and get developed. I don't know. I can't make excuses. It just. It wasn't right. And it's something I've been dealing with that I don't tell anyone because I told my. I told my mom and my dad, and they didn't believe me. So I never told dad. Didn't not. Not believe me. No, He. He. He knows.
[08:07] A: Right? Yeah, he actually tried to. Right.
[08:13] B: Yeah.
[08:14] A: And we don't know whether mom doesn't believe you or whether mom can't.
[08:19] B: Okay. Yeah, that's true.
[08:20] A: So there's a really interesting dynamic, and I want to kind of give this to you first, but then we want to do this stuff to get rid of the discomfort for you.
[08:28] B: Okay.
[08:30] A: Because what he did wasn't okay. We already know that it wasn't okay. But we want to get the discomfort attached to that happening then. And then the bad feelings that you have over having told. And people are like, no.
[08:42] B: Yeah.
[08:43] A: Like. Because then again, it goes back to, we want that bullet.
[08:47] B: Yeah, exactly.
[08:50] A: Cleared. It no longer has any of that stuff on it for you.
[08:54] B: Yes.
[08:54] A: But let me give you two kind of scenarios of different people that I've worked with and how things kind of showed up. So. So I worked with a boy one time. Not boy. He was, like, 26 at the time. And he had a trauma that had happened. And it wasn't just the trauma that had happened that was really troubling him. It was what his mom did after he told her about what happened. And so what had happened is his grandpa lost her, and I threw money at him and said, don't tell anybody. They're not going to believe you anyway. And for a long time he didn't. And then he finally got up the courage and, like, said it to Mom. And Mom's response to him in that moment was, you can't tell anyone that that happened. You need to pretend like that never happened. Now he's left with, like, this. I'm gonna tell finally, one person. I'm gonna tell one thing. They do this thing.
[10:04] B: Yes.
[10:04] A: So he's, like, stuck with this, like, all bad feeling. Now, what he didn't know at the time, which came out later in life, knows that happened when he was a kid. But later in life, it came out that that was actually his step grandpa, and he also molested mom. And the only way that mom was able to survive that was to pretend like it never happened. Because that guy was a small town, and he was, like, a powerful man in a small town.
[10:38] B: Yeah, right.
[10:40] A: The only way that she could survive. So as we were talking, it wasn't that she didn't actually believe him, and it wasn't that she didn't think he should. She was trying to give him the only tool that she knew to deal with that, which was to try to pretend like it never happened. Right. So that's the first one. Second one. I worked with a young girl one time, again, in her, like, early 20s, and she had told mom that uncle Tony molested me. Uncle Tony's mom's brother. And uncle Tony was older than mom. And, like, during that time, Uncle Tony kind of, like, operated more like that and, like, really took care of her. And so her response to her daughter was, don't you dare lie about my brother. And what happened was, like, right. It wasn't that mom didn't believe her. It's that mom couldn't believe her. Not because it didn't happen, but because of what it would mean about me that my own brother would do that to my child. Like, can't compute. I've had it with a grandma. Person told their grandma that grandpa did stuff. No. Grandma's like, no, that couldn't have happened. Now, again, Grandma made sure that she wasn't ever alone with grandpa again. But grandma never acknowledged that it did again because of what that would mean, that her own husband would do that to her grandchildren. Right. So people get really whacked out with that kind of stuff. But what we want for you is we want you to be free. Because it's not as if somebody at 13 goes, you know what would be really cool? I would like to get in the hot tub with this older man and have him do stuff to my body. And that'd be really fun.
[12:39] B: Yeah.
[12:41] A: No, that's not, like, the impetus that's going on. Oh, cool. So I'm developing and.
[12:49] B: Oh, great.
[12:49] A: I'm learning that older pervertedness yeah, exactly. Right. So what we want to begin to get is that you're not troubled. I know this is going to sound crazy again.
[13:03] B: Don't say it.
[13:04] A: You're not actually troubled because of what he did. And you're not even troubled because of how they responded to you telling them about what he did. The reason that it's so troubling now is that part of your brain doesn't know that that stopped.
[13:22] B: Yes.
[13:23] A: We want the part of the brain that doesn't know that it stopped to get that it's over. Second thing we want it to get is would you know, but don't fully feel. Is that happening? Wasn't about you. Them not being able to get it isn't about you. It's about what screwed up over there. And it just adds to another layer of why mom can't quite talk to you yet. Because mom operates with you out of lots of fucking guilt. Not just about how shitty of a mom she was, but how shitty of a mom she was.
[13:59] B: Okay. Yeah.
[14:03] A: You follow me?
[14:04] B: Yes, I'm following you. Yeah.
[14:10] A: Right. Yeah. Because her being different in any other way, like, she's got a lot of, like, feelings of like, it is totally on me that my daughter has gone. Gone down the path and had the things.
[14:27] B: Yeah.
[14:28] A: But she can't quite even be with that. Right. Like, that's at a deeper level. At a logical level, she's like, oh, people make their own choices and tries to rationalize it all out. But at that level, there's a lot of that there.
[14:41] B: Exactly.
[14:43] A: Makes sense.
[14:43] B: Yes.
[14:44] A: That's why as we talked the last time, you even know that there are many times that. And you used it to use, but got money, got stuff, got things from mom, you know, with the portraying of, oh, I'm gonna be, but I'm not.
[15:00] B: Yeah.
[15:01] A: Right. And mom, out of guilt was like, okay, let's do that. Make sense.
[15:08] B: Yes.
[15:08] A: So we just want you to be free from the impact that all that's had so that you're more at peace with your. So that you are clear. And here's the coolest part. Maybe the second coolest part. Because the first coolest part is like, you're getting free.
[15:24] B: Yeah.
[15:25] A: Second coolest part is you're making generational change.
[15:30] B: Generational change.
[15:31] A: Yeah. Because here's the coolest part. When you actually take care of this stuff that's been troubling you and you clear up the trauma for you, it actually has a both feet forward and backwards look, meaning in getting things better for earlier generations and making Things different for future ones. Do you know what's really, really common? I don't know how much you've done of your genogram is to be looking through the genogram and seeing how many others prior to me also had trauma, abuse, stuff happen along the way.
[16:04] B: Yeah.
[16:06] A: Right.
[16:06] B: Yeah.
[16:07] A: So as you get yourself healthy and well and no longer troubled, you literally are making generational change.
[16:18] B: That's cool.
[16:19] A: For generations moving forward and healing earlier ones. Because the earlier ones not getting those wounds healed is what led to the stuff happening in your generation. Follow me with that.
[16:34] B: Yes. That's cool.
[16:37] A: That's what you're up to do.
[16:38] B: Yes.
[16:39] A: In both ways.
[16:42] B: Okay. I like that. Yeah.
[16:45] A: So again, how do we get. So the you that I'm seeing, right. That kind of discomfort, the sweaty thing that happens that I'm seeing, she remembers feeling all those feelings, but if you asked her to get it, wouldn't even know how to get it.
[16:57] B: Yeah.
[16:58] A: It's gone. She's clear, she's at peace. She's good on the inside. She's good with herself. This is the you that I'm seeing. Got it. The you that I'm seeing has also got a whole other way of relating to them.
[17:15] B: Okay.
[17:16] A: So that she's no longer triggered by any of that stuff that they did or should have done that they didn't do or like, that's just completely wiped out and gone. Because the you that I'm seeing is clear, at peace and free.
[17:31] B: Yay.
[17:33] A: And as we're organizing towards this you, the question isn't how it's going to happen, but would it be okay? And we know that how we begin to organize the mind, we've got powerful symbols and we can use activators and we can also use brain lever. So the first thing we do is we get your body more into a state by having you slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, and then breathe in a way that your exhale gradually becomes longer. So that as you breathe in and out. Right. Notice just by doing that what starts to happen already in your body. Right. Notice how it's feeling a little bit more calm. Right. Because as your body becomes in a state of rest, it's accelerating the healing process. And as we accelerate the healing process, we're on our way organizing towards this. You and your unconscious knows how to do. Knows how to do the healing and is really interested in doing it. And what's so super cool, and this is a testament to you, because it's not something that you say or talk about because it got shut down and you've tried to put it out, but as things got cleared, you went, fuck, do this one.
[19:02] B: And you're like, oh, hey, I'm gonna.
[19:03] A: Get in so I can get this one. Yeah, right. How cool is that?
[19:06] B: Yes.
[19:07] A: Right. That's you advocating for you, making a difference for you, standing up for you. You interested in you, being free, healthy, healing.
[19:20] B: I like it.
[19:21] A: But that's all that's happening because you're.
[19:24] B: Doing that.
[19:28] A: Because this doesn't happen without you.
[19:31] B: It's true.
[19:32] A: That's right. Really collaborating and intending it with me. Right. So again, slightly lower your jaw. Rest your tongue. Breathe in that way. That's a little bit slower, a little bit deeper. Notice that you can see me. You can see my fingers way out here. And you can notice the space. Beginning to realize that no matter where you are, there's always more space and room. And as you're realizing that, beginning becoming more free, things are beginning to lighten and lift. Your unconscious is reorganizing and rewiring. Faulty programs that got installed not from you, but what got happened that got it installed inside of you so that you're aligning now with more of who you are. Clear, light, peace, free with flow and ease in dealing with stuff. That's right. You can see all that's happening because you can check in. How's your body feeling now? That's right. Isn't that a good feeling? Yeah. And so there's stuff that you know that the earlier you doesn't. But we want to get the moment cleared. And there might have been more than one with that pop up guy. But if we think of one at a time, you might have been like 13, you might have moved over there, you might have gone out to the hot tub. It might have been that. Right. And then you're in the hot tub. You might have been in a bathing suit. Would have been a one piece or two piece? Two piece bathing suit. Right. Good. And so you're in the hot tub and he's in the hot tub. Right. And then what happened next? Like Nana's like doing whatever she's doing.
[21:12] B: Nana was asleep.
[21:13] A: Nana was asleep. Good job. That's right. So Nana goes to sleep at 9. Yeah, that's right. So you went out to the hot tub. And of course, going out to the hot tub with somebody like that would have been like a neat thing to do.
[21:24] B: Yeah, right.
[21:25] A: And then what happened next?
[21:26] B: He gave me cigarettes.
[21:27] A: So you're in the hot tub. Oh, right. So he gets you cigarettes. Right? Right. Good. And so you're smoking, right?
[21:31] B: Yeah.
[21:32] A: And then what happened next?
[21:33] B: And then he put his hand on the leg.
[21:36] A: So he put his hand on your leg and that might not have been weird, but it would have been like. Okay, like kind of unusual, but. Right. And then what happened next?
[21:45] B: And then his hand slipped up and.
[21:46] A: Then it slid up. Right. And underneath. Right. Good. And he touched between your legs. And some of that might have felt good, but it would have been weird.
[21:52] B: Yeah.
[21:53] A: Because of course body parts touch in certain ways are designed to feel good.
[21:56] B: Yes.
[21:57] A: Not because I want it.
[21:58] B: Yes. Right.
[21:59] A: And see where people get that screwed up is they go, well, because it was feeling good. Does that mean that I wanted it?
[22:04] B: Okay. Yeah.
[22:05] A: Is my body betraying me? Did I kind of give indications that I liked it because it felt good, but I didn't want it because. Because it was that kind of following with that. That's what gets all confused. So he might have touched some of it might have felt good. He might have put his finger in your vagina. And then what might have happened next?
[22:23] B: I would get out eventually.
[22:26] A: Eventually. Like you'd be like, okay, dog did the shy gain.
[22:28] B: I guess.
[22:29] A: You did the what? Say more about that. What's the shy game?
[22:32] B: I would just like, oh, pop. Stop it.
[22:34] A: Right. Good job. So you're trying to like make light of it.
[22:36] B: Uh huh. Yeah.
[22:37] A: Good.
[22:37] B: Right.
[22:38] A: And then he finally stopped.
[22:39] B: Yeah.
[22:40] A: Right, Good. And then you got out of the hot tub and then you went back inside.
[22:43] B: Yeah.
[22:43] A: Dry shower, Took a shower and then went to bed. And then that time ended.
[22:47] B: Yes.
[22:47] A: And then later on you did something more fun.
[22:49] B: Yes.
[22:49] A: Yeah. What's something you've done more fun?
[22:51] B: I went to Jenny Springs.
[22:52] A: You did go to Jenny Springs. Was that cool?
[22:54] B: Yes.
[22:54] A: Did you like it?
[22:54] B: I loved it.
[22:55] A: Yeah.
[22:55] B: I'd been there before.
[22:56] A: Oh, I had never been there.
[22:57] B: Oh yeah. I've been there plenty of times. I remember.
[22:59] A: Yeah. So you went to Jenny Springs. Right. And that was way more fun.
[23:01] B: Yes.
[23:02] A: Right. So we got being in Jenny Springs.
[23:04] B: Yeah.
[23:04] A: Right. And then you were asleep and then you'd gotten out of the shower, then you took a shower, then you went in to take a shower. And then you got out of the pool hot tub.
[23:11] B: Yes.
[23:11] A: And then you're like, no, stop. And then he had been touching between your legs, and then he had his hand on your leg and then you were smoking cigarettes and then you guys had gone in the hot tub. And then before that he said, well, let's go to the hot tub. And in the end and fall asleep. And then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing.
[23:23] B: Yes.
[23:24] A: Right. And as we go through it backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it flying? Right. You can remember all that happened. Right. You can remember putting your shirt on. Tori, stop putting on your shirts. I am not putting on my shirt. Well, stop putting on your sandals.
[23:36] B: I'm not putting on.
[23:37] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt.
[23:38] B: You're not putting on your shirt.
[23:39] A: Well, stop him from touching your leg.
[23:40] B: He's not touching your leg.
[23:41] A: Stop him from reaching underneath your bathing suit. Stop him from doing that. Hurry.
[23:44] B: He's not.
[23:45] A: Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Right. Him doing that, did that have anything to do with you?
[23:50] B: No.
[23:50] A: Right. Had everything to do with him not being well. But you didn't know that then because it kind of felt like it did. He's kind of being nice and he's giving me stuff. Right. And that's kind of like the hard Christians. Do you know the hard Christians who make the thing and they give you the flower to try to get the donation. There's something about the law of reciprocity, which is if I give you something, then you're more inclined to give me something back. That's kind of how that works. Isn't that interesting? Yes. Right. So I'll use some cigarettes and maybe you'll. Right, right. Not because you wanted to.
[24:26] B: Yeah.
[24:27] A: But like that kind of already has that inclination. If somebody does something nice and you are inclined to do. That's just kind of how that thing works. Does that make sense?
[24:36] B: Yes.
[24:36] A: Right. So you can remember him doing that. You can remember all that happened. And we know that it had nothing to do with you. Right. And now that you is beginning to get it. That's right. So close your eyes and let her know a first at that moment's over. That him doing that had nothing to do with you. Everything to do with what was off with him. So that she gets it. Right. Let her know about going to Jenny Springs. Right. There you go. Notice how that's getting in now. There's another moment that's going to surface. Yeah. What's the moment that comes. Comes to mind now?
[25:15] B: Same moment.
[25:16] A: I don't know whether it's that one or something similar.
[25:19] B: I mean, it's close to that.
[25:21] A: It is close to that, isn't it? What's the thing that happened there?
[25:24] B: I mean, he walked around naked. The house. Yeah.
[25:28] A: So it would have been nighttime or this daytime. Oh, this is daytime. Good. And you're where in the house?
[25:33] B: I am in the living room.
[25:34] A: So you're in the living room like a kid. You're watching tv.
[25:37] B: Yeah, Right.
[25:37] A: Because that's what kids do.
[25:38] B: He let me stay home for school.
[25:40] A: Oh, good. So you stayed home from school and you're watching tv.
[25:42] B: Yes.
[25:42] A: Right, good. And then what happened next?
[25:44] B: And then he came out of the.
[25:45] A: Shower with nothing on and he didn't even have a towel.
[25:47] B: Yeah, they didn't have a towel.
[25:48] A: Right. And then he's walking around with that thing, you know, I want to see that. Yeah, right, good. Then what happened next?
[25:52] B: And then he's like, come on, come.
[25:54] A: On, come on, come on, touch it, touch it. Right, good. And then what happened next?
[25:57] B: And I.
[25:57] A: You're like, I don't want to do that.
[25:58] B: But I still played like that. Pop, pop, stop.
[26:00] A: No, don't do that.
[26:01] B: No.
[26:01] A: Right, right, right.
[26:03] B: Good.
[26:03] A: Cuz you don't want to like, be.
[26:04] B: Offensive, but like, because he's letting me stay home from school.
[26:07] A: Good job, baby.
[26:08] B: Letting me drink. He's letting me smoke pot.
[26:09] A: Isn't that an interesting thing?
[26:11] B: Yeah.
[26:11] A: So here we go again with that law of reciprocity.
[26:14] B: Yes. Wow.
[26:16] A: Right. Because if I give you, then you might be more inclined to. Yeah, Right. And so you might have touch it.
[26:22] B: I didn't touch it.
[26:23] A: You didn't touch it?
[26:23] B: No.
[26:24] A: Right, good. But he wanted you to.
[26:25] B: But he wanted me.
[26:25] A: And then he walked away finally.
[26:27] B: Yeah.
[26:27] A: Which was better.
[26:28] B: Yeah.
[26:28] A: Then he's asking you to touch it.
[26:29] B: Yeah, yeah.
[26:30] A: There's no girl at that age. I don't want to see anything. It's like the guy's good with the photo of the girl doing this. No girl wants that.
[26:38] B: Oh, no, I see that.
[26:39] A: Even the daylight.
[26:42] B: So true.
[26:43] A: That's right.
[26:45] B: Yeah.
[26:45] A: Right. So you can remember all that happening?
[26:47] B: Yes.
[26:47] A: You remember putting your hair in the pony? In the bun pony? Bun bun bun bun pony.
[26:52] B: I don't know what it is.
[26:53] A: Yeah. Putting your hair up.
[26:54] B: Yeah, there you go. I'm not putting my hair up and doing that. He's not doing that.
[26:59] A: I said. Then where is it? Satan no longer exists.
[27:00] B: Satan no longer exists.
[27:02] A: Right. Yeah. What starts to happen now? Right. And again that happening. Did it have anything to do with you?
[27:10] B: No, no.
[27:11] A: Stuff that was off with him. Right, right. And the you is getting it right. And again, another moment's gonna surface.
[27:20] B: Right.
[27:24] A: Doing great. I'm so proud of you. It surfaces because you're totally intending to be free.
[27:31] B: Okay.
[27:31] A: That's right.
[27:32] B: Yeah.
[27:32] A: And it happened when.
[27:35] B: I told my mom yeah.
[27:36] A: So you're where?
[27:37] B: I'm in her car.
[27:38] A: So mom had picked you up.
[27:40] B: Yes.
[27:40] A: Right. From school or from the house?
[27:43] B: From school.
[27:44] A: She got you from school. And now you're like in the driver or passenger?
[27:47] B: She's driving me back to Nana and pops.
[27:48] A: So she's driving you back to your nose. Pops and your going. You said, what?
[27:50] B: Stops at Publix on west.
[27:52] A: Stops at Publix.
[27:53] B: And I told her.
[27:55] A: And you said, you're like, in the car.
[27:57] B: In the car. We're in the car.
[27:58] A: In the car.
[27:59] B: Stopped public.
[28:00] A: And you said, hey, mom, he touched me.
[28:03] B: Yes. And she said.
[28:05] A: She said what?
[28:05] B: She said, how can you say that? And it's just because everything that I've been through.
[28:10] A: Good. So she says, how could you possibly say that about him?
[28:13] B: Yeah.
[28:13] A: Right. Given that they're letting you stay with him and admitted about it.
[28:18] B: Yeah, she said I just wanted attention.
[28:20] A: So she said, you just want attention. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[28:23] B: And then she got mad and dropped me back off there. She said she wouldn't talk to me.
[28:26] A: And then she dropped you back off. Good job. Right, then what happened next?
[28:30] B: And then I went home that night and Nana went to sleep.
[28:33] A: Right. Good job. You detail. Right. Then what happened?
[28:35] B: Told me to get in the hot tub. You're in the hot tub.
[28:37] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[28:38] B: He put his hand.
[28:40] A: He put his hand. And again, some of my. Not because wanted it, but because the word didn't work.
[28:44] B: Yeah, it's really weird. Yeah.
[28:46] A: Right? It is really weird, isn't it? Because notice how some of it did, but not because you wanted it. Yeah, but it's literally because a body part, that body part touching the way that it is designed to feel good.
[28:56] B: Okay.
[28:57] A: Right. Right. Isn't that weird? Right. But it's true.
[29:01] B: It's true.
[29:02] A: Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[29:04] B: And then after. Yeah. I just move all over the place.
[29:07] A: Right. Good job.
[29:08] B: Just kind of. Yeah. He kind of vagues. And then I get out and I go back to sleep.
[29:13] A: Right. Then you go back. Then that was over. Right. And then later on, you did something fun.
[29:18] B: Yes.
[29:19] A: Right. Like ride a dinner tube.
[29:20] B: Yes.
[29:20] A: Right.
[29:21] B: Good.
[29:21] A: And see, like the actual springs.
[29:22] B: Yeah.
[29:23] A: Right. But not alligators.
[29:24] B: No alligators.
[29:25] A: No. I'd be scared.
[29:27] B: Why?
[29:28] A: Because I don't really like to swim with alligators.
[29:31] B: Or snakes.
[29:32] A: Or snakes.
[29:33] B: I like snakes.
[29:34] A: You would be okay with a snake?
[29:36] B: I saw some.
[29:37] A: Okay.
[29:37] B: Yeah.
[29:38] A: Did you go up and touch them?
[29:39] B: No.
[29:40] A: No. I don't touch things either.
[29:43] B: I would have. I could get to it.
[29:46] A: He'd run away.
[29:47] B: I know. Water was too cold.
[29:53] A: That's right. Yeah. Yeah. So we've got being at Jenny Springs and then we've got going to sleep and then taking the shower and then getting out of the hot tub and then him stopping and then kind of moving around and then him doing that and going to the hot tub and then getting dropped off and then mom going, you just want attention.
[30:05] B: And.
[30:06] A: Right. And then you telling her at Publix and then her stopping at Publix and then picking you up at school. And then you had been at school. Right. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[30:16] B: Okay.
[30:17] A: Right. You can remember mom doing that, saying that. You can remember putting your glasses on. Well, stop putting in your glasses. Well, stop putting in your earrings. Well, stop mom from saying that.
[30:25] B: Mom's not saying that.
[30:25] A: Well, then you stop putting on your jeans.
[30:27] B: I'm not putting on my jeans.
[30:27] A: Well, stop me from kissing my daughter.
[30:29] B: You're not kissing your dad.
[30:29] A: Stop her from saying that.
[30:30] B: She's not saying that.
[30:31] A: So then where is it?
[30:32] B: Doesn't exist.
[30:33] A: That's right. That's right. And again, mom being that way, did that have anything to do with you?
[30:38] B: No.
[30:38] A: No. Did it do with all the fucked up shit that's going on with mom? Right. Because what we're really, really getting is that mom's not well. And mom can't see that stuff. Not because it's not true, but because of what that would mean. Right. Could mom even be with what happened to you on Treasure Island?
[30:59] B: No.
[30:59] A: No, she couldn't even be with it.
[31:01] B: No, she couldn't.
[31:02] A: Right. Which has to do with all the stuff that's happened with her, not you, because of what it causes and discomfort in her. She can't even be with it.
[31:14] B: Okay.
[31:15] A: That that would be happening. So she tries to pretend like it didn't. Yes, yes. And. But at another level, she's got all sorts of guilt over how crappy she was as a mom.
[31:27] B: Okay?
[31:29] A: I mean, how could you not?
[31:31] B: Yeah, it's true.
[31:33] A: Right. That's why she did things when you were in the state of using. Right? That's right.
[31:41] B: That makes sense.
[31:43] A: Right. And see, you know what, the other part that's starts goes on with mom a little bit as you get better. Mom now has to, like, look at mom. And that's when I'm comfortable for mom to look at mom.
[31:55] B: Yeah, it is.
[31:57] A: It is. It's not focused on me anymore. Right, Right. But here's the flip side, right? Because as you're getting that stuff cleared and realizing that it's not about me. And everything you do is screwed up with her. As you realize that at a deeper level, imagine the role. I mean there's the role that you got being you in this situation. But you know, I mean, just check it out. Is there anything that a 13 year old boy could do that would turn you on? No. Like what if he said you're hot? I mean, what if he goes, I like your ass?
[32:35] B: Okay.
[32:36] A: What if he flexes? Want to go see? No. What about mine?
[32:44] B: No.
[32:45] A: Right. 11:30, they're not going to do anything that actually acts as a turn on for you. Okay, Follow me with that.
[32:53] B: Yes.
[32:53] A: Because you're not into that.
[32:55] B: No.
[32:56] A: Right. So can you imagine being somebody that. That is something that turns you on. Like that's what comes to mind to do young girl who you've seen grow up through the years comes to live with you for a period of time and you're handing her cigarettes at 13 and you're trying to reach in, touch her body, let her smoke some pot. Go ahead and touch it, please. Imagine like that being the thing that comes to mind to do.
[33:33] B: Yeah.
[33:36] A: Right, right. Like how sad for him that that's what shows up to do. Follow me. Yeah. Which again is a very different way to be thinking about this.
[33:51] B: Definitely.
[33:52] A: Right. Like that's what shows up for him. Him sad. Right? It is sad. Yeah. And even with mom.
[34:04] B: Yeah.
[34:04] A: Because of mom's own stuff, Mom's own baggage of garbage. I can't even be with it because you know, you actually living there got along well with Nana. Nana was fine to be with.
[34:21] B: Yeah, right.
[34:21] A: And he wasn't actually bad until he started doing that shit.
[34:24] B: Yeah, yeah.
[34:26] A: Right.
[34:27] B: Because I always loved Pop Pop. He was popping princess.
[34:31] A: Right. Why would somebody like want to fuck all that up? I'm not having to live at this crazy ass house that I was living at where shit is crap and I'm living at a better place. Or I've got somebody who dotes over me and I got somebody who used to like really, really dote on me. Right.
[34:53] B: Dang.
[34:54] A: Dang. Right. Why would somebody be interested in any way, shape or form screwing that up? Why? Because she's selfish.
[35:03] B: Yeah.
[35:03] A: She just wants attention. No, you were actually getting.
[35:06] B: I was getting. Oh.
[35:11] A: You were. And going there and having people dote over you because when you first got there, it wasn't like any of that was happening right the first night. No, no. It took a little time and it was great actually being there. Because you got people who were nice to you and doting over you, and they didn't have anybody else there. And you were feeling cared about and taken care of and loved and nurtured and. Right. Yeah. Wow. Right. Right.
[35:42] B: That's crazy.
[35:43] A: Why? So it wasn't like you even wanted to have to say that to Mom. Follow me. Like, you would have been better. You would have loved it if none of that shit was happening there. This was better than living with mom at the time.
[36:01] B: Yeah.
[36:02] A: Cause mom got her own.
[36:04] B: Yeah, exactly.
[36:07] A: Right? Mom's got her own stuff. Mom's not love. Maybe she's getting better as she's gotten older, but she's got her stuff. Right? Right. What's happening now? See, that's a good time, huh?
[36:28] B: I'm thinking about it and I'm calm and I just. It's okay.
[36:35] A: It is okay. You're okay.
[36:37] B: I am okay.
[36:38] A: And you're getting free. Right? Right. Right.
[36:44] B: And.
[36:44] A: Yeah. Right. How old are your kids?
[36:52] B: Gracie just turned 11 and Chloe's 7.
[36:55] A: And where are they?
[36:58] B: Gracie is with my mom, and Chloe's in Arizona with my dad.
[37:02] A: Oh, very cool.
[37:04] B: Gracie sees Nana and Pop Pop all the time. Yeah, she's 11.
[37:12] A: I got that. I'm with you. You're with me.
[37:15] B: Okay.
[37:16] A: Yeah.
[37:16] B: Yeah.
[37:17] A: So is there anything that we can do to make sure that. Not alone time. I mean, with Papa.
[37:27] B: I don't know. I don't even talk to that.
[37:31] A: Thanks for always listening, sir.
[37:35] B: I know. So weird.
[37:41] A: The world we live in now.
[37:43] B: I know, right? I mean, I don't know. I mean, I know they're all in each other's lives, you know? I remember I brought it back up to my mom again after I had Chloe, because Gracie was five and she had told me. It's like a little Spam. And I had gotten sober and she had told me that, or Nana, my Nana said that she just loves her paw Pap so much, she won't let anyone give Papa. She won't let anyone give her a bath. But Pop Pop, when she comes on Wednesday nights, and I'm like, right then and there, I, like, freaked out. I told my mom, like, I brought it back up to my mom. My mom just, of course, ignored me again and I relapsed and never brought it up again. I had. I think I told my caseworker, but nothing was ever followed through with it.
[38:33] A: Yeah. So who had the birthday?
[38:37] B: Who had the birthday we need?
[38:40] A: You had a daughter?
[38:41] B: Yeah. Gracie.
[38:42] A: Gracie. So she just turned 11?
[38:44] B: Yeah.
[38:44] A: Okay. Did you see her?
[38:48] B: Did I see her. No.
[38:49] A: Okay.
[38:49] B: I just made a cake for her and celebrated.
[38:51] A: Isn't that awesome?
[38:52] B: Yeah. And all the girls at the house, we all sang Happy Birthday.
[38:56] A: Right? Yeah. So one of the things that we can be thinking about just as a strategic way to be handling and processing. So one of the things, based on my background in having a PhD in sexology, pedophiles tend to be very age specific. So a pedophile that is into 670 year olds is not into preteen prepubescent into puberty. Follow me with that.
[39:42] B: Yes.
[39:42] A: They tend to be very different. And a pedophile actually is not so much sex. Determined. Boy, girl. Because a seven year old boy and a seven year old girl don't look that different body type wise.
[39:55] B: That's true.
[39:56] A: Right. Penis, vagina, but not body type wise. They look very similar. Even same sizes. Right. So as we think about what was going on with you at 13, you were developing. Right. So you had begun to have boobs. You might have even had some hair. Other kinds of things were developing. Right. So do we know where your daughter is in any of that?
[40:29] B: I don't know.
[40:30] A: Like have we seen a picture?
[40:32] B: I've seen a picture. She's starting to develop.
[40:36] A: Just start.
[40:36] B: Yeah.
[40:37] A: Right. But notice when you were 13 and went over there, 13, 14, you were developing but developed.
[40:46] B: Developed. Yeah.
[40:47] A: I mean stuff might have gotten a little bit or moved around a little bit, but it was like already.
[40:52] B: Yeah.
[40:56] A: So what we want is we want you to have just in the background that I want her to be okay. Like I've coached other people where let's say a step parent had done something to them and now their brother has daughter. The idea is not that they don't get to go over, but they don't get alone time. They don't get to do sleepovers. Okay, follow me.
[41:27] B: Yes.
[41:28] A: Right. So however we can at some point we still have a little bit of a window. Because at 11 you're still in the pre pubescent.
[41:39] B: Yes.
[41:39] A: You haven't like fully developed. Even if you've started to get a.
[41:42] B: Little bit of a.
[41:45] A: It doesn't look like a boob. Like a boob looks like. Yeah, you follow me with that? Might have a little like a thing. We might wear a training bra.
[41:53] B: Yeah.
[41:54] A: But not because it's like whoa, look at. Yeah, it's not that. Right. So we have a little bit of a window and you're in the process of getting more and more. Well, and more and more. Okay.
[42:09] B: Yes.
[42:09] A: So it's not that I'm saying don't see. Don't interact. My request is no alone time.
[42:21] B: I don't know how to do that.
[42:22] A: Well, you had. And there has been some interactions with Stepdad. Yes. Stepdad, Isn't it Mom's husband on my stepdad.
[42:34] B: Oh, like talking to him.
[42:35] A: Yeah.
[42:36] B: Yeah. Well, Kayla talks to him. Yeah.
[42:38] A: Yeah. Okay, so there may be at some point, again, not right this.
[42:42] B: Not right now. I see where you're going with this.
[42:43] A: But as we're being strategic about how we move forward with things, maybe with Nana, maybe with just, like, not having alone time.
[42:54] B: Okay.
[42:54] A: You don't have to believe me that it happened in me. I'm wanting you to be protective of my little one.
[43:05] B: Okay.
[43:06] A: So can we, you know, make sure that there's not any alone time?
[43:11] B: I see what you're saying. Yes. Okay.
[43:14] A: Right. That's why I say we have a little bit of time. Because think about back. Because you might even have had a sleepover.
[43:21] B: Yeah.
[43:23] A: When you were a little girl. When you were 10. When you were 11.
[43:26] B: Yeah.
[43:27] A: Right. Before you fully transitioned into womanhood. Before there started to be. Period. Before there started to be the full development of body. And that stuff didn't happen then.
[43:42] B: Yeah.
[43:43] A: Follow me with that.
[43:44] B: Yes.
[43:44] A: Right.
[43:45] B: Okay.
[43:46] A: So she's just turned 11.
[43:48] B: Okay. So she's.
[43:50] A: She's not in.
[43:51] B: She's not in the zone.
[43:52] A: Right. She's not. She's not the target.
[43:55] B: Okay.
[43:57] A: Because it doesn't quite fit that mold. Because pedophiles tend to be very much age specific. Now, they can be intimate with adult, but when it comes to that, they tend to be more age specific.
[44:12] B: Wow.
[44:13] A: Isn't that interesting?
[44:14] B: Yes.
[44:16] A: Yeah.
[44:19] B: Okay.
[44:20] A: Men tend to age out of exhibitionism.
[44:23] B: What does that mean?
[44:24] A: Guy flashes himself.
[44:26] B: Oh.
[44:26] A: Which guys get in trouble for. Women don't. What? Did you know that? No, it's true. If a guy flashes his penis, the girl screams. The guy's like, dude, look, booze. The difference is the gal feels threatened and the guy doesn't.
[44:46] B: Okay.
[44:47] A: Right?
[44:48] B: Yes.
[44:48] A: Because the gal might think, oh, my goodness, this guy wants to rape me.
[44:51] B: Okay.
[44:52] A: Where the guy's not going. The gal wants to. No, buddy, look.
[45:00] B: That's funny. It's true.
[45:04] A: Wait, that gasparilla thing goes on and people do this.
[45:06] B: I know.
[45:07] A: Nobody does this. No, no, no, no, no. I don't want to see that.
[45:14] B: It's funny.
[45:20] A: Right. So you have a little bit of time, and you're going through programming and you're getting better, and we're getting things to be more Simple. So that you're more and more. Okay, so then you're clear. Right. And we even have a little bit of bad feeling for him that that's something that would come to mind to do. Isn't that interesting?
[45:45] B: Very.
[45:46] A: Right, right. Instead of just anger and hurt, I actually feel bad for him that that's something that shows up to do like that this guy who was like really nice and dope and all that then does that like. But see, he wouldn't dream of giving the 11 year old a cigarette now. Right, right. Because an 11 year old go, what is that?
[46:15] B: I know.
[46:17] A: Yeah, right. Where the 13, 14 year old go.
[46:22] B: You know, don't take a cigarette.
[46:23] A: Yeah, right. Someone would be cool. 11 year old still thinks parents are cool.
[46:28] B: Yeah.
[46:28] A: 13 year old goes, parents are fucking boring. Right. Every once in a while the 11 year old will look at the parent and be like the 13 year old. But not all the time. My little girl who's 10, almost 11 does that to me sometimes.
[46:46] B: Does she?
[46:46] A: She looks at me and I'm like, I do. Don't you give me that teenage attitude. You're not even old enough.
[46:54] B: You're not old enough. It's cute.
[46:58] A: Right? So that's the difference.
[47:01] B: Okay.
[47:01] A: She still doesn't look like she's turning into a lady. Okay, follow me with that.
[47:07] B: I follow you.
[47:08] A: Yeah. So that's why I say we have some time.
[47:10] B: So I have it in the back of my head that's okay. Right now.
[47:14] A: Right now.
[47:14] B: Right now.
[47:15] A: And it's something for us to be aware of so that we educate as we move forward.
[47:19] B: Okay?
[47:20] A: Right, right. And as you are doing the rehabilitation and getting yourself more grounded and more sound and more good.
[47:27] B: Yes.
[47:27] A: Right. That opens up lots of lines of communication because you don't even have to be hurting with mom because what's starting to get in is mom just wasn't well. And I can still be thankful that she's taking care of because my daughter needs him taken care of now.
[47:46] B: Yeah.
[47:47] A: And a grandma taking care of is always better than a mom taken care of. Because the grandma feels I get to have the second chance to do better.
[47:54] B: Yeah.
[47:55] A: Because I was really shitty the first time.
[47:59] B: Nailed it.
[48:00] A: She's a better mom to your daughter than she certainly was to you. Right. And that plays to your favorite. But as you get more. Well, as you get more grounded, as you get more clear and clean and grounded in your sobriety and moving forward and having your life work better for you, all of that stuff. Right. You have more opening and therefore the Conversation doesn't go in a mean, accusatory, hurtful, angry way. It's just more matter of fact. This is how it's going to go. I'm not telling you this because I need you to believe me. I'm telling you this because I want to make sure my daughter's okay.
[48:38] B: Yes.
[48:38] A: I don't care whether you believe me or not. But like honor, like what I want from my kid. Exactly. I don't care whether you. It's not about me.
[48:46] B: It's not about me anymore. You're right.
[48:49] A: Got it.
[48:50] B: I got it. That's great.
[48:53] A: Yeah. So what are you noticing now as you think about all that stuff? Stuff.
[48:59] B: Cool. Yeah.
[49:01] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[49:02] B: I know. I don't know how you do it.
[49:05] A: We do it.
[49:06] B: We do it. I know, but I feel like.
[49:10] A: Yeah. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. So one last thing. What's the lifestyle thing? The lifestyle kind of like fantasizing about, thinking about where there's like some desirability.
[49:25] B: I'll be. We'll be driving somewhere, anywhere, you know, and like, I literally just like, I'll pass. Like a Homewood Suites. Right. I'll pass there. And I like instantly go, like when I lived at the one, you know, in Clearwater, and I'm like, you know, I just, I start thinking about that and I'm like, oh, I love that hotel room. You know what I mean? It's like a little mini apartment and I just loved it. And then I'm thinking about, like, I start thinking about the people that would be in and out of my hotel room and it's. I know I'm disgusted with it, but I'm not. Does that make sense?
[49:57] A: Like, I would discuss with it.
[49:58] B: I mean, maybe not. Maybe there's not disgust with it. I. I want there to be disgust with it. That's what I mean. Yeah.
[50:07] A: Wow.
[50:08] B: Okay.
[50:08] A: Well, remember we talked about just a little bit in highlighting because you go, what felt good to me was the guy wanting me.
[50:17] B: Yes.
[50:19] A: Right. And as we were thinking about it, it wasn't that the guy was wanting you. The guy was interested in what you were going to do for him. That all the time it was about what you could do for them. Even the guy that was interested in maybe doing oral on you wasn't doing it because he wanted to do it for you. Like, as a generous, loving. I care about you.
[50:41] B: Yeah.
[50:41] A: He was doing it because it was a turn on for him. Right, right.
[50:48] B: Okay.
[50:49] A: And see, that's what we want, like, in addition to. So it's not Just that we go, oh, there's that separate. There's Homewood, Sweets.
[50:58] B: Yeah.
[50:59] A: We want to add the other pieces to the picture.
[51:02] B: Okay.
[51:03] A: Because when I see that picture, I only see that part.
[51:05] B: Yeah.
[51:05] A: I don't see that part with the other parts with it.
[51:08] B: Okay.
[51:09] A: The using some of the violence.
[51:11] B: Yeah.
[51:12] A: The guy. The other stuff. And the realization that. Because what felt good was feeling like they wanted me. Because for a long period of time, it didn't feel like I was lovable or people wanted me.
[51:29] B: Yeah.
[51:30] A: Right.
[51:30] B: Yes.
[51:31] A: And so you kept trying to get less outside of you, to fill inside where you felt there wasn't.
[51:39] B: Yes.
[51:40] A: Right. What we're starting to shift around for you, Tori, is getting that you are the light and lovable. And where the lovableness is in you and you loving you. Therefore, you don't need it from the outside. And that's what's starting to happen, is you're getting more good with you. That's what why I was like, yes, right. Because you're becoming more okay with you. You just got screwed up messages along the way. That wasn't your fault. That wasn't what you were doing. But it was the messaging that led you down the path that you got stuck moving down. And what's so really cool is somebody else outside of you saw something in you. That officer, when you had to go and explain stuff of what you had seen, saw something in you. And then you began to see something for you.
[52:33] B: Yes.
[52:35] A: To be dramatically different. To start to be more okay with you, despite the shit that's happened.
[52:42] B: Exactly.
[52:43] A: And that's what you're doing is becoming more okay with you. So that you're getting good with you. You. Right. And not like, you know, I gotta love myself, you know? But you are becoming more at peace and good with you. Which means I'm not so dependent on trying to get it outside of me. That's where the trickery was, is I was thinking they were liking me. What they were really liking is what I could be doing for them.
[53:20] B: Exactly.
[53:21] A: Right. And see, I'm worth it. So I want somebody who's into me, not because of what I can do for them.
[53:28] B: Exactly.
[53:30] A: And they might get really fun things that I can do. They're into me. Right.
[53:40] B: Okay.
[53:40] A: Because I'm worth it to me. That's what started to change. You saw somebody saw something in you. And then you began to see that you're worth it to you.
[53:51] B: I get it.
[53:53] A: And that's what's starting to be coming out. That's why you're getting more peace. That's why that's becoming easier. That's why you're not so agitated and irritated, because you're becoming more good with you. More at peace with you getting your own worth. Yes. Lightening up.
[54:15] B: I know, right? I love it.
[54:19] A: Cool. Cool. You're doing great.
[54:21] B: Thank you.
[54:22] A: I'm so super proud of you.
[54:23] B: Thank you. I'm so happy. You're still a wizard to me, but it's okay. Yes, I know.
[54:31] A: Yeah. Yeah. Well, cool. All right. So anything else left for today?
[54:37] B: Not that I can think of.
[54:38] A: Okay. We'll be able to get back together again for sure. Yeah, absolutely.
[54:42] B: There'll be more stuff.
[54:43] A: You've done great.
[54:44] B: Thank you.
[54:45] A: I'm so proud of you.
[54:45] B: Thank you.
[54:46] A: All right.
[54:46] B: Yay.
[54:47] A: We'll head on out and.
