[00:00] A: Alright, so today is the 9th of December, Tori. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that that recording may be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:14] B: Yes.
[00:14] A: Alright, so first I want to get a sense. How did our last session leave you? What have you noticed for yourself? How have things been?
[00:22] B: Things have been great. To be honest. I haven't had any troubles or any problems with like anything at all.
[00:29] A: Awesome.
[00:29] B: Yeah.
[00:30] A: Yeah. When you think about like the last little piece like that had to do with like step grand, all that kind.
[00:37] B: Of stuff, like, it doesn't bother me.
[00:39] A: Isn't that cool?
[00:40] B: Yeah.
[00:40] A: Yeah.
[00:41] B: It's so weird.
[00:42] A: Yeah. And we know that we've got a little time before there's anything that we need to be concerned about. With your oldest.
[00:48] B: Yes.
[00:49] A: She is your oldest, right?
[00:50] B: Yes. And she's 11.
[00:52] A: Eleven.
[00:52] B: Yeah, that's right.
[00:54] A: I have a little one that's turning 7 on Wednesday.
[00:59] B: My youngest just turned 7 and then.
[01:01] A: The other one turns 11 January 6th.
[01:03] B: Oh, wow. See? Aw, that's so cool. I have a 7 and 11 too.
[01:08] A: You do?
[01:09] B: Yeah.
[01:11] A: Awesome.
[01:11] B: Yeah.
[01:12] A: All right. So things have been going over.
[01:13] B: Things have been like perfect. I mean, I want to say perfect, I guess, you know, but things have been great. Like I haven't been triggered by anything. I mean, I don't.
[01:23] A: Isn't that cool?
[01:24] B: Yeah.
[01:24] A: How are you progressing? Where are you in phases?
[01:27] B: I'm in action.
[01:28] A: I should be in action.
[01:30] B: Yeah, I should be in action, which.
[01:31] A: I love that they call it in action.
[01:32] B: In action.
[01:34] A: In action. Wait a minute. I'm. Which means I'm not in action at all. But I'm in action.
[01:39] B: But you're in action.
[01:40] A: In action. Not I'm in action.
[01:43] B: Yes. I signed up for school, So I start January 6th.
[01:49] A: Wow. What are you gonna do?
[01:51] B: Get my AA and then they have. At SCF, they have a fuse program to go to USF.
[01:56] A: What? A fuse program?
[01:57] B: If you get your AA SCF, you're automatically guaranteed admission to USF.
[02:02] A: Cool.
[02:03] B: And then I'll get my bachelor's in sociology.
[02:06] A: In sociology? Yes. What do you want to do with that then?
[02:09] B: I mean, I want to work for Sala. I want to work with Sala.
[02:11] A: Why don't you get a bachelor's in social work then?
[02:13] B: I mean, I could. Sociology is like the study of people, right?
[02:17] A: Yes.
[02:18] B: Okay.
[02:19] A: But see, social work gives you more. So sociology is great if you want to do Research and all of that kind of stuff. If you want to work with people and still understand people. So the thing about social work that I think is different than other like programs for mental health. Social work isn't just about mental health or mental health counseling. Social work, in a similar fashion to sociology, looks at a person in their environment. So where a lot of mental health stuff looks at pathologies, social work comes from a strength based perspective. Let's look at what the person already does. Well, yeah, there are those things. What do they do well, what can we enhance about that? Let's think about the person isn't the sole thing. It's the person in their environment. So do we need to make adjustments to their environment? Do we need to make adjustments to person? Right. And with social work, you can go into criminology, you can go into things like what SALA does. You can go into things like Department of Children, Families, other kind of welfare. You can work in a variety of different nonprofits. All sorts of things you can work in like I did school system. And the other thing about getting a bachelor's in social work is if you ever decide to want to get a master's. Once you have a master's, you can be licensed, do kind of what I already do. It only takes an additional year.
[03:53] B: What?
[03:54] A: So normally master's programs are two years.
[03:56] B: Yeah.
[03:57] A: But with a bachelor's in social work, you get what's called an advanced standing. So that enables you to only have to go to school for an additional year to get your master's.
[04:10] B: That seems a lot better.
[04:11] A: So that's just something I know that's way down the horizon.
[04:14] B: Yeah, it is.
[04:15] A: But you kind of want to look at if I want to do stuff that's in the helping profession. Social work is really geared towards doing stuff in the helping profession. And it comes from so much more of a strength based perspective in getting people well and all of that kind of stuff.
[04:31] B: Okay, I like that.
[04:32] A: Yeah.
[04:32] B: Okay.
[04:33] A: Yeah. And you can still take sociology classes.
[04:36] B: Yeah.
[04:36] A: And understand that because that some of it is going to be part of that advocacy. You can also do with social work. So there's a whole program. There's a clinical track, which kind of is what I went on. And then there's an administrative track.
[04:49] B: What do you mean?
[04:50] A: Like, so like you could work for social justice, you could do advocacy in law, you could do a variety of different things.
[05:00] B: Okay, okay. Yeah, I know what you're talking about now because I'm doing that victim's advocacy training online. So it's in many different genres.
[05:10] A: Exactly. But also would be something that backs up, like I got a background in social work. That also backs up what I'm doing as a victim.
[05:19] B: Okay.
[05:20] A: Again, that's also looking from a strength based perspective and person in their environment. Because we can't just look at the person.
[05:27] B: Yeah.
[05:28] A: To look at the person and the environment. Because we know. Just think about it. Two people come out of. Get born on the same day, but they grow up in completely different environments. A lot of their environment will shape how they turn out. Right. So if I grow up in an environment where there might be more domestic violence, if I grew up in an environment where there might be more abuse, if I grew up in an environment where there might have been a history where maybe my mom and her mom had sexual abuse happen. Well, the likelihood that all stems in an epigenetic way through the cycle of the environment which you grow up.
[06:13] B: Okay.
[06:15] A: Versus just looking at the person. We kind of look at it from a bigger environment.
[06:23] B: Okay.
[06:24] A: Yeah. That's why somebody can go, let's say, to a treatment center and get rehab, but they go right back to the same environment in which they were using. What's the likelihood of them using again?
[06:35] B: 100%.
[06:37] A: So we have to not just change the person, we also have to work on changing the environment in which the person is living in.
[06:45] B: Okay.
[06:46] A: That matters.
[06:48] B: Definitely. Isn't that the truth?
[06:52] A: It does. It really does. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Have you had any other interaction with, like, the person from Tampa and the whole thing about knowing about the homicide or any of that kind of stuff?
[07:06] B: No, I mean, I. They haven't talked to me. Yeah. I mean, I. When I meet with Dee Dee or whenever I see Dee Dee, she's like the detective. She just says, you know, Detective Kenny gives her love and stuff like that.
[07:17] A: But.
[07:18] B: Yeah. But.
[07:19] A: Yeah. Have you. Did you have to testify or anything?
[07:22] B: Eventually I will.
[07:23] A: You will? Okay. At some point.
[07:24] B: At some point.
[07:25] A: Okay.
[07:25] B: Yeah. So eventually I will. I just.
[07:28] A: The person who did it, that is, he caught jail, all that.
[07:31] B: God, I don't even know. I choose not to know. I've been thinking about it a lot.
[07:36] A: Lately because this is what I wanted to check on. Because one of the things that you had said was, although I know he's not a good guy and not a good guy for me, at one point you were having thoughts about, well, like, you know, he could be getting out of jail and like, you know, maybe I would be.
[07:51] B: That's. That's.
[07:53] A: Different guy.
[07:54] B: Different guy. Yes. Okay. Someone gets confused yeah, he. This is funny. I've been having dreams about him lately.
[08:03] A: Which one?
[08:04] B: This one.
[08:04] A: Solo.
[08:05] B: T.J. right. The one that got out of prison. Yeah. And he's the one that it was like, I just in love with, you know? And I've been having dreams lately. And I had a dream last night, and it was the craziest thing to me. I don't know why, but, like, he was so morbid. He was telling me to, like, kill these people, but it was. I was shooting them up with something. And I don't know if that goes to the homicide because Red had shot her up with a bad shot. But, like, literally watching them, like, I'm shooting them up. I remember. And I could see their heads, like, in the car. So they sit in the car and, like, go like that.
[08:41] A: Yeah.
[08:42] B: And it just, like, really freaked me out. Like, I woke up in a panic last night.
[08:46] A: Yeah.
[08:46] B: And then when I went back to sleep, I was trying to use the same needle, same rig to shoot up for myself. And I haven't had using dreams or anything in a long time. And it wasn't. I don't even know if it was using dreams. I was just trying to rinse it out so I wouldn't shoot myself with the bad stuff and make myself die. And then I woke up. So I don't know. But lately I've been dreaming about him a lot. Like, that last night was just really weird. And I try and read into dreams all the time. Sometimes they just don't. I, like. I want to dissect them. I'm a very vivid dreamer. I dream every night. I can wake up, go back to sleep, continue my dream, you know, so. But lately it's just been, like, times, like when. And he's totally ignoring me. In my dreams, he's ignoring me. He's being a dick. You know what I mean? I don't know. But lately it's just been happening. But I wake up and I'm kind of fine. Like, it's not bothering me.
[09:47] A: Right. Which is better.
[09:49] B: Which is great. Yeah. You know, and it was. Yeah. So it's not like I wake up and I'm like, oh, I got this and that. No. What I was disturbed about was that I was, like, killing people in my dream. And then in my dream, like, I was aware that I was doing it. And I'm like, oh, my God, Jesus, forgive me. You know, like, freaking out like that. Like, why would I do that?
[10:15] A: Do you ever. With the dreams that you get because they're vivid.
[10:18] B: Yes.
[10:19] A: Do you Ever wake up in it?
[10:21] B: Wake up in my dream and realize I'm dreaming. Yes, that happens occasionally.
[10:26] A: Okay. Do you know what that's called?
[10:28] B: No.
[10:28] A: It's called lucid dreaming.
[10:30] B: That's what lucid dreaming is.
[10:32] A: Lucid dreaming is when you wake up and you realize that you're in a dream.
[10:36] B: Yes.
[10:37] A: That you're dreaming the dream.
[10:38] B: Yeah.
[10:39] A: But you're also kind of lucid.
[10:41] B: Okay, yes, that happens. It happens. Not a lot, but it happens sometimes. Like I know I'm dreaming. Like I wake up and I'm like I'm dreaming, but I still dream. I don't know. It's weird.
[10:53] A: Yes. Right. Okay. So in dreams, dreams are interesting because you can actually direct how a dream goes.
[11:04] B: Okay. Yes.
[11:05] A: So when people tend to have disturbing or troubling dreams, they're at the effect of the dream. Disturbing, troubling dreams have negative things happen. Have me feel like I'm either in a frozen state where I can't move, or I'm trying to get away state, or I'm trying to fight, but it's helpless state. Those are the tendency to be disturbing dreams. A part of our brain that dreams is the part that's like an animal.
[11:34] B: Okay.
[11:35] A: So the. That's why they don't make logical sense. They're not along a timeline. Right. That's why I could be sleeping in my childhood room, but in the bed that I'm in now.
[11:47] B: Yes, yes.
[11:50] A: And my childhood house had an upstairs, but it doesn't. Although I am in the upstairs bedroom, but like downstairs. Because I didn't go downstairs. It just. Just kind of walked out and I was already on one floor, like.
[12:02] B: Exactly. That's funny how you say childhood house because like, even last night in my dream, I was at my mom's house. Like, I walked back in and it was her garage. And I walked into my room and I was. Yeah, yeah.
[12:13] A: Like, I will have dreams sometimes where I'm in my childhood room. And my childhood room at one point was small. And then we. They put on an additional. They build a garage and then a room above it and they move the master.
[12:29] B: Okay.
[12:29] A: So then I had a small room, there was a spare room and there was the master. Well, they changed their old master into the spare room and they knocked the wall out. So then I had a really long, like rectangular room all at the front of the house. So there are times that I'm like in my room and then it's like the small room and my closet. When I was a little kid, they had built it so I had a ladder and they had a flat thing. So, like, up on top of where the clothes would hang was a little, like, alcove. That was like, my little secret thing.
[13:03] B: Okay.
[13:04] A: I had a little light that I could turn on. I could go up there and do whatever.
[13:08] B: Yeah.
[13:10] A: But that clearly got destroyed when they knocked out the wall. So there will be some times that I'm up there, which I wouldn't fit that.
[13:18] B: All right.
[13:19] A: But I'm up there. But the room is the long room. And my bed that I am in now is over there. Not the bed that I had when I.
[13:29] B: When you were younger. That is so weird. I do that too. Like, I do that. Like, with my. It'll be like. Okay, See, for instance, my parents, they added on to another for. To make a master bedroom as well. And so. But my mom, it was by the garage, so she wasn't having it. So I moved into that room. So when I moved into that room, I had my own bathroom, everything. But it didn't have a closet, so I had to have one of those, like, fake closet. What do they call it?
[13:59] A: The armoire.
[14:00] B: Yeah, that type thing like that. Yeah. Wasn't as fancy, though. But, you know. But I had one.
[14:04] A: That's the name of it.
[14:05] B: Yeah.
[14:05] A: You might not be looking fancy. It's an armoire.
[14:12] B: Like, for instance, last time I was looking for stuff, and. And it was stuff that I have now, like my purse, or it's just stuff now, but I was looking in that closet thing.
[14:20] A: Right?
[14:21] B: Yeah, yeah.
[14:22] A: They don't make sense.
[14:23] B: No.
[14:23] A: Right. So that's why the timeline gets distorted.
[14:26] B: Okay.
[14:27] A: Because the part of the brain that's dreaming has no relationship to time. It's perpetually all at the same time. Right. An animal doesn't have the concept of today, tomorrow and yesterday. An animal isn't thinking about something they're gonna go do next year. They're not planning for it. Even the squirrel who hides the nuts isn't thinking, well, I'm hiding these nuts. So that next February, Right. They don't. They don't know what time it is. You can't go to the dog. So what time is it? What'd you do today in religion? No clue. Because they have no past based. They're always perpetually now. So think of it like a dog may have a conditioned response because people go, dogs have memories. I go, not like human beings. So the dog, when you take your belt off to go hang it up in your closet, may wince. Because maybe at one time the dog, prior to being Adopted by you was hit by somebody who hit him with a belt, but the dog. So the dog goes, belt means. Okay, but the dog isn't having a flashback traumatic response to the other person who used to hit him with the belt. They just have the conditioned response that belt means hurt.
[15:51] B: Hurt. Okay.
[15:52] A: Does that make sense?
[15:53] B: Yes, it does.
[15:54] A: So that's very different than I have a memory of it.
[15:57] B: Okay.
[15:58] A: Dogs have like really short term memories. It's why if your dog poops and you catch it right away, you can show the dog. No, no, don't do this. But if you came home and the dog had pooped in the middle of the kitchen, you can't three hours later take the dog up and go. Dog's like, are you.
[16:19] B: Oh, really?
[16:20] A: Dog doesn't have that recollection.
[16:24] B: That's why it never worked in the past.
[16:26] A: Because we've got to catch it right away.
[16:28] B: Okay. Yeah.
[16:29] A: Makes sense.
[16:30] B: Yes.
[16:31] A: So dreams. If we know that we have dreams, we can make a request at night to have certain things get resolved. Right. So I might say to myself, unconscious mind, as I peacefully sleep and dream tonight, resolve whatever upset that I had going on earlier today.
[16:55] B: Okay.
[16:55] A: But I make the request of while I peacefully sleep and dream. Right. If I want to wake up, I might say unconscious mind, as I'm again peacefully sleeping and dreaming, let me be awake in my dream so that now I can have a lucid dream. And then I could fly, which can't really fly, but I could go for a goal. Yeah.
[17:23] B: Those ones are the best, right? Yes, right. Like I just get like a little running and start and I'm up.
[17:28] A: That's right.
[17:29] B: And then sometimes like I'm trying to run and do it and I only go a little bit, right?
[17:32] A: Yeah, right.
[17:33] B: It's so weird.
[17:35] A: But that's the whole thing of like, I could request what I wanted to do by as I'm laying down at night before I go to sleep. Unconscious mind, while I peacefully. And that's the key thing.
[17:48] B: Unconscious mind while I peacefully sleep and dream.
[17:54] A: And then whatever the request is, sometimes it might be resolved. Sometimes I might say integrate all my new learnings. Like if I was at a training.
[18:04] B: Oh, okay.
[18:05] A: Sometimes I might say I want to be awake in the dream.
[18:08] B: Okay.
[18:09] A: So I can begin to practice that.
[18:12] B: Wow.
[18:14] A: Add some components to it. Right?
[18:21] B: That's cool.
[18:22] A: Yeah, that is cool.
[18:26] B: So really. So if I do that, I won't have. I'll dream what I want to dream?
[18:40] A: You will have more of a yes.
[18:42] B: Okay.
[18:43] A: To dream the dreams that you're interested in dreaming.
[18:46] B: Okay. And not have.
[18:48] A: Right. It was really. For a good chunk of time, I didn't remember dreams. I didn't remember that I was dreaming. And so. So for me, I thought I wasn't dreaming. And it would be sad to think that I don't have any dreams like dreams in life, dreams and aspirations. And I did some work and shifted some stuff. And since then, I now dream and sometimes remember my dreams, which I didn't always remember my dreams, but I sometimes will remember my dreams. And when I do this practice of putting in, I have much more fluidity with my dreams.
[19:28] B: Okay.
[19:31] A: Which is kind of neat. It is neat because it's a whole nother. I mean, in aboriginal cultures, they don't distinguish between dream state and sleeping state. See, how do kids learn? Like, when they're four, they wake up, they maybe had a bed dream. They don't have a distinction between dream state and awake state until their parents tell them, oh, no, no, that wasn't real. That was a bad dream. Little babies who sleep 18 hours a day, they're literally dreaming themselves into existence. What?
[20:15] B: I love that.
[20:16] A: Isn't that interesting?
[20:17] B: Yes.
[20:17] A: Right.
[20:18] B: What?
[20:19] A: Because that's where it starts coming from. I'm dreaming myself into existence. Yeah.
[20:26] B: It's really cool.
[20:27] A: Yeah. Yeah. So even though you sometimes have had dreams.
[20:32] B: Yes.
[20:33] A: Have there been any interest in, oh, no, I gotta be with that guy?
[20:36] B: No.
[20:37] A: Oh, isn't that cool?
[20:38] B: Yes. It's amazing.
[20:43] A: Right. Isn't that good? Right. Because what's crystal clear is that it wasn't being done for me. Right, Right. And the nice things that he got from me was out of, like, you know, what I was providing.
[20:56] B: Yes. Came from me.
[20:58] A: Right.
[20:59] B: Yeah, Exactly.
[21:00] A: Here's all this money that you made. Let me go ahead and give you a nice present so you get to feel good.
[21:04] B: Yeah. So weird. I.
[21:11] A: Right, right, right. And he didn't do that thing to the other guy to protect you?
[21:16] B: No.
[21:16] A: Right. The other guy screwed up. Screwed with his property. And you're not property. No.
[21:24] B: No, I'm not.
[21:26] A: Right. You're worth more way, way more than that. To you. That's right. Isn't that cool?
[21:32] B: Yes.
[21:32] A: That's why you're looking forward to, like, new opportunities.
[21:35] B: Definitely.
[21:37] A: Like, going to school. Right.
[21:38] B: Trying to get a job.
[21:40] A: Yeah. Where are you looking for?
[21:42] B: I have no idea. I mean, I applied at Southeastern, but, like.
[21:47] A: Okay.
[21:48] B: I don't know. Their partnership thing is kind of not scarce right now, but kind of, like.
[21:56] A: Not as much. Opportunity.
[21:58] B: Yeah.
[21:58] A: Kind of full.
[22:00] B: As in, like, I Know, they have one with goodwill, but goodwill, the hours. And they don't want to do any more fifis. They want ILP people, so they want graduates. I'm trying to get one at first watch, but I'm not sure. So I'm just. I finished my employment workshop and just kind of going with the flow now. But I'm looking forward to all these things.
[22:20] A: Yeah. Well. And the good news is we're not that far away from school starting. I mean, because we go through the holiday stuff, and it's like that. Like that in particular, more so when Thanksgiving is as late as it was.
[22:36] B: It was late, wasn't it?
[22:38] A: Right. Because Thanksgiving was what, the 28th?
[22:40] B: Yeah.
[22:40] A: And then it was Christmas.
[22:42] B: I know.
[22:44] A: Okay. It's December 1st now. December 1st already.
[22:47] B: I know.
[22:48] A: Now it's already December 9th, and now it's December 9th. Right. And then we've got. Literally, Wednesday will be two weeks until Christmas. And then we've got another week for New Year's. And then you got another week, and then it's. School starts on the 6th. Right. So literally, you've got four months or. No, four weeks and two days.
[23:12] B: Yeah.
[23:14] A: Before you're in school.
[23:15] B: That's really cool.
[23:16] A: And that goes fast.
[23:17] B: That goes really fast.
[23:18] A: Yeah.
[23:19] B: I'm excited. I see. Excited. You know what I'm excited about? Like, I've always depended. I was always dependent on someone, you know, in my past, and I'm not anymore.
[23:31] A: No. And, like, who are you depending on?
[23:33] B: Myself.
[23:33] A: Yeah.
[23:34] B: Yeah.
[23:34] A: Isn't that cool?
[23:35] B: Yes.
[23:35] A: Right. And others can contribute.
[23:38] B: Yes, definitely.
[23:40] A: Which is different than I'm dependent on them.
[23:42] B: Exactly. Yes.
[23:44] A: Yeah, I know.
[23:45] B: So cool. I always say. I'm like. After our last session, I was telling Christine, I was like, I don't know what he did, but, like you said, he is a wizard. I keep telling her that. I was like. Because everything's, like, great. Everything's good.
[24:01] A: Yeah.
[24:01] B: I mean, it's just. It's good.
[24:04] A: Yeah.
[24:04] B: I think about things, and it doesn't bother me. You know, I had started thinking about my family a lot.
[24:11] A: Yeah.
[24:11] B: And, like, which side? My mom's side. Like, just wanting them to talk to me because they weren't ready yet, you know, And.
[24:18] A: Well, the. The step dad.
[24:20] B: Yeah.
[24:21] A: My stepdad was more okay talking to you than yes.
[24:24] B: But. Yeah. But now Kayla calls. She says from a whole bunch of different area codes, and they're just not answering the phone, which is fine. But I have this Christmas card idea that I want to send them a Christmas card, and literally just like, give them a little update of what I've been doing, but also let them know, like, when you're ready, I'll be here. You know, it's now on your time kind of opening that door.
[24:49] A: Which, again, is very different than how you would normally do it.
[24:54] B: Oh, yeah, because I would normally, like, go and find them or call them and cuss them out and like, hello. I'm doing all this, like, out of.
[25:03] A: A desperation mode, trying to show you that I am.
[25:07] B: Yeah.
[25:08] A: I don't actually even need to have you see me different.
[25:11] B: No.
[25:13] A: Because I am.
[25:13] B: I am different.
[25:14] A: Right, right. Isn't that cool?
[25:17] B: Yes.
[25:18] A: Right. And we did talk about how mom's stuff is her stuff and all the things that were going on had to do with her guilt.
[25:27] B: Yeah.
[25:29] A: And that's really more of it than anything else. Right. Because she operated out of doing things for you when you were in active addiction, when you were in life, when you were in all that stuff, out of guilt. And she's got lots of it that she could be feeling guilty.
[25:48] B: I know a ton. I don't want her to feel guilty.
[25:54] A: No. And that's why as you get better and as you become more, well, that becomes a non issue.
[26:00] B: Okay.
[26:01] A: Right. So I'll give you a great example. My dad, my birth dad was not around for me growing up. He wasn't present in my life, and it created a lot of anger and hurt. And even the times that I did do things with him, they weren't enjoyable. I remember like, five, and it's raining, and we go out to the dock and. And he wants to go fishing. And, you know, he's probably had a 12 pack and he's wanting me to put the fish on the hook. And I'm a mama's boy. I'm not touching that gross, disgusting thing and putting it on, and he's yelling at me. And I mean, to this day, I don't go fishing.
[26:38] B: You don't? It's not my thing.
[26:40] A: There's a lot of other things I could be doing now. I could say that's really traumatic.
[26:44] B: Yeah.
[26:45] A: Can I put a fish on a hook now? Sure. Could I go? Yeah. But I look at. There's so many other activities that I'd rather do other than go fishing. And I'm still not a big fan of, like, even if I caught the. I don't want to touch it.
[26:56] B: I know. Ew. It's gross. It's slimy.
[27:00] A: Still like that. That's not like trauma. It's just not preference.
[27:04] B: Exactly.
[27:05] A: I mean, If I'm out in the wilderness and the only thing that I'm going to be able to eat is fish and dammit, I'll catch that thing and unhook it and do whatever I need to do with it other than that. And I'll eat fish now because for a long time I wouldn't even touch it. But I do. I'll eat fish and shrimp and all the other stuff. I just don't need to go catch it.
[27:22] B: Yeah, catch it or eat it. It's all gross.
[27:26] A: But anyway, for a long time I had a lot of disdain and I had a lot of reinforcement that I should. Right. Your dad should be the one that calls you. Your dad is the parent. He's now retrospect, in hindsight, I look back and I go, well, how old was my dad when they got divorced? Okay, if my mom was 22, he would have been like 23 or 24. That's young, very young to have a little baby. No wonder he wasn't present. And he had his own shit drinking and all that other kind of stuff. So I, for a long time was hurt when it flipped around. And I got that my dad being that way wasn't about my lovability. Right. I also got to realize that because of my hurt, there was a certain way I acted towards him which was constantly disappointed. So even when I saw my dad, he got a son who was disappointed in him. So I shifted that around to not be disappointed. I got that my dad does dad the way that he does dad, not the way that I would have wanted him to do dad, but it has nothing to do with his love for me. That's just how he does it. So now I've got freedom. So before I would give the example where we would travel to New York and I had my young daughter and I'd called my dad up and I said, dad, we're coming up. Oh yeah, well, I got to work that day, so I probably won't get there until the later in the afternoon. We're gonna get there by noon. Yeah, I won't get there probably until. And see, prior to it all shifting for me, I would have been like, well then fuck you if you've never met your granddaughter and you can't get out of work a couple hours early.
[29:11] B: Exactly.
[29:12] A: Screw you. That's how I would have been. But with all of that, I'm like, it didn't matter anymore. And he actually wound up getting out early. Right. My biggest complaint with my dad is that he never called. Growing up, he Calls me out of the blue now because I shifted. Not only did the hurt go away, but I also shifted how I was towards my dad because I lost the expectation that he needed to be a certain way. My dad, for the first time, got a son who was okay with him. The way he does it now, is it the way that I do, dad? No. And do my kids get to benefit from what I didn't get from my dad? Yeah. Like, my daughter is playing the recorder tonight at the mall with a group of other kids, and they're singing songs, but she's gonna be one of, like, four or five kids that play the recorder, which is such a wonderful instrument. Not my most favorite thing in the world to hear, listen to, or go to, but I will absolutely there with a big smile on my face. Because what my kids get is they get a dad who's present. Right. In that regard, I shifted from how it was him, not okay. Right. So that's the thing that starts to change, and I lost the anger towards him. I'm not hurting anymore. Right. I use your example because I think it's a really powerful way to illustrate something. The example of, you know, telling dad about seeing mom kiss the guy.
[30:53] B: Yes.
[30:53] A: And then them divorcing, moving from where you lived, and dad moving away.
[30:59] B: I know. All of that happened.
[31:04] A: And although later on in life realizing there clearly was more going on with them than me just saying that dad moving wasn't about his lack of love for me.
[31:14] B: I know, right?
[31:15] A: Like, it didn't feel that way. Now that thing shifted. It doesn't feel that way. It had to do with the shit that was off with them. Yeah, right. Even the whole thing with mom going, oh, is that what happened with the boy? Okay. You're going to move with your father.
[31:29] B: Yeah.
[31:30] A: What?
[31:32] B: I know.
[31:36] A: All right.
[31:37] B: Well, that's a great way to handle it. I know. Listen. See, you're great. I'm telling you. You're great. Because normally I'm thinking about that. I would be like, it was homecoming week, and I just got my homecoming date and this and that, but now it's just.
[31:54] A: Yeah, right, right. I got to see what oven. How it was.
[31:59] B: Yes, exactly.
[32:02] A: Where you can literally cook the egg on the sidewalk.
[32:08] B: I love it there, though.
[32:10] A: Arizona's pretty. What part is he in again?
[32:13] B: He's in Scottsdale.
[32:13] A: Scottsdale, that's right. Yeah. And we have family that are right outside of Scottsdale. Glendale.
[32:18] B: Glendale.
[32:19] A: Glendale, Chandler and all that area.
[32:22] B: I lived everywhere there. Everywhere in the Valley.
[32:25] A: Yeah. Yeah. So there you go.
[32:31] B: You're great though. Things are just good.
[32:34] A: Isn't that a good news thing?
[32:36] B: It's a great thing, right?
[32:37] A: Even thinking about what the guy did at the. What's it called? Something you sleep in. Sleep in. That's it.
[32:43] B: Yes. Yeah, listen. So okay, for instance. Yeah, I forgot I was talking to Madeline about this and she's like, bring it up, Dr. Q. So I find myself when we're driving to our Tuesday night NA meeting to go down, I think Fruitville and go down. Cause downtown Sarasota. So I literally pass a sleep in.
[33:09] A: There's a sleep in.
[33:10] B: Yeah, it's like there's three hotels. Right when you get off the interstate, right at Fruitville. Uh huh. There's like, I think it's Fruitville. And then there's these hotels on the left side. Literally right when you're turning to go, okay, yeah, there's the hotels. Yeah.
[33:23] A: And one of them's asleep.
[33:24] B: Really?
[33:25] A: I didn't even know that.
[33:26] B: I have to pay attention, right? There you go.
[33:28] A: It's like a Hampton or something like that.
[33:30] B: There's a. There's a. There's three of them. Yeah, there's three of them. They're like directly behind each other. Okay. So I could go past it and every. Every time I see it, the sleep in, I think immediately of him and then it goes away. Like nothing happens.
[33:46] A: Right.
[33:46] B: I think about it for that second and then my mind doesn't associate bad stuff with it.
[33:51] A: No, right.
[33:54] B: It's just. I look at it, I think about it and it's. Right, great. Exactly. It's crazy to me. You know, I do it with the Homewood Suites too. When I go down and see Homewood Suites and for a while, I'm not in their life. For a while I would see Homewood Suites and I'm like, oh man. I start thinking about like stuff, you know, but now it's just. I see homeless suits and I don't. It's like the same like with sleeping. I don't associate with anything. I just. I can look at it and be like homeless. Oh, sleeping. Okay, let's keep on going.
[34:26] A: Yeah, right.
[34:26] B: And for a moment, like, I. Because I know in my head sleeping means something.
[34:31] A: Well, does it?
[34:32] B: But it doesn't exactly. In my mind, I think it means something maybe, but then it doesn't mean anything. Oh, that's weird.
[34:40] A: Isn't that cool?
[34:41] B: It's amazing. Yeah, it's so cool.
[34:43] A: Yeah. Because what it's starting to do so. And I'll give it to you and how it works for Gambling and the casinos know this. So somebody who's a gambling addict, their brain, a win and a close to a win, registers the same dopamine hit. So if I need five sevens to win on the slot machine, if I get five sevens, dopamine hit.
[35:09] B: Yeah.
[35:10] A: And I get the money. But if I get four and a half sevens, I get the same dopamine hit. So casinos know it. So they give people close to wins, not fully wins, because the brain is registering it as a win. People who are not gambling addicts. Right. It's a win and a loss.
[35:33] B: Yeah.
[35:33] A: A close to a win is still a loss. So they register completely different. So what happens with trauma? Trauma has a tendency when it's active to confuse similar as same. So that's why different things that have similarity, it reads the same. Yes, because that might not have been the same. Sleep in.
[35:58] B: Exactly.
[35:59] A: But it's same name, so. Same name. Right. When the brain has the trauma stuff separated and it's not active anymore, it reads similar as different.
[36:12] B: That's why.
[36:13] A: And because the issue wasn't the place or the name of the place. It wasn't even the location that it happened. It's what the person did and the.
[36:22] B: Location, and then it happened.
[36:24] A: Yeah, but it's what the person did.
[36:25] B: Yes.
[36:27] A: That's where the problem lies, not the actual location. Yeah, right, Right. Just like the guy who came in to see me who was pissed at blue Ford pickup trucks because his wife had had an affair with somebody who drove one. It wasn't the truck that he was mad at.
[36:46] B: There wasn't a truck.
[36:47] A: She did not have sex with the truck.
[36:50] B: No.
[36:51] A: She may have had sex in the truck.
[36:53] B: Oh, my God.
[36:54] A: But she didn't have sex with the truck. And it's not even the back seat of the truck that is the problem. It was what she did with the person in it. Yes, but because it was similar, it was attached to same. So your brain is reading that stuff as similar as different. Right. Even though it's got a similar name, it's not the same.
[37:19] B: No.
[37:20] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[37:22] B: Yes.
[37:24] A: Yeah.
[37:25] B: I love it.
[37:25] A: And the way that that goes, that just continues to reinforce.
[37:30] B: Does.
[37:31] A: Right.
[37:31] B: Like every time I pass, I mean.
[37:34] A: Right.
[37:34] B: And I'm consciously aware and passing it and thinking about it.
[37:38] A: I can tell you the. When I got LASIK surgery done, because from, I don't know, eighth grade on, I either had glasses or contacts when in 2002, I got Lasik surgery. Still to this day, when I wake up and I turn and I see the numbers on the clock I dial.
[38:03] B: That must be a nice feeling.
[38:05] A: Like, I go, I can read the numbers.
[38:09] B: I can't see nothing.
[38:10] A: Right.
[38:11] B: As long as the bat.
[38:12] A: That's the difference is so. For some people, like, I still go, wow, that's cool.
[38:20] B: That is cool.
[38:23] A: Like, even at night I can read the street sign. That's cool.
[38:28] B: Good thing.
[38:29] A: Yeah.
[38:29] B: Yeah.
[38:30] A: It's not so problematic when you drive in places that you know where you're going. Cuz you don't care because you already know where you're going.
[38:36] B: Yeah.
[38:37] A: It's all those places that you don't know where you're going that when it's dark out and at night it's harder to see. See. Right. But it just continues to ring. Oh, that's different. That's different. That's different.
[38:51] B: Yeah.
[38:52] A: That's different. That's different. Yeah. Good job.
[38:56] B: Thanks.
[38:57] A: Yeah.
[38:58] B: Good job to you.
[38:59] A: Yeah. Well, I mean, you notice because it's a collaboration.
[39:02] B: It is.
[39:02] A: And you notice what you notice that's different for you.
[39:05] B: Yes.
[39:05] A: Right. Right.
[39:08] B: So cool.
[39:08] A: Right. And you're not having like this pull towards that guy.
[39:12] B: No, not. I'm not.
[39:16] A: And that's very different than it was.
[39:18] B: Oh my God. Yeah.
[39:20] A: Cause before it was. I know it's not a good idea.
[39:24] B: But I just want. Yeah.
[39:26] A: Right. Now it's like, yeah, right, right. Cause he's not worth it. No, Right.
[39:32] B: Absolutely not.
[39:33] A: That's right. Cause you're worth it way more to you.
[39:35] B: Yes, I am.
[39:38] A: Yeah. Where is birth father now?
[39:41] B: My dad?
[39:41] A: Yeah.
[39:42] B: In Arizona.
[39:43] A: He's still in Arizona. Okay.
[39:44] B: Yeah.
[39:45] A: Have you had any.
[39:46] B: Nope.
[39:47] A: Contact with him? Okay.
[39:53] B: My stepdad said that my mom would have to be the one to give her my dad's number, but my mom won't talk to her, so.
[40:04] A: Okay.
[40:05] B: Yeah. Me and my dad are good. I mean, I thought we were good, you know.
[40:09] A: Yeah.
[40:10] B: He just silently. He's sick of it.
[40:14] A: Sick of it. Meaning what you had been doing.
[40:16] B: Sick of the shit. Yeah, that I was doing. You know.
[40:22] A: It'S okay though, because you're not doing it anymore.
[40:25] B: I'm not. So I'm.
[40:26] A: He actually might want to know.
[40:28] B: Yeah.
[40:28] A: How much better you're doing.
[40:29] B: Yeah.
[40:29] A: Right. At some point.
[40:32] B: At some point.
[40:33] A: Yeah. Mom still is in contact with him.
[40:36] B: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty sure.
[40:38] A: I mean, they're always younger brother from him too.
[40:41] B: No, younger brother is from my stepdad.
[40:43] A: It's from stepdad. Okay. Because that was the thing. You had homecoming and his birthday.
[40:49] B: Yes. You were so good.
[40:52] A: And mom was like ruining his birthday. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, Mom.
[40:57] B: Happened on the birthday. Yes.
[40:58] A: I certainly didn't think that that was gonna be the thing.
[41:01] B: I know.
[41:02] A: Yeah. Right. My friend's guy. That's what I think was going to happen. Are you kidding me? Yeah. Yeah, Right? A lovely Treasure Island.
[41:11] B: Lovely Treasure Island. You're good with a Thunderbird, right?
[41:17] A: And the thing you always have to throw the coins into the toll box to get across.
[41:20] B: Oh, my God. Yes.
[41:24] A: That's one of the only places that still have the spot where you have to throw.
[41:27] B: Really?
[41:28] A: Yeah. Everything else is like Sun Pass, but like that going out to Pasa Grill, you have to throw quarters or you can have a Sun Pass, but they still have the quarter thing. And Treasure island, they still have the quarter thing.
[41:38] B: That is so cool. I did not know that.
[41:40] A: Yeah.
[41:41] B: So weird. I miss it over there, though.
[41:45] A: Yeah.
[41:47] B: I never used to miss it over there, but now I miss it over there.
[41:50] A: Isn't that cool? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because you were like, madeira beach area, right?
[41:55] B: Madeira Beach Middle.
[41:57] A: That's the prettiest middle school in the world.
[41:59] B: Yeah. It was so cool.
[42:01] A: Like, I. I think to myself, I'm like, I don't think I could have gone to Madeira Beach Middle School right over there. All I do is look out the window, paying attention. No.
[42:10] B: Right. We got on dolphin watches for our field trips, right?
[42:15] A: Yeah, yeah. That location. I'm like, man, the school district sells that property they got, they could make a lot of money. Oh, let's go somewhere else.
[42:25] B: Yeah.
[42:25] A: And that property is enormous, first of all. And it's right there.
[42:29] B: Right there on the water right now. That's so cool. Marine biology was fun.
[42:34] A: Yeah. Because I lived very close to there when I worked in Pinellas County.
[42:38] B: Yeah.
[42:39] A: For the school system.
[42:40] B: Okay.
[42:40] A: I lived off of 118th way.
[42:44] B: And what?
[42:45] A: Like, so you know where park is? Park. Just north of park is 118th. So you could go down park and then turn right on 118th way.
[42:54] B: Okay.
[42:55] A: I was in homes back there that were basically, my gate opened to the Pinellas Trail. And on the other side of the trail is the Seminole, like, Little League field.
[43:06] B: Yeah. Sia Seminole Chiefs. Yeah. See, I know. Right there.
[43:11] A: And I used to do a lot of running down whatever it is. Do Me road.
[43:17] B: Do Me Road. I know. Do me down to Madeira Beach. Yeah. Yep. I got right off of Ridge Road.
[43:28] A: Yeah.
[43:28] B: Ridge in 88th Ave. So.
[43:30] A: Okay.
[43:30] B: Yeah. I mean, really 86 and we're 80, so not Ridgeon Park. Yeah, no.
[43:36] A: Far away at all.
[43:37] B: Not at all. No. That's where they still live too.
[43:41] A: Is that they're still in that area.
[43:42] B: Yeah, they're still in the house. Yeah.
[43:44] A: Okay. Every once in a while I get way out there.
[43:47] B: Do you far? It's not far from here.
[43:51] A: Yeah, like. Cuz that's what I found when I lived there. It was fine to be out west.
[43:57] B: Uhhuh.
[43:58] A: Everything was right there. It's true. But if you had to go anywhere.
[44:01] B: East, it's like, I know.
[44:03] A: You're driving red light, red light, red light, red light. It doesn't matter whether you go East Bay, Ulmerton Park. It doesn't matter which road you take. You are taking lots of red lights to finally get to the one spot where the interstate is.
[44:18] B: I know. That's true. That is very true.
[44:22] A: Yeah. I never even realized that Pinellas county being the most densely populated county in the state of Florida.
[44:30] B: What?
[44:31] A: There's more people per side in Pinellas county than there is anywhere else in the state of Florida.
[44:37] B: Wow.
[44:37] A: Isn't that crazy?
[44:38] B: That's insane. It's so small.
[44:42] A: It is.
[44:43] B: I know.
[44:44] A: And there's only the one tiny portion of the of the county that actually has the interstate.
[44:51] B: You're right. Because you gotta like take Elmertick all the way down and then try to.
[44:56] A: Drive up to Tarpon.
[44:58] B: Oh God, no.
[45:00] A: It's gonna take like three hours to get you to Tarpon.
[45:04] B: I mean. Yeah. It's crazy. I know. Exactly. I never went to Tart. Vince.
[45:10] A: That's okay. You just aim the south.
[45:13] B: Yeah. That's what I was confined to.
[45:17] A: Right. That's what you do when you're down in that area.
[45:20] B: Yeah. So funny. Very cool.
[45:24] A: Cool. So do you have anything that you're asking for for Christmas?
[45:28] B: That I'm asking for for Christmas? No.
[45:33] A: No Christmas list? I mean, no things that you want for Christmas?
[45:38] B: Well, they gave us Christmas list to fill out. Is that what you mean? I don't know. I don't really need anything for Christmas. No.
[45:51] A: Good.
[45:51] B: Yeah.
[45:52] A: Cool. My friend who did her PhD with me is coming to the house on Thursday.
[45:59] B: Yes. And I'm so excited about this.
[46:02] A: She's awesome.
[46:03] B: Yeah. I was talking to Christine about it. She is super excited.
[46:07] A: Dr. Day.
[46:08] B: Dr. Day.
[46:09] A: She and I did our PhD program together.
[46:12] B: So are you gonna be there too?
[46:13] A: I'm gonna be there to introduce her. I'll be there for part of it and.
[46:17] B: Yeah. Very cool.
[46:19] A: Yeah. Because Christine's on a cruise.
[46:20] B: I know. She's not even gonna be there. So I told her last Thursday. I was like, you're not Even gonna be there, right? No. Okay. No, she's like, Dr. Pugh will be there for a while. Okay, cool. Yeah, it's cool. I mean, I don't really know what it's about. I know it's unconscious.
[46:36] A: It's a positive sex talk. And, like, how you all, as women particular, given that, the dynamic that you were put in, how are you to own it as women?
[46:51] B: Okay.
[46:51] A: Like, own your own power. Own it.
[46:54] B: Okay.
[46:55] A: Right. Because even as we talk, we talked about, you know, the thing that I liked is there were some regulars, like, knowing that they liked me. Yes, well, they liked what you were doing.
[47:10] B: Exactly.
[47:11] A: Right. So we want women. Right. Like, I've got a take on it. And she has a similar view of that, that, you know, all women need to hold the keys. They've got the goods.
[47:23] B: Yeah.
[47:23] A: Women don't pursue men. They get men to pursue them. Women's got the keys, they've got the goods. You know that whole idea that the millionaire matchmaker used to say, no sex before minor monogamy.
[47:33] B: Yes.
[47:34] A: Is key. That doesn't mean, like, you're married, but, like, we need to, like, be in a committed thing before you get in here. Because her take wasn't. I thought it was funny. Why buy the cow if you can get the milk for free?
[47:48] B: That is great. You're so true.
[47:53] A: So it's really like a sex positive, understanding your own body, the whole kind of thing with that. And how does this whole system work? Some of it is going to be sex ed stuff because where do we learn about it? Not in school. We learn about it in school. It's like, you know, bad and wrong.
[48:11] B: Yeah. Big time.
[48:13] A: You know, body parts, all the different things that go along with that kind of stuff. She'll be able to elaborate and discuss and be fun.
[48:21] B: I'm excited.
[48:22] A: She's really good.
[48:23] B: Good. And be cool. I think everyone's looking forward to it. Maybe not Katie, because Katie says she knows all about sex, but she's.
[48:32] A: What doesn't Katie know? According to her?
[48:36] B: According to her.
[48:37] A: I'm not so sure it's true, but she knows everything that she says that she knows. But, you know. I know, right?
[48:44] B: She's great. It's so funny.
[48:47] A: I mean, she knows everything, you know, because she's, what, 19? 20.
[48:50] B: 19. Yeah.
[48:51] A: Yeah. So, I mean, 19 year olds, you do know everything.
[48:53] B: Oh, we know everything. Yeah. I knew everything.
[48:56] A: Yes. And then progressively you get dumber because you start realizing, oh, my goodness, there's more stuff that I don't know.
[49:03] B: Yeah.
[49:04] A: Which when I realize that there are things that I don't know. It makes me feel dumber, even though I'm not dumber, because I've actually learned more. But I lived in a world where I thought I knew everything, so it makes me feel like I am.
[49:15] B: Yeah.
[49:15] A: Yeah, T. Yeah. Cool.
[49:18] B: Cool.
[49:18] A: All right. Anything else left for you for today?
[49:20] B: No. I'm glad. Me too. Because things are great.
[49:25] A: I'm so glad.
[49:26] B: I'm so glad. I thank you so much.
[49:28] A: Yeah, my pleasure.
[49:31] B: All the time. I know. In action, right?
[49:35] A: Yeah. Making your life move forward.
[49:36] B: Yeah.
[49:37] A: Right. And now you got things to consider as you're going to school. Like, maybe looking at. Okay. What would it be like to go into a BSW program? Right. Because if you finish your AA and you get in and you go into a BSW Bachelor's in Social Work program.
[49:51] B: Okay.
[49:52] A: And then if you ever wanted to get your master's is only an additional year.
[49:55] B: See, that's a great idea.
[49:56] A: Right, Right. And it just do that. Opens up.
[50:00] B: Opens up. Okay. I like that. Thank you for that advice.
[50:04] A: Absolutely.
[50:05] B: It's great advice.
[50:06] A: Cool, cool, cool, cool.
