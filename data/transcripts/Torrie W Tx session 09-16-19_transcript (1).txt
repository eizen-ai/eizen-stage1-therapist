[00:01] A: Today is the 16th of September, Tori. This is our second meeting and we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And of course, given what we do is transformative and life changing and really beneficial and useful for you, the recording may be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:22] B: Yes, yes.
[00:23] A: All right. So from our last conversation, which was now like several weeks ago.
[00:28] B: Yeah, it was a while ago.
[00:30] A: Yeah. There were multitudes of different things that you had mentioned to me. So I'm going to kind of think about that stuff or at least cover that first, then whatever also is kind of surfaced since then to now that we would be wanting to do. So one of the things that you had mentioned to me is that you had I think at that time like 160 some odd days clean soap.
[00:54] B: Yes.
[00:54] A: Which is really, really cool. So it's been more than that now.
[00:57] B: Yes, it's been seven, seven and a half months.
[01:01] A: Seven and a half months. Congratulations on that. And then you had mentioned why that kind of surfaced is that sometimes you have thoughts about like needles and use and that kind of is triggering and causes discomfort. Yeah. The veins, we want that to be gone so that no longer causes discomfort. You mentioned witnessing some yucky stuff that Trafficker had done and death or like that whole thing was there. There's been like earlier childhood stuff that's happened along the way that's still underneath the surface. Sometimes it affects sleep. Sometimes you think about it at times that you don't want to be thinking about it. We want to get the effect that that stuff has had cleared. But you would also mention that in your current environment that there's a tendency, and you mentioned it just a few minutes ago too, for you to be a short triggered a little more easily. Irritated, agitated, aggravated annoyed, frustrated. And certain things or things that people say or do kind of cause that. And then you're like. And you'd like that to actually diminish. That's not so reactive. So those are the things that kind of like framing what it is that we're wanting to do that I'm remembering.
[02:19] B: Yes.
[02:19] A: Out of what I said, is there anything that I missed?
[02:22] B: I don't think so. Okay.
[02:26] A: What else would be useful for me to know or as we're thinking about what we want for you when we're done? Because you had also mentioned, and I'm really curious because we briefly touched on this, you said that there had been a whole bunch of Bad feelings attached to first child that you didn't really get established, even though they're in a much better family unit and all that kind of stuff than you were when you were 20. But there's a little bit more connection you have, I believe. Is it Chloe? Chloe, yes. That you have a little more connection with. But I don't even know whether you still have the same heaviness with the first one or if that's at all lightened up a little bit from what we talked about the last time. I don't even know whether that's even at the forefront of.
[03:06] B: I think that might be at the forefront. I think my family is at the forefront.
[03:09] A: Oh, tell me more about what would be useful for me to know. My.
[03:12] B: They've been trying to contact. For safe contact, my. My mom. My stepdad.
[03:16] A: Birth mom.
[03:17] B: Yeah, they've been. And they live in Seminole, and so my.
[03:20] A: Seminole, Like Pinellas County Seminole?
[03:22] B: Yeah. You live there too, right? So, yeah. My stepdad said that my mom wasn't willing to talk to me right now. Every time I call them, I need something or want something from them. I feel like me and Kayla talked that they think I'm setting them up somehow to, like, get, like, their socials, probably do the safe contact, because you have two background checks, this and that. They're just not ready to talk to me. I don't know whenever they're gonna be ready to talk to me. They have my kids this and that. My stepdad's like, you know, I hope she succeeds and does good. But as of right now, yeah, that's great. She's got seven months sober. But what happens when she leaves there? That's when it'll really start, basically. So they're just not wanting to talk to me, and that pisses me off, and it makes me mad. And then I start to resent all the other residents in the house because their families come every weekend and their kids come, and I just sit and, like, watch that. So I feel like that's where my resentments are coming towards them, because it's like I'm mad at them, but I'm not mad at them. Does that make sense?
[04:28] A: You're not mad at the residents?
[04:30] B: Yeah.
[04:30] A: But you're.
[04:31] B: I'm taking it out on them.
[04:33] A: We could call it a little bit of jealous.
[04:37] B: Jealous? Yeah.
[04:38] A: That they're able to and you're not.
[04:40] B: Yeah.
[04:40] A: Right. And so there's, like, hurt that you're feeling that maybe gets spread outward.
[04:48] B: Yeah, exactly.
[04:49] A: Right. Not necessarily that. That's how you Want to be, but it's kind of like, it's not quite fair. I wish I had mine. And they do. That kind of thing goes on.
[04:57] B: Yeah.
[04:57] A: Okay. And if I'm following you, from what your stepdad said, they go, great. We're glad that she's making progress. We're really glad that she's gotten seven months clean and sober and she's in a program.
[05:09] B: Yeah.
[05:10] A: So what we're really concerned about, based on our past history of her and what has happened through the years, is we're concerned, is she really changing? Right. That's what they're really worried about. And if we're gonna be connecting and reconnecting to her, which takes, like, an investment in us because we're taking care of the kids, and we're willing and happy to do that part. But, like, if we're gonna, like, reinvest, we're, like, kind of gun shy. Cause it feels like we got burned a few fucking times along the way.
[05:42] B: More than a few, but. Yeah, exactly.
[05:45] A: So that can somewhat be a little understandable. Even though, knowing what you know, it's still, like, hurting and it's not ideal and it's not what you want.
[05:54] B: Yeah. Cause this is, like, the first time that, like, I'm actually wanting to change. And I know prior times I'd be like, I'm sober. I'm doing this, I'm doing that. No, like. And I had been sober and still living with that addict mentality. Like, I was, like, clean off of drugs, but not clean mentally, I guess, you know, so.
[06:14] A: So they got a little. They're a little gunshot.
[06:17] B: Yeah.
[06:17] A: And mom definitely is reserved because she doesn't want to, like, open, because she.
[06:21] B: Knows that she's the headache. And the minute she talks to me, she'll just, like, like, open her arms. You know what I mean? So I know she's.
[06:27] A: So there's that.
[06:28] B: Yeah.
[06:29] A: And you can understand it. It doesn't still make you feel. There's still the feeling part. And then it also probably feels a little bit like. Well, like, you're not, like, there for me.
[06:38] B: Yeah.
[06:39] A: Kind of thing.
[06:39] B: Yeah. Everything that I've been through, I want you to be there for me. And they're just, you know, they're not.
[06:45] A: And.
[06:46] B: But I understand. But then I'm like, my mom has always been the one that would be like, Toriann, I can't. I can't do this for you. If my husband finds out, he's gonna divorce me. And da, da, da, this and that. It's always been my Stepdad I'm scared of now my stepdad's the one that's talking, saying he's trying to encourage my mom to call back this and that, but she's just not having it. They flipped around, which is really weird too.
[07:09] A: Yeah. And sometimes just as a side, the people who we are the closest to are the ones that notice how much we've changed last.
[07:23] B: Really?
[07:24] A: Yeah. Because they're the ones that have their filter up of how they see us. Right. And with this filter up, can I see you that? Well, no. So even if you've changed and I still have this up, I'm not really seeing that you have. You follow me?
[07:42] B: Yes.
[07:43] A: So for the people that we're closest to, they notice sometimes our change in how much different we are later down the road. People who don't know us as well, who like all of a sudden. Now I'm not. They see it more because they didn't have all that preconceived shit based on years of what have you.
[08:05] B: Yeah.
[08:05] A: Yeah. Okay. So we want to get it so that you're not feeling so shitty.
[08:10] B: Yeah.
[08:10] A: That they haven't been wanting to connect. Okay. Yes, that would be useful.
[08:15] B: Yes, that would be great.
[08:17] A: So then you could actually like have like a little more enjoyable weekend.
[08:20] B: Yeah, exactly. Everyone's family there.
[08:25] A: I'm doing that. Yeah.
[08:26] B: Just hiding in my room and sleeping.
[08:28] A: What else would be useful for me to know?
[08:33] B: So my. Not my original trafficker, like my last one, whatever, you know, the one that I totally fell head over heels in love with is. Got out of prison in June.
[08:46] A: Okay.
[08:47] B: And so I had been waiting.
[08:49] A: You had been with. Trafficked with. He went to jail.
[08:55] B: Yeah.
[08:56] A: Another trafficker.
[08:57] B: Yes.
[08:58] A: Okay.
[08:59] B: So he went to prison because of me. Like. Well, I say because I had a bad alcohol and some guy raped me. So he went and like fucked the guy up basically and went to prison. Got another 18 months in prison. And so he'd always like use that when he went to prison or right before he went. He would use that like, I'm in here cause of you, this and that, you better stay. And I was head over heels in the.
[09:21] A: He's not in there. Because he did. Well, I mean, do you know why he's in there? Cause I want you to get something. Really. Because this is a weird thing to start thinking about.
[09:32] B: Uh huh.
[09:32] A: And then we'll get this thing separated, but just again, put it up over there. Not like what I'm saying is the truth, but a way to think about it. Somebody fucked with his Property.
[09:48] B: Okay.
[09:49] A: And he went and fucked up the person who fucked with his property. Right. Like, so let's say he had this really kick ass car. He's got a Maserati. Right. And somebody came and they just freaking scratched the shit out of it. They cut all the tires, they pissed on the inside. You fucked up my car. And then he went and fucked them up because you fucked up my fucking car.
[10:16] B: Okay.
[10:17] A: Right. You were part of his entourage property.
[10:21] B: Yes, exactly.
[10:23] A: And that. You don't get to do that to my shit.
[10:25] B: Mm.
[10:28] A: So not because of you. Because somebody did something to his shit.
[10:33] B: Okay.
[10:33] A: Did he go and do that? Cause it wouldn't have mattered. Whether it was you or somebody else that was part of his had done. He would do that. Right. But not because of like, oh, my goodness. Oh, I love you.
[10:50] B: Which confused this whole time.
[10:56] A: Right. That's where it gets somewhat confused. Because it felt like, wow, this guy really, like, was all about protecting me.
[11:04] B: Yes. He was my life. He loved me so much that he.
[11:08] A: Was be willing to go to jail.
[11:09] B: Yes. Yeah. Yeah, totally. That's how I felt this whole time. I couldn't wait for him to get out.
[11:17] A: Yeah. And now he has.
[11:19] B: And now he has. And I struggle with it on a daily. Like, I could just go back to. Cause he lives in Seminole like his parents. So I could just go back there, you know, and things will be fine. So I think they'll be fine. But like, why do I still love him? I don't understand. I mean, he wasn't at one point in time. No. He was never good.
[11:39] A: I don't know.
[11:40] B: I know he's sick in the head too, but I just. I'm struggling with this and like, who's he with and what's he doing and.
[11:48] A: Okay, so there's been lots of thoughts about it.
[11:52] B: Yeah. But yet he sold me. So I don't understand why I have that connection with him that I do, that I feel like I do.
[11:59] A: Right. Well, in order to be able to do that, there is a psychological component that goes into it.
[12:06] B: Oh, okay.
[12:08] A: I mean, that's where that shows up. We want you to have freedom there.
[12:13] B: Yeah.
[12:14] A: Yeah. To see it for more of what it was. The good, the bad and the ugly all together. See, because what. When we reminisce, we only think about the good. What we don't include in the reminiscing is all the other crap that was going on too. Right. Like, if you think about him, if that's a separate thing, like, what do I reminisce about? Oh, I remember. Reminisce about some things that we did that were enjoyable. Some stuff that's happened, some things that he said maybe that made me feel good knowing that he did that thing. Like how to. Like protecting me.
[12:50] B: Yeah.
[12:51] A: Right. Like so I got that. But what's not included in that image is what was the other shit. That's also gone. Oh, wow. He was the one that was getting me this drugs. He was the one that made me go out and do these things with the different guys. He was the one that put me in Arm's Risk in the fucking first place.
[13:06] B: Yeah. Wow. Okay.
[13:08] A: If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have been fucking there to have that guy do that fucking shit to me.
[13:13] B: Yeah.
[13:14] A: Okay. That makes sense. Right? It's not being seen all as the same picture. It's only reminiscing about that moment.
[13:23] B: Okay.
[13:23] A: So we want the whole picture be seen.
[13:26] B: Yeah. Probably want to see the whole picture. Probably not. But you know.
[13:30] A: Well, you might.
[13:31] B: I know.
[13:31] A: As you get free from it.
[13:33] B: Okay.
[13:33] A: As it no longer causes trouble and emotions, as you begin to get more and more pretty with you. Right. On the inside. Right. Because it felt like that guy was actually somebody who was there for you. And as you brought up your mom and dad or stepdad, it doesn't actually feel like they are.
[13:51] B: Yeah.
[13:52] A: So now we got that in combination with this.
[13:55] B: Yeah. Run back to that. I feel like there's a whole conflict there. Yeah.
[14:02] A: Okay. What else would be useful for me to know? I'm following that.
[14:05] B: Okay. I think that's good right now. I think. Yeah.
[14:11] A: And that's kind of what you. When you say I've been struggling. You've been having thoughts about being back with him.
[14:18] B: Yes.
[14:18] A: Yeah.
[14:20] B: Even though I know, like, I'd end up dead, but like, I know that, but I don't know. It'll make me feel good in a time deep.
[14:31] A: Isn't that interesting?
[14:32] B: Yeah.
[14:33] A: Right. And I'm wondering what it would be like for you to just feel good. Yeah. On the inside. Yeah. Without the need of it from anybody else.
[14:40] B: Exactly.
[14:42] A: For you to become more important. Peace and good with you.
[14:45] B: Yeah.
[14:46] A: Yeah. See, that's where we're headed.
[14:48] B: Okay. Okay, good.
[14:50] A: Where we're headed is a you who's a lot lighter and more at peace. A you who's free from the emotional effect of the prior stuff, whether they be the more recent things or the things that have happened long time ago. The you to be seeing things more clearly and getting other people's prayers as being about Them. So it's not making you feel anything about you. Right. Even, like, with mom and stepdad, there's, like, their crap, which isn't meaning anything about you. That's what they've got going on. But see, even if you know it. It doesn't feel that way. Follow me with that.
[15:28] B: Yes.
[15:29] A: Even though, you know, fuck, if I go back with this guy, I'd probably be dead. And here you go. What am I doing? Notice how there's the. I might know better, but I don't feel different. We want to get it so that you're aligned. Meaning that at a head level, a heart level, and a gut level, like there's coherence.
[15:54] B: Okay.
[15:55] A: So that you get to become more free.
[15:58] B: Yes. That's what I want.
[15:59] A: To be more of you.
[16:00] B: Yeah.
[16:01] A: Right. And have access to more of who you are and be more content inside. Meaning that you're not needing things outside of you in order to be okay.
[16:14] B: Mm.
[16:15] A: Got it.
[16:16] B: Yes.
[16:16] A: I don't know what's happened now.
[16:18] B: I don't know. I'm scared.
[16:19] A: Oh, what was that?
[16:20] B: No, not like scared. Like, I just. I don't like feelings. I don't like to feel, feel. I don't like all that. That's why I've used so long, you know? So I just have to sit, you know, I get nervous and I talk about me just being with me, being okay with me. Because, you know, what about being okay.
[16:45] A: With you wouldn't be okay?
[16:48] B: Good question.
[16:50] A: What about being okay with you? You wouldn't be okay. What about you being enough for you? Okay wouldn't be okay. What about you being more at peace and good with you? What about that wouldn't be okay. We'll just check as you're checking. You're doing great. I'm really proud of you. I'm excited that you're here.
[17:26] B: I'm excited. I'm here, too. I'm just. I've been. I've been trying, like, trying to get away from myself for the past 14 years. You know, that goes hand in hand with being worthy, being. You know? But I just. The way I cope, the way I deal is with the needle and drugs, you know, so.
[17:50] A: Not anymore.
[17:51] B: Not anymore.
[17:52] A: I mean, that's how you did.
[17:53] B: That's how I did. You're right.
[17:54] A: Now you're doing something different. I know, right?
[17:57] B: That's scary.
[17:58] A: Well, because you keep thinking I'm gonna start feeling feelings that I don't want to feel, and I don't know how to not feel.
[18:04] B: Yes.
[18:06] A: Right. So the. You that I'm feeling. Seeing isn't about having all sorts of feelings that she doesn't want to be having.
[18:14] B: Okay?
[18:15] A: The you that I'm seeing is free from the emotional effect. See what you've been thinking, and this is the really crazy part. You've actually been thinking, I am my feelings, like they're me. But what if your feelings aren't? What if your feelings are just ways that you feel that they're not actually a part of? You see, the coolest part of it being a feeling is that it's something that's changeable. People confuse thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. What do people come in to see me about? They have thoughts that they don't want to be having, and they don't know how to not have them. They act behaviorally in ways that they don't want to be acting anymore. They don't know how to stop, and they feel ways that they don't want to feel, and they don't know how to not feel it. Right? And what happens is, because that's been going on and maybe been going on for a long time, people think that they are those things, except those things are changeable, right? If a girl walks in and she says, hi, my name is Sally, I'm five foot two and I'm shy. If Sally is thinking about her height or her shyness, better yet in the same way she relates to her height, can she change it? If she thinks about her shyness in the same way she thinks about her height, can we get her taller or shorter? No, no, absolutely not. Is her shyness the same thing as her height? No, it is a way that she feels. It absolutely affects how she thinks and how she acts, but it's not a part of who she is.
[20:17] B: Okay, I get it. Yes, I get it.
[20:21] A: So what you've been relating is, one of the things that I've known for me is that I find myself feeling ways that I don't want to feel or thinking thoughts that I don't want to be thinking or acting in ways that I don't want to act, and I don't know how to not do it. And one of the ways that I use to deal with unwanted thoughts, feelings, and behaviors was to use, well, now I'm not doing that. It's part of the reason that it pisses me the fuck off when somebody goes, well, how did that make you feel, Man, I'm trying to not feel.
[20:57] B: Jesus.
[20:57] A: I just processed with four other people. Now I'm fucking stressed that I had to talk about the Shit that I wasn't talking about.
[21:03] B: Yes, perfect.
[21:06] A: Exactly. So that's what's been going on, what we're going to be doing. Because none of those things have been new. They're just problematic ways that you feel, think, act, and react. So what we're clearing out is the emotional effect that this stuff has had on you so that you wind up feeling more the way you want to naturally, and automatically that you're more. That's right. Thinking the thoughts that you want to be thinking naturally. That you're more. Handling the situations more in the way that you want naturally. All the other stuff is just stuff that's been in the way of connecting to who you are. You've been thinking that the feelings are me and I don't want to feel them.
[21:58] B: Yeah, exactly.
[22:00] A: So if I get to be, like, contented, then I've got to feel all those yucky feelings. Well, how the hell does that have you be content?
[22:08] B: It doesn't.
[22:11] A: How does that have you at all? Be at peace? It doesn't. No. So where we're headed is a you who's much lighter and much more at peace on the inside, that you're actually good enough for you. Right. That you have much more freedom and ease in how you deal with the distressors of life.
[22:36] B: I want that.
[22:38] A: That's where we're headed.
[22:39] B: Okay.
[22:40] A: This is the you that I'm seeing. You don't have to see this. You just like me. Because the question isn't how it's gonna happen. It's more, would it be okay? Got it.
[22:53] B: Got it.
[22:54] A: And as you think about this, you, would it be okay?
[22:57] B: Yeah.
[22:58] A: Right. So now we're getting you to become more okay with being okay. Because being okay doesn't mean that I have to feel all that yucky crap.
[23:08] B: Hmm.
[23:09] A: Being okay is about being free from the emotional effect that the crap has continued to have. That's where we're headed.
[23:20] B: Yay.
[23:22] A: You're much lighter. And that's what I mean by you emotionally experience other people's stuff as being about them, not me. It gets read from that lens that it's over there, which you might already know, but you haven't felt. We want what you now know so that it integrates and you feel more of it.
[23:50] B: Okay.
[23:51] A: Got it?
[23:52] B: Yes.
[23:53] A: And that's why I said to you before, as we're looking towards where we're going, there's the stuff that has happened, and then there's the effect that it's had on your brain. So people tend to think that I'M troubled by this stuff, but a lot of this stuff is over.
[24:11] B: Yeah.
[24:11] A: How could I still be troubled by it?
[24:13] B: Exactly.
[24:14] A: Well, then it's not the stuff that you're still troubled by, but it's the effect that the stuff has continued to have on your brain. That's what we're gonna adjust so that you get free.
[24:28] B: Yay.
[24:31] A: And this is the you that I'm seeing. Someone who's free from the emotional effect. Right. Because if we look at it from that weird lens, Right. Most of us go, stuff causes feelings. When that person did that thing, it made me feel this way. That thing happening, had me feel like that. That's fine. This much power, change it, avoid it. But in light, you. There's some stuff I can't change. There's some stuff I can't completely, maybe don't even fully want to avoid. Can't get all of these away from it. There's a whole bunch of shit that's happened. I can't get the shit to have not happened. So we got to do something else.
[25:16] B: Okay.
[25:17] A: We're going to be adjusting how your brain reacts and responds to stuff. Like the silly example of the lion in his eagle. Because people say it's lion that makes zebra scared. Makes sense. I don't disagree. But if we look from a different lens, we go, wait, no, it's zebra's brain that's making zebra alert, motivated, and strong. Yes. It's doing it. As soon as the zebra senses, feels, smells, thinks, lying is coming. But it's zebra's brain that's doing it to zebra. Got it.
[25:55] B: Yes.
[25:56] A: So that lens, there's been ways in which your brain has been working that's causing you to feel good. By bad remaining the lingering effect of the past. By bad remaining the more. Right. By bad remaining the more on edge. By bad remaining the gosh, I should probably be with this guy, even though I'm gonna be good. Like the. Your brain might be doing all that stuff to you in response to stuff. Some past, some current, some future. You've recognized that way of your brain working has been problematic. That's the issue that's on the table for us to get better.
[26:31] B: Okay.
[26:32] A: Got it.
[26:32] B: Yes.
[26:32] A: And if we look at it from the lens that it's something your brain has been doing, it's making you feel bad. The first question is, do you really think that your brain wants you to feel bad? No, it doesn't. Right. Do you think it would want you to feel good?
[26:46] B: Yeah.
[26:46] A: Right? No.
[26:47] B: No.
[26:48] A: That's the fucked up Part Oh, God. See, what we've learned in working with lots of people is that even though you're a pretty bright gal and I'm a pretty bright guy, most of our brain emotionally works like the brain of an animal. Animals don't have feelings because the brain of the animal is concerned about that. Animal's mood affects how it feels about itself. Whether it has good or a bad day. Its level of self esteem, self worth or self love causes it for a different reason. Motivate the animal to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. That simple. So when the rabbit sees the fox approach, the brain makes it experience fear to get it to run away. Not because it wants the rabbit to have a bad day.
[27:33] B: Hmm.
[27:34] A: Squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire. The brain makes it experience pain.
[27:39] B: Yeah.
[27:39] A: Not because it wants the squirrel to hate itself, feel like a stupid dumb moron for being so careless and getting too close to the freaking fire. And now it's Mars. Ought to be embarrassed without all the others. It's actually much simpler. Just get the tail out of the fire. So all the negative emotions. That's right. That we experience. Hurt, anger, sadness, resentment, guilt, shame, regret, remorse, angst, upset, worry, confusion. All those negative emotions are being caused by the part of our brain that works like an animal. Same purpose. To motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem. Where the error comes in is that our brain makes us feel bad trying to motivate us to solve a problem. Problem we can't solve. That's why you and I know we tend to feel bad about the same shit over and over and over again. Good news. Many of the stuff that we feel bad about is in a time period that's finished. So we don't actually have to solve it. All we want to do is update the timing. Timing is what malfunctions. The reason why is your body is the only thing about you that's in now. Always. Your body can't be anywhere other than right now.
[29:05] B: Okay.
[29:06] A: In your brain you can time travel. So how does anxiety work? Somebody's worrying about an awful scenario that could or might happen. And if it. If it were to happen, it would be bad. When are they feeling the distress? Now. That's where their body is. If somebody's remembering past stuff that happened that was awful, when are they feeling it? Now, because that's where their body is. Right? It doesn't work that way for a positive or a neutral experience. If somebody tells you about how they went to Universal Studios and they were a big Harry Potter fan, and they went through the whole Harry Potter world. When they tell it to you, you know that they know the difference between remembering doing it and doing it. It's very different.
[29:57] B: Yes.
[29:58] A: Somebody tells us about something awful that happened, what their uncle did to them when they were 8, and they're 58, 50 years later, and they start getting all kinds of what's wrong with him. It's almost as if he's reliving it. But what's really going on at a different level is his emotional brain is confusing the memory about what happened, thinking it's the experience. That's why he's having the troubling feelings. So, Tori, when we go through really troubling moments, it freezes. And the memory of it and the experience of it get glued together. So the memory lives as if it is the experience. That's why when he's telling us about it, we saw the effect. But it was affecting him even over the weekend when he was playing in the pool with his kids. It was just under the surface at a logical level. At 58, the guy knows that it's over and that it's been over for a long time. He realizes it wasn't his fault and he didn't do anything wrong. He realizes that some of it felt good, not because he wanted that, but because body parts touched in certain ways are designed to feel good. He knows all of it. He's even done the work where he's forgiven the guy for what he did. Why inside does he still feel all the hurt and the anger and the guilt and the shame? It's because at that emotional level, his brain never got updated. It never got the good news that it stopped. It still lives as if it's happening. Makes sense.
[31:46] B: Makes perfect sense.
[31:47] A: That's what stays on. Once that's on, our brain does a second thing to us as a human being. We were lied to by the people in authority, whether it be our parents or our culture or everything else around us. Lied to kids because they want kids to grow up to be good boys and girls. So we tell them that if you're good, life will be good. You'll get to live happily ever after. And that gets reinforced because when I'm being good, I might get prey. When I'm being good, I might get candy or toys. Some strange guy once a year drops gifts off because I'm good. Right? Little kids live in the message that good happens when I'm good, which is great. If everything in life is always good. I've never met anybody who's had it all good. See, the problem isn't that we told kids that life was good. The problem is the other message got installed too. Which is bad things only happen when we're bad. Now that isn't true and you know that as an adult, it's not. Yeah, but when we were little, that's what got reinforced. Mommy gives me a spanking because I was being bad. Mommy's disappointed at me because I was being bad. Even the 18 month old who's now got wheels, easy. But mom's looking for him, knows that when he's quiet, he's doing something he's not supposed to do. She's looking frantically. She sees him across the way in the bathroom. He's got the can of Comet and he's already got the cupboard open. The Comet. She shrieks loudly screaming no. Rushes over there, grabs the Comet out of his, swats him on the hine. What is the nervous system of the child learning? I was doing something I wasn't supposed to do. Mommy got mad. Bad thing happened to me. Therefore bad happens when I'm being bad. So now fast forward to the woman who's leaving work at 4:30 at night. It's light out. She's in a nice suburban area like this. She's parked on the other side of the parking lot and she walks towards her car. When she goes to get in the driver's door, two guys in a van jump out. They grab her, they throw her in the van, they drive off to a secluded area for a week, beat and rape her. Horrific. Do you know what's worse? When she comes to see me, she goes, you know, I am never going to forgive myself for that. I go, for what? She goes, well, clearly being stupid and careless and reckless, not paying attention, putting myself in danger. You walked across the parking lot at work at 4:30 30 at night in a nice area, huh? But because it was bad, what gets installed, it's my fault. I should have known better.
[34:36] B: Yes.
[34:37] A: I shouldn't have put myself in that situation. Right. That happens all the time with people. Right, because if you had known that was gonna happen, you still would have done the walk. No, of course not.
[34:51] B: That's true.
[34:52] A: Right?
[34:53] B: Yeah, but I had no idea.
[34:55] A: But see, once that gets in, now we've got the meaning. Which makes me feel worse about me. That's what's affecting me. Feeling whether I'm good enough or smart enough or pretty enough or lovable enough or worthy enough, or. It all gets stuck with those Meanings attached to bad experiences. But once they're on and they're locked in, my brain is now sensitive and vigilant. It's ongoingly looking for anything that's similar. But it'll confuse similar as same always. So the guy's telling us about how his wife had an affair three years ago, not because he's still troubled. They repaired the marriage, they're together, they're doing better than they were before. But every time he sees a blue Ford pickup truck. Oh, no. Did you have sex with the truck? No. Right, okay. But it's similar, right? That's one of the things. The soldier dies on the ground when the firework explodes. Not because he doesn't know it's the 4th of July, he left the firework. It's that at a different level. The brain confused it. Follow me with that. Yes, the person drives by the White House in a different community than the White House that they got beaten and raped in. But they drive by the White House and it's got similar shutters. It's the same color and the same color, and they have. The house was not the fucking issue. What happened in the house was the fucking issue. But is there similarity? And my brain is going to confuse things that are similar, but it matches it as same for survival purposes. Because the part that's activating is like an animal. And for an animal, the sooner and more intensely I respond to anything that's threatening, the better chance I have to survive it. The rabbit that hears the twig snap and took off. That rabbit's still around. The rabbit that heard the twig snap thought it was George, and it wasn't. So it reacts. The problem is that it's confusing. Similar as same. So we get reactions all the time, whether it be sounds or smells or times of year. I remember one person that I worked with, and it was October. And October was when they had, like, horrific ritualistic torture happen to them. Great. Now, guess what happens every October? They get all panicky.
[37:35] B: Yeah, yeah.
[37:36] A: But what does October of, you know, 2019 have anything to do with October of, you know, 1997? Nothing. Okay, but is there some similarity? Yeah, it's fucking October. That happens all the time. Some of it we're consciously aware of. Most of it runs us underneath the surface. All of it continues to haunt until we turn the lights on, until we unplug the memory by getting in the good news. With most troubling moments, the moment stops at the worst part of it, and that's the one that replays. Like the guy Whose wife died. And every time he thinks about her now, he sees him kissing her cold forehead as her body's wielded at hers. Great. That's a lovely image to have. Every time I think of my wife of 42 years that I had great marriage with. Right. But if that's the one that comes up, what does it block? Access to good memories. Anything that was more enjoyable. Yeah, right. Any of the experience later that were more fun. And we all have those. When it comes to certain stuff where it gets stuck where that's the thing that replays. We want it unplugged because we want the emotional part of the brain to know that it stopped. That's the real error. We don't actually have to solve the problems anymore because the purpose of the feeling is to get me to get it to stop. Good news. It has. So all we got to do is unplug the memory. How do we do it? Well, you stay with me emotionally present here when we remember past stuff. So it's not about feeling, getting it out. It's about being here. Because I'm more fun. So that your brain begins to get that it's data. Once it's read as data, the feelings are gone. Like gone. Like gone gone.
[39:43] B: Like gone.
[39:43] A: Yeah. And they don't come back. Because it's the same thing that happens with Sam. When you know he's not real, you can't believe in him anymore. It's done. It's changed forever. We can pretend for the. For the kids sake. Sucks for Dad's. It was Santa that put the tree swing up in my house, not me.
[40:06] B: That's funny.
[40:08] A: Yeah. Santa, right in the middle of the night. Yeah. Daddy's technical and is really good at that. Stuff happening at night. Right? Reindeer, Santa, elves, or Daddy. No credit.
[40:24] B: That's funny.
[40:25] A: So that's what we want to be getting shifted. Right. And then we want to have another way of thinking about stuff. Because people have had yucky stuff happen to their bodies. Right. All of us have had something yucky happen. Or at least most. Maybe there's some people that haven't. But yucky stuff happen. The body. And then people tend to think of that. I am my body.
[40:52] B: Okay.
[40:53] A: But we want to have a different lens to look at that. So as we're headed towards this, you, who's much lighter, who's much more at peace and much more comfortable in her own skin, getting her own worth and value so that she's good enough for herself. This isn't you that I'm seeing. Free from the effect of the prior step, reading other people's craft as being about them and experiencing more contentment as she's on her way to where she's going so that she's feeling really good about what she's doing and where she's headed.
[41:30] B: Okay.
[41:31] A: Right.
[41:31] B: Yes.
[41:32] A: This is the you that I'm seeing. And again, this is where we're organizing. And that's okay with you? Yeah. Good. So then as we do that, we've got two separate pieces. One, our brain loves and is very responsive to symbols. So if an advertiser uses it, we know our brain responds. It's why, when you see a big yellow arch, you think of McDonald's. When you see a swoosh mark, you think of Nike. And when you see that, you know, girl green on the coffee cup, you go, that's Starbucks.
[42:05] B: Yeah.
[42:06] A: Right. Our brain responds to symbols. We want to get a way to symbolize this. You wild animals, something out in nature, something up in the sky, something that grows from the ground, a natural formation of the earth. What comes to mind to symbolize this? You. Light, clear, peaceful, free. More and more emotionally present. Content. Good on the inside. Right.
[42:37] B: Okay.
[42:38] A: What comes to mind is symbolic.
[42:40] B: An owl.
[42:40] A: An owl. Beautiful. An owl is a. As you see the owl, is it moving or still?
[42:49] B: Say that again.
[42:50] A: As you see the owl, is it moving or still?
[42:53] B: It's moving.
[42:54] A: It's moving. Like soaring or flapping. Soaring. Last week I. That owl mal song becomes a powerful symbol. We're going to use that to have your body become more in a state of rest. So you're simply going to look up and out. You're going to think owl. As you do that, you're going to take a long, slow breath in. So go ahead and look up and out. Think owl and breathe in. That's the first part that was simple, wasn't it?
[43:20] B: Yeah.
[43:21] A: Second is going to be the exact same thing as that. This time, though, after inhaling, you exhale and close your eyes. So look up and out. Think ow. Big breath in and then exhale. And eyes are closed. Good. You can open your eyes. Same thing as that. This time, though, when they close, they're going to stay closed for just a few moments. You're going to bring awareness into your breath.
[43:47] B: Okay?
[43:48] A: So look up and out. Think owl. Deep breath in. Good. Exhale. Eyes are closed. Good. With your eyes closed, bring your awareness in towards your breathing so that you continue to breathe in that way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper. Just like that. And Then, when you're ready in a moment, take one more big deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Those short moments that your eyes were closed, what did you begin to notice within yourself?
[44:35] B: Calmness.
[44:36] A: Yeah. Which is a nice healing to have. And that's what we're headed, is you becoming much more calm as we clear out all that stuff. Which would be weird that I'll be calm as I remember stuff that was sucking.
[44:50] B: Yes.
[44:51] A: Right. But it would be really cool as that happens.
[44:53] B: Right.
[44:54] A: So again, we're going to look out, think out one more breath in, exhale and close your eyes. Good. With eyes closed, they rest. As your eyes rest, you rest. You're aware of your breath. My voice sounds up above and behind. Aware of all of that. At the same time, your unconscious now is responding towards what the owl symbolizes. Already beginning to make change, added deeper, which doesn't require effort. It just automatically happens. Because your unconscious is interested in working in ways that are best for you. Naturally beginning to happen. Now should rest. Which means the next time you rest with your eyes closed, it'll be even easier to be transported to deeper and suffering. Towards the light at your center, where there is a calm and a peaceful and an easy flowing energy. That's right. And then one more time, taking your time to find your way up with a big breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Good job. Now, next, I want you to think of a time when you are outside in nature. You see something beautiful. What is it that you see?
[46:33] B: Mountains.
[46:34] A: Yeah. There's a moment when you're seeing those mountains, you're feeling that peace and the excitement all at the same time. And some people would say that seeing is what's giving you those feelings. But if we look at it differently, we go, wait a minute. No. Being there and seeing that actually is drawing your awareness down and in towards your center. Because at your center you are peaceful and excited. Kind of like if I've got a candle and the flame is burning and I take my hand and I move it down towards the flame and I go, boy, toward the candle's getting hotter. Is it really that the candle's getting hotter? I'm becoming more aware of it.
[47:18] B: Yes.
[47:18] A: Right. So we know that in your life there have been lots of occurrences and occasions and things where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. Stressors, upsets, angst, guilt, shames, pains, worries. But no matter where your awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited. Just like you know that there are two of us in this room. You know it because you can look around. That's knowledge. Light of knowledge. Up there at your center is a brighter light, light of wisdom. So now we've got knowledge and wisdom. And I remember this one girl, she had lots of yucky stuff happened to her. But one of the really yucky things that happened to her, his older brother, when he was little, he used to take Matchbox cars, drive them up her leggings, park them in her. So she had a lot of gunk around all of that. But as we worked together, included, she was present and feeling okay. And I had to ask her the question, you know, all of that discomfort, I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone. I don't feel it. I go, now? She goes, it's cool. I go, yeah. But I go, the question was, where was it? We started thinking. I go, was it at the surface? She's like, no, it wasn't in the vaccine. Oh, was it? Was it at your center? She's like, dude, how could it survive in that light? Wow. Right? So I said, where was it? And we started thinking. She goes, oh, I know. It was hiding in the shadows, the gunk that's been in the way. I go, well, what happened? She goes, the lights, they've joined. They're touching. I said, isn't that cool? She goes, yeah. And then we started talking about how neuroscience likes to say that you have a body.
[48:56] B: Mm.
[48:57] A: It's totally yours. But it isn't actually you. That. If you and I came back one year from today, almost all of the subatomic particles that make you and I up wouldn't be here. Now, they don't all leave at once. That's like Star Trek. But they wouldn't actually be here. That. When my mom was 17, she lost the tip of her finger in a snow cone machine accident. When they go to visit and other people come and she visits other people, they don't say, susie, I'm glad almost all of you could come over. So we know that you have a body. It's totally yours, but it isn't actually you.
[49:31] B: Okay?
[49:31] A: You also have thoughts. There's not a cell right now that's the same as it was when you were born. They've all been replaced at least millions of times.
[49:39] B: Okay?
[49:40] A: Your feet alone are longer than they were when you were three. Yet despite all that, you're still you. You have thoughts which most people go, I am the thoughts that I think. Except you're not even the thinker of Your thoughts, your brain is. It's yours, not you. You have one. Your brain is an organ, like your heart is an organ. Okay, so you're not the thoughts. People go, well, then I must be my feelings. Except you feel different ways at different times. Happy, sad, angry, glad. Yet you're still you. So you're not a feeling. Well, maybe you're what you do. But there's lots of things you've done through life. And when you stop doing one thing to do something else. You did not stop existing. Which leads us to the weird question. If you are not what you do, and if you're not your feelings, and if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not your body, what are you? Maybe the who you are is what you became aware of as you see the mountains. Maybe the who you are is the light at the center. And you know what's really cool about light? It can't be touched or hurt or harmed. It only experiences the love that it allows in it's whole and complete and totally indestructible. And I say it because people screw up identity words to me all the time. They go, I'm anxious, I'm depressed, I'm shy, I'm irritable. I'm angry. Thinking that the way and who they are is how they feel. But if I, you know, went to the dentist and I go, you'll never believe what that jerk did to me. What did he do? Well, he put me in a chair. Yeah. My head went down. Yeah. He shined a light in my eyes. Yeah. And then he shoved this cold metal instrument right up inside of me. And you're like, oh, my goodness, in your heart. I go, tori, my mouth. I'm at the dentist. But it's the same thing I said to that girl with her brother. I said, when you were really little, he messed with your stuff. She goes, yeah, I did. And it hurt my feelings and it screwed up my thinking for a long time. But then she started to have this glow about her. And she goes, but you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my body. It screwed up my feelings. It screwed up my thinking. But he never touched me. I go, whoa, that's powerful.
[52:25] B: It is.
[52:26] A: Yeah. So what if there's stuff that's happened, but it never got who you really are? Because the who you really are can only be touched with respect and love. So I want you to think of that owl one more time. Soaring owl. Take that big breath in. Exhale. And close your eyes. Good. With your eyes closed. They rest as your eyes rest closed. You also rest aware of your breath sounds dropping deeply down in to delight at your center, where there is a calm and a peaceful, easy, flowing energy. And because the unconscious parts of your mind have direct access to the control panels, they know exactly what buttons to press and the hubs to turn on, levers to shift, switches to flip, to reorganize and reprogram. To restructure your brain so that it's optimized to function more naturally in the way you want. Automatically. These changes are happening first at deeper levels. Just like when planting seedlings in the soil. We know that there's a lot going on under the surface before you ever see the change happening. Your unconscious doing that within you, beginning to lighten up so that you become more peaceful and free. All of that happening now is your resting, which means the next time you close your eyes, it'll be even easier to drift deeper down to that calm, peaceful resting. And then in a moment, once again, when you're ready, taking your time, finding your way back. Up and up and up and up. That's right. One. One more big breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. What did you notice in you in those short moments eyes were closed?
[55:09] B: What I noticed just as peaceful as calm.
[55:13] A: I just focused on you're peaceful, calm, right. And so you're uncomfortable is responding. You're becoming more peaceful and calm. And what will happen at the same time is that part of your brain is going to travel back through negative experiences that have happened, whether they be more recentized long time ago. And they're going to begin to group and categorize them, maybe not chronologically, but by type of experience that would be useful for us to unplug and clear. And as it begins to categorize a group, it's going to narrow down and pinpoint a particular experience that would be useful to clear. So your unconscious travels. What moment comes to mind?
[56:11] B: Moment?
[56:12] A: Yeah, negative thing that happened. One, one, just one @ a time. The homosexin that would be useful to get cleared. As you think about that moment, the feelings that come up are feelings of what? Hurt.
[56:28] B: Anger.
[56:29] A: Yeah. Would it be okay to get the hurt and anger gone?
[56:32] B: Yes.
[56:33] A: If you were no longer hurting and no longer angry, would it be mean it was okay? No. Right. You get to be okay even if that wasn't okay. Right. That's true. Because wouldn't you want the other person to be okay even if you weren't here anymore and the thing happened to you? Wouldn't you want them to be okay. Right. I worked with a soldier one time whose buddy happened to be in the seat that he was in when the IED came. He had a lot of guilt. Shouldn't have happened. He had family. I didn't have a family. Should have been me, not him. But as we got it clear, we also got him to realize. Wait a minute. Your buddy isn't wanting your life to suck and isn't wanting you to be troubled by that experience. He's actually wanting your life to work really well. He's wanting you to be okay. He's been okay with it for a lot longer than. That's what we want to get in. So how we clear something is simple. One, you're going to intend to emotionally be with me here now, because this is what's happening and that isn't.
[57:41] B: Yeah.
[57:41] A: Two, we're working on a mutual goal that we're both interested. Three, on more fun and sucky stuff. So I want you with me.
[57:46] B: Okay.
[57:47] A: Second, you're going to tell me just facts about what happened. Okay. So it'll go, that happened, that happened. That happened, that happened, that happened. Three, if it happened a period of time ago, there have been other things you've done after it that were more fun in that moment.
[58:01] B: Okay.
[58:01] A: What's one thing, any time from when that ended until yesterday that was more fun than that?
[58:06] B: The beach.
[58:06] A: Going to the beach. Way more fun than that. Good. Something else.
[58:10] B: The Springs.
[58:11] A: Going to the Springs were way more fun than that. One other thing that you've done anytime from the Ben until yesterday, that was more fun than that. Movies. Yeah. Going to the movies. Right. So we got. Going to the movies, being at the Springs. We got being at all those moments way more enjoyable. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know. Okay. Anything beyond that moment. Right. We got good news to get in.
[58:30] B: Okay.
[58:31] A: Right. Which is what we want to do. Right. So when that particular moment happened, you were aware where it happened?
[58:37] B: I was there.
[58:38] A: Where?
[58:38] B: In a hotel room.
[58:39] A: So you're in a hotel room. Good.
[58:40] B: In Tampa.
[58:42] A: In Tampa. Good. Right. And it was daytime or nighttime?
[58:44] B: It was nighttime.
[58:44] A: It was nighttime. And you're where? In the hotel room?
[58:47] B: I am in a different room.
[58:49] A: So you're in a different room?
[58:50] B: Yeah. Like two doors, two rooms down.
[58:52] A: Two rooms down. Right. And you're, like, on the bed or you're on the.
[58:56] B: I'm on the bed.
[58:58] A: So you're on the bed. Are you watching tv?
[59:00] B: No.
[59:00] A: No. You're just on the bed?
[59:01] B: Yeah. I'm just trying to hit.
[59:03] A: You were doing whatever. Good. And then what happened next?
[59:06] B: And then I get a FaceTime video.
[59:08] A: Right, good. You got a FaceTime video. So you hit the little thing. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[59:12] B: I see a dead girl in the background.
[59:14] A: Right. You see her in the background? Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[59:16] B: And he didn't know what to do.
[59:18] A: He's like, so, what do I do about it?
[59:19] B: What do I do? She said, right, good job, good detail.
[59:22] A: Right. She's blue. Right, Good. Then what happened?
[59:24] B: I freaked out.
[59:25] A: You're like, I don't know what to do either.
[59:26] B: I said, chop up the body. Right.
[59:27] A: Good job, good detail. And then what happened next?
[59:29] B: And then he said that he had to go serve people.
[59:31] A: Right. Good job, good detail.
[59:33] B: And then he went back or came back like, I think like seven hours later. And still in the room. Yeah. He left.
[59:41] A: And then you were in the room.
[59:42] B: I was. I was in the other room.
[59:44] A: And you were doing whatever you're doing.
[59:45] B: Yeah, yeah. And then he was trying to find people to dispose of her body.
[59:53] A: Right, Good. So, like, what do we do? So he was calling people. Yes. What happened next?
[59:57] B: He finally got people 24 hours later.
[59:59] A: Right. So then a whole day later.
[60:01] B: Yes.
[60:01] A: Right, good.
[60:02] B: They switch. Stripped her down naked.
[60:04] A: Right. Good job.
[60:05] B: They hog tied her.
[60:06] A: Good job. Right. And you were there when they were doing that. So you went in that room then.
[60:09] B: Yeah.
[60:10] A: Right. And then they'd done what they did. And they did that. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[60:13] B: And then he went into. Or then they put her in a tarp thing.
[60:18] A: Right, Good job. Right, good.
[60:18] B: People dumped her off outside of the Harry Franklin.
[60:22] A: And then they were. You were in the car then. And then they stopped and then they dumped her and did that. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[60:29] B: And I went home in holiday.
[60:31] A: And then you got driven off to holiday. And then that particular moment.
[60:34] B: Yes.
[60:35] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun like go to the springs.
[60:38] B: Yeah.
[60:39] A: Or be at the beach. Yeah. Or go to that movie.
[60:41] B: Yeah.
[60:41] A: Right. Now notice as you're recalling it, all that discomfort.
[60:44] B: Yeah.
[60:45] A: Right. Not because that was sucky.
[60:46] B: Okay.
[60:47] A: But because your brain was confusing the memory, thinking it was the experience.
[60:53] B: Okay.
[60:54] A: Right. It was causing the discomfort, trying to motivate you to get it to stop. Good news. It has. Do you know what we never do with the memory?
[61:02] B: What?
[61:02] A: Go backwards. But when you go backwards with the memory, it literally unplugs the memory. It flattens up the neurons. It takes away the charge. So we're going to run backwards. Watch what happens. So we got being at the movie, we got going to the beach, we got being at the Springs, and then you were back on holiday and then they dropped you off, and then the car pulled off, off, and then they dumped the body. And then you were driving down the Howard Franklin, and then you guys left the hotel room and then they had wrapped her in the tarp and then they tied her up and then they taken the clothes off and then they had gotten there. And then before that, he had called a bunch of different people and then he had come back. Right. And then he was gone. And then you're like, I don't know, chop up the body, do whatever I want to do. And then he had go, what the hell do I do? And then you had gotten the FaceTime video. And then before that you were lying on the bed, and then before that you were doing whatever you're doing. Right. As we go backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it? Same. More or less.
[61:55] B: Less.
[61:56] A: Isn't that weird?
[61:57] B: Yeah.
[61:57] A: Who would have thought?
[61:58] B: I know.
[61:58] A: That going backwards would make it less. Yeah, right.
[62:03] B: Crazy.
[62:05] A: Now, that's the first part of it, because your brain is beginning to read that it's data. Okay, second piece. The emotional part of our brain does not respond to logic. It responds instead to patterns of association. So there's a great pattern of association game we get to play. Which is because the problem is that the brain doesn't know the difference between the memory of it and the experience are glued together. There are many things that you know the difference between remembering doing it and doing it. Like putting your genes on today. You can remember doing it. You can remember where you were when you did it. But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your jeans on, and then I said, tori, stop putting on your jeans, you'd look at me and go, I'm not putting on my jeans. Because you know, there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you doing it. They're not the same thing. So you can remember that happening, him calling and all that stuff, and people coming, doing what they did. You can remember all that happening. You can remember putting your jeans on today. Okay, Tori, stop putting on your jeans. Say, I am not putting on my jeans. Well, stop putting on your shoes. Say, I am not putting on my shoes.
[63:13] B: Say that I'm not putting on my shoes.
[63:14] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say, you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then stop me from putting on my shoes. Say, you're not putting on your shoes. Well, stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that.
[63:23] B: He's not doing that.
[63:24] A: Well, then you stop putting on your sweater. So I'm not putting on my sweater.
[63:26] B: I'm not putting on my sweater.
[63:27] A: Well, then stop him from calling you. Say he's not calling you. Well, then you stop putting on your genes. Say, I am not putting on my jeans.
[63:32] B: I am not putting on my jeans.
[63:33] A: Well, then stop telling them that. Say I'm not telling them that.
[63:36] B: I'm not telling them that.
[63:36] A: Well, then stop them from doing that. See, they're not doing that.
[63:38] B: They're not doing that.
[63:39] A: So then where is that experience? Say it no longer exists.
[63:42] B: It no longer exists.
[63:43] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to get in to the part of your brain that didn't know. Right. By the way, any of that happening, did it have anything to do with you?
[63:55] B: I.
[63:56] A: No, it didn't, did it? You thought it did for a little bit.
[63:59] B: Yeah.
[64:00] A: You thought you were kind of somewhat involved or because he had called you into, well, I don't know, chop the body up.
[64:05] B: I would never have said that, though. That's.
[64:08] A: Well, wouldn't that be. Well, I mean.
[64:10] B: I mean, I said it, but.
[64:11] A: You did.
[64:12] B: Yeah.
[64:13] A: Not because you actually wanted him to chop up the body?
[64:15] B: No.
[64:15] A: Yeah, but he was asking for solutions. Right. And what do we see on tv? Well, fuck. What do they do with the dead body?
[64:23] B: Chop it up. Yeah. That's horrible.
[64:27] A: That's right. But it wasn't because you actually wanted him to chop up her body?
[64:31] B: No.
[64:31] A: You didn't even want her to be dead.
[64:32] B: No.
[64:33] A: Right, but see where it got stuck is some of that happening and then them doing that and then had something to do with you. Did it have anything to do with you? No, no. It had to do with what was going on with them. Right. But you didn't know that back then. So I want you to repeat these four words. Here we go. It's. It's not about me. Right. It's not.
[64:54] B: It's not about me.
[64:56] A: That's right. Now close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You just. After that happened, let her know that it's over, finished, completed, defeated, that experience no longer exists. That then doing that, him and the other people had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was offered them. It's not about me. So that she gets it. That's right. Let that you know about going to the beach and the springs, being at the movies. Let her know about how you're changing now. That's right. So the earlier you get it and as she's getting it, what do you notice happening to her face?
[65:36] B: Smiling.
[65:37] A: Yeah. You can open your eyes, right? Yeah. That's a good breath. Right. And what's happening now?
[65:46] B: Center and calm.
[65:48] A: You are already right. And we still don't like that it happened. I don't think miracle will. But again, them doing that had nothing to do with you. Had everything to do with what was going on then. Right. Which is starting to it in at a deeper level, by the way. She wasn't thinking, oh, my goodness, this. This other gal hates me. Right. Because she was more okay with it than you've been. Yeah, right. That's right. She gets that experience couldn't help not happen. Even though we don't like it that it did because she's got a different level of understanding. And we know you saying that wasn't because that's what you actually wanted to do. Right. But it was because of I don't want to be able to do that. Right.
[66:50] B: Saw it on Criminal Minds.
[66:52] A: That's right. That's right. Yeah. And as you're getting all of that, what do you notice now? I noticed. Yeah.
[67:04] B: It's not affecting me.
[67:05] A: It isn't, is it? Isn't that cool?
[67:07] B: Yeah.
[67:08] A: Notice how different that is?
[67:09] B: Very.
[67:10] A: Right. You're getting free. Right. To become more at peace and clear. Because people oftentimes think that when somebody's bodies stop working, it's that they stop. But it's actually when the body stops working, they exit it because they're no longer in need of it because it stopped. The essence of who they are is ongoing. Einstein, a smart dude, said, who we are is energy plus matter equals the physical existence. And that energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. So when the body stops, it's not that they stop, the body stops, they exit it. They're no longer in need of it. And you can see it even in a chase scene with a predator and a prey. Rabbit's being run down by a fox. And there's a moment that the rabbit knows that death is inevitable. It's not going to be able to get away. There's no exit routes. Getting tired. But it's far enough from the fox so the fox hasn't caught it. Put it. When the. The moment that the rabbit gets that its death is inevitable, that rabbit stops and the body of the rabbit is completely still. Rabbit's mind takes Rabbit away. Rabbit doesn't need to be there for that. Right. Not even in the body isn't that interesting?
[68:32] B: Yeah.
[68:34] A: And so as we're organizing towards the eye and everything that the owl symbolizes, I want to show you something that I think is kind of weird but also interesting.
[68:44] B: Okay.
[68:44] A: So take that hand. You're going to put it on the pillow. You're going to hold your hand up like that. When you do this, you're going to look at that spot right there.
[68:52] B: Okay.
[68:52] A: Don't do anything at all on purpose to move your hand or your fingers. Just focus on that. Excuse me. Well, you're going to start noticing movement happening in the hand, but it's not going to to be on purpose. Even though you can try to keep your hand completely still. That's right. You're going to notice some unconscious movement every time you notice the movement within the fingers. That's right. Within that hand. That's right. That's it. Just think the word yes. Because each time you notice it, it's your unconscious responding to you, transforming you deeper. That's right. Into more calm and peaceful healing. Because that's right. Your unconscious is interested. That's right.
[69:38] B: That's it.
[69:40] A: You're healing. That's it. From the inside out. Much of those movements you couldn't even try on purpose do. Because even if you did, you realize cause movements. That's right. That are not conscious. That's it. Your unconscious is responding to you. That's it. Even now at different and deeper. That's right. Otherwise. That's right. So much more is happening. And just check how's your body feeling now? That's right. And it's kind of curious to notice the movement. But what will be also interesting for you to notice. That's right. Is what happens when I take my hand towards yours. You'll see it with your peripheral vision as it gets closer. But you'll also notice before it touches your hand that you can feel my hand. That's right. You feel my hand here different than when it's there. And you see my point that with it here you feel it. Right. Interesting that I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with body or hurt your feelings. Screwed with your thinking. Because the who you really are can only be touched with respect and love. That's why take another big deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. And then just drop down, down, down, down, down, deeper in, deep inside. Towards the light at your center. That calm and peaceful easy flowing energy. Because your unconscious is so wonderfully responsive to you. It's interested in causing healing at so Many levels in so many ways, getting you to be more afraid of becoming more than who you are, which is even more than you think. That's right. And as your body stays in this nice, calm and peaceful resting, as you find your way back up, big breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes again, the unconscious parts will travel back through things that have happened and bring another moment to mind to clear. What comes to mind now?
[72:51] B: Peace.
[72:52] A: You are feeling peaceful, aren't you? Which is something that you don't always feel and haven't been feeling for a while, but you're starting to feel it now. Isn't that a good news to you?
[73:03] B: Yes, I love it.
[73:05] A: Yeah. And we're on our way to more of it by getting the effect that stuff has had. So again now the unconscious part is going to travel back through those negative experiences long time ago reason. And we'll bring another moment to mind for us to clear. Yeah. What comes to mind now?
[73:27] B: Oh, man. Honestly, Trying to kill myself.
[73:34] A: Oh. When did that happen?
[73:36] B: February 4th.
[73:37] A: February 4th of this year. Oh, okay, good. So you're where and what happened?
[73:42] B: I was at a Super 8.
[73:45] A: So you're at a Super 8. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[73:47] B: It was nighttime.
[73:48] A: Nighttime. Right. And you're at the Super 8 and you're in the hotel room or outside? On the.
[73:52] B: Outside the hotel room.
[73:53] A: Outside the hotel room. First floor, second floor.
[73:56] B: I was outside, like in the parking lot.
[73:57] A: So you're outside in the parking lot. Good. Then what happened?
[74:00] B: I bought six bags of fentanyl.
[74:01] A: So you bought six bags of fentanyl? Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[74:04] B: I couldn't hit, so I got pissed and swallowed the six bags.
[74:09] A: So you swallowed the six bags live anymore? Fuck it.
[74:11] B: Yeah.
[74:12] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[74:13] B: And then I woke up in the hospital.
[74:15] A: So you woke up in the hospital? Yeah.
[74:16] B: Handcuffed?
[74:17] A: Handcuffed. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[74:18] B: I went to jail.
[74:19] A: Well, they had gotten the stuff up.
[74:21] B: Huh? I overdosed.
[74:23] A: Right.
[74:24] B: They got brought me back.
[74:25] A: They did, didn't they? Right.
[74:26] B: Yeah.
[74:27] A: And then you were okay?
[74:28] B: Yes.
[74:29] A: Like awake?
[74:30] B: Yeah.
[74:30] A: Right. And then they took you to jail. Right. And then what happened next?
[74:33] B: And then I stayed, I mean, in jail. I don't know, like three weeks later. I got introduced to the homicide detective.
[74:43] A: And then you got introduced to homicide detective. Right. And then what happened?
[74:46] B: And then she showed me pictures.
[74:49] A: Right. Good job. Of that person?
[74:51] B: Yes.
[74:51] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[74:53] B: She told me that she wanted me to get help.
[74:56] A: Yes. Good job. Good detail. Right. Then what happened?
[74:58] B: And then I had an interview with Sailor.
[74:59] A: And then you had Tahir. And then later on you went to the beach.
[75:03] B: Yeah.
[75:03] A: Right, in the Springs.
[75:04] B: Yes.
[75:05] A: Right. And went to the movies.
[75:06] B: Yes.
[75:06] A: Right. So we got going to the Springs in the movies.
[75:08] B: Yes.
[75:08] A: And the beach. And then being at Salah. Right. And then she wanted you to get help, and then you had told her what you knew, and then she had shown you the pictures, and then you got introduced to her.
[75:20] B: Yeah.
[75:20] A: And then you were in jail, and then you got taken to jail, and then you woke up in the hospital, and then you had taken the fentanyl and then you were pissed that you couldn't get it to work, and then you bought it. And then before that you were doing whatever you're doing.
[75:34] B: Yeah.
[75:34] A: Right. And as we go through it backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it done? Right. You can remember all that happened?
[75:40] B: Yeah.
[75:41] A: You can remember putting your jeans on?
[75:42] B: Yeah.
[75:43] A: Tori, stop putting on your jeans.
[75:44] B: I'm not.
[75:45] A: Well, stop swallowing the fentanyl.
[75:46] B: I'm not.
[75:50] A: Then stop putting on your sweater, Sandra. I'm not putting on my sweater. I'm not doing that.
[75:53] B: I'm not doing that.
[75:54] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[75:56] B: No longer exists.
[75:57] A: Right. Now close your eyes and let the you know where you are now. Here. Not just in this office, but how much you've changed already. Right? Right. Because all she wanted to do was not feel. And you're learning ways to get the feelings to be clear. Healing. Healing is happening inside. Let her know I'll be in a sailor. Let her know about going to the beach or no, but the Springs. Let her know about that. So I know how long you've already gotten to being clean. Clear. That's right. And then maybe be a little bit thankful to her for having done that because it got you here, which isn't the way that you've ever thought of that. But I'm wondering what it would be like to actually be appreciative. Because that is the thing that transformed the first start of you transforming your life for the better. Who would have thought.
[77:17] B: That'S true.
[77:18] A: I know, right? Who would have thought that that's what it would have been?
[77:22] B: Yeah.
[77:22] A: Right. But it is. And you're doing it, transforming your life for the better. So when you think back about that now, what do you notice?
[77:33] B: It's okay.
[77:36] A: Anything about it? Trouble?
[77:38] B: No.
[77:40] A: Like having done it. Are you at all troubled by having.
[77:44] B: By doing it right now?
[77:46] A: Yeah.
[77:46] B: No.
[77:47] A: Isn't that weird?
[77:48] B: Yeah.
[77:48] A: Right. Notice how you haven't ever not been.
[77:51] B: Yeah.
[77:53] A: And now you're thinking about it and you're not.
[77:55] B: No. How is that possible?
[78:01] A: It's cool, right?
[78:02] B: Yeah.
[78:03] A: Yeah, I like it. Yeah. Well, that's what we're doing. And notice how it's not about getting you into it. And I haven't asked once.
[78:10] B: No.
[78:11] A: How did it make you feel?
[78:12] B: You have not asked that word, that question. I mean.
[78:18] A: I don't think it's useful.
[78:20] B: Everyone where we're at still ask that. All the advocates. How did that make you feel?
[78:28] A: Yeah, we want to get rid of that question.
[78:30] B: Yeah, I don't want that question. Clearly you saw me, I didn't feel too great in the moment. That's how I feel.
[78:44] A: I don't even have to have been there to realize. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, right. And we want to get other things to be cleared. So again, your brain's travel back because all of a sudden one of the things that's going to start happening is as things begin to lighten and lift, your brain's going to go, do this one, do this one, do this one, do this one. More and more are going to come to get cleared. Right. What's another moment that comes to mind?
[79:16] B: They're getting raped.
[79:17] A: That would be a useful one. So that one happened. Oh, and be here. Notice how you went there.
[79:23] B: I went there. I know, I watched.
[79:29] A: But see, your job is to just intend to be with me.
[79:33] B: Okay.
[79:34] A: Here. Because this is. And that isn't okay. And my job is to keep you here with me. So when I notice, if I do notice, because I do notice.
[79:46] B: Yeah.
[79:48] A: Then my job is to get you back here.
[79:50] B: Okay?
[79:50] A: Right. I want you with me. Right. Because that's what we're doing. And we want to get that in. Right. And you can, even before you do it, you can remember that it happened, but it's not happening now. And what we're interested in doing is getting the good news. Because there's a part of you back then that wasn't sure she was going to be okay. And what we know is that you are because you're here. She just doesn't know that yet. There's a part of you back then that doesn't have the good news that you're here now. Right. Right. And as you get present to being here now, what we're doing is really a reconnaissance mission. Right. The soldier got separated from the troops in battle and the war ended and his side won. He's still in the jungle. He never found out. When we find him, we've Got really good news for him.
[81:00] B: I like it.
[81:01] A: I know. We've got really good news for that early review. Tell me.
[81:05] B: Yeah, yeah.
[81:06] A: Right. So when that thing happened, you're where.
[81:11] B: Where I am.
[81:12] A: So you're at a hotel.
[81:14] B: Yeah. Like sleep in.
[81:16] A: You're at a sleep in. Right. Good. And it was daytime or nighttime? It was nighttime and it was nighttime. And you're wearing the sleeping in his room. So you'd gone to the room, you've gotten the call or.
[81:26] B: TJ dropped me off.
[81:27] A: TJ dropped you off? Because they had figured out like, okay.
[81:30] B: I'm texting back page ad.
[81:33] A: Okay, so you had a back page ad. He texted you texted back and forth and TJ dropped you off.
[81:38] B: Yes.
[81:38] A: Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[81:39] B: It was supposed to just be like a full service.
[81:42] A: Yeah. So you were gonna go in there. Right. Good job, good detail.
[81:46] B: Right. And that's what he wanted.
[81:48] A: Yes. Good job.
[81:49] B: As in the middle of us having sex. He jammed it in there.
[81:53] A: He put it in a butt.
[81:54] B: Yeah, man. Yeah. That was not what I mean. He was holding me down.
[81:58] A: Right. Good job, good detail. Right now.
[82:00] B: And then he continued to do what he did. He threw $200 at me and then.
[82:05] A: He did it until he was done.
[82:06] B: Uh huh.
[82:06] A: Right. And then he stopped.
[82:07] B: Yes.
[82:08] A: You stopped fighting.
[82:09] B: I. Eventually, yeah. I couldn't. He was. I gave up.
[82:13] A: No, see, people always think that.
[82:15] B: I mean, I feel like that's why.
[82:17] A: I know. But I want you to look at that clearly for a second. Do you know when you stopped fighting? You had him stop fighting sooner. It had it end faster. As soon as you stopped fighting. It wasn't long after that it ended.
[82:30] B: Wow.
[82:31] A: Right? Have you ever heard the thing, the saying, what you resist persists. So the more you fight, the more it keeps going, the longer it takes. As soon as you stopped fighting, it was done.
[82:47] B: You're right.
[82:48] A: That's right. So you stopped, then he stopped, then he stopped. Right. And then he threw $200. My good. Then what happened next?
[82:55] B: I got dressed. So I had a dress on. Dress on.
[82:58] A: Put your dress on. You took the money? Yeah, I took the money. Good job, good detail.
[83:03] B: And I went outside and TJ wasn't there.
[83:06] A: And TJ wasn't there, right?
[83:07] B: No, I called him, video chatted with him.
[83:11] A: Yes. Good job.
[83:11] B: And I was like, where are you? He said he was at Burger King, which is five minutes away, but really he was back in Indian Rocks Beach. So he was like 40 minutes away. And so I freaked out. I started crying. He said what happened? And I showed him the blood dripping from my eyes.
[83:26] A: Good job, good detail. Right.
[83:27] B: And then he was there 40 minutes later and he said, where's the room? And I said, fight, pick your battles. Go do that.
[83:35] A: That's right. You said, don't do that.
[83:37] B: Yeah. And he said, I'm going to do it.
[83:39] A: Good job.
[83:39] B: And he told me, wait in the car with police. I went to police and you're in.
[83:45] A: The front seat or the back seat?
[83:46] B: I was in the back seat.
[83:47] A: In the back seat. Good job, good detail.
[83:49] B: He came back like 10 minutes later and said, we gotta go. And he had a baseball bat that was bloody.
[83:55] A: Good job, good detail. Right.
[83:57] B: And we went back to the house.
[83:59] A: Yes, good job, good detail.
[84:01] B: Then I mean, I continued do what I did.
[84:04] A: That particular time was over.
[84:05] B: Yeah, right. Yeah. And then he got caught too, weeks later.
[84:10] A: How so?
[84:12] B: The guy called the cops. Well, obviously the cops came, cuz he went to the hospital. He showed them my back page ad and he said that he was writing a book on prostitution and Backpage and escorts and that I came there with my pimp and he beat him up, he took his money. And when the cops, like, they recognized, like I guess they've been following, they knew him, they recognized us somehow, whatever. And I told them what really happened. They said it was statutory on like rape this and that. And they knew that that would. They knew that. They figured that's what happened. They didn't believe his story. But they still took TJ to jail.
[84:52] A: Right, and then you bonded him out.
[84:54] B: But he still went back to prison?
[84:55] A: Well, yeah, because then they went to court.
[84:58] B: Yeah.
[84:58] A: Oh, good.
[84:59] B: Yeah.
[85:00] A: And the guy testified?
[85:01] B: Well, no, the guy, we just. No, left that out. He just took 18 months for being smiling.
[85:09] A: Oh, so he just said, okay, no, I'll just take a sentence. Yeah, yeah, good job, Padita. And then that was over.
[85:14] B: Yeah.
[85:14] A: Right. And later on you did something more fun. Yeah, right, like go to the beach.
[85:18] B: Like go to the beach, Go to the spring, Go to the movies.
[85:21] A: Right. So we got the anthem movies. And then like he was in jail and then you had. Then he'd gone back to jail, then you had bonded him out and then he took the plea.
[85:33] B: Yes.
[85:33] A: Right. And then he had been arrested and you had told the whole like story of what really happened. And they're like, okay, no, we get all that. Right. And he had been picked up.
[85:42] B: Yeah.
[85:43] A: Right. And then you guys had left. Yeah, Right. And then he came back with the bloody baseball bat. And then he had been up there and then he like, no, you go wait in the car with Felice, and you're like, dude, don't do any of this. This is stupid. Don't do this. Like, pick your battles. I'm glad that you're here. This is better than being in there.
[85:58] B: Yeah.
[85:59] A: And then you. He said, I'm on my way. And then you had called him and showed him what had happened. And then you're like, fuck, man. Why aren't you. I don't know. I'm just at Burger King. And then you had called him, and then you left the room. Then you got your dress on, and then you had taken the money. And then he had stopped. And then you had stopped fighting. Right. And then you were fighting him. And then he had put it in your butt. And then he was doing it in the vagina. And then you had gone over there to do that. And then TJ dropped you off. And then before that, you had been texting. And then before that, you were doing whatever you were doing.
[86:30] B: Yeah.
[86:30] A: Right. And again, as we go backwards, comparative, forward, emotionally, how was it?
[86:34] B: Okay.
[86:35] A: You can remember him doing that?
[86:37] B: Yeah.
[86:37] A: You remember TJ doing what we did? Right. You can remember putting your shirt on?
[86:40] B: Yeah.
[86:41] A: Or you stop putting on your shirt.
[86:42] B: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[86:43] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt.
[86:44] B: You're not putting on your shirt.
[86:44] A: Well, stop me from kissing my daughter.
[86:46] B: You're not kissing your daughter.
[86:46] A: Well, then stop the guy from doing that.
[86:48] B: He's not doing that.
[86:48] A: Well, then stop me from eating sushi.
[86:51] B: You're not eating sushi.
[86:51] A: Well, stop him from putting his penis in your body.
[86:53] B: He's not putting his penis.
[86:54] A: Well, then stop that from happening. It's not happening. It's not happening. We'll stop TJ from doing that. See? He's not doing.
[86:59] B: He's not doing it.
[86:59] A: Yeah. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[87:01] B: It no longer exists.
[87:02] A: Bingo. Which is what we want to get in, Right? That's right. By the way, Teacher Day, doing all of that stuff, did that have anything to do with you?
[87:14] B: Oh, I want to say yes.
[87:16] A: I know you do, don't you? Yeah. But I want you to check it out. Think of the kid who comes home with two D's and two F's. Okay, mom is pissed. This is unacceptable. You wait until your father comes home. Now dad comes home. I had a couple at the bar in between. You know, working hard.
[87:35] B: Yeah.
[87:36] A: He was thinking, like, he's gonna get lucky tonight. Cause it's, you know, hump day. And Mom's like, look, dad is just fucking pissed. Takes the bellow off and just starts wailing on the kid over and over and over again. We're not talking with the leather part. We're talking buckle. Right?
[87:54] B: Yeah.
[87:55] A: Now the kid is feeling. I'm getting beat because I got the four grades. And is he.
[88:04] B: No, no.
[88:05] A: Is he?
[88:06] B: He's not.
[88:07] A: No. Because as a parent, isn't there more than one way, maybe a hundred other ways that might have been different than that one?
[88:15] B: Yeah.
[88:16] A: To deal with the situation? So did it have to do with the kid in the grades? Did it have to do with whatever the hell was going on with dad?
[88:23] B: With dad?
[88:24] A: Yeah. That you back then thought TJ Doing that had everything to do with you. Didn't have anything to do with you. Right. Because you actually were the one saying, no, I'm good. You're here. Let's go.
[88:39] B: Yeah, exactly.
[88:42] A: That's right. That's what you wanted. Let's just go. You're like, pick the battle. Like, I'm okay. I survived. I'm good.
[88:50] B: Yeah.
[88:50] A: Hurts a little, but.
[88:52] B: Exactly.
[88:54] A: I had a pain in my ass. That guy was a pain in my ass. Right. Literally. Exactly. You're the one that told him not to.
[89:04] B: Yeah.
[89:05] A: So it had nothing to do with you had everything to do with him and somebody fucking with his property. Right. Cause he would have treated him the same way if the guy came and smashed his car window.
[89:17] B: Yeah.
[89:19] A: Right. Right. So now close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You. And let her know what you know now. A, that it's over, finished. That it no longer exists. B, that him doing that had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with the guy. And let that you know that TJ Doing that had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was going on with him. Him. Based on what had happened to his property. So that she gets. It's not about me. That's right. That's right. And as that you is getting that, what do you notice happening to her face? Right. Right. What's happening now?
[90:12] B: It's not bothering me.
[90:14] A: Yeah. Isn't that a good news now? Yeah, it is. Right? Right.
[90:22] B: I like that feeling.
[90:24] A: I know. Isn't that a good feeling?
[90:26] B: Yes.
[90:26] A: So take your hand again. Hold it out like that. Look at that spot right there. Again, I'm gonna take my hand. It's gonna come close before it touches your. Notice that you feel it. Yeah. And as you feel it, I want you to repeat these words after me. I have a nose.
[90:40] B: I have a nose.
[90:41] A: I have ten fingers.
[90:42] B: I have ten fingers.
[90:43] A: I need two elbows.
[90:44] B: I have two elbows.
[90:45] A: I have ten toes.
[90:47] B: I have ten toes.
[90:48] A: I'm not my toes.
[90:49] B: I'm not my toes.
[90:50] A: I'm not my fingers.
[90:51] B: I'm not my fingers.
[90:52] A: I'm not my elbows.
[90:53] B: I'm not my elbows.
[90:54] A: I'm not my nose.
[90:55] B: I'm not my nose.
[90:56] A: I have an ass.
[90:57] B: I have an ass.
[90:58] A: I'm not my ass.
[90:59] B: I'm not my ass.
[91:00] A: My ass is mine.
[91:01] B: My ass is mine.
[91:02] A: But it isn't me.
[91:03] B: But it isn't me.
[91:04] A: So he messed with my stuff.
[91:05] B: So he messed with my stuff.
[91:06] A: And it screwed up my feelings. It screwed up my feelings. And it hurt my body.
[91:10] B: And it hurt my body.
[91:11] A: But he never touched who I really am.
[91:13] B: But he never touched who I really am.
[91:15] A: He never touched me.
[91:16] B: He never touched me.
[91:18] A: He messed with my body.
[91:19] B: He messed with my body.
[91:20] A: But he never got me.
[91:21] B: But he never got me.
[91:23] A: That's right. That's right. Close your eyes. Think back to the you and let her know what you know now. He messed with your stuff. That's right. But he never touched you. That's right.
[91:41] B: I don't know.
[91:42] A: There's no sound now that's the same as that. That's right. But she gets it. That she's okay. Healing and your energy. Big breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. Deeper down. There we go. That's right. All the way. And then a big breath in. And an exhale. And you can know that when you see. Stop. You got him to stop. You made that happen. You got to get in quicker. That's right. That's right. And as that earlier, you is getting it. What you notice now?
[92:56] B: Come on.
[92:57] A: Come on. Aren't you right? Yeah. And see, back then, she thought he was doing it to protect her, but he was doing it because somebody fucked with his property. That's right. You just didn't know back then that it was considered property, right? Because I'm sure, like, you got all the money.
[93:37] B: No.
[93:38] A: Oh, you didn't?
[93:38] B: No.
[93:39] A: Right.
[93:41] B: It's so true, though, right?
[93:45] A: Oh, he just took his little commission, like the little 5%. No, no, it wasn't that either. Oh, he maybe gave you a small little bit of it? No, not even that. Oh, good. Right? He just told you where the money was so that you could bail them out. Yeah, Right.
[94:05] B: Huh. Interesting.
[94:09] A: Wow. Right? Cause it didn't actually go to you. You were doing all the work, though.
[94:15] B: Yeah, but I was fine with it.
[94:19] A: You were doing the texting. You were doing the Interaction. You were doing all the work, you just weren't getting compensated. Yeah, we call that slavery.
[94:27] B: Okay.
[94:28] A: I mean, maybe a room and burn.
[94:29] B: Yeah. Okay.
[94:30] A: Yeah, Right. Just like the slaves did. I mean, they had a place to live.
[94:34] B: I mean, I got anything I wanted if I asked for it.
[94:37] A: Not anything.
[94:38] B: No, not anything. Most things.
[94:41] A: Uh huh, Right, right. Because if you've got like, you know, a prized workhorse that's making you a shitload of money.
[94:48] B: Yeah, you're so right. Why was I okay with it? I felt like I was okay with it. Like that didn't bother me.
[94:59] A: You thought it was your choice.
[95:00] B: I thought it was my choice. And I thought I became addicted to that lifestyle. Sort of sense. I liked not only like the feeling. I liked the feeling I got from him and bringing him money and he was so happy and I thought he loved me. But then I liked the feeling that I got from the men as well.
[95:19] A: Right. That you were desired. Yeah, yeah, right.
[95:24] B: That they would pay a lot of money just to be with me.
[95:28] A: Yeah, yeah, right. Well, they would pay a lot of money.
[95:32] B: Yeah.
[95:32] A: To be with somebody who's going to do those things.
[95:36] B: Yes.
[95:37] A: You just thought it was you specifically.
[95:40] B: Yeah.
[95:41] A: And you may have had a regular or more. Right. But they were paying because you were doing those things.
[95:49] B: Okay.
[95:50] A: I mean, a guy will have sex with a hole in a tree.
[95:53] B: Okay.
[95:54] A: I mean, the cushions, if it fits. Okay, let's try.
[96:01] B: Okay.
[96:02] A: Yeah, Right. If a guy's got discretionary income, then somebody's gonna come over and do those things. Yeah. Okay.
[96:09] B: Yeah.
[96:12] A: I might even give them the gfe.
[96:14] B: Yeah, right. Exactly.
[96:17] A: Right. Yeah, Right. And then it feels like we got something.
[96:21] B: Exactly.
[96:22] A: Right, Right. But how often are they, you know, you know, concerned with your orgasms?
[96:28] B: Not often at all. Somewhere.
[96:30] A: Somewhere.
[96:31] B: But that sounds good.
[96:32] A: That is how they would get. But. Right. So I want you to get that.
[96:35] B: Okay.
[96:37] A: They weren't concerned about your orgasms, but as you just said it, that's how they would get off.
[96:46] B: Exactly.
[96:48] A: So it's always about theirs.
[96:49] B: Always.
[96:50] A: Right. They might do different things. You know, some people might like oral. Some people might like, you know, on top, some people might like on bottom. Some people might like dress up. Some people might like cuffs. Some people might like all sorts of different things. Right. There's tons of different stuff that's out there.
[97:05] B: There's a lot.
[97:06] A: I mean, we can go to the gym, you know, some people like clamps, some people like all sorts of different things. There's all sorts of people that are into different things. Right. But notice how it wasn't about yours.
[97:20] B: Yeah.
[97:21] A: It was about theirs.
[97:22] B: Yes.
[97:23] A: Right. How often does the guy, you know, go and do oral on you?
[97:28] B: Not often.
[97:29] A: Right.
[97:30] B: Because that's what they wanted, which is.
[97:33] A: How they got off.
[97:34] B: How they got off. Okay, I see where you're going with this now. I get it. Okay.
[97:40] A: It was always about how they're gonna get off.
[97:42] B: Yeah.
[97:42] A: And people have different preferences.
[97:45] B: Yeah.
[97:46] A: Right. I mean, there are some people that just like getting spanked, and that's how they get off. There's some people like the prostate massage, and that's how they get off. There are people that are into all sorts of different things.
[97:58] B: Yes.
[97:58] A: Right. But it was always about how they're.
[98:01] B: Okay.
[98:02] A: Not you.
[98:02] B: Not me.
[98:03] A: No. If it did happen along the way. Okay, whatever. That's great. But it was always about that.
[98:10] B: Yeah.
[98:11] A: Right. Because they were paying for a service. Right, right.
[98:15] B: Okay.
[98:18] A: As you're getting that, what are you noticing?
[98:21] B: Noticing? It doesn't bother me that much. It did.
[98:26] A: Yeah.
[98:27] B: But right now it's.
[98:28] A: It's not.
[98:29] B: No.
[98:30] A: Because you're beginning to see it clearly for what it was. Exactly. Right. What made it tolerable and okay to do is that some of it felt good.
[98:39] B: Yes.
[98:40] A: Right. Some. Some of it felt good in that somebody was desiring.
[98:45] B: Yes.
[98:46] A: Right. So the mechanism. Right. Men get off and turned on by women. That's how it works. Women don't get turned on or off by men. Meaning it's not primarily what the guy looks like. She might like the guy. Like. Cause there were different ones that were more appealing based on you and your own preferences. There were different ones that it might have been easier to do stuff with then others was like, just let me put this button thing over.
[99:25] B: Exactly. Yeah.
[99:29] A: Right.
[99:29] B: Yes.
[99:30] A: But. So if men get turned on by women and women don't get turned on by men, what turns a woman on? Being a tease? Being a flirt? Being what? High school boys would complain about that. So there was some of it that in the interchange, that part was fun and playful. Right. And I was getting compensated. Yeah, right, Right. But whether it was you or somebody else that was doing that.
[100:07] B: Okay.
[100:08] A: Right. You had just been thinking that they were doing that for you.
[100:11] B: They weren't.
[100:13] A: They were doing it because you were doing the things that you were doing for them.
[100:17] B: Okay.
[100:20] A: Right. Like the person who goes to the hairdresser goes to that hairdresser because they like how they get their hair done.
[100:34] B: I get it.
[100:35] A: They're going. Because they're getting their hair cut. Right.
[100:39] B: I get it.
[100:40] A: And they like how that person cuts their hair. But if somebody else cut their hair just like that person does, they'll go to that other person too.
[100:49] B: Exactly.
[100:51] A: Because what are they wanting? A haircut.
[100:56] B: Interesting.
[100:57] A: And there might have been regulars because they got comfortable and you got comfortable because is it easier once you've already known somebody?
[101:04] B: Yes.
[101:05] A: Yes. In the world of any business, repeat customers are the easiest to keep.
[101:10] B: Yes.
[101:11] A: Because they've already bought from you.
[101:14] B: Yeah.
[101:16] A: That's how it works. Versus getting new ones.
[101:18] B: Yeah. Okay. It's true.
[101:21] A: Because new ones have a whole like, who the fuck is this? And I don't know.
[101:24] B: Yeah, exactly. Yeah.
[101:26] A: Oh, oh, that's my regular. Okay.
[101:27] B: Yeah, exactly. I never thought of it that way.
[101:33] A: Right, right. So the. Why did I like it? Well, I'm not sure that's the most useful question.
[101:45] B: What's the most useful question?
[101:47] A: Well, it isn't about why you liked it. I mean, there were probably other aspects of it. It felt like I was being desired and wanted. It felt like I had say and control. Like I negotiated what I was willing to do to certain points.
[102:05] B: Yeah, right.
[102:06] A: And again, depending on the person is easier to do certain things with just because it naturally kind of fit better.
[102:14] B: Yes.
[102:15] A: The thing that's been going on really goes back to the valuing. You see, where we're headed truly is I'm interested in you getting your own worth to you. Because in the world of relationships, it's always the woman who's the regulator, not the guy. What? This is gonna sound really weird to you.
[102:51] B: Yeah.
[102:52] A: But it's always the woman who's the regulator, not the guy. So. So the reason is guys are always yeses, never nos. If guy is into gal and gal goes, do you want him? Yeah, I'm in. If gal wakes guy up at 3:30 in the morning goes, I'm really horny. I'd like to. Okay, I'm in. Here, sweetie, let me give you a. Okay, sure. Yeah, right. Like, I remember one girl I dated and she goes, you know, you were teaching me this thing about guys and gals and don't have sex on the first date. And you're going to be really proud of me. I did. Awesome. Great job. She goes, but I did give him a blowjob. I'm like, no, no.
[103:38] B: No, no, no, no.
[103:39] A: So if guys are always yeses. Women are not always yeses. Women are yeses when they want to and no's. So women are not always yeses.
[103:52] B: No, they're not.
[103:52] A: You can't wake a woman up at 3:30 in the morning. Come on, baby.
[103:56] B: Get away.
[103:57] A: Put that thing away. Like I'm tired. I know. So in addition, women have the goods.
[104:05] B: Okay.
[104:06] A: Women have what the man is interested in.
[104:08] B: Yes.
[104:09] A: Right. The guy is interested in the revealing photo.
[104:12] B: Yes.
[104:13] A: Nobody wants a snapshot of his job. Oh, God, I don't want to even see that dirt. Right. So the difference is women are the object of desire. A woman has the goods. She's got the stuff that the guy is interested in. So it's always on her terms. She gets to decide how much, how frequent, how often. She gets to determine where and when. That hint. He's always going to. You want to do it now? Sure. Now? Yeah, Now. Now? Yeah. Again.
[104:47] B: Twist his arm.
[104:48] A: That guy is ready to go all the time. And guys don't take that long. Lots of them done. They're like drag race.
[104:57] B: Yeah.
[104:59] A: Very short race. Go real fast, over.
[105:03] B: Yeah.
[105:03] A: Right. Women are not that way. Women are nasty. They don't even start from a stop in nascar. They start the engines and they start running around the track, and then they get up to speed, and then they start the race, and then 500 laps later, they're freaking, finally done. Right. And for a woman, an orgasm happens along the way.
[105:22] B: Yes.
[105:23] A: It's not the ending.
[105:24] B: No.
[105:25] A: Right. And she can have more than one. For a guy, it's the ending.
[105:29] B: Yeah.
[105:29] A: And for all guys, when the ending happens, he will lose his erection for a period of time before it comes back. Because for the guy, it's the ending. It's the crescendo. It's da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Right. It's the. So women are the regulators. They've got the goods. They hold the keys and where we want you to be and where we're headed for this, you that I'm seeing is a gal who totally owns it, that she's got it. And he's lucky if I'm gonna allow him to spend even a moment of my time. Right. Which isn't how it's been.
[106:10] B: Yeah.
[106:11] A: But that's what we're headed.
[106:12] B: Okay, good. Yes.
[106:14] A: So that you get that about you.
[106:15] B: Okay.
[106:16] A: And you get to be more good with you and at peace with you. And see, you had been wanting. That was the part that. There was an allure to it. There was an allure feeling like with tj, like you were pleasing and he was happy. He was happy that he was getting money. Right? Right. Yeah. He wasn't as happy if he didn't get as much money. Oh, that guy told me he was gonna pay three. And he only had 150.
[106:45] B: Yeah.
[106:46] A: What? Wasn't really as happy.
[106:50] B: No, he wasn't. No, not at all.
[106:52] A: Right, right. But if, you know his, his workhorse is doing stuff and she goes, hey, could you get me this thing? Sure. Right, right. So where the discomfort is or where the discomfort comfort has been is in that whole thing of like there's been stuff that's gone along the way that's made me feel like maybe I'm not worth it. And therefore if I get it from out there, it made me feel like it was.
[107:29] B: Yes.
[107:30] A: So where that discomfort goes, we want to travel that back.
[107:34] B: Okay.
[107:35] A: To an earlier time where you have that kind of feeling.
[107:45] B: That kind of a feeling.
[107:46] A: Yeah.
[107:47] B: Like, oh God, yeah, it's gonna travel back.
[107:49] A: It might grow you younger and earlier.
[107:52] B: Younger and earlier.
[107:53] A: Earlier and younger. Yeah.
[108:00] B: I'm trying to think.
[108:03] A: So let's check it out. Okay, Right. So where we're headed is you becoming more good with you at peace and getting your own worth. Worth it to you. Okay, got it. As we're organizing towards that, there have been times where you haven't felt lovable. Worth it. Good. So I'll give you an example. The two year old's parents get divorced. Now at two, he doesn't quite get why they got divorced, but he does know that daddy used to live at home and now daddy doesn't live at home. And because when we're little, everything is about me, the two year old starts to think at some level, maybe it has something to do with me. Maybe I shouldn't have left out my toys because one time I did and daddy stepped on them and he was really mad and threw it and broke it. So maybe it had to do with me. Maybe I'm not good enough. Maybe I'm not like enough. Maybe daddy doesn't love me. Maybe it has to do with my lovability. So then at 7, dad was supposed to take him to Disney and dad doesn't show. Now the kid doesn't quite get that dad drinks. He knows there's Budweiser cans and things like that, but you know, at seven he doesn't quite get it. So at seven he's not thinking, oh, I bet my dad who's a drunken alcoholic is probably hungover at this point because he was out getting shit faced. It's his loss that he doesn't go with me. No, that's not what's happening. It gets internalized and personalized. See if my dad truly cared, if I was worth it to him, then he would be here. It has to do with me, my loveability. And that goes on. Then when the kids. Kid doesn't do well academically in this class, he doesn't go, oh, you know what? It's only in high school that we're told that we have to be good at all subjects. When you go out in the real world, you don't have to be good at everything. You just need to find your thing that you're good at and do that. No, the kid who's doing bad at math. But see, I'm fucking dumb. Even if he's good at this other class that he likes better because he likes his teacher in that class, he didn't like the teacher in the machine. Material didn't make sense to him because it was boring and wasn't his thing. But he goes, you know what? It must be because I'm not smart. Because I was told that in order to be smart, I have to be good at all subjects. Except that's not true. But he keeps going, well, that has something to do with me. So now he's got the, I'm not good enough. I'm unlovable, and I'm not smart. You know? And then he dates a girl at 19 who breaks his heart because she goes and screws his best friend. Now he is thinking, fucking bitch. But he's going, see, if I was more lovable, if I was truly worth it, she wouldn't do it. Then at 27, when, you know, he's married and she cheats on him, it just reinforces the message about how unlovable I truly really am. Because it all kept going back to being about me. Right. So we all have had those kinds of issues, experiences that go on in life that start framing my outlook. And with that framed, that becomes the generalization that just becomes the truth about me. And any moments that are opposite or don't fit it get deleted and distorted out.
[111:24] B: Okay?
[111:25] A: Right.
[111:25] B: Yes.
[111:25] A: So what we want to be getting into is there may have been moments where you didn't feel like you were worth it to the people that you were supposed to matter most to.
[111:36] B: Okay. Interesting along the way, right?
[111:44] A: Yeah. And as that goes, what is it that's beginning to kind of pop and surface everything now?
[111:50] B: Way back when? From way back when.
[111:53] A: Particular experience.
[111:54] B: We can start with my mom and my dad's divorce.
[111:57] A: Oh, good. You might have been how old?
[111:58] B: Five.
[111:59] A: Yeah. And you're where? How'd you find out?
[112:01] B: We moved back for. I was born in Italy.
[112:04] A: So you're in Italy.
[112:04] B: Right there till I was five. And we moved back to the States, to Florida.
[112:09] A: You and mom moved, or you moved?
[112:10] B: Mom and mom and my dad.
[112:11] A: Okay, so you moved back to Florida.
[112:12] B: Because they were getting divorced. I apparently. Well, I didn't. Apparently. I told my dad when we were in Italy that my mom. I saw mom kissing rj. One of his buddies. Army buddies.
[112:26] A: Yes. Good job. Good detail.
[112:28] B: And then they got divorced.
[112:30] A: Yes.
[112:30] B: Three months later.
[112:31] A: That's right. Good job.
[112:33] B: Yeah. And then my dad left and went to Arizona. Left me with my mom. Yeah.
[112:37] A: And then you were with your mom.
[112:38] B: Yeah.
[112:38] A: Right. And then that moment ended.
[112:40] B: Yes.
[112:40] A: Right. And then later on, you did something more fun.
[112:42] B: Yeah.
[112:43] A: Go to the movies.
[112:44] B: Yeah.
[112:44] A: Or be at the beach.
[112:46] B: Yeah. Or a lot of fun or stuff. Go to Disney at that time.
[112:49] A: So we have being at the Springs, and we've got beach and see, then dad went to Arizona, and then you. They had gotten divorced, and then you guys had moved back to Florida, and then you were in Italy, and then you had told dad that you saw mom kissing. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[113:06] B: Yeah.
[113:06] A: Right. To see, back then that you thought that. You can remember that happened.
[113:10] B: Yeah.
[113:11] A: You can remember putting your pants on.
[113:12] B: Yes.
[113:12] A: You remember telling that.
[113:13] B: Yes.
[113:14] A: Right. Stop telling him that.
[113:16] B: Not telling him.
[113:16] A: Well, stop putting on your pants.
[113:17] B: I'm not putting on my pants.
[113:18] A: Well, stop that from happening.
[113:19] B: I can't stop. It's not happening.
[113:21] A: So then where is it? Satan. No longer himself, by the way, dad divorcing Mom. Did that have anything to do with you?
[113:27] B: Yeah.
[113:28] A: Oh, it did.
[113:29] B: Because I told my dad.
[113:30] A: Right. There wasn't any other reasons.
[113:32] B: Cause I told my dad that my mom kissed someone else.
[113:35] A: That's right, you did. Mm.
[113:37] B: But she.
[113:38] A: So who did it have to do with?
[113:40] B: Them. Not me.
[113:42] A: It didn't have anything to do with you. No. Had everything to do with mom and dad. But, see, back then, you felt like it had something to do with you. Like, if I hadn't told dad, then that wouldn't have happened. Right. But if we look at it clearly, that was just a symptom of something that was more problematic.
[114:01] B: Yes.
[114:02] A: Between mom and dad.
[114:03] B: Yeah.
[114:06] A: But you back then, felt like it was too totally about me. Right. Like it was totally my fault.
[114:11] B: Oh, yeah.
[114:13] A: Was it your fault?
[114:14] B: No.
[114:16] A: Right. Right. That's right. Now close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You let her know that it's over. Let her know that it had nothing to do with you. It wasn't your fault. Had to do with what was Going on between mom and dad. That's right. That she didn't know that back then. Right. So that she begins to get it. And if she gets it, Tori, what do you notice happening to that earlier? You.
[114:48] B: She's happy.
[114:49] A: Yeah, Right. You can open your eyes. Cause it wasn't like at 5, you go, I'm gonna get that fucking bitch. Dad, guess what mom did.
[115:00] B: I know, right? But like, I was thinking like that.
[115:04] A: My whole life, but that wasn't what was going on. Not only that, if you had known. Hey, by the way, I'm gonna tell dad this. And then later on they're gonna get divorced. Fuck. I'll keep that a secret forever.
[115:13] B: Exactly, exactly.
[115:16] A: Because that happened. He had nothing to do with you. That was just a sympathetic. And it had to do with mom. Right. And if mom was gonna be doing that with some other guy, she needed to do that. Not around you.
[115:31] B: Exactly.
[115:34] A: Right, Right.
[115:39] B: Yeah.
[115:40] A: Right. Yeah. Now we begin to lighten that up.
[115:46] B: Yeah.
[115:46] A: What's another moment that comes to mind?
[115:53] B: I got raped and my virginity taken when I was 15.
[115:56] A: Well, I don't know whether that was taken.
[115:59] B: I wasn't taken.
[116:01] A: Oh, we'll get to that in a second. So what's the thing that happened?
[116:05] B: I went out. So you're 50 on Friday night. You're where I am, on Treasure Island.
[116:10] A: So you're on Treasure Island. Good. Daytime, Nighttime. Nighttime, Nighttime. So you had gone out with like, other friends?
[116:14] B: Yeah, Jacqueline and her boyfriend Brian.
[116:18] A: Soon you were out with Jacqueline and her boyfriend. Good. No matter.
[116:21] B: Then I was drinking.
[116:22] A: Right. Good job.
[116:23] B: I thought I was taking ecstasy and I wasn't.
[116:25] A: Yes. Good job. Goody job.
[116:26] B: And it was Valiums.
[116:28] A: Yeah.
[116:28] B: That knocked me like out.
[116:31] A: Right. Good job. Good evening.
[116:32] B: He dropped Jacqueline back off.
[116:33] A: The guy?
[116:34] B: Yeah, her boyfriend dropped her off.
[116:36] A: And then he had you and he.
[116:37] B: Took me to Treasure Island.
[116:39] A: Took you back to Treasure Island.
[116:40] B: Yeah. Hotel.
[116:41] A: Yes. Good job.
[116:41] B: I woke up.
[116:42] A: Yes.
[116:43] B: Okay, wait, I do remember bits and pieces.
[116:46] A: Yes.
[116:46] B: I remember saying no, but I didn't fight it.
[116:49] A: Right, well, you said no. Like he brought you back there and then you were in the hotel room.
[116:52] B: Yeah, I woke up. Like I was in and out of consciousness. I woke up and he was trying. Like I was dry, I guess. Cause I didn't know.
[116:59] A: Good job. He did. And of course he didn't know anything. Like, you know, hey, you need to warm that area up a little bit. Maybe a little oral, maybe a little lube and none of that stuff. So he was just like. Right, good. And then you're like, oh, wait a minute.
[117:10] B: I want that.
[117:11] A: Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[117:13] B: I woke. When I finally woke up. Cause I fell asleep. When I finally woke up, he was gone. I saw condoms on the floor. I went and called my mom. It was my little brother's birthday.
[117:23] A: Good job.
[117:24] B: She was mad at me because I wasn't home. I didn't come home that night, was I? How could I?
[117:28] A: So she was just mad.
[117:29] B: Yes. So I told her, I'm on a beach. I told her what happened, what hotel room. She came and picked me up.
[117:34] A: Yes. Good job.
[117:35] B: We got back to the house and Brandt's dad left a message on the phone for my mom to call them.
[117:42] A: Yes.
[117:43] B: And he went home and told his dad everything. He had sex with me. And I was unconscious.
[117:47] A: Yes. Good job. The detail.
[117:49] B: And that happened on a Friday?
[117:51] A: Yes.
[117:51] B: The next Tuesday. Following that Friday, my mom put me on a plane to Arizona to go live with my dad.
[117:56] A: And then mom, three years ago.
[117:58] B: So I felt. What happened next? I went to Arizona, lived with my dad.
[118:02] A: And then that part was over.
[118:03] B: Yes.
[118:03] A: Right. And then later you went to different.
[118:05] B: Yeah, Right.
[118:08] A: And then later on, you did something more fun.
[118:10] B: Yeah.
[118:10] A: Right. Like go to the Springs or movies.
[118:13] B: Yeah.
[118:13] A: Or be at the beach. Yeah, Right. We got being at the beach in the Springs and movies.
[118:17] B: Yes.
[118:17] A: And then we got being at dad's in Arizona.
[118:19] B: Yes.
[118:19] A: Right. And then we got mom flying you there.
[118:21] B: Yes.
[118:22] A: Right. And then the dad talking to your mom about all of that stuff. And then he had told his dad. And then you had been picked up. And then you had told mom. And she was pissed like, what the fuck? Where are you? Haven't you come home? Right. And then you'd woken up, and then you're like, no, not really. And then you got brought into the hotel room. Right. And then you'd been dropped off the friend. And then you guys had been out drinking and having some stuff. And then you'd gone out there with her and her boyfriend. And before that, they may have picked you up.
[118:53] B: Yeah.
[118:54] A: Right. And then before that, you might have been at school.
[118:56] B: Yeah.
[118:57] A: All right. And again, as we go backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it you can remember that habit. You can remember putting your sweater on?
[119:04] B: Yes.
[119:04] A: Before you stop putting in your sweater.
[119:05] B: I'm not putting on my sweater.
[119:07] A: Well, then stop him from doing that.
[119:09] B: He's not doing that.
[119:10] A: Well, then you stop taking the Valium.
[119:11] B: I'm not taking the volume.
[119:13] A: Well, then stop me from putting gel in my hair.
[119:15] B: You're not putting gel in your Hair.
[119:16] A: Well then stop him from doing that.
[119:18] B: He's not doing that.
[119:19] A: Well then stop mom from doing that.
[119:20] B: She's not doing that, mister.
[119:21] A: Then where is it saved? It doesn't exist. And again, mom being that way, did that have anything to do with you now? Now you're actually getting it.
[119:31] B: Yeah, right.
[119:32] A: Isn't that weird because you thought it did have everything to do with you.
[119:35] B: Yeah, right.
[119:36] A: Didn't have anything to do with you at all. No, had everything to do with mom. Right. And even what was going on with mom. Yeah, right, right. I hear people all the time, they like, you know, I told my mom that grandpa molested me and mom told me to pretend like that never happened. I had another person say, yeah, well, you know, Uncle Tony did stuff to me. Mom's response was, don't you say that about my brother. Now the first one, that grandpa also molested mom and the way that mom dealt with it because it was a small town, he was a powerful man in a small town, is to pretend like it never happened. She was trying to give her kid the only coping mechanism that ever worked for her. Isn't that interesting? The second one with the brother. The mom couldn't be with it because of what it would mean about her as a mom that her own brother would do that to her kid. She couldn't be with him. Right. Like mom couldn't be with him. Right.
[120:47] B: Yeah.
[120:47] A: Like, what kind of a mom lets her daughter go out at 15 to the beach, drink and have that happen? I can't even be with it.
[120:57] B: Yeah, right.
[120:58] A: Out of her own gunk about it and her own guilt.
[121:03] B: Okay.
[121:03] A: Right. What? She's got a lot of. Yeah, which is why she's not wanting to talk yet.
[121:07] B: Yeah.
[121:08] A: Because she feels really shitty about how she was as a mom that had you be in the predicaments that you were in.
[121:16] B: Okay.
[121:17] A: Uh huh.
[121:18] B: Yeah.
[121:19] A: I don't know whether you've realized that yet or not.
[121:21] B: I'm starting to.
[121:22] A: You are, aren't you?
[121:23] B: Yeah.
[121:23] A: Yeah. That, that's what's going on with her. She's got lots of shitty feelings because of the kind of mom I was that allowed my daughter to go down that road. Right, Right. Yeah. What's happening now?
[121:42] B: I'm a little sad, but I'm good. Sad?
[121:45] A: Yeah. Sad how?
[121:47] B: Like, like thinking about it. I'm fine, but I don't want her to feel like it's all her fault.
[122:01] A: Well, yeah, but see, here's the coolest part with you healing. You're changing it for her.
[122:10] B: Okay.
[122:11] A: See, it's generational change that starts to happen. Not just for your generation, the generation before yours and the generation after yours. Right. Because what's the likelihood that mom had, you know, yucky stuff happen to her?
[122:28] B: Yeah.
[122:29] A: I mean, there might have been some unwanted.
[122:32] B: Sure.
[122:33] A: Uh huh. Right. Because that stuff tends to go generally, but as you get healed, it changes it. Right.
[122:41] B: Okay.
[122:42] A: Right. And you're actually getting that she loves you.
[122:45] B: Yes.
[122:45] A: Right. She just had her own fucked up. And why she's been concerned is because she loves you. Right. And she's got a lot of bad feelings. That's why she would say things like if your stepdad knew what I was doing. Because she might hand you off money when you were in the midst of your addiction.
[123:10] B: Yes.
[123:11] A: She might do stuff for you that that contributed to you continuing to use out of her own guilt.
[123:21] B: That makes sense.
[123:27] A: And she's not sure she's strong enough yet.
[123:33] B: You're so right.
[123:38] A: Right. So it's not that she doesn't want you to see the kids or doesn't want to have a relationship with you. She's got them and their well being and she wants to have like assurances that you're better now. Right.
[123:57] B: That makes them feel better. Yeah.
[124:02] A: That'S what she wants to make sure.
[124:04] B: Okay.
[124:05] A: Before she opens them up. That's right.
[124:14] B: Makes sense.
[124:15] A: Yeah. And her sending you there had nothing to do with her lack of love. Okay, well check it out. Because that you actually thought it was.
[124:25] B: Yeah.
[124:26] A: Like mom must not care. Yeah, right. Had all of it do with her own gunk about that. What does that mean, as me as a mom, that that thing happened? Well, she's with her dad. None of that shit will ever happen again. Right. Not the right answer.
[124:47] B: Yeah, right.
[124:50] A: Right. Had nothing to do with her lack of love. Had everything to do with like the up shit that was going on with her. And her own gunk about like my own daughter had that thing happen and the kid's dad talked to me about it. Right, Right. There we go. Now that's starting to get in. Right. And just close your eyes for a moment and let that earlier, you know, back then at 15, that you going to dad had nothing to do with mom's lack of love. Had nothing to do with you. Had everything to do with what was going on with mom. That's right. And that maybe you didn't need certain things that you thought you needed in order for you to turn out okay. In order for you to see an opportunity to transform your life and take it in Order for the homicide detected. To see something in you that you're worth it to change. That's right. And that you stepped into it getting that you're worth it to you. That's right. That's why you're here. Whether you fully got that all the way through yet or not, it's starting to happen. There we go. That's a good breath. And when you're ready, you can open your eyes. Yeah. And what's happening now?
[126:46] B: I feel good. I like this feeling. I really do.
[126:53] A: Yeah. Yeah. Right. So just check in. Think about the stuff that we've talked. Talked about so far. Think about the homicide. Think about the guy at the sleeping. Think about what happened with the guy at 15. Think about the divorce and having told dad. What do you notice?
[127:23] B: There's a bunch in me.
[127:25] A: Right.
[127:30] B: I think. God, I'm just. I'm at peace.
[127:36] A: Yeah.
[127:38] B: Do that.
[127:41] A: We did it.
[127:42] B: We did it.
[127:43] A: Yeah. Good. It takes us.
[127:45] B: Yeah.
[127:46] A: Doing it. Right. Right. Because nothing gets done without our collaboration. Right. Nice. And that's what's happening. You are healing. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And even now, as you think about, like, okay, well, they're not ready. She's not ready yet. To be a safe contact. And some of the other, you know, women in the house, they got their family and kids. I still want them. What are you noticing now happening to the hurt and the anger?
[128:29] B: It's going away.
[128:30] A: It is, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah.
[128:38] B: It's not on me.
[128:39] A: Right. That's right. Right. And we actually want her to be making sure to not cause additional harm for kids. Maybe Mom's got a little wiser.
[128:57] B: Maybe that's good.
[129:01] A: For them.
[129:02] B: For them.
[129:03] A: That's right.
[129:04] B: Aw.
[129:05] A: Yeah. That's right.
[129:08] B: You're right.
[129:12] A: Right. Even if it's not ideally what you want yet.
[129:15] B: Exactly. That's okay.
[129:16] A: Yeah. Because you're becoming more okay. Notice how you're not feeling bad about that stuff. Right. By the way, the guy didn't take anything from you. He did stuff to your body. Right? Yeah, you're right. Yeah, that's right. Because it happened when you decided to have it happen, even if the hymen wasn't there anymore.
[129:42] B: You're right.
[129:43] A: Right. There wasn't anything for him to take away. It's not like there's this thing in there called virginity. And I got it now.
[129:51] B: I get it. What?
[129:55] A: Right.
[129:55] B: I get it.
[129:56] A: Yeah. That wasn't ideally how I wanted the first time to go down, but, you know, that wasn't my choice. That's right. That's why I said women hold the keys. Because it's on her terms. When it's not on her terms. It's called rape.
[130:15] B: Yeah. Huh. Crazy concept.
[130:20] A: Right? That's why even with the guy in the sleep in, we agreed on these terms. You added a completely different term. Completely agreed. Wasn't agreed to.
[130:29] B: No, definitely not.
[130:32] A: And if it was going to be, it was gonna be a shitload more money. Dan.
[130:35] B: Yes, exactly. See, I feel better.
[130:46] A: You do? Don't you?
[130:47] B: I do.
[130:48] A: Yeah.
[130:48] B: Can you tell? I do.
[130:53] A: I mean, you can even think of, you know, one of the advocates going, so how did that make you feel?
[131:01] B: Made me feel just fine.
[131:05] A: How did the session with Dr. Ki made you feel?
[131:13] B: I wish I could record when one of them says it.
[131:16] A: Just kidding, right?
[131:17] B: Yeah.
[131:17] A: Yeah. But notice the intention behind that. So I want you to hear the how did that make you feel? Isn't actually asking you how it made you feel.
[131:30] B: Okay.
[131:32] A: It's really checking. Is there anything else that you got going on that I might help you with? That's what they're really asking.
[131:47] B: I know.
[131:48] A: Well, now you do.
[131:49] B: Now I do.
[131:50] A: Check it out.
[131:51] B: I did it before. I thought it was going to bug me.
[131:54] A: Right. They're just checking. Hey, is there anything that I could help you with? Cause we also want you to feel good.
[132:02] B: Yes.
[132:04] A: Right. Right.
[132:08] B: I have to use the restroom.
[132:09] A: Do it.
[132:10] B: Okay.
[132:10] A: Use the restroom.
[132:11] B: Where's.
[132:12] A: I'll show you to. You can use the back restroom.
[132:15] B: I can? Yay.
[132:16] A: This way. Much closer. All right. So it's always relief.
[132:36] B: Yes.
[132:36] A: Yes.
[132:40] B: Okay.
[132:41] A: It is. Yeah. So what are you noticing though?
[132:44] B: For you, I just am calm. At least I'm not irritated.
[132:49] A: Yeah.
[132:50] B: I just. I like it. I haven't felt this way in a long time.
[132:55] A: Yeah. Right? Yeah. And you're not feeling the blame. No. Right.
[133:02] B: Which I have felt to blame.
[133:03] A: I know.
[133:04] B: Over everything.
[133:05] A: Yeah. So even. Check it out. Thinking about tj.
[133:09] B: Mm.
[133:10] A: He really loved me. What do you notice now?
[133:18] B: He didn't.
[133:19] A: Huh. Isn't that weird? Mm. Yeah. Right. He didn't do that thing to protect you.
[133:27] B: No.
[133:28] A: He was pissed cause somebody fucked with his property.
[133:31] B: You need to prove a point.
[133:33] A: Don't fuck with my property.
[133:34] B: It had nothing to do with. Cause he loved me.
[133:38] A: Right? Yeah. And he bought you shit.
[133:43] B: Yeah.
[133:44] A: Not because he loved you, but to.
[133:47] B: Make sure I stayed.
[133:48] A: Yeah. Well. And you know, I mean, I might as well compensate her a little.
[133:52] B: Yeah.
[133:52] A: I mean, she's the one making us all the money.
[133:54] B: Yeah.
[133:59] A: I ain't making that much money per hour.
[134:01] B: No, that's crazy.
[134:08] A: Right? I mean, it would be one thing if it was like, you know, somebody who's selling a home, they get a real estate Commission. They get 4% of. On the flip side, are 3 and 3, 6% of the home sale. Great. Or somebody who is the agent for the professional athlete, they do get a cut. Or the person who is the caddy for the golfer, they get a percentage.
[134:39] B: His other girls got percentages of the win, like 60, 40. But I didn't.
[134:47] A: Because.
[134:47] B: What?
[134:48] A: He always got 60.
[134:49] B: He did.
[134:50] A: Yeah. No. See, the caddy doesn't get 60% of the winnings, but the player who actually is making the shot, the guy handing the club, doesn't get paid as much as the person executing the shot. The person dropping the person off doesn't get his money.
[135:09] B: Yeah.
[135:10] A: Doing the work.
[135:12] B: You're right.
[135:18] A: But I want you to check, even as you're getting it, are you feeling bad about you?
[135:22] B: No. Right.
[135:23] A: How cool is that?
[135:24] B: I love it.
[135:26] A: What?
[135:28] B: I'm not. Wow.
[135:32] A: Right?
[135:34] B: Can we do this on every aspect of my life.
[135:36] A: Yeah. We're on our way.
[135:37] B: Yay.
[135:38] A: To be doing it on lots.
[135:40] B: Yeah. Okay.
[135:42] A: Right. So that it lightens up.
[135:44] B: Yeah.
[135:45] A: So that you become more at peace with you. When you get your worth, can you see a future for you? That's why you're here. That's what got you to Selah. Right. And who would have thought that, you know, fuck, man. Was gonna be the turning point?
[136:11] B: Exactly.
[136:13] A: Like, I'm ready to be dead or I get to have a whole completely transformed life. Mm. Because that's what's happened. And that's what. That's what you're doing. That's what you're in the process of creating. That's what you're making happen. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah. And you're becoming more and more okay. With you.
[136:45] B: I like it.
[136:48] A: Yeah. And now you've got a powerful symbol. Yeah. So there are two things for you to know. One, the stuff that we cleared, it's not going to have the same feelings. Because your brain got that. It's data. It can't activate it again. Two, in certain things that normally used to stress you out, you're going to notice that being much less. So it might be in the moment. Normally, I'd be, like, all flustered. I'm not. It might be after the fact. Thinking back, hey, I used to be really fluffed, and I wasn't. So you're going to notice it in those two ways. Right? You're going to notice the intensity, even when you do get stressed, because you will. It'll be less. You'll notice that the frequency of the spikes will be less, you'll notice that the duration will be less. So even if you do get set off, it won't go up as high, it won't happen as often, and it won't last as long. So we're on our way. And then we'll get back together and do more.
[138:09] B: Okay.
[138:10] A: Because we did a whole good chunk of stuff today.
[138:12] B: We did.
[138:13] A: Yeah. Right. Yeah. Because you can think about all those particulars. Right. And you're not feeling bad. Right.
[138:25] B: That is so cool.
[138:27] A: Yeah. Yeah. And that five year old no longer feels responsible for her parenting. Divorcing and then dad not living close. Yeah, right, Right. Because dad moving far away also wasn't about you or his love or lack thereof. Had to do with whatever was going on with him. Now I know that now. Isn't that a good news thing? Because for the longest time you weren't sure you were really worthy.
[139:01] B: Exactly. Yeah.
[139:03] A: You thought it did have something to do with you. Now you're realizing it had nothing to do with you. Isn't that cool?
[139:13] B: Yes. Yeah.
[139:17] A: Yeah. Right. And you get to become much, much stronger. Now, see, the thing where we're headed, so just to kind of give you a prelude of where we're going, is you getting connected to more of who you are and becoming much stronger. Because nobody goes through adversity to get stronger. But when you are fully on the other side of it, you have to be much stronger. Right. All the. All the predators in the world only prey on the weakness. They don't go after strength.
[140:01] B: It's like a light bulb in my head.
[140:03] A: Yeah. So as you become more good with you and more at peace with you, you're no longer even attracted to them because they were only playing on off your vulnerability and being weak in that area. Oh. This is a person who never really felt love. Let me pretend that I do. And then she'll jump through heaven and earth to.
[140:33] B: That's right.
[140:34] A: She's a workhorse.
[140:35] B: Yes. Wow.
[140:41] A: Just so I can feel a little of that love. Right, right. But see, as you start becoming worth it to you, which started when you made the decision to go to Selah. That's right. It's not needed from anything outside of you. Anything outside just adds to what's already whole and complete.
[141:04] B: Yes. I love that.
[141:08] A: Yeah. Yeah, Right.
[141:15] B: Been looking for it. Looking for whatever in somewhere else. This whole time.
[141:19] A: I know when it's been here. The whole time. It's just that crap's been in the way of you fully feeling it.
[141:27] B: Yeah.
[141:27] A: Yeah.
[141:30] B: Yay.
[141:31] A: Yeah.
[141:31] B: I. I know.
[141:32] A: Isn't that cool?
[141:33] B: Yes.
[141:34] A: Yeah.
[141:34] B: I'm excited.
[141:37] A: Awesome.
[141:38] B: I know.
[141:38] A: You did great work today.
[141:39] B: Thank you. You did great work too.
[141:42] A: Right. And notice how we didn't have to get into the feeling stuff.
[141:46] B: I know. Wow.
[141:47] A: Right? Cause it's more about being here.
[141:52] B: Yes.
[141:53] A: And getting in the good news. We have a lot of good news to get in.
[141:56] B: Yes. Yay. I'm excited.
[141:59] A: Thank you. Come with me. We will head on up.
