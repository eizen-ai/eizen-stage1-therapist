[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 15th of July, Tori. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that Christine and Alex are also here. And you know that because you can see them here. The recording that we make may be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes, yes. Okay, cool. So let me give you first, because this is our first meeting.
[00:27] B: Yeah.
[00:28] A: A menu of the kinds of things that I'm actually able to get better.
[00:32] B: Okay.
[00:32] A: Right. So some people, and when they come in to see me, they go, you know what? I find myself a lot more on edge. I'm way more easily irritated, agitated, aggravated. I'm quick, I'm short tempered, I'm reactive. I say I do shit, but later on I'm like, I wish I hadn't ever done that. They don't want to react that way. They'd like to get that better. Okay. Some people come in and they go, you know, for me, I'm more tense, nervous, anxious. I get like uneasy feelings in certain social situations. I kind of worrying about what others might be thinking or am I gonna say the right thing. I don't like feeling that way. Some people, it moves into full fledged panic, anxiety stuff. Some people just got monkey mind. It's like spinning really fast. Like even at night when they go to lay down, it's on like that kind of thing. They have difficulty sleeping, moves into panic. They don't want to feel like that anymore. They'd like to get that better. Yeah, some people come in and they go, you know what? For me, I get that there's been a lot of shit that's happened in my life. And although it's over and I'm out of it, it's still underneath the surface. Affects me. Maybe it's a nightmare. Maybe I think about it when I don't want to think about it. Maybe there's still bad feelings attached. Maybe there are reminders that I'd like that to go away. Some people come in and they go, you know what? For me, it's more about loss. Like I've had people that I really care about that have died loss. Every time I think about them, I feel awful. I don't want to feel like that anymore. Other people go, you know, for me, I feel more like down, depressed. Like I used to have like a zest for life, energy, interest in things, and now it's like I got like no interest, no energy. I feel down Depressed. I don't want to feel that way. And then some people come in, they go, you know what? For me, I got, like, these unwanted, problematic urges and cravings for different substances and things like that. I'd like that to stop, too. So those are the kinds of things that we're able to get better.
[02:20] B: Yes.
[02:22] A: That being said, I'd be really interested in learning more about what's been going on with you. And if we could truly change problematic ways that you've been feeling, thinking, acting, reacting. What is it that you'd like our time to do for you?
[02:38] B: Oh, geez. Well, you hit it right in the middle. It's like everything.
[02:41] A: Oh, good, Jason, you're in the right spot. How cool is that?
[02:44] B: Yeah, I know. Like, I was talking to them today. Like, I've been so irritated today. I'm just irritated with everything and everyone.
[02:52] A: No, how do you know when to do that?
[02:54] B: Huh?
[02:54] A: I know that's a weird question.
[02:55] B: I know.
[02:59] A: It'S only meant to be confusing.
[03:01] B: Okay, good.
[03:02] A: But it's a weird question, right? How do you know when to get irritated?
[03:05] B: Yeah. I don't know.
[03:09] A: You don't know? I mean, did you wake up that way?
[03:11] B: Yeah.
[03:12] A: Like my mom used to say, sometimes I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
[03:14] B: Yeah, I did.
[03:15] A: I'm like, mom, but the wall's on the other side. How am I supposed to wake up on any other side than this side of the bed?
[03:19] B: Yeah. Mm.
[03:21] A: Right?
[03:22] B: Yeah.
[03:22] A: Yeah. Okay, so you're a lot more on edge right now.
[03:24] B: Yeah.
[03:25] A: And, like, little things, kind of.
[03:26] B: Yeah, everything.
[03:27] A: What's everything?
[03:28] B: The food pantry door was my cake topper today. It was open. Someone left it open? Yeah, my cake topper. Like, everything just piles and then that one small, minute little thing.
[03:37] A: Yeah.
[03:38] B: Yeah.
[03:38] A: And then it explodes.
[03:39] B: Yeah. And, like, I got really mad that it was still left open. Like, it's like that whole barn door scenario. You know, people just leave doors open when they're not supposed to be open. I don't know. Just.
[03:51] A: So that was the thing.
[03:52] B: That was the thing.
[03:53] A: Damn fucking door. Yeah, Right?
[03:55] B: Pretty much.
[03:55] A: Or whoever left the damn door.
[03:57] B: Yeah.
[03:57] A: Right. Okay, so that was something that. Like, on that snap. Yeah. But that's the thing that you're recognizing happening more is that you're more edgy and irritable, and then, if I'm following you correctly, it has a tendency to pile all the way up, and then somebody put something on top of it.
[04:12] B: Yeah.
[04:13] A: And you don't even get to eat any of it.
[04:14] B: No, none.
[04:15] A: See, that Whole saying, you know, you can have your cake but you can't eat it too. Why would you want the cake if you can't eat it? Like if somebody literally puts the cake in and goes, no, you can't have any of that. Well, don't put it in front of me.
[04:27] B: I know, it's true.
[04:29] A: Right? All right, so that's something way more easily irritated, agitated. Cool. What else would we want to get better? I mean, you'd like to be a little more easygoing.
[04:42] B: Yeah, well, usually I am easygoing. That's the thing.
[04:44] A: Until it pops up.
[04:45] B: Until it piles up. I don't like to be in bad moods. I'm usually like, go with the flow. In a happy mood, positive all the time. I. I don't know, it's just lately I've just been more irritated with everyone and everything. I'm going through a lot, like a trigger. I'm going through a lot of triggers with my veins. My veins pop out. It's driving me nuts.
[05:10] A: What does that mean?
[05:11] B: That means I want to use.
[05:13] A: Oh. It's like they literally like pop out.
[05:16] B: Yeah, I mean, like, especially when I'm working out or something. Like I can see them like. Oh, yeah.
[05:21] A: Okay. So when you've been seeing veins, it's been thinking, oh, that would be a good idea to like stick something in there. Yeah.
[05:26] B: Uh huh. I know, it's horrible.
[05:29] A: I don't want that horrible. But like, you'd like that to not happen?
[05:33] B: Yeah, I would love for that. Because I have to move my veins for the rest of my life.
[05:36] A: See your veins and be like, look, I'm getting stronger blood flow.
[05:39] B: Exactly, exactly.
[05:40] A: Versus. Oh, wow, that's a fucking thing that I can jam in.
[05:43] B: Yeah, exactly.
[05:44] A: Okay.
[05:44] B: Yeah.
[05:46] A: Something that was problematic.
[05:48] B: Oh yeah, yeah. Since I'm 31. Since I was 17.
[05:52] A: Okay.
[05:53] B: Yeah.
[05:53] A: And what kind of stuff?
[05:55] B: Heroin mask.
[05:56] A: Oh, well, I mean, go with the easy stuff right off the bat. Right?
[05:58] B: I love the easy stuff. Yeah.
[06:00] A: So, well, how long have you been clean and clear now?
[06:04] B: 161 days. Yes.
[06:08] A: Awesome. Good job.
[06:09] B: Thank you.
[06:09] A: Congratulations on that.
[06:10] B: Thank you.
[06:11] A: Yeah. All right, so we want to get that like solidified, like rock solid.
[06:15] B: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[06:17] A: Cool. I can get behind doing that.
[06:19] B: Okay, awesome.
[06:20] A: Yeah. What else are we wanting to do?
[06:25] B: Okay, So I keep at nighttime and during the day lately too, I keep reliving the girl that died, the girl that was murdered. The reason why I'm here, Sheila Capone by my trafficker against her last name. I know, right? Come home. Right. But she was by My trafficker. So she.
[06:48] A: She was killed by your trafficker?
[06:49] B: Yeah.
[06:50] A: Oh, that's fine.
[06:50] B: Dumped in the ocean.
[06:52] A: Oh, boy.
[06:52] B: Yeah. So I. And I was. During all this, I might have. I like to. Not like to say, but I was like, in a fentanyl induced coma, you know, like. Or a met psychosis. So, like, not in my normal mind, I wouldn't have partaked in all that. So I just keep getting, like, visions and memories of all that, and it's just.
[07:14] A: Okay, you'd like that to stop.
[07:16] B: Yeah.
[07:16] A: Because when you have those visions and memories of it, it makes you feel yucky.
[07:20] B: Yeah.
[07:20] A: Okay.
[07:21] B: Yeah.
[07:21] A: So we'd like to lighten that up.
[07:23] B: Exactly.
[07:23] A: So that you're no longer troubled by it.
[07:25] B: Yeah.
[07:26] A: Okay. Does anybody ever tell you why that crap can continue to haunt?
[07:31] B: No.
[07:32] A: You have any idea why it might?
[07:34] B: No.
[07:34] A: I mean, it's not because it happened, which I know that would sound.
[07:37] B: Well, yeah.
[07:38] A: But it's really not because it happened. I know that sounds crazy, right? It isn't, though. I know. That's the craziest part. Right. People tend to think that I'm troubled by shit that happened because it happened. Yeah, but what if you're not?
[07:54] B: Okay.
[07:54] A: Troubled because it happened. Isn't that crazy? Yeah, but think of it in a different way. Let's say I'm seven. I'm not now seven, but I was seven. All of us, actually, at one time was seven. Alex was seven. She didn't skip that year, so. But if I was seven and I fell out a tree and I broke my arm, if I were to tell you about having had that accident now and I started to hold your phone, you would be looking at me like, fuck wrong with this guy. Like, why is he all upset about that? His arm moves. He's fine.
[08:30] B: Mm.
[08:32] A: That's weird, right? You wouldn't think I would still be troubled by it because that was like, a physical injury.
[08:38] B: Mm.
[08:39] A: But if I told you about something my uncle did multiple times when I was seven and I started to have the same kind of emotional response, you go, aww, man. You wouldn't think that there was anything weird about me being troubled by it.
[08:53] B: Okay, right.
[08:54] A: So the first one you're like, this guy's crazy. The second one you're like, of course.
[08:58] B: Yeah.
[08:59] A: So it's as if we think that emotional wounds don't heal, but they do. Do you know why they haven't?
[09:06] B: Why?
[09:08] A: The deal is, when we go through particular troubling moments, it short circuits the emotional part of the br. And what that Means is that part of the brain doesn't know that the negative experience stopped. I might. Where I'm logical, reasonable, rational, but at a deeper emotional level, it freezes. And what tends to freeze and replay is like, little gifts are the worst moments of it. So when we talk about, like, I have memories or flashes, I would imagine that they're probably repetitive, the worst parts of things that keep flashing or a small, like, replay of it. Right. And that doesn't happen because of how bad it was. It happens primarily because there's a part of your brain that never got that it stopped. That part it got stuck on. So at that level, the memory of it and the experience of it live as if it's still happening.
[10:11] B: Okay.
[10:12] A: Right. That's why it's still on.
[10:14] B: Okay.
[10:15] A: So we'd like you to be free from the effect in particular, that more recent experience has had.
[10:22] B: Yeah.
[10:23] A: So it no longer has all the heaviness and any of the hurt, anger, guilt, shame, sadness, stuff attached to that so that you can be free from that. Okay, cool. I know how to do that.
[10:35] B: Okay, cool.
[10:36] A: Like, get that completely better.
[10:37] B: Okay, great.
[10:38] A: Okay, great. What else are we wanting to do for you?
[10:42] B: I don't even know everything.
[10:44] A: You're doing a good job so far.
[10:49] B: I don't know. I don't know. Let me think, Let me think. I know. Right?
[10:57] A: Well, you don't have to tell me, like, specific things.
[10:59] B: Yeah. I mean, just abandonment, like, issues.
[11:03] A: What does that mean?
[11:04] B: Huh? Abandonment by my trafficker.
[11:07] A: I don't know what that means.
[11:10] B: I don't either.
[11:11] A: When you say abandonment issues, what does that actually mean?
[11:16] B: Leaving me. I mean, leaving me in bad situations. Leaving me by myself a lot. Leaving me left for dead in an alley.
[11:24] A: Oh, yeah. But you made it.
[11:26] B: But I made it.
[11:26] A: You're not dead.
[11:27] B: I'm not dead.
[11:28] A: Oh.
[11:29] B: But I was close. I mean, I don't.
[11:33] A: Wasn't it glad that you're not.
[11:34] B: I'm glad I'm not.
[11:35] A: Me too.
[11:36] B: Yeah, I know. Right.
[11:38] A: Right. But there was a part of your brain back then when you were left there that didn't know that you were gonna be here now.
[11:45] B: Yeah.
[11:45] A: So that would be good news for that part to get.
[11:48] B: Okay.
[11:48] A: That you made it through it.
[11:49] B: Yeah.
[11:50] A: Right. That you actually didn't need him.
[11:53] B: Yeah.
[11:54] A: Cause at certain times when it was going on and you were left, you actually thought you did.
[12:00] B: Oh, yeah.
[12:00] A: Need him to be around in order for you to survive.
[12:03] B: Oh, yeah.
[12:03] A: And make it through it and be here now. But guess what you didn't do. You Know why you know that?
[12:10] B: Why?
[12:11] A: Because you're sitting here now, so clearly you didn't. Right.
[12:16] B: Yeah.
[12:17] A: We want to get that good news in.
[12:18] B: Okay.
[12:19] A: Because you're way more resilient than you thought. Right. Don't you think? You're not sure of that yet.
[12:26] B: I'm not sure of that now.
[12:27] A: Well, what if you were?
[12:29] B: Well, then that would be great, wouldn't you? Yeah.
[12:32] A: Right. So we want that installed. The resiliency that actually comes from making it through and surviving awful experiences. Like, nobody goes through awful experiences to get stronger except crazy Navy SEALs. Those guys sign up going, hey, put me in the shit. Put me in the shit so I can become strong.
[12:53] B: Yeah.
[12:54] A: The rest of us go, fuck, no, man. Yeah, right. But making it through troubling experiences, you have to be stronger. How could you not? Yeah, right. You don't have that fully in yet, but what would it be like if you did fully feel that way?
[13:13] B: That'd be great.
[13:14] A: Yeah. So that you actually get to be, you know, like, proud.
[13:18] B: Mm.
[13:19] A: That you were able to survive all that.
[13:22] B: Yeah, I'm trying.
[13:24] A: You know, what if you didn't try.
[13:26] B: To find positive out of all?
[13:27] A: Well, I know you already told me that you're like a positive thinker, which might have helped, but we want it actually integrated.
[13:35] B: Yeah. Definitely.
[13:36] A: So that you fully feel it.
[13:37] B: Yeah.
[13:37] A: Right. And, like, you're good with you.
[13:39] B: Mm.
[13:40] A: Right. Okay. I know how to do that too.
[13:42] B: Okay.
[13:42] A: I can get behind doing that.
[13:43] B: Yay.
[13:43] A: Yeah. Right. What else?
[13:45] B: I don't know what else. I'm not even sure. I can't even think. I don't know.
[13:50] A: For somebody who can't even think, you've done a really good job so far. I mean, what you've told me so far, just making sure that I'm following it.
[13:57] B: Yeah.
[13:57] A: Is a. That there's been. Well, I'm gonna say now a bunch of experiences that have happened, that although they're over underneath the surface, they still affect you. There's lots of strong emotions attached to them. Some of them are like anger, resentment. Some of them like hurt, pain. Some of them might be guilt, shame.
[14:15] B: Yeah.
[14:15] A: We want to get you to be free from all of that. Right. You told me that there's unwanted thoughts at times about using. In particular, when you see veins.
[14:25] B: Yeah.
[14:26] A: You'd like that to stop.
[14:27] B: Yeah.
[14:28] A: You said that you're way more recently quick tempered and irritated, like things are violent up and get pissed off at stuff, and you'd like that to stop.
[14:38] B: Yeah.
[14:39] A: So that's what I'm understanding. So far. About what? We're wanting to get better.
[14:43] B: Yeah.
[14:43] A: Right out of what I said. Tori, is there anything that I missed?
[14:53] B: I. I don't know if this part takes. I don't know. I want feelings of me loving my trafficker to go away.
[15:02] A: Oh, okay.
[15:03] B: That's a big thing.
[15:04] A: Okay, so tell me more. What would. What would be useful for me to know. To understand feelings of loving your trafficker.
[15:12] B: Although I know in my head, I know that if I ever went back to him, I'd be dead. I know that he's no good for me. I know he's bad. He's just bad, you know? But there's a part of me that just. I was in love with them at a point in time in my life, you know? I was in love with them at a point in time, like, two years ago. Two years ago until just. I mean, I still feel like I love him, even though I know in my brain that he's no good for me. You know? He's not. But I don't know why. I don't know why.
[15:50] A: To be in love with somebody that you know is no good for you.
[15:53] B: Yeah. Someone that would sell me, someone that would beat me. You know, someone that I just. I don't get why I still have. Like, I think about him and, like, well, who's he with now? You know? Even as something as simple as me using and him, he would shoot me up, you know? And, like, who's he doing that with now? You know? Why does that cross my mind? I don't want it to cross my mind. I don't want to care about that.
[16:19] A: Okay.
[16:20] B: Yeah.
[16:20] A: So you'd like to get it so that you actually see all of him at once.
[16:25] B: Mm.
[16:26] A: Because the way that you actually reminisce is that you're not seeing the whole picture at the same time. Right. Don't you have, like, little windows of, like, oh, he was this. Yeah, but that's not including all of the. Oh, and he left me in that.
[16:38] B: Yeah, exactly.
[16:38] A: They're not, like, included in the same picture.
[16:40] B: Yeah.
[16:41] A: So you have little windows of seeing him as, like, this ideal, yet that's not included in the bigger picture of how he actually had been with you. Okay, I got that. Okay, so we'd like to get it so that you're no longer having that kind of affinity towards a guy who, you know, is bad for you and, you know, did lots of yucky stuff.
[17:05] B: Yeah.
[17:06] A: Even though there might have been some stuff along the way that he did that might have been nice.
[17:10] B: Yeah, exactly.
[17:13] A: Okay.
[17:13] B: Yeah.
[17:14] A: So we get to see, like, the whole big picture all at the same time. Right. Because if you did, he's probably less desirable.
[17:24] B: Yeah. I mean. Yeah. Yeah.
[17:26] A: I mean, just check it out. And we see that guy along with the guy, I left you there. And this other stuff. Right. If we have all that. And I don't even know all the different things that happen, but if we see all of that at the same. Same time, how desirable is he doesn't have the same desirability? Isn't that weird?
[17:43] B: Yeah.
[17:44] A: Yeah, that would be good for you. Okay. I know how to do that, too.
[17:47] B: Okay, good.
[17:47] A: Yeah. To get you to be free from all of that and to see it clearly with distance.
[17:53] B: Okay, Right.
[17:54] A: Because sometimes we don't see as clearly when stuff's too close to me, but if I have distance from it, I can kind of see the big picture out in front of me. And we want to include all of the different parts. Right. Because that's the other thing that you have. You said it. You have a parts conflict. Right. There's a part of me that knows he's not a good guy for me.
[18:15] B: Yeah.
[18:16] A: Yet there's another part of me that wants to be with him and has love for him.
[18:19] B: Yeah.
[18:20] A: What the fuck? Right? So there's a parts conflict, and we want the conflict to go away so that you actually see it clearly.
[18:29] B: Mm.
[18:29] A: Right. And then actually feel good.
[18:31] B: Yeah.
[18:32] A: About you.
[18:32] B: Okay.
[18:33] A: Okay, cool. I know how to do that.
[18:35] B: Okay.
[18:35] A: Awesome. Why not? This is gonna be fun.
[18:38] B: I think that's it right now.
[18:39] A: Okay. Just it. That's it?
[18:40] B: Yeah. That's it? Yeah.
[18:41] A: Nothing else?
[18:42] B: No.
[18:43] A: Well, if other things show up, you can certainly tell me.
[18:45] B: Okay. I have one.
[18:47] A: Yes.
[18:48] B: Oh, no, it's okay.
[18:51] A: You were troubled by your postpartum period with your daughter.
[18:54] B: Oh, yeah. That one. Yeah.
[18:56] A: What does that mean?
[18:58] B: Oh, I have two girls. I have Gracie, who will be 11 in September, and I have Chloe, who will be 7 on the 27th of this month. Chloe lives in Arizona with my dad. Gracie's. And I've been. Let me start with Gracie. When I had her, I was in a really bad relationship in Arizona. So I moved back here in 2008 and went to go live with my mom and my stepdad and ended up being pregnant, and I was coming off of heroin, everything like that. So, you know, when I had her, everyone kept telling me, oh, this great. You had this great relationship with your child. It's this endless love. I did not have that at all. At all. No. And it Wasn't that I didn't love my child. Because even though she would sleep with me at nighttime, you know, she'd sleep, I'd put her in a little boppy pillow and I'd wake up like every 15 minutes, I swear, and check in, make sure she's breathing. Like I still cared about her, but I just never felt that, like my mom was the first person to hold her. Like it was. I think I was jealous of her too. I think I explained that to you. I was jealous.
[20:02] A: Especially jealous of the baby.
[20:04] B: Yeah, especially.
[20:05] A: Cause she was getting more attention.
[20:06] B: Yeah.
[20:08] A: I mean, they're babies.
[20:09] B: I know.
[20:10] A: By the way they freaking demand it.
[20:12] B: I know.
[20:12] A: If you don't give them attention, they are gonna make you give them attention.
[20:15] B: Exactly. And I ask her, she knows right now. And my mom had said something to the effect of, I never knew I could love my grandchild. I never knew it was possible to love my grandchild more than my child. Like, jokingly nice mom, but I was.
[20:35] A: Already going through it.
[20:37] B: Right, Exactly. I was already going through it. So my guy. I really struggle with that. I couldn't wait to go back to work. I was calling my boss, like six weeks. He's like, no, I told you it'd take two months. I'm like, no, I want to go. I need to get out of this house. I remember going to a six week checkup and I told them my feelings and they kind of said, oh, that's normal. So I never dealt with. Eventually caused me to leave the house. My daughter stayed with my step. With my mom, my stepdad, and has been with them ever since.
[21:09] A: Okay.
[21:09] B: I never dealt with it. And it's dealt with it.
[21:12] A: What's the it?
[21:13] B: The postpartum, the depression, the not connecting with her. I don't know if it was. Yeah, I was jealous. And I. Part of me when I saw her, it reminded me of her dad.
[21:24] A: She would have been like, what, 20?
[21:25] B: 20? Yeah. Turned 20. Well, 21. I turned 21amonth after she was born.
[21:30] A: Really old, huh? Really old.
[21:31] B: Yeah. Really old. Yeah, exactly. But. Yeah, but when I had Chloe.
[21:38] A: Oh, it was different.
[21:39] B: Oh, yeah. That was my.
[21:41] A: Oh, it was different.
[21:42] B: Yeah. Completely different.
[21:43] A: Right. You were in 21 now, right? Yeah, it was different.
[21:47] B: Yeah.
[21:48] A: Right. Which doesn't mean that you love her more.
[21:50] B: No.
[21:51] A: Right. Don't you love them both?
[21:53] B: Yeah.
[21:53] A: You do?
[21:54] B: Yeah, no, I do.
[21:54] A: Even if one's easier?
[21:56] B: Yeah.
[21:56] A: Yeah.
[21:58] B: Okay.
[21:59] A: Right?
[22:00] B: Yeah. I mean, I just.
[22:01] A: So you have a lot of bad feelings over having felt like you didn't connect as well.
[22:05] B: Yeah.
[22:06] A: To the first one, definitely. Okay.
[22:11] B: I wasn't able to deal with it. Everyone told me that was normal, and for me, that wasn't normal. You know what? It's normal to not feel this connection with your child. It's normal to not have that undying love with your child right away. I didn't have that. I wanted to stay away from her. I didn't want to be around her. That's hard for me to admit.
[22:33] A: Okay.
[22:33] B: Yeah.
[22:34] A: So what if you had more peace with that?
[22:36] B: That'd be great. Yeah.
[22:39] A: And probably really great for her too.
[22:40] B: Yeah.
[22:40] A: Don't you think?
[22:42] B: Definitely.
[22:43] A: Right. Because you feeling shitty over not connecting with her isn't actually useful for her.
[22:48] B: No, not at all.
[22:49] A: It doesn't do anything good for her. Oh, and by the way, it's actually easier as a grandparent.
[22:54] B: Is it?
[22:55] A: Yes. That's what they don't tell us. I swear. They don't tell us. Yes. No, no. I mean, it's easier as a grandparent because, like, they're not like your birth kid.
[23:05] B: Oh, right.
[23:07] A: You have to go through being a parent and all the hell that that is to then become a grandparent and go, hey, this is great.
[23:14] B: Yeah.
[23:15] A: I get all the good parts and none of the bad parts.
[23:18] B: Yeah, that's good. Yeah.
[23:21] A: Okay, so we want you to be more at peace with all of that and not have so bad feelings about you or be so hard on you about how you had been feeling at 20 having a baby that was being doted over.
[23:34] B: Yeah.
[23:35] A: Right. And getting comments like, hey, gosh, I love her more than you. Yeah, great. Awesome.
[23:41] B: I know, right?
[23:43] A: I don't know why I have issues with you, Mom.
[23:45] B: I know, Exactly. Yeah.
[23:49] A: Okay, so we want you to have freedom there and we want you to be more at peace with that.
[23:53] B: Yes.
[23:53] A: And all like the bad feelings that you've had about you. We want that lifted in corner. Okay, I can do that too.
[23:59] B: Because for me, there's something wrong with me because I didn't connect with my child. You know, who doesn't? Like, I.
[24:06] A: Well, I don't know whether you didn't connect with her.
[24:08] B: I didn't connect with her.
[24:09] A: Yeah. But I don't know.
[24:10] B: She doesn't even know me as mom right now.
[24:12] A: Well, right. She's been living with them. Yeah, right. Which has been probably a useful thing for her. Don't you think?
[24:18] B: It's been a great. I mean. What do you mean, a useful thing?
[24:23] A: Well, she's had, like two stable people that have been raising her.
[24:27] B: Oh, yeah. She's.
[24:27] A: Or at least somewhat stable. I don't know.
[24:29] B: Oh, no. Perfectly stable. My parents, they're great. You know, she's. She's in the best place, realistically.
[24:36] A: Like, better for her.
[24:37] B: Yeah. By far.
[24:38] A: Right.
[24:40] B: Yeah.
[24:40] A: Which you were able to do that. Which wasn't included when you were thinking I wasn't connecting to her. That all of that actually got her in a situation that's better for her.
[24:52] B: Yeah.
[24:53] A: Right. Which has everything to do with your love for her. Which, again, you haven't been including. Right.
[25:01] B: Yeah.
[25:02] A: Right. So you're starting to get that what's happening now, that's a better breath.
[25:08] B: Yeah.
[25:08] A: Yeah. Right. Because it's the context that you weren't including. You were only seeing it from that very narrowed spot. But as we're looking at it clearly with some distance from it. Right. We know with all of that happening, got her into a situation that is better for her to be in.
[25:24] B: Yeah.
[25:25] A: Right. Which has everything to do with your love for her. Right. Because it's not that you don't love her. You already told me that.
[25:32] B: Yeah.
[25:32] A: And it's not that you don't love the other one more.
[25:34] B: Yeah.
[25:35] A: They're just different. Right. My wife. We have two kids. My wife said if we had the second one first, we'd have one. Wait, what? I know. Isn't that crazy? She said if we had the second one first, we'd only have one child.
[25:51] B: Okay.
[25:52] A: Because the second one is a lot harder for her.
[25:54] B: Okay, I see. That's funny.
[25:57] A: But it's not that she doesn't love them any more or any less. One's just easier for her. Right.
[26:07] B: Makes sense.
[26:09] A: Right.
[26:09] B: Yeah.
[26:14] A: What's happening now?
[26:15] B: I'm just thinking.
[26:16] A: You are? I know. That's a good thing. Kind of in a different way than you were.
[26:20] B: Yeah.
[26:21] A: Right. Because notice how it's beginning to lighten up a little and, heck, we just met.
[26:24] B: I know, right?
[26:26] A: Crazy.
[26:26] B: Yeah. Okay.
[26:29] A: So that's something we can get better, too, which has already started. Yeah, I know.
[26:34] B: Weird.
[26:34] A: Isn't that neat?
[26:35] B: Yeah.
[26:35] A: Yeah.
[26:36] B: I like it.
[26:40] A: Right. See, there you go. Right? Yeah. Right. Lots of things can get better. Yeah. Way better than how they've been. Yeah. What else would be useful for me to know? Anyone else got other information?
[26:51] B: No. No. I think that was the only other thing I. Yeah.
[26:56] A: Okay, cool. What part of Arizona? Just, you know.
[27:00] B: Oh, Peoria. Like Glendale. Glendsdale. My dad. Yeah. Avondale. I moved my sophomore year in Seminole. Sophomore? Year of high school, I moved to Arizona with my dad.
[27:15] A: And that's birth dad.
[27:16] B: My birth dad. Yeah.
[27:17] A: Okay. And step dad and mom still live here.
[27:21] B: Yeah.
[27:21] A: In Florida.
[27:22] B: Yeah.
[27:22] A: And birth dad still lives in Arizona. And birth dad has youngest. Chloe.
[27:28] B: Yes. Yeah.
[27:30] A: Cool. I have family out in Arizona.
[27:33] B: Okay, let's see.
[27:34] A: They were in Chandler.
[27:36] B: Yeah.
[27:36] A: Which is outside of Scottsdale. And then I think they're in Glendale. That you just said. Yes. I think that that's another suburb of that.
[27:43] B: Yeah. Still all in the valley.
[27:45] A: Yeah.
[27:45] B: Yeah, definitely. I always say my heart. No, my heart belongs in the desert. I was just talking to Alex about that. I love Arizona. I love it there. I just love it.
[27:56] A: Cause they have mountains.
[27:57] B: They have mountains. It's brown. I like the dust storms. I like little dust devils.
[28:02] A: Just.
[28:03] B: I love it out there.
[28:04] A: And it's hot.
[28:05] B: It's hotter here, I think.
[28:07] A: It's different hot.
[28:08] B: It's humid here. It's dry there.
[28:10] A: Right. It's still hot.
[28:12] B: Yeah.
[28:12] A: I mean, the difference in the hot is here. You can't get away from it when you're outside.
[28:18] B: Yeah.
[28:19] A: Because even if you go under the tree, it's just as hot.
[28:22] B: Yeah.
[28:23] A: There. If you go under shade, oh, my goodness, it's so much cooler. But there, you can cook an egg on the ground.
[28:29] B: Oh, yeah. On the sidewalk. I've done it. I've done it. Yeah. I used to do that every summer going to my dad's. Every summer. Right. I thought it was the coolest thing. Me too. It gets like 121 degrees.
[28:42] A: Cook an egg.
[28:42] B: Yep, exactly.
[28:44] A: Over easy, sunny. Set up. Any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know?
[28:53] B: No, not that I can't think of right now. I know.
[28:55] A: Yeah. How you feeling, though?
[28:57] B: I'm okay. Good.
[29:00] A: Not so edgy.
[29:00] B: No.
[29:01] A: Right.
[29:02] B: Relaxed. You.
[29:03] A: You are more relaxed.
[29:04] B: Yeah. I like that feeling.
[29:05] A: It is a good feeling to be having and to be having more ongoing. Right. Because that's where we're headed, is you a lot lighter and a lot easier on you. You becoming more at peace. You getting. Internalizing the resiliency and strength for you to still be here now after all of that. I don't even know all of that.
[29:27] B: Yeah.
[29:27] A: Right. But for you to still be here, there's gotta be a lot of resiliency.
[29:31] B: Yeah, that's true. Right, Right.
[29:34] A: Right. But you discount that.
[29:35] B: Yeah.
[29:35] A: Right. And then we want you free from, like, you know, having interest and desire in a guy that you know isn't good for you.
[29:40] B: Oh, yeah. By far.
[29:42] A: Okay. And is he here? Is he here, like in Florida? Well, not here.
[29:46] B: I know.
[29:46] A: I don't see him.
[29:46] B: Well, I mean, he was in prison, I believe. Unless his date changed. Just got out June 24th.
[29:54] A: Okay.
[29:55] B: So that was something that I was dealing with too, that whole day. And that because for the past like 18 months prior to me coming to Salah, I had been waiting for that day for a long time for him to get out. Oh yeah. I couldn't wait to see him, you know, so. But yeah, he's in Seminole.
[30:11] A: Okay.
[30:12] B: Shared his parents house, so I don't know.
[30:16] A: All right. Yeah. So we have freedom there.
[30:19] B: Yeah.
[30:19] A: Okay.
[30:19] B: Definitely.
[30:20] A: So I'm gonna give you a couple different things that I think would be useful and then we're gonna schedule a chunk of time to actually do the change.
[30:29] B: Okay.
[30:30] A: Like you'll notice immediately right then and there it changing. Like stuff that used to bother you won't bother you. You'll think about it and you'll be like, huh? Yeah, normally that would have all this. And I don't feel any of that. Won't that be cool? Yes, because that's what people tell me. There are three, maybe four major things that people tell me over and over again. One being the stuff that used to really bother them. That stuff doesn't bother them at all. Right. Won't that be cool? Second thing, they tell me the intensity in which they used to get distressed, way less. The frequency in which it used to happen, way less. The duration it used to last, way less. So instead of being the large mountain to overcome each time, it's a small speed, but it's still freaking annoying. Yeah, but you're beyond them really fast. Right. That's where we're headed. So how people tend to look at or listen to stuff is they go, it's the stuff that causes the feelings. Whether it's the past stuff that has happened, the current stuff that is happening, the future stuff that could. It's the stuff that causes feelings. When we look through that lens, we got about this much power because we're either going to try to change the stuff, we work hard to change stuff, but if I can't change it, then I try to get away from it or avoid it. But in life there's some stuff I can't change, there's some stuff I can't completely or maybe don't want to fully get away from. And then there's a whole bunch of stuff that's happened in life. I can't get the shit to have not happened. So we got to do something else. That's where I get to come in My job is all about adjusting how your brain emotionally reacts and responds to stuff. Whether it's the past that did the current, that is the future that might. Right. So think of it in a silly way. Lion approaches zebra. Most people are going to say the lion is making the zebra scared. Yes. You wouldn't disagree with that? No, no, I don't disagree with it either. But if we looked at it from a different lens, we go, wait, no, it's not actually the lion. It's really the zebra's brain that's making the zebra alert, motivated, strong. We call that scared. It's doing it as soon as the zebra senses, feels, sees, smells, or thinks that lion is coming. Isn't that a weird way to think? So instead of it being the lion that's causing all that stuff in the zebra, it's the zebra's brain, and it's doing it as the zebra senses and responds to lion. But if we look through that lens, we've got weight, more power. Right? Because you've been saying, you know, it piles up, but it's the door being open. That's what made me feel this way. Okay, right. We're gonna flip it around and wait. No, it's not the door. It's something your brain has been doing to you. Not because your brain wants you to be pissed about a fucking door.
[33:26] B: I know, right?
[33:32] A: Right. But it's something that your brain has been doing. It's undesirable to you, therefore, it's an error. And do you know what our brains are prone to do? Have lots of errors, glitches and malfunctions. Because a brain is a really complicated, almost like supercomputer. And what do we know about things that are complicated? You know, hammers are pretty basic and simple, right? They tend to work well. I can get mad at my hammer and I can throw it. I can still pick it up. I can still use it to pound nails. My computer, really complicated. My phone, really complicated. Right? I get pissed off at my phone. Probably need to get a new one. That one ain't working again, right? So with complicated machines, they're more prone to error than machines that are simple and basic. Our brains are complicated. So my job is all about tuning up the glitches, the errors and the malfunctions in the way that your brain works. One of the major malfunctions our brain has is in timing. And what I mean by that is your body right now is the only thing about you that's locked into today. Now it's the only Place. It could be your body in your brain, though. You can time travel, right? So you can remember stuff that you did. You can think about stuff you're going to go do. Did you know that no other animal can do that? Only we can see all other animals, just like their body they're always in now. There's no other time for an animal.
[35:13] B: Yeah.
[35:14] A: Than now. But for us, we can time travel. So how does anxiety work? I'm thinking about a future thing that could or might happen. That if it did happen, it would be really bad. When am I going to feel all of the distress? Now, because that's where my body is. Right. I'm remembering past stuff that sucked, that was awful. When am I going to feel all the distress of it? Right now, because that's where my body is. Isn't that interesting?
[35:47] B: Yeah.
[35:48] A: So we've developed our ways to literally unplug the emotional effect that past experiences have had. So my brain reads it instead of as happening, which is why I feel the feelings as data about something that happened. Right. That way it's still information. We don't want to erase memories because again, that's useful as intel for world. Right. But we want to unplug the emotional effect that the stuff has had. So it's not running me anymore. Because most of the times that you're feeling ways that you don't want to feel or thinking thoughts that you don't want to be thinking, it's not because you chose it. Right. It's not like you woke up today. If that fucking door is open, I am gonna be so fucking pissed.
[36:43] B: Yeah, I know.
[36:46] A: That is not what you were deciding. I'm gonna walk in there and if it's open, wait until I just freaking go off. Yet all of a sudden you walked in and boom, you were in it.
[36:56] B: Yeah.
[36:57] A: Not because you decided it. Got it.
[37:00] B: I got it.
[37:02] A: Right. So where we're gonna intervene is in the arena of all of that way that you find yourself feeling and thinking without deciding it. So it changes it at that level. That way you don't have to think about doing it, you know, like most of the time people give us suggestions of what to do when I'm already triggered. I remember this is a funny story. When I was a teen. Well, no, I wasn't a teenager. I was in elementary school, fifth grade. And I'm an emotional guy, which is not good as a boy and really not good in fifth grade. Like when we're all going through like, you know, but me being emotional and, you know, people Might, like, say mean things, and it would hurt my feelings, you know, because, like, in fifth grade is when you start realizing that, like, not everybody's in front of me, right? And I'd have, like, all these feelings. Stuff would happen. I went to the school psychologist who I thought was, like, a really brilliant guy, and he goes, he had this little jar, and in the little jar, he had what he called magic rubber bands. And he said, I want you to wear one of these magic rubber bands. You get to pick the color. My favorite color at the time, Blue. Still favorite color. I picked the blue one. I put it on. He goes, this magic rubber band is something that I want you to snap when somebody picks on you. Because what it's going to do is it's going to tell you to remember to close your eyes and find a happy place, you know, a place you really like to go. And then I want you to take five deep breaths in and long exhales because that will solve you getting upset. You won't get upset anymore when people pick at you. I went, awesome. So I left wearing this magic rubber band. Go to class. Nothing really happened. That a little bit later, somebody said something to me, and it hit me, right? And I snapped the rubber band, and it fucking hurt. And now he was even more mad, and I didn't remember what the hell he told me to do. So that clearly didn't work. Right. So we don't want to give you tools to use once you're already triggered.
[39:14] B: Okay.
[39:14] A: Or tools that you got to try to manage life all the time thinking about. Okay. So how am I going to. No, we want the automatic part of your brain to naturally work more in the way that you want it to. Got it. So that you're naturally feeling more the way that you want to feel and reacting to things more the way that you want to.
[39:33] B: Okay.
[39:34] A: Got it. So therefore, as I'm listening to what's been going on, I've also been thinking in my mind, well, gosh, how do we want things to be for Tori? And I'm already coming up with, like, a how I want you to be. So the you that I'm seeing. Right? And I bet you could do this really quick. Watch. Think about whatever you need to think about, Whether it be stuff that we talked about or other stuff. Think about whatever you need to think about. Feel just a tiny little bit of the bad feelings. Right. Notice how it didn't take long?
[40:01] B: No.
[40:01] A: Right. But you did it on purpose because you were being cooperative.
[40:04] B: Okay.
[40:04] A: And you know what? That Wouldn't be a problem if it only happened when you decided to do it. Right. The problem is that your brain does that shit to you all the time when you haven't been deciding to.
[40:14] B: Exactly.
[40:15] A: That's the error. So the you that I'm seeing, that kind of feeling, the you that I'm seeing, she remembers having had it, but if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't even know how to get it. Like, it's, like, completely clear. Gone.
[40:27] B: Yeah.
[40:27] A: Got it. The you that I'm seeing is much more at peace. She's comfortable in her own skin. There's a lot more lightness and ease and how she's maneuvering through her day. The lingering effect of those prior experiences where there's been any of the hurt or the anger, the guilt or the shame or the sadness that's been cleared and gone. That whole confusion of the parts like, but don't, like, want, but not want. That's been completely cleared. So the you is seeing it clearly for what it was. She's at peace. She's centered. She's a lot lighter. She's rock solid. Her recovery, meaning it would be easier to push over a large locomotive than it would be to get her to use. That's the you that I'm seeing.
[41:15] B: Well, I want to be that person.
[41:17] A: Yeah, right.
[41:17] B: I want to be that person.
[41:18] A: Isn't that cool? You, by the way, Tori, don't even have to see this. You just like me.
[41:22] B: Okay?
[41:23] A: Because the question isn't how it's going to happen. The question is, would it be okay?
[41:29] B: Hmm?
[41:30] A: Right? Would it be okay for you to be the way I just described it? Would be, wouldn't it? Right. And see, just with it being okay, we've got a green light, which means at a deeper level, your brain is already responding to it. Kind of like, have you ever planted seeds in the soil? Right? You cover them up, and then you water the top level, and then a whole bunch of stuff starts to happen. And you don't see anyone. What the heck? Nothing's going on. Nothing's going on. Remember as a little kid, you put a seed and like, water, water, water. Nothing's happening. Nothing. And then all of a sudden, finally, after all sorts of stuff have happened, before you ever see it, it sprouts, starts to come above. So your brain is already beginning to organize towards what I described. We want to increase it because I'm going to give you one little thing. Our brain is really responsive to symbols. Do you know how I know that? Advertisers Use them.
[42:20] B: Okay.
[42:21] A: When you see a big yellow arch, what do you think of McDonald's? When you see a swoosh on somebody's shoe, what do you think of Nike? What the hell does a swoosh and a yellow arch have to do with cheeseburgers and athletic apparel? That's true.
[42:33] B: Okay.
[42:34] A: They're symbols. We want to get a way to symbolize this. You.
[42:37] B: Okay?
[42:38] A: Right. Peaceful. Clear. At ease. Comfortable. Solid. Right. And we could use a wild animal. We could use something out in nature. We could use a natural formation of the earth. We could use something that grows from the ground. We're going to make it up because we don't have one. But if we were to symbolize this, you. What comes to mind?
[43:01] B: I don't even know.
[43:02] A: I know. Make it up. Right. We make it up. We don't actually have one.
[43:06] B: No.
[43:07] A: Right. So we make it up.
[43:08] B: Okay.
[43:09] A: So if we were to symbolize you as a wild animal or something out in nature or something up in the sky. This you here. Who's clear, who's at peace, who's free, who's present? Right. Who's feeling really good about what she's up to, where she's headed. Right. And we symbolize it with wild animals. Something out in nature, something up in the sky. Natural formation of the Earth. What comes to mind?
[43:36] B: An owl.
[43:37] A: An owl. Beautiful, right? So the owl is the perfect symbol. I'm going to give you a small little homework assignment.
[43:45] B: Okay?
[43:45] A: It won't take long. If you were to do it 10 times a day, which would be a lot, it might take you a full minute. So here's how it works. You're going to sit with both feet on the floor. You're going to look up with your eyes. You're going to picture the owl. And you're going to take a slow, deep breath in. Okay. We won't do it yet. Then you're going to exhale and close your eyes. You're going to breathe in, you're going to breathe out. And then you're going to breathe in one more time. And then exhale and open your eyes. I'll guide you through it. So look up and out. Think owl. No, just with your eyes, not with your head.
[44:20] B: Okay?
[44:21] A: Right. Think owl. Take a deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. Keep your eyes closed as you breathe in and out. And then one more breath in. And then this time, as you exhale, allow your eyes to open.
[44:46] B: Perfect.
[44:48] A: Right? Took us maybe 9 seconds, 10 seconds to do it. So not a long period of time. Anytime you think. Ow. And take that slow breath in. And then exhale and close your eyes. It's telling the part that's already doing stuff under the surface. Hey, organize towards this me. Set up towards this me so that when we get back together, we can move in a much faster pace.
[45:10] B: I like that.
[45:11] A: Yeah. So, any questions?
[45:13] B: No?
[45:14] A: All right.
[45:15] B: Yeah.
[45:15] A: I'm excited.
[45:16] B: I'm excited, too.
[45:17] A: I know. Isn't that cool?
[45:18] B: Yeah.
[45:18] A: Isn't it cool to, like, actually be excited to go to counseling? Yeah. Because most people aren't.
[45:22] B: No. Why?
[45:23] A: Because they don't do this.
[45:25] B: Okay, well, I'm excited.
[45:28] A: Me, too. All right, cool. Well, we'll stop with that, and then I will have the office coordinate all this stuff so that we can get back together and get that done.
[45:35] B: Okay. Awesome.
[45:36] A: Yeah.
[45:37] B: Thank you.
[45:37] A: Cool. Cool. Very nice meeting you.
[45:39] B: Very nice meeting you.
[45:39] A: Okay.
[45:40] B: Thank you.
[45:41] A: You're welcome.
