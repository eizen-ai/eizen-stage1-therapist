[00:00] A: So Today is the 18th. Is it the 18th. Wow. Of January, Trish. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing, and you know that. And that recording may be made available in teaching and training professionals, given what we do is useful and valuable for you, and I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:17] B: Yes.
[00:17] A: Cool. So give me an update first on how things have been, how our last session left you, which was a while ago, and then kind of what you would be wanting our time today to be focusing on.
[00:28] B: Okay. So the last month has been fairly productive. Subtle, but productive.
[00:38] A: Yeah.
[00:41] B: I. I think I was. They. I think that Madeline tried to get me in last month for a speaking thing that I had to go and do, but I ended up not having.
[00:56] A: To go into it.
[00:57] B: No. Not coming here. But I went into it anyways, and I. It made me question whether you were like a. Like, if you were. I don't know. They said that you could help me get ready for, like, public speaking. And I was like, oh, cool. At least somebody can, because I have no idea what I'm doing, but, like, my passion outweighs my fear, so I'm just gonna go for it.
[01:25] A: Cool.
[01:25] B: And I did. In front of a group of teenagers. There was like 40 of them.
[01:31] A: Wow. Nice.
[01:32] B: Yeah. And it was. It went good. It was great. And then I didn't expect it, but afterwards, you know, I Even. A couple kids came up and asked questions and were, like, blown away by my. My story, and so. That was great. It was empowering. Really nice. Yeah. And then I.
[01:59] A: And wasn't triggering.
[02:01] B: No, not at all.
[02:03] A: Which is also different.
[02:04] B: Yeah. Yeah. I didn't break down and cry in front of a group, which would have been humiliating, but I didn't. I. I got through it, and. And it was great. I want to do it again.
[02:22] A: Cool.
[02:22] B: Yeah. So anything else? I don't think so. I don't know. So much has happened. It's been a long time, I'm sure.
[02:30] A: Yeah. Well, when you think back about the kind of overreaction to thinking I'm in trouble, how has that been?
[02:42] B: Um, good, I guess. I guess I haven't. I haven't came into any bumps in the road.
[02:57] A: You haven't been doing the overreaction?
[02:59] B: No.
[03:00] A: Nice.
[03:01] B: I don't think I've had any re. I don't think I've had many reactions to anything. Yeah. I'm pretty flatlined.
[03:10] A: Okay.
[03:11] B: Yeah. Yep. I think the only thing that I have came to is, like, it's pretty recent. I talked to Christine about it on Thursday how like for my dad's death anniversary, I really want to go to, you know, they sent like a little cross up and whatever where his accident was and everybody got to write their names on his cross. But I haven't got to do that yet. And I want to, but also I want to, I want to see my grandma. She lives right there and she's not a safe contact. Not because she wouldn't be a safe contact, but she, she's far away, she's pretty depressed and she's on fixed income. So I don't like $20 is a lot for her to put in for a background check right now. And so she's not a safe contact. But it's something that I really want to do. And I think like, at first I was like, okay, nothing was coming up for me. And I was like, alright, this is what I want to do. So I just have to put in a pass to do it. And then like, when I got to putting in the pass process, I was like, this is fucking ridiculous. This is my family that I want to see. And I have to ask, I have to ask to see my family. And like, really brought me down and I was. It was hard for me. It's still kind of hard for me to like articulate exactly what the feelings are that come up for it. But it's like, I don't know. I'm at a point in my life where like, I really want to trust myself because I've been empowered to do so. And like, I want to trust my decisions and I want to trust where I'm going in life and the things that I'm. The decisions that I'm making. But then I make these decisions and I also have to give it to somebody else to make a decision. So it's like I know what I want to do and I know where I want to go, but then I have to present it to somebody who's either going to say yes or no. And I think like, the fear that they're gonna tell me no really kind of irks me because I'm like, this is my family. It's my grandma. She's 85 years old. Literally, like next month is not a promise to her. And so anyways, this came up this morning.
[06:13] A: Huh. So that's like, that's what came up.
[06:17] B: The feeling of like, oh my God, I have to put in a pass to see my family because I don't know. And what it made me feel like is I can't be trusted Or I can't make decisions for myself or, you know, like, I'm not able to do that.
[06:38] A: Okay. So the thing that's troubling, if I'm following this correctly, about you having to put in a pass to see somebody, your grandmom, who's not yet a safe contact, not because she couldn't be, but because 20 bucks is hard for her to come up with to even have a background check. Yeah. The thing that's been troubling for you is somehow having to ask is making you feel like you don't make good decisions or you can't do things on your own or. Okay, that's what's been happening.
[07:10] B: Yes.
[07:11] A: Okay. Okay. And so here's the dumb question. What about it has been troubling that.
[07:21] B: I can't make the decision to go?
[07:28] A: Who would be making the decision?
[07:31] B: The program.
[07:34] A: The program is gonna decide whether you can or can't go?
[07:38] B: Yes.
[07:38] A: But before they would decide that, you have to decide that you want to go.
[07:43] B: Yes.
[07:44] A: Because we wouldn't be in this situation if you didn't.
[07:46] B: Right.
[07:49] A: So isn't that you deciding?
[07:51] B: Well, yes.
[07:52] A: Okay.
[07:52] B: But that's not true.
[07:54] A: I'm just checking.
[07:55] B: So that's. That's where. That's where I'm at. That's where the fork in the road is, I guess. Is that, like, I make this decision and then I have to ask somebody else if the decision that I'm making can happen?
[08:19] A: Yes. Based on the decision that you made to be in this program?
[08:25] B: Yes.
[08:25] A: Right. Right. So what do you think they're gonna do?
[08:36] B: I don't know.
[08:37] A: You don't know. Okay, so what's troubling you is that because you're in this program, when you make the decision to do it, you can't just go do it. You have to make sure that it's okay with programming to go?
[08:56] B: Yes.
[08:57] A: Okay. What does that have to do with you not being able to make your own decisions?
[09:01] B: Well, not being able to follow through on my own decisions?
[09:07] A: Well, aren't you?
[09:08] B: No.
[09:09] A: Following through on your own decisions to be in the program?
[09:12] B: Well, yes.
[09:13] A: And wouldn't following through on your own decisions to be in the program to be following through with what the program is doing and why?
[09:21] B: Yes.
[09:23] A: Oh, so you are following through with your decisions.
[09:26] B: Yes.
[09:27] A: Okay. You had made that decision before you decided to go visit Grandma.
[09:32] B: Yes.
[09:33] A: So that decision that you made then supersedes the one that you just made with Grandma, and in making the decision, you agreed to following what the rules of the program are?
[09:46] B: Yes.
[09:47] A: And so you're doing the things to take, the steps and actions that are in alignment with what programming says. Okay, so you are doing it.
[09:59] B: Yes.
[09:59] A: Just not about that one yet.
[10:01] B: No.
[10:02] A: Yes. What's happening now? You're doing great. Write that. What's happening now? Write this right. You're doing great. Church. Hey.
[10:17] B: I'm just upset because there's things that I want to do that because I made a choice to come to the program could potentially not allow me to follow through with the things that I want to do. I did not think prior to coming to the program that I would even want to visit my dad's rec site.
[10:52] A: Yeah.
[10:54] B: But I do. And I haven't seen my grandma since I've been home from prison. I didn't see her the whole time I was in prison. I talked to her on the phone when I got out, and that was the extent of our communication. And now I want to go over there and spend the day with her. And I don't know if I'm gonna be able to or not.
[11:27] A: In the timing that you want.
[11:30] B: Yes. Well, in the timing of my. On the anniversary of my dad's.
[11:36] A: Right. It's timing.
[11:37] B: Yeah.
[11:39] A: It's not that you might not. It's not that you wouldn't ever be able to.
[11:43] B: I mean, she's 85. Tomorrow's not promised.
[11:46] A: Tomorrow's not promised for me. I'm 47. Tomorrow's not promised for you. How are you 29. Tomorrow's not promised for any of us. So. So it's timing because it's not that you won't be able to do what you want to do. It just. You may not be able to do what you want to do at the exact time frame that you want to do it.
[12:11] B: Yeah.
[12:12] A: Okay. And that's been challenging because it brought up, like, well, then maybe I'm not really choosing.
[12:19] B: Yeah. Yeah. And also, my sister is. Lives in Maryland, and she's having a baby within any day now. And, like, my mom and my stepdad and my sister, they all went up there. So they're all up there through February. And. And I think that that's another thing that's been kind of.
[12:44] A: To be with the baby. To be with the pregnant mommy.
[12:46] B: Yeah. To help her, like, transition into being a mom of two and stuff like that. And I can't be there for that either. So that also is something that's like. Because I'm in a program to ensure that I don't have to miss out on any other aspects of life in the Future with them. But it still doesn't make it easier now having to not be there and be here. Along with the timing of my dad's death anniversary and my grandma.
[13:31] A: Yeah. So we've got long term goals, things that I want to have happen in life, and short term pains. Yeah. Right. Because ideally I'd like to be up there. I can't do both. Right. Ideally I want to see her. I'm not sure whether that'll happen or not. Right. I'm also basing my decision based on. I want to lessen the number of those kinds of experiences. Because when you were out in the light and addiction and other kinds of things happening, were you doing all that stuff then too? Were you missing it then?
[14:24] B: Well.
[14:25] A: Or wasn't as important?
[14:27] B: No, I was there and involved. I just, I don't think it. I was there, but I don't think that it was important to me.
[14:40] A: Yeah, yeah. See, now it is.
[14:45] B: Yeah.
[14:45] A: Right. Which means you're getting better. Right? Yeah. Okay, so given that you're in the situation that you're in and you'd like things to move at a faster rate of speed and you'd like to be able to do more of what you want to do. Right. Well, knowing that you've had to put the past in, like, how do you want to be as it pertains to that stuff? Like, how do you want to be feeling right now? There's been a little bit of like frustration and anger or how come I'm not able to do what I want to do when I want to do it?
[15:24] B: Well, I think more or less. How come I have to ask you to be involved with my own family?
[15:31] A: Oh, wouldn't that be good for a lot of people? Do we know that most people's families are pretty fucked up in some way, shape or form? I mean, I try to put the fun in dysfunctional. I mean, do you know that in counseling one of the busiest times of year is right before Thanksgiving? And then in that couple week period of time between Thanksgiving and Christmas, first to prep people for, oh, fuck, I got my family coming over.
[15:59] B: And I'm sure that one day it'll be like that, But I don't know.
[16:07] A: Maybe it's so, I mean, that would make sense. Why as a organization, they kind of put this blanket statement about like, yeah, well, we gotta, like make sure that the people that you're gonna interact with that are family are also safe contacts.
[16:26] B: I mean, it makes sense to me.
[16:28] A: It does. I hear that even though I don't like It.
[16:32] B: Yes.
[16:33] A: Right.
[16:33] B: That's where the problem is, where I.
[16:38] A: You don't like that it's that way right now.
[16:40] B: Yeah.
[16:40] A: Right. And I don't know whether you consider that it being that way is only temporary.
[16:46] B: Yeah, I have.
[16:47] A: Okay. Still not okay.
[16:49] B: No.
[16:50] A: Okay, good.
[16:50] B: Because then, like, cuz then when. When I look at it as a temporary situation, like, I feel like. I feel like I am getting too far ahead of myself. Like, yeah, it's a temporary situation, but even narrower than that, it is the situation, the reality right now, today. So whether it be a temporary situation or not, like, what am I gonna live into next year when I'm able to do all of those things? Because I feel like that's what I did in prison where I was like, okay, year 2020 and I'm gonna be home. So like, my mind and everything, my soul and everything in me was already. Fast forward 10 years into 2020, but my body was way back in 2012 trying to catch up to it. But like, I feel like I disassociated myself with prison where, like, I was already living at home. I was just waiting to catch up.
[17:52] A: Yes.
[17:53] B: And I don't want to do that here. And so I think that that's where, like, my struggle comes in. Because I'm like, well, it would be so much easier for me to just focus on X, Y and Z and getting there if I could just get there. If I could just get there instead of being mindful and intentional and staying present in today, which is. That's.
[18:13] A: Can you not do both? They have to be either or. I can only do that. Or this.
[18:18] B: No, I could do both, but what's.
[18:20] A: The point of having a compelling future? Don't look forward to things that would be fucking sucking.
[18:31] B: No, no. There's no point in trying to put myself too far ahead when I still really need to focus on today. I mean, do I think about when I'll be able to do X, Y and Z? Of course I do. Naturally. And sometimes I get stuck there for way more than an hour and. And I like it. And I sit there. But I.
[19:03] A: Good. Those are dreams and aspirations.
[19:05] B: Yeah.
[19:05] A: There's nothing wrong with having them. No, I know, right? We need to know where we're headed in order to get anywhere.
[19:11] B: Yes.
[19:11] A: I don't know where I'm headed. I'm gonna just be spinning.
[19:14] B: I just don't want to get myself in a comfortable position where I feel.
[19:19] A: Like you don't want to be comfortable. I would hate that too. Whatever you do, don't Actually sit in a comfortable position. Make it the most awkward thing. So it's really hard to stay seated that way the whole time.
[19:32] B: No, no, I am comfortable. I'm comfortable being present.
[19:36] A: You are, which is different.
[19:38] B: I'm uncomfortable with my mind being somewhere else, wishing I was somewhere else.
[19:46] A: Oh, okay.
[19:48] B: Wanting to be somewhere else and not.
[19:51] A: Can you want to be somewhere else and be okay here? Right.
[19:56] B: Two maybe.
[19:58] A: Like, what would it be like for you to be wanting something and still at the same time be okay right where you're at because you're on your way towards it? I don't know. You don't know what it would be like? What if you were already, like, you know, content Right where you're at, on your way to striving towards other things? I mean, you don't know. But would it be okay?
[20:25] B: Yeah.
[20:26] A: Yeah. That sounds like it's okay. Yeah.
[20:29] B: Well, I mean, it would be okay.
[20:31] A: But what wouldn't be okay then about it if it would be okay? You don't know, do you?
[20:48] B: No.
[20:48] A: How's your body feeling now?
[20:51] B: Confused.
[20:52] A: It is, isn't it? You are confused. Right. Because it hasn't been. That you've been able to be content on your way to something else. No, that. Like, you're okay right where you're at. On your way to creating more. We tend to think of. And that's what you did in prison. That's the difference. What you did in prison is. Imagine that you were already at the finished thing. Yes, that was fine in there because it was better to dissociate than actually being there. Yes, Right. But see, we think of that as being the destination. Once I get there, everything's gonna be great. Right. Like, somebody goes, you know, when I finally have my first million in the bank, that's when I'll be feeling secure and happy. And then they get their first million in the bank, and, you know, for a little while they feel secure and happy. And then they go, oh, no, that's not enough.
[21:42] B: A million.
[21:43] A: Right.
[21:44] B: I'm thinking a thousand right now.
[21:45] A: Right. But I mean, think about. People go, my goodness, what? And then they turn it up again, or, I got to get to the next thing. Because we think it's about getting to the next place that'll give me the happiness, the content, feeling the freedom. I wonder what it would be like to be feeling free on your way to being more free.
[22:03] B: I don't know. I have not felt that way.
[22:05] A: Oh.
[22:06] B: At all.
[22:06] A: But you are free. I mean, you're not behind bars, so that definitely Means, Tris, that you're free.
[22:13] B: I am not physically confined.
[22:16] A: You are not confined. That's right. No, you actually sat out there all by yourself. I know, that's right. Right. So you're not actually confined. You're not locked in.
[22:25] B: No.
[22:26] A: You actually can go.
[22:28] B: Yes.
[22:29] A: Anywhere you want. You could leave, but I can't. You could. You don't like the consequences that would come along with leaving.
[22:37] B: Right.
[22:37] A: Do you follow me? So it's not that you could. You're free to freaking grab your shit, go and walk out. Right. You also go. I want something more for me. So doing that is not a good idea.
[22:50] B: Right.
[22:50] A: Not that I couldn't do it. You're actually free to do it. Where, when you were in jail, you couldn't go. All right. That's a fucking sakura.
[22:59] B: I would have got shot.
[23:02] A: Hey, I'm leaving. You can't hold me. Yeah, okay. Whatever.
[23:05] B: Yeah. Yes.
[23:08] A: Right, Right. That's the major difference, because you can leave. You just actually see opportunity for you. And I'm wondering what it would be like to be feeling more content on your way to having more of what you want. Like that you actually get to be content. Now that I'm taking the right steps and the right actions, I'm doing the process. And the coolest part about doing process work, taking right steps and taking right actions, is we know that eventually, we don't know where, when result will happen. Right. The world of electrons, which we're made up of a shitload of. Did you know that?
[23:41] B: Yes.
[23:42] A: Right. The electron, we don't know where it goes when you look at it, because it's so small that the looking of it changes it. It, like, looks like it disappears. It's where Quantum Leap came from. Like, there was a researcher, David Bohm, who wanted to figure out, where does the electron go? He didn't know. He couldn't figure it out. He got frustrated, sat down, and he flipped on the tv, and there was this science guy on the TV doing an experiment for kids. And he had a cylinder that was filled with glycerin and a little rotating thing on one end of it. And he had a droplet of dye, and he just dropped one droplet of dye into the cylinder. And you could see it at top, see through. He then spun it, and that die began to disperse, disappear, and go away. The guy's like, watch. And he rolls it backwards and the die begins to reform into its droplet. But not in the same place that the guy dropped it. A different location, did it again. It was still in a different location. Right. It kept moving, and that's what he wants. Oh, my goodness. That's what happens with electrons. They take leaps. So we know about somebody taking small steps towards something somewhere along the way. We can't know where, and we can't know when there's going to be a leap. And see, what we're wanting for you is to be more content on the way to where you're headed so that you have more ease, more flexibility in getting there. My mom used to tell me a saying. You can have anything that you want for yourself in your life. Anything that you want. You just might not be able to have it all at the same time, but you can really have anything you want for yourself in your life. So we want you to feel more content on your waiting wherever you're headed. Right. Knowing that you are taking steps, head even understanding that in some of the steps, some of what I'm going through, I won't like. Like, I don't like that I can't go see just because I want to. And I don't like that the rest of the family's up there, and I don't like that. But I'm still doing it because I'm taking the steps and actions. What's happening?
[26:04] B: No, to your right.
[26:06] A: Yeah. What's happening in your body right now?
[26:09] B: I don't like it.
[26:11] A: Yeah. Right. Do you have to like something in order for you to be okay?
[26:16] B: No.
[26:17] A: Oh, do you think everything you're always gonna like?
[26:25] B: No.
[26:26] A: Are there certain foods that sometimes somebody cooks something and you don't necessarily like that? Yes. Do you have to, like, force down and eat it?
[26:33] B: No.
[26:34] A: No. You'll try it. Not for me, thanks. Right. So it's that kind of thing. We want you to be more okay in you, even if you don't like that, because you'd like to go see her. And we're also working something up that we don't even know will it be a problem or not. At this stage of the game, we don't know. That's why you put the pass in. But what's been frustrating, right, has been that I've had to put a pass in because I should just be able to go. Right. Except it's not part of the program. So it's like I'm playing basketball, right. And I should be able to running from the out of bounds or. No. No. Because there are different rules for different games. And in basketball, instead of dribbling, I just run with it. Kind of like I'm a Running back in football, I knock through people. No. Right. Different game, different rules. Different game, different rules. You're just playing a different game. I don't like that in Sorry. Somebody can land on me and put me back in the fucking start, think it's bullshit. Or they pick the card and they flip with me. I'm like, fuck you, man. That's crap. But that's part of the game. I don't like that part of it.
[28:00] B: Yeah.
[28:06] A: What's happening now?
[28:09] B: I don't know. What if I think, like, what's hard for me is. What if they tell me no?
[28:19] A: Yeah. What if they tell you no? Yeah.
[28:21] B: What if they tell me no?
[28:23] A: Then what?
[28:26] B: I'm gonna really, like, hate them.
[28:31] A: Because they told you no? Definitely hate the fucking messenger.
[28:35] B: Hate the program.
[28:37] A: Oh, so you won't actually hate the people.
[28:39] B: No.
[28:40] A: Who are charged to enforce what the program says?
[28:46] B: Yes. No, I won't hate the people. I will hate the program in itself and probably be super resentful that I even chose to go to a program that cares about me when I could have just went to a program that doesn't care about me and been able to make my own decisions.
[29:05] A: Maybe. I mean. Cause you should definitely trust all your own decisions because you've always made good ones. I mean, the track record shows. We're gonna go rob somebody. Want to get in the car? Sure. Yes. I'm in. I won't go in, but I'm in.
[29:26] B: No, I know that it sounds ridiculous. Oh, I know, I know. I have literally spent the entire weekend thinking or battling myself with.
[29:40] A: Oh, good. So the part of you. Right. Let's put it into parts. Right. Because there's a part of you that is glad that you're here and knows that you're doing the right thing for you. Right. And then there's a part of you that wants to be able to do whatever you want to do within reason. Okay. Within reason. Right. Like make those kinds of decisions and do what you want.
[30:07] B: Protecting my family.
[30:09] A: Huh? Who's the most healthy as well? No, no, no, they're not, are they?
[30:18] B: No. Right, but they're not.
[30:25] A: But they're not a contributing factor to why you went in the direction you went.
[30:32] B: No.
[30:32] A: Oh, they are, aren't they a contributing factor?
[30:36] B: No, they were all my decisions.
[30:38] A: Yes, but see, to be in the position that you could even make the decisions that you make, they had to lack in their decisions, come from where they were like, you know, I mean, there's going to be a certain set of options that are available for somebody who's born in East Africa. Different than the options that are available to somebody who's born in lower west side of Chicago. Different than somebody who's born in, you know, upper Manhattan.
[31:03] B: Yes. Okay. Yeah. So then family was a contributing factor to, you know, positions that I was placed in in my life at a young age. Yeah, yeah.
[31:28] A: And you want to see grandma.
[31:29] B: Yeah.
[31:30] A: You do. I know. Right, right. And see the anger that's somewhat misplaced is on programming, not on grandma. Cuz we understand grandma. 20 bucks is hardship. Could you pay it? How would they let you pay it for grandma? Oh, cause it's gotta come from grandma. Right.
[32:02] B: Well, I didn't put her as a safe contact because she would never be able to make the drive. I would never, I never thought I'd be able to.
[32:16] A: When is the anniversary by the way?
[32:18] B: Next month.
[32:19] A: Okay.
[32:20] B: February 16th.
[32:22] A: Oh good, look at you. You're not like waiting until the 14th going, I want to go do this thing.
[32:28] B: No, I'm an over a cheer probably.
[32:33] A: Uh huh. Right. She didn't put her on there. But now you are.
[32:42] B: No, I put in a pass. I put in a pass for my case manager to take me and I put seeing her on the pass despite the fact that she is not a safe contact.
[33:00] A: Okay. Could they make her one?
[33:03] B: I'm sure that they could make her one. I don't know exactly what her life is looking like right now.
[33:13] A: Okay.
[33:14] B: I haven't been in contact with her. I don't even know if you know, she would want me to come see her. I mean, I feel like I know that if I was allowed to come and visit her, she would be willing and you know, she would want to see me. I know that she would want to, but I have not even made contact with her about, about seeing her or like going to my dad's site where his cross is or anything. So like I haven't made any solid plans with anybody and I don't know if she would be able to do the background check because it cost $20.
[34:08] A: But we don't know whether you could pay for it for her.
[34:12] B: No, I'm sure that they would not want me to pay for it because that's codependent.
[34:29] A: I don't know whether it is or not. I mean, so there's a bunch of unknowns.
[34:37] B: Yeah.
[34:38] A: Cause you haven't even checked with grandma.
[34:40] B: No.
[34:41] A: As to whether she would be wanting you to stop by or not. You have no idea. Isn't that interesting? Yeah.
[34:52] B: Well, I don't want to make Plans if I'm not allowed to. You know, if the program's gonna say no, I don't. I don't want to make plans.
[35:04] A: How can the program know until we have contact with Grandma?
[35:07] B: Well, I won't contact Grandma until I know that I'm allowed to. Why would I make plans with Grandma if I'm not gonna be.
[35:14] A: Why would I have to be contacting Grandma to make plans.
[35:18] B: So that she knows I'm coming to her house?
[35:20] A: Why wouldn't you just have contact with Grandma and then after you've had contact with Grandma, you can talk to her about.
[35:28] B: Cause I. Well, there's a process for safe contacts, and I've had my safe contacts in since the second week that I was in Selah. And they do it on a. Like, they want you to form and bond with one person and then they'll introduce the second person, and then they'll introduce the third person, and then they'll introduce however long your list of people is. And I'm still waiting for my sister to be approved and she's been in for over three months. So add my grandma onto that list. She's still at the end of the list.
[36:10] A: Maybe.
[36:12] B: But.
[36:23] A: There'S a good breath. What's happening now? Right, that. Well, what is it that you're saying to yourself or seeing as you're feeling.
[36:45] B: This right now, that nothing makes sense?
[36:53] A: Nothing. How so? I want to get it. What hasn't been making sense when you say nothing. What's one or two of the things that haven't been making sense.
[37:15] B: Why.
[37:18] A: I.
[37:18] B: Can'T make her a safe contact?
[37:22] A: I'm thinking that there's a lot of ambiguity going on, a lot of mind read of things that you don't actually know with certainty yet.
[37:31] B: Well, yeah, I feel like I need to get my ducks in a row before I make plans. So that's why I put in the pass a month early to see if it's even a possibility, if it's a possibility for me.
[37:44] A: And we're waiting on that right now? Yeah. Oh, that's all we're doing is waiting. Find out what they say, and then based on what they say, they'll be other things for you to do?
[37:59] B: I don't know.
[38:01] A: Well, there will automatically be other things for you to do, probably because if.
[38:06] B: They say or there won't be. If they say no, then.
[38:09] A: Well, there's different things for you to do then. If they say no.
[38:16] B: Like what?
[38:17] A: Well, they would be different than the things that you would be doing if they said yes.
[38:20] B: Yeah, I'd be doing nothing.
[38:23] A: Well, if they said yes, you'd probably be contacting Grandma and checking in. Hey, Grandma, I'm planning on coming up. Would it be okay to stop by and see you? That would be different. That would be based on them saying it's okay. If they didn't say it's okay, then a different step might be. Well, I want to understand how come and what are other things that I can be doing to kind of move this. What don't I know that you guys do that would help me. That would be different actions based on different things that you're told. If I'm understanding what's been happening to you is that you're seeing the worst outcome and feeling bad about it now as you see it, preparing. I don't think that that's actually preparing you because you feel the shitty right now. There's a couple times that you already felt shitty right in here with me just thinking about it. I don't think that that's preparing. I don't think you're gonna do better going through it already, having felt shitty about it.
[39:34] B: It's a grieving process.
[39:36] A: See, I don't think that that's gonna make you feel better. Yes, let's grieve loss that I haven't had yet because I might have it.
[39:42] B: Yeah.
[39:45] A: Because if I do have it, then I'll at least feel like I'm handling it better because I've had preparation for it. Yeah.
[39:52] B: No, I feel like it won't slow me down if I'm already prepared.
[39:55] A: Yeah. Yeah. Or it doesn't really help now.
[40:01] B: Yeah. Or it just slows me down until I find out that I can't. And then I put myself back together and move forward.
[40:10] A: Because you have different actions based on. So you're in the, I don't know, phase. Oh. And you like to be in control. That's the problem, right?
[40:22] B: Well, I don't know. I've never had control now that I.
[40:24] A: I don't know whether that's true.
[40:26] B: Well, I mean.
[40:32] A: I don't feel like.
[40:33] B: I've ever had a true.
[40:34] A: Oh, really? You didn't have control of you in prison not being the person that kind of was in the spotlight, kind of be the one that you don't, like, notice? Isn't that what you did to make it through? And you didn't have control of having a vision of someday being outside of those walls? Kind of like the guy who wrote the Man's Search for Meaning in the Nazi Prison camps. You had a Wonderful tool, Trish, that got you through awful shit at prison. And not without different scars. Because we know the cutting. We know the other shit. When you were really, really troubled. Right? When it was feeling like the longest part of it, like, we got all that stuff. But you had a really useful tool, which was envision a better future for yourself. Envision a time that I'm out of here and kinda like, feel all of that to be free. Right.
[41:38] B: Well.
[41:41] A: And didn't you do it? Get to be free? Cause you freely chose. Nobody forced you. Misty wasn't like, with your arm behind your bag, you're gonna come here. Making you get there. Come on. She wasn't doing anything like that, was she? No. So you freely chose to be in a program. And sometimes we don't like the rules. I think the horsey in chess should be able to move more than an L. It would be better if it could.
[42:20] B: I love the game, Jess.
[42:22] A: But the horse, he should be able to have a different move than just the.
[42:26] B: He can jump. It's still kind of cool. Yeah, I know. But.
[42:39] A: You know what's happening now?
[42:47] B: I don't know.
[42:48] A: You don't know. But how's your body feeling?
[42:59] B: Out of excuses.
[43:02] A: So what do you think the part that's having you be troubled, what do you think that part's highest positive intention is for you? The part that's causing you to feel upset over maybe not being able to do what I want to do? What's the highest positive intention in that part?
[43:24] B: I don't feel like it has very many high positive intentions.
[43:28] A: It wouldn't be doing it if it didn't have something positive and beneficial for you. Your brain doesn't create things to do just to fuck with you. I am. Its number one job is to beat your heart and breathe for you. But the highest positive intention of that part.
[43:52] B: I don't know.
[43:54] A: I flip it around. What's the hidden benefit from being on edge? The hidden benefit of the part that's causing you to have all the bad feelings around. What if I'm not able to do what I want to do? Well, better yet, take the part out of you and we'll put the part. Take it and put it over there. And then ask the part, what's your highest positive intention for me? Ask that part what it wants for you. Cause it's got a voice. It can tell you. Check in with the part. Pass that part over there. Right. What it wants for you.
[44:52] B: I don't know. I just want to be in control, I guess.
[44:55] A: Yeah. Aren't you more in control now than you were? Yes, you are right on your way to having even more. That you're gonna be able to decide what you wanna do, when you wanna do it and what's best and right for you. That's where you're headed, isn't it?
[45:21] B: Yeah. But am I not capable?
[45:24] A: Are you not capable?
[45:26] B: Yeah.
[45:30] A: Good. Got the feeling right. Now Close your eyes and let that feeling take you back. Let the feeling tone guide you back. Let the feeling tone grow you earlier and younger. Back. Back towards one of the first times you had that kind of feeling. What is it that's coming to mind now?
[46:16] B: I don't think I've ever even.
[46:19] A: What's it takes you towards.
[46:30] B: I'm just thinking about being a kid.
[46:33] A: Yeah. Good. Let's think of a time when you were a kid. You're doing great. What is something that might have happened. Has the same kind of feeling tones. So you might have been a kid. Older than five? Younger than five?
[46:56] B: Probably younger.
[46:57] A: Younger than five.
[46:58] B: I don't even remember feeling good.
[47:00] A: Make it up the time that I was ever kid. It could have happened. Hey, what's the experience that's coming to mind now?
[47:22] B: I was left home.
[47:26] A: Yeah. So you might have been how old? I don't know.
[47:31] B: The thing that's ringing for me is I was probably like 9 or 10. And I was babysitting.
[47:40] A: That's right.
[47:43] B: Kylie and I. She was just a baby.
[47:46] A: Yes.
[47:47] B: And I dropped her.
[47:48] A: That's right. You had her in your arms and you dropped her.
[47:52] B: I was playing with her and I dropped her.
[47:53] A: Right, Right. Good. You dropped her. Right. And then what happened? She cried.
[47:58] B: She was bleeding.
[47:59] A: Right. Good. That was scary.
[48:01] B: Through her front lip.
[48:02] A: Yes. Good job. Good detail on what happened.
[48:05] B: And then mom came home.
[48:08] A: And then mom came home. Right. And then what happened?
[48:11] B: She was really upset.
[48:12] A: That's right. She was upset. Right. And then what happened next? And be here.
[48:16] B: Hi.
[48:17] A: With me. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Right. Then what happened next?
[48:20] B: She brought Kylie to the hospital.
[48:22] A: That's right. Good. And then what happened?
[48:26] B: I was in trouble.
[48:27] A: We were in trouble. Right. And mom might have hit you or spanked you or you got grounded or. She was just mad.
[48:35] B: Yeah, she was mad.
[48:36] A: Right. And then that ended. Kylie came back. Right. And then that moment was over. And then later on you did something more fun like get out of prison. It was way more fun in that moment. Right. Good. But something else you've done that's fun in your life after that.
[48:56] B: Goss, there's so much.
[48:59] A: Yeah. What's something else. Yeah. Going to the beach was more fun than that. Right. One other.
[49:14] B: Roller coaster.
[49:15] A: Yeah, riding a roller coaster. So we got riding the roller coaster. We got going to the beach, we got getting out of prison. Right. And then before that, like, mom was mad, then they'd come back from the hospital, then she'd taken her to the hospital and then she'd come home and then you tried to, like, clean things up and then she was bleeding and then she'd fell and then you were playing with her. Then before that you were left to babysit an infant at nine. Right. And before that you were doing whatever you're doing. And again, I go backwards compared to when you told it to me emotionally, how was it? You can remember that happening and mom being mad and her falling. You can remember putting your jean shorts on. Trish, stop putting on your jean shorts. Well, stop dropping her. Well, then you stop putting on your sweatshirt.
[50:04] B: I'm not.
[50:04] A: Well, then stop mom from being angry. She's not. Well, stop mom from being that way. Say she's not being that way. Yes, but then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Right. And did you do it on purpose? Look, cute little baby. No, you didn't. Right? And don't accidents happen? Right? I mean, is it really good to leave your nine with an infant year old? Oh, right. Should I give. Should I be pissed at my daughter when she was six and I gave her the key to the car that she fucking lost it at the amusement park? She got a spankin. Oh, or is it a bad idea that I gave her my keys? Right. Which Mom's anger may have been more at herself than you just got directed to you. Right. Oh, and you were capable enough to be there. Oh, and you know what the other you didn't know is how capable she is and making it through prison. Cause, you know, that's easy. Everything goes smoothly there, Right? Right. And you're capable of making good decisions for you, aren't you?
[51:29] B: Yeah.
[51:30] A: Yeah, you are. Right. So I wonder what it would be like if the younger you learned how capable you really are. That you made it through. You did it on your own too, right? You relied on you. Could you rely on others? No. You could form allegiances, but like, you still took care of you got it. Right? So close your eyes. Think back to the. You let that, you know, a. That that moment is over, finished. That it no longer exists. Let her know that mom being mad had more to do with mom being mad at herself than you. It just got taken out on you that it was on mom that she left you and that was an accident. Right. Let that you know how capable you really are. Let her know that Kylie's okay, her lips are okay, her teeth are okay. So that the younger you get that she's okay, that you're becoming more okay. Let her know how capable you are of making it through difficult stuff and things that you don't always want to have to do. But you do make it through it. Right. And as all of that is getting in, what do you notice now happening to the earlier you? Yeah. Not a good news thing. Right. So try to feel not capable. We'll try to feel not capable.
[53:20] B: I can't feel incapable.
[53:22] A: Right. Isn't that weird? So before you were saying that I never felt capable. Huh? Cause that was the only time mom left you with an infant. Oh, right. Even after that she left you with an infant. Right. Because you're capable. Right. What do we learn from mistakes?
[53:50] B: That we're capable.
[53:52] A: Yeah. That I would do something else this time. Huh. Didn't know that. Won't go that way. Right. And you know the best kind of learning that gets really installed is when it's learning that I do versus watching somebody else learning. Watching somebody else will give me stuff too. But it's better when I get it myself.
[54:17] B: Yeah.
[54:17] A: Right.
[54:18] B: It's getting easier to watch other people make mistakes though.
[54:21] A: Right.
[54:24] B: Learn from theirs.
[54:25] A: Right. Too. Right. And you're getting separate from them. Right. So just check. How's your body feeling now? It is. And think about the steps that you're going through. What do you notice?
[54:45] B: I can do this step by step.
[54:51] A: That's right. Nobody signs up for difficult things just because they like to do difficult things. Even my wife, who I thought was crazy, signed up for a calculus class that was a four day a week class that was at 8am Fuck does that? She didn't do it because it was gonna be. She did it because she likes math.
[55:23] B: Yeah.
[55:24] A: Right. Right. And different things will push and pull and we get to grow. Right. Right now you're just getting connected more to your resources. Yeah. Right. Because your body's more in congruent with you right now. Right. And you are taking the steps and actions and you do have what you need already inside of you. Prior to going to jail, could you possibly conceive of all of the things about jail that you experienced knowing it ahead of time? Just like when somebody has a baby, no matter how much they've learned and what they've read, can they really get it? What it does that. It changes things. Right. Right. You're learning, always changing, and you're on your way to being better. Right. And having a life that's more fulfilling, that's working better for you. Yeah. Ah. So what are you noticing now? I'm capable. Uh huh. Right. Huh. As it pertains to Grandma, what are you noticing now?
[57:11] B: I'm doing what I can.
[57:16] A: Yeah.
[57:16] B: Taking the steps.
[57:18] A: Yeah. Huh. And programming. Just, you know, does what they do just to like, kind of fuck with you.
[57:33] B: My thoughts exactly.
[57:36] A: They're doing what they're doing because they want to help you get more of what you want and become a better version of you. For you. Yeah. Cool. So how you feeling now?
[58:02] B: Capable.
[58:03] A: Huh.
[58:07] B: I mean, I still have this overwhelming sense of tenacity to push for what I want.
[58:28] A: Yes. Doesn't that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Right. And that's what there is for you to do.
[58:48] B: Doing what I can do.
[58:50] A: That's right. Because you're capable. Awesome. You did great today.
[58:59] B: Thanks.
[59:01] A: We'll stop with that for now.
[59:04] B: Just one more question.
[59:05] A: Oh, okay.
[59:06] B: Is control a bad thing?
[59:10] A: Well. So my saying goes this. Anything less than letting go wouldn't be total control when you're feeling free. Anything less than letting go wouldn't be total control when you're feeling free. And are you not in control of your feeling free life? I cannot control all the external variables. I cannot know. Life is nonlinear. So instead, what I want is that I have what I need to move through whatever might come my way. Then I don't have to be worried about the future anymore because I have what I need. I'll do what shows up when it shows up. That's what there is.
[59:57] B: I feel like that most times.
[59:58] A: Yeah, I know you do feel like that most times. You just weren't with this.
[60:05] B: Yes.
[60:06] A: That's why we wanted to get it connected. Because again, it's not that you didn't have the resources you do. Right. And you still want to be tenacious at getting what you want because that can drive you. If it's not this, then I'll go over here. If it's not that, then I'll go right. I keep moving to get more and more. Right. Yeah.
[60:33] B: All right.
[60:33] A: You did great.
[60:35] B: Thank you.
[60:35] A: You're welcome.
[61:02] B: I went to the mall last weekend and I saw this store that sells shirts.
[61:13] A: Yes, that's it. All right.
[61:17] B: See you next time.
[61:18] A: Bye. It.
[62:18] B: In your room.
[62:19] A: Oh, you did?
[62:22] B: Yeah.
[62:27] A: No. Yep. You did.
[62:30] B: Texas Probes.
[62:32] A: Yeah. Don't want to lose this.
[62:34] B: No, thank you.
[62:35] A: Okay. See you.
[62:36] B: See you.
[69:35] A: Hi, yes, is Megan there, please? Hi, Megan, this is Dr. Quintel. I had gotten a message to give you a call. Is this an. Oh, that's it. Okay. It was about my kids, not anything else. Oh, how good. All right, thank you very much. Okay, bye. Bye. It's Sa. Hi, Hassan, it's Dr. Quintel. How are you? Sure, I can call you back at three. Is that better? No worries. Okay, talk to you then. Bye. Bye. It's.
