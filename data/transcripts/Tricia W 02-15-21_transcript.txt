[00:00] A: All right, so today is the 15th of February, Trish. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful and valuable, it may be made in teaching and training other professionals and how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:17] B: Yes.
[00:17] A: All right. So what are we wanting our time to do for you? How can I be of assistance? What would be useful for me to know?
[00:27] B: Well, so I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure the reason for my scheduled visit today is because I had a incident, I guess, last week, or not an incident, but it was pretty. I don't know. Anyways, I was triggered by a conversation that I had with one of the advocates because she kept questioning me about this money that I have saved in my mom's savings account, which I've never told anybody about it because I didn't see. Well, there wasn't a relevant time to talk about it. Like, it wasn't something brought up in conversation. And so I'm about to start education, and I wanted to establish my college courses on a laptop that I own, and we could just start like that. So, anyways, in the phase that I'm in, I felt like it was an appropriate time for me to ask to use the money that I have saved up to purchase a laptop for education and also my future life that I have ahead of me. And so they were a little concerned about this money because, A, they had never heard about it before, and B, I guess there have been some incidences in the past where it was considered, like, dirty money or things like that, which is understandable. But in the midst of being questioned about it, I felt interrogated. And I was like, are you asking me all of these questions about this money because of my past or why I'm here? Like, why I'm in a human trafficking program? And, you know, their response, of course, was no. But then they continue to ask, like, who gave me this money and how do I have this money and all kinds of things. And then they wanted the exact amount and if my mom would be willing to verify that she has it. And I was like, all of this is irrelevant. I mean, my mom would be willing, but I don't know. So then I ended up talking to the coordinators about it, and I talked to Christine about it in therapy. And, you know, I feel like it does go back to me being in the relationship I was in with Clyde for so long and him always having control over my whole entire life, and me finally choosing to take control of my own life without him in it. And now I'm, like, still being questioned about my savings that I have and everything else in my life.
[03:29] A: Everything.
[03:30] B: That's dramatic, but that's where it goes, right? Yeah. So I'm pretty sure that that's why I'm here.
[03:43] A: Okay, well, how are you with all of that? Because that happened. You had the conversation with the advocate that caused, like, discomfort, and you were kind of like, why are you even wanting to know all this information? And that felt uncomfortable. And then you talk to coordinators about it, and then you talk to Christine. So how are you with all of that now?
[04:06] B: I'm feeling. I'm feeling better because I understand where they're coming from, that things might have occurred with past residents and, you know, things out of my control and why it would raise maybe yellow flags for. For them. They've never heard about it before, but I feel like we were all on the same page with, like, there was no relevance to knowing that information until now when I wanted to do something with it. And, I mean, I don't feel like I'm being accused of anything. I just think there are moments sometimes where I'm reminded that I'm an assistant. And that's, like, what triggers me, because I just want. I want to be able to.
[05:05] A: Take.
[05:06] B: Control of my own life. And, like, if I want to buy a laptop with money that I have saved up, I don't see why it's a big deal. So that's where I'm at.
[05:19] A: So that statement, right, I have money saved up to buy a laptop. It shouldn't be a big deal to use it on. That is a completely separate thing. Then what got triggered about, quote, unquote, being in a system? Yeah, right. Which do you know, that will never.
[05:38] B: Be out of, in a sense.
[05:42] A: I mean, we are all in a system. You know, in America, we pay taxes, and depending on where you live, you may have both federal and state. We don't here in Florida, but in other states they do. And that's part of the system that we all have to pay into. So the idea of systems, it was in. Not feeling free.
[06:13] B: No, I think it was just in, like, feeling like I'm not in control of my life still.
[06:25] A: How are you not in control of your life?
[06:29] B: I always have to ask somebody, like, even growing up with Clyde, having control over everything, always had to ask him or turn to him or look to him. And now I'm in a program to get Away from him. But it's like now I have to turn to them and look to them and ask them. And I mean, the only difference is with Clyde, you know, I could send him a text message or a phone call. With the program, I have to put a pass in eight days in advance, so I really have to think ahead to ask them.
[07:18] A: So that's what it's doing, isn't it?
[07:20] B: Yeah.
[07:21] A: Causing all that.
[07:22] B: Yeah.
[07:23] A: And there's lots of, like, similar. Same. Yeah. Okay. Even if at a different level, you realize this is different.
[07:32] B: Yeah. I mean, logically, I know it's different.
[07:34] A: Oh, okay. Damn. Logic and emotion. Why don't they match?
[07:40] B: I know.
[07:41] A: Be much easier if they did. Yeah. Match more frequently. It would be, wouldn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Like a lot easier. Okay. So that's what's been kinda triggered.
[07:55] B: Yeah.
[07:56] A: Okay.
[07:57] B: But it also kind of like ties into. Tomorrow. I go in, I'm going with one of the coordinators, Madeline, to my dad's rec site because tomorrow it's been two years since he died, and the first time that I'm like, doing something commemorative for him. And I put the pass in a month ago with a safe contact for my grandma because she lives in the same area and I really wanted to see her. And I haven't been able to see her since before I went to prison. She visited me in county jail, but then other than that, we've just stayed in contact through writing. And I haven't been able to make it over there because I don't have transportation, my own transportation. And now I'm in a program and I can't go over there as often as I would want to. And so anyways, I wanted to be able to go commemorate my dad and then maybe like, spend some time with my grandma. And I feel like the program has waited till last minute to safe contact my grandma and she's still not safe contacted. So tomorrow I will not be hanging out with her. And I'm like. Because I'm in this program and I have to ask, and I do ask, and I gave him a whole month to do it. And she's not safe contacted and I'm not gonna be able to see her. That's kind of frustrating.
[10:03] A: Just kinda.
[10:05] B: Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of frustrating. I say kind of because I know that it's not, like, life altering.
[10:13] A: Yes.
[10:13] B: So I say kind of.
[10:16] A: It's kind of very frustrating. Yeah, Kind of very frustrating. Right?
[10:22] B: Yeah.
[10:22] A: Yeah. Okay. Okay. So is there some discouragement that I'm hearing as well? Like okay. Like, I've made it through steps and I'm jumping through hoops and I'm doing these things and I still haven't.
[10:39] B: Yeah, well, no, I mean, I guess the discouragement would come from me doing all the things that I have to do or all that I can do. Like, I did all that I could do and then gave it to them. And there was an unexpected something that happened in Selah. So who was originally gonna bring me and do all these things tomorrow doesn't work for Sayla anymore. And so it kind of, like, put a pause, so to speak, on the situation. And we've been kind of figuring out, like, who's gonna bring me tomorrow and how it's gonna happen. So it was all figured out because.
[11:30] A: Dad's thing is fairly close to where Grandma lives now. Yeah, Got it. Yeah.
[11:36] B: Just a couple streets away. But now that now she's. Well, she's still not safe contacted. So that's not on the plans for tomorrow. But I don't know where I was going with all this, but. But it's all tied up together, like, the frustration of both and having to be. I think it's just where I'm at in the program right now. Like, I feel like.
[12:08] A: I don't know that.
[12:10] B: Yes.
[12:12] A: You feel like that.
[12:13] B: Yes.
[12:14] A: Right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Based on where you are in the program. Yeah. Okay. Okay.
[12:25] B: Yeah. I'm halfway through, and I think that we've had a conversation about being halfway through something where the end looks much further away than the beginning.
[12:39] A: Yeah. Isn't that weird? No. How that works?
[12:43] B: Well, it's weird how it works, but.
[12:46] A: It is weird how it works. You would think, like, I'd be feeling better because I'm closer.
[12:50] B: Yeah. I'm not.
[12:52] A: I'm still feeling stuck because I've been at it. And when we're in that part, we're not towards the end, but we're not back at the beginning where we have all the fresh hope of what it's going to be. So we're in the mode.
[13:12] B: Yeah.
[13:12] A: Of things. Okay. Okay. So I'm following you about the whole grandma and this and the not a safe contact and not being able to see her even though she's close to where dad is and that you did the stuff there was for you to do. The person who had been in charge of taking you there is no longer an employee. So that had to get flip changed around. You're still going to do something in honor of dad, and that part's cool. But, like, this not happening. And Then feeling like they were asking me where I got the money from and felt like I was in the same situation that I had growing up with Clyde. Okay, so that's what I'm understanding so far.
[13:53] B: Even though I logically know that I'm not. Yeah. It doesn't matter.
[14:00] A: Right out of what I said though. Is there anything that I missed?
[14:05] B: No.
[14:07] A: Okay. Anything else that you think would be useful for me to know, to understand?
[14:15] B: No, not that I can think of.
[14:17] A: Okay. Okay. So given where you are and given what has transpired and it's not how you want it to be, and that it triggered that kind of discomfort feeling like they're all tied together, like, how do you actually want to be? Like, if that was no longer an issue and maybe the stuff that had gotten tied together was able to be untied and unwound, so now they're separate, how would you actually be.
[14:50] B: Fine?
[14:53] A: What's it like when you feel fine for you?
[15:01] B: I think just being able to make my own decisions and not having to ask for permission.
[15:13] A: Well, are you not making your own decisions?
[15:15] B: Well, yeah, I'm making my own decisions, but ultimately I'm not. Because I have to depend on people to make my decisions possible. Like I get to make the decision, but then they're ultimately in control of whether or not I get to follow through with the decision that I'm making for myself. Are you keeping up?
[15:45] A: I'm trying. That was a good one right there. That was a tongue twister.
[15:51] B: No, it's so complicated.
[15:54] A: That's why we want to get it all unwound.
[15:56] B: Yeah.
[15:56] A: Because it's all been tied together. Right. And when it's unwound, we get to like, see it clearly for the different pieces. Yeah. Cause you get at one level, this is not that, but because it's all tied together, it feels like it has been. This is that.
[16:15] B: Yeah. It makes me very defensive.
[16:17] A: Uh huh. And when you're defensive, what do you think that does to somebody else?
[16:25] B: Well, it makes them defensive.
[16:26] A: Does it?
[16:28] B: Well, it doesn't make them.
[16:29] A: Or does it like have them question why she's so defensive? What is she hiding?
[16:34] B: Well, yeah, I'm sure.
[16:36] A: Which is if I don't have anything in my phone and my wife says to me, well, let me see your phone. And I don't actually have anything. I hand it over.
[16:45] B: You wouldn't say why?
[16:47] A: If. Well, watch. Watch what happens. Right. I could do that and I could hand it over and she does whatever she does with it. Right. If I'm getting offended that she's even asking me to see what's in my phone. Why you want to look at my phone? I don't have anything in it. But why do you want to look at it? Because I just want to. What does the effect of me being defensive in that way have on her? What are you really hiding?
[17:17] B: Okay, but what if you're like.
[17:19] A: Like, I mean, in that example, right? You follow me with that?
[17:21] B: Yeah. Yeah. But what if you're like, why do you want to see my phone while you're handing the phone over? I feel like that's what I have to do.
[17:32] A: Oh.
[17:34] B: Like, I'm like, okay, here's the information, but why is that relevant?
[17:39] A: Hmm.
[17:43] B: And here's who gave me the money? But why is that relevant?
[17:48] A: Oh. Cause you didn't.
[17:49] B: Because you don't trust me.
[17:50] A: Because you didn't have the context. Oh, you think it's about you again?
[17:54] B: Well, yeah.
[17:55] A: Cause would it be you or just anybody else in programming that they would do the same thing with?
[17:59] B: I don't know.
[18:00] A: Oh, you don't? You don't, do you? Hmm. Isn't that weird?
[18:05] B: Yeah.
[18:06] A: But, like, would it be, you know, if somebody else in programming said, hey, by the way, I've got this money? What money? Well, this money that I have in this special account. You have a special account with your mom? Oh, yeah. Well, I never came up because, like, it, like, never showed up as a thing to have in conversation until, like, I need to use the money to buy something that I want.
[18:25] B: Right.
[18:25] A: Welcome. You haven't told us that you had this special account. Well, because it wasn't there to tell. Right. So now we're down this freaking rabbit hole. Yeah.
[18:32] B: Well, that's exactly the first conversation and how it happened.
[18:37] A: That was literally beautiful. Right. So would that have mattered? Or there's you, Trish, or somebody else in program.
[18:45] B: No. But I guess my thing is I don't think about anybody else in programming. I'm thinking about me in programming.
[18:54] A: That's right. Because it is my world, and everybody else lives in it. They do not operate the way I want them to. Damn it.
[19:01] B: What? In this journey that I'm on right now. Yeah. It is about me, is it not? Should it not be?
[19:12] A: I don't know. How does it feel when it's always about you?
[19:16] B: Well, great. For once in my life, I feel like I have spent a lot of time focusing on everybody else.
[19:29] A: Yeah.
[19:30] B: Yeah. I took care of everybody.
[19:35] A: Me, too.
[19:36] B: No, everybody else in my world at that time, I'm not me.
[19:42] A: Well, maybe not everybody you might have taken care of, like some or several or lots even. Yeah, but not everybody. Not all and every.
[19:53] B: Not everybody.
[19:54] A: I mean, those are like blanket statements. It's like never. It's hard to be 100% right. What would it be like for you to feel more free?
[20:07] B: I don't know.
[20:08] A: You don't know, huh? Because if this wasn't troubling to you, like, it has been. Because it's been really troubling, hasn't it? I mean, even right now, as you're thinking about it, aren't you feeling some of it?
[20:26] B: Yeah.
[20:27] A: Yeah, Right. And this feeling that you're feeling right now, this feeling isn't new, is it?
[20:34] B: No.
[20:35] A: Oh, okay. But if you weren't feeling it anymore, how would you actually be?
[20:46] B: Who knows?
[20:48] A: Who knows? It's hard to get there when you're in it. Did you know that?
[20:52] B: Yeah. Cause I don't think I've ever been out of it.
[20:54] A: Oh, no. I mean, in the feeling of it.
[20:57] B: Yeah, that's right.
[20:58] A: You actually haven't been feeling this way all the time?
[21:01] B: Well, no, not all the time. But everything ends up feeling like this.
[21:04] A: Not everything.
[21:05] B: Most things.
[21:07] A: But see, you know what? So good. It's nice to see you. What I was saying is it's really hard to get out of it when you're in it, because you're in it. I don't know whether that's true, because there's times that you're not feeling this way. See, it's really hard to see how I would be different in not feeling this way when I'm actually in the feeling of it. Right. Because different bands of information exist at different states. And when I'm in the problem, guess what? There is nothing called a solution in it. Because when we're in a problem state, the issue is that we're not connected to the resources, not that I actually don't have them, and not that there aren't different ways that I felt, acted, reacted, thought in life. It's that in this state there are no solutions. That's why we try to ask why when we're in those states, but it doesn't ever solve it when I ask why, because it just leads to another kind of thing. That's why my statement is, when you're in a house that's on fire and there are flames all around you, is it a good idea to try to figure out why? No. No better idea to get out of the house. If once you're out of the house, you want to go back to discover. Fine. But we gotta get you into the right state first. Right? Cause if this stuff was no longer an issue and you weren't feeling trapped and it wasn't feeling like you were being controlled, like, if that was no longer going on for you, how would you actually be? Oh, darn it. Turn OFF phone.
[22:46] B: I don't know.
[22:48] A: I don't know. Do you?
[22:49] B: No.
[22:50] A: Huh? What if you did? Like, how much better would things be?
[22:54] B: I would know better.
[22:56] A: You would know better. Right. Right. So first we want to start thinking of, like, this feeling that you've been having isn't a new feeling. And when you're having it, it feels like I have it all the time and everything leads to it. Right. Except when you're not having that feeling, you don't think that way at all. Right? So it's just when you're in the problem, right? So we want you out of it. So they get to connect to your resources and be more the way that you want to be. Right. Which is free. See, what's the opposite? Just think of that for a moment. What's the opposite of the way that you've been feeling? This whole, like, controlled and, like, I've got to tell everybody and, like, I'm not really able to make my own choices. Except you did make the global choice. It's kind of like if I go to work for somebody, I make the choice to work for them. Now, they might be interviewing me too, and they're gonna choose to hire me, but I'm also choosing to work for them. Like, I don't have to if I don't want to. But there may be certain requirements. When I worked as a bellman at a hotel, do you know what one of the requirements was? No facial hair. At all. You couldn't have it. Well, what if I like having a little bit of a. Well, not in that job. Well, is there any real problem with this? Like, I don't get to be my own individual me, because, like, you know, well. But I'm choosing to take on that job. And as a result, that's one of the things that they have as part of that job. In the same way the military, like, somebody joins the military to fight for freedom. Do you know what happens when you're in the military? No fucking freedom. You are not free. You sign a contract that you are theirs for however long you signed the contract for. You can re up, or once the contract's over, you can get out. But while you're there, if they say, hey, we need you to Go clean that. You can't go. Fuck no, I don't want to clean that. You can think it, but you gotta go over and clean that. Right? And if they say get down and give me 20 push ups. No, no, I'm gonna get six in. No, no, you better do. Right. Like there is no. It's the. It's the. We'll call it an oxymoron, which is like. Right, right. Like I'm fighting for freedom, but while fighting for freedom, I'm not free. Something about this doesn't seem quite right. But that's part of where we are with this kind of thing, right? So in the overall global part, there is like the choice that I made to enter this program that's got these structures that sometimes these structures make no f. Cking sense to me. I don't know why it's gotta be this way. And because of what I've gone through, some of that eerily reminds me of what it was like with other shit. And that makes it worse, right? We want you to be free from the effect of the other shit. So that you actually see this is different than that. Which again, at a logical level, you somewhat know that it's not quite the same, is it? Right. So what would it be like? That's why I'm thinking maybe part of the opposite of being controlled would be free. Or the other part is anything less than letting go wouldn't be total control when you're feeling free. And are you not in control of your feeling free? That's a weird question, huh?
[26:26] B: Freedom is a mindset.
[26:28] A: I don't know whether it is fully a mindset, but what if you were more in control of your feeling free by letting go?
[26:43] B: I mean, I feel like ultimately I do.
[26:45] A: Oh, good, let go. Except kind of reluctantly and angrily.
[26:50] B: Yeah, it's kind of grudgingly. Absolutely.
[26:54] A: So how free is that? It's grudgingly free or not free at all then? If it's grudgingly, it's grudgingly.
[27:03] B: I feel like it's kind of.
[27:09] A: So part of what we want. Like the you that I'm seeing, this stuff has been untangled and untied so that we see separate is separate and different is different, even if there are some similarities. Got it. The you that I am seeing is free to know that she's choosing programming and this particular model of programming on her way to becoming even more free to have even more of a life that she wants. Which is why she actually wants to buy a laptop, you know, for now and later. Correct. Right. And probably will do some research into which one will support me now and later. Right. And if that means I might spend a little bit more so that I have something that will support, then I might do that. Right.
[28:02] B: But it's not up to me.
[28:03] A: Oh, it isn't?
[28:04] B: No.
[28:04] A: Oh. Who's it up to?
[28:06] B: The program.
[28:07] A: Oh. How do you know?
[28:08] B: Because they have to confirm or deny whether I can get it or not Now?
[28:14] A: Yes. Oh, just right now?
[28:19] B: Yeah.
[28:20] A: Oh, right. Was that money only to be used while you're in program that you saved?
[28:26] B: No.
[28:27] A: Oh, it was for you, for whenever and wherever. Yeah.
[28:30] B: I couldn't use it before.
[28:34] A: Right. Oh, so that's not tied to it, that money?
[28:39] B: No, it's not.
[28:40] A: It isn't at all.
[28:41] B: No. I mean, it is now to programming. Well, not to programming. It isn't a program.
[28:47] A: Oh, it's not tied. Oh, you have to give it to them.
[28:49] B: Well, they want me to transfer it into an account that they can help me budget.
[28:57] A: Oh, okay. So like your own account? Yeah. Huh. You wouldn't want to like, have like your own account? Well, when I have a job for your money.
[29:08] B: When I have a job to put money into it.
[29:11] A: Uh huh. Which is part of the next steps of programming, isn't it?
[29:14] B: Yes.
[29:14] A: Okay. What's happening now?
[29:21] B: I mean, I know all these things. I just don't know why it makes me feel the way it makes me feel.
[29:27] A: Oh, I do. Why? Cause it's been all tied together. You already answered that question. And what we're interested in doing to you, that I'm seeing, it's been all unwound and untied so that she sees separate as separate and different from different. And that you're actually free now, way more free than you were when you were in jail because you weren't free then. Or prison. Fuck, you really weren't free. It's one thing County. It's another thing. Fucking got it. So the you that I'm seeing is connected to being free, that she's actually choosing things for herself now, different than it was when you went to jail or prison. You didn't get to choose that.
[30:10] B: Well, ultimately, I guess I did.
[30:13] A: No, you didn't get to choose which prison to go to.
[30:20] B: I did.
[30:21] A: You got to choose which prison. They gave you a list of them.
[30:26] B: Yeah, well, not ultimately.
[30:29] A: Oh no.
[30:30] B: But I got to choose to go to the better, higher quality facility with good behavior and application.
[30:41] A: Oh, so more of a controlled choice, like what I do with my kid when I put out the two outfits Yeah, I said, which one do you want to wear? You get to pick. Totally your decision.
[30:53] B: Just like that.
[30:55] A: Right. This is different than that.
[31:00] B: Yes.
[31:01] A: What is different than that? Could you leave?
[31:08] B: No.
[31:09] A: You can't?
[31:10] B: No.
[31:10] A: Oh, why?
[31:12] B: Because if I leave, I would be violating my probation.
[31:15] A: Oh, so you don't like the consequences.
[31:17] B: Yeah.
[31:17] A: Of leaving doesn't mean that you can't.
[31:20] B: Well, yeah, to me, that means there's no option.
[31:22] A: Oh, because you don't like the consequences.
[31:25] B: Because I won't accept the consequences.
[31:27] A: Well, you don't want those consequences, so you're doing this instead of that.
[31:31] B: Yeah.
[31:31] A: Oh, right. You're choosing that because it's not like if you wanted to leave, they can't stop you.
[31:39] B: No.
[31:40] A: Madeline's not grabbing your ankle. No.
[31:44] B: But it's not a choice.
[31:46] A: Only because you don't like the consequences.
[31:49] B: Only because it's not a choice.
[31:51] A: I don't. Based on. Right. See, notice you're thinking that it isn't a choice.
[31:59] B: It's not for me. I'm choosing that. It's not a choice.
[32:04] A: Oh, yes. But is it, like, ultimately.
[32:10] B: Well, ultimately, yes, it is. It's a choice that I'm choosing to not choose.
[32:16] A: You could be on the run.
[32:18] B: I could be.
[32:19] A: That's not what you want for you?
[32:21] B: No.
[32:21] A: Oh, so you're choosing you?
[32:23] B: Yes.
[32:23] A: Oh, right. You are. You're choosing you. Right. That you matter to you.
[32:28] B: Yes.
[32:28] A: And you doing things that are going to forward your life in a better way matters to you. Oh, that's what you're choosing, isn't it? Oh, it is. Doesn't that feel good?
[32:39] B: Yeah.
[32:39] A: Did you?
[32:40] B: Yes.
[32:41] A: To do the things that, like, you know, forge your life that matter to you. Oh. And you wouldn't want to actually feel good about that?
[32:47] B: No, I feel great about that.
[32:48] A: You do? Okay, good.
[32:49] B: It's all the things that that entails.
[32:52] A: Damn it.
[32:52] B: I don't feel great about.
[32:54] A: Okay, that's not included. When you're thinking of those things, are you including it? How you feel really good that you're choosing things that are for the betterment of your life.
[33:08] B: I think four out of 10 times I feel like that.
[33:11] A: Oh, six out of 10 times I feel like shit.
[33:17] B: Why am I here?
[33:20] A: Right. But which one's the bigger decision? See, there's a saying. I don't know if you've ever heard this before. Came from a real estate guy. Really? Came from a real estate guy. His name is. Well, it came from the guy Keller, from Keller Williams. And he said that what is the one thing that I can do such that by doing that one thing makes everything else easier, unnecessary. So it's like making the big decision, which I did. I know, but it still sucks. Oh, what if it wasn't so sucky? Well, then you were actually connecting to that. I actually made the big decision, and then I just go along with it, do the things that there are to do. Part of that.
[34:18] B: I don't know.
[34:19] A: Weird, right? You don't know.
[34:22] B: Why do I not want to conform? I think that's ultimately it.
[34:26] A: Oh, why do you feel like it's conforming?
[34:31] B: Just doing what I have to do.
[34:34] A: Hmm. See, that's. I'm thinking where the similar is like.
[34:38] B: Doing what I have to do, not because it's what I want to do.
[34:40] A: Oh, no, but it is actually what you want to do because you made the big decision.
[34:45] B: The big decision, not the little decision.
[34:46] A: Right. But the big decision cascades down to the little decision which informs. Why I'm doing the little decisions in the way that I'm doing them because of the big decision I made.
[34:58] B: Well, I do think I'm just grudgingly.
[35:00] A: Right. Yeah. So what would it be like if you weren't so disgrudgingly doing it? How much better and more enjoyable and more joy would you be experiencing if I wasn't so grudgingly doing it?
[35:12] B: Well, maybe a lot better.
[35:14] A: Maybe a lot better. And wouldn't that be great for you to actually be feeling a lot better right now? Yeah, it would be. So let's think of you feeling a lot better as things are getting unraveled and untied so they're not all bound together. Right. That they're beginning to be separated and that I'm connecting to the big decision that I made that I actually truly feel really good in doing. Because when I think of the alternative, me leaving or being violating probation or like, those don't look appealing at all. I mean, even worse than grudgingly going, okay, yes, I've got this. And okay, I have to wait, and grandma's not ready yet. Like, okay. Right. But if I weigh that in comparison to. No, no, this is still better than that. Isn't that interesting? Right. So what's happening now?
[36:07] B: I mean, I do. I do it.
[36:09] A: You do. And we want you to do it in a way that actually feels good to you. Because that would be only because it would be better for you.
[36:16] B: Yeah.
[36:17] A: For no other reason that you would actually feel good and you wouldn't want to feel good more often. I mean, four out of ten times gets you to the hall of Fame in baseball, but maybe not in life. Right. Somebody can bat.400 in baseball. They are a Hall of Famer. Right. In life. Right. We want you to have more access to all of that for you. Right. So now as you think of this you who's got it all untangled, so it's unraveled, so it's untied and she's seeing separate as separate and different is different, even if there's some similarities and she's actually feeling good about the things that she's doing, the decisions that she's making and where she's headed. Right. Because in all that way, this is the you that I'm seeing. And my question isn't how it's going to happen that we get you here because you're already partially there. But really, would it be okay that as you're here, you're actually also feeling good and doing it? Like, would that be okay? Oh, good. See, this is what I'm opting for. This is the peace. This is like the key thing. Because notice how as I say, all of that, it's kind of like eh, but there's like conflict. So what? Right. So George, what about fully being here? What about that's not quite a hundred percent okay. Yeah. This thing that's happening right now. This? Yeah.
[37:48] B: Oh no.
[38:10] A: And what about it showing up as not quite okay for you, that emotion? Right. Where does that feeling take you towards? Like if you were just like to have that feeling tone and let the feeling tone guide you back so that the feeling tone took you back and grew you younger and earlier back back. What's it taking you towards? What's an experience that's starting to surface? No.
[38:55] B: What are you?
[38:56] A: Uh huh.
[39:03] B: I don't feel like anything's ever been good, huh? Or okay.
[39:08] A: Huh. Is it good and okay that you're making better decisions now?
[39:13] B: Yes.
[39:14] A: Okay. So we can't go the whole life then poke hole in that one. Some of life. You didn't know that it could actually be different. Yeah. Right. Now you actually realize that it can. I wonder what would happen if the younger you got to realize that life can be different and that you're actually doing it now.
[39:39] B: I think she does realize it.
[39:40] A: Oh, she does? What if she fully got it? I don't know how different where you are now is back then with him. Hmm. Right. That, that got untangled, didn't it? I mean, you're not talking to him though. Isn't that interesting? How cool is that? See, that was good. I like that. Cuz you're like, really cool. Duh. Right, right. But what does that emotion travel you back towards other than, like, my whole life? Well, how do you know when to feel it in those moments?
[40:39] B: It's when I'm reminded.
[40:41] A: Mm.
[40:41] B: That I can't do things on my own. That's the reminder.
[40:49] A: The reminder that you can't do things on your own. Except you're doing this on your own.
[40:52] B: Yeah. Except for.
[40:54] A: God damn it.
[40:55] B: On my own.
[40:57] A: You are doing this on your own. Right. Oh, and getting support in a different way.
[41:04] B: That seems similar.
[41:06] A: I know. That's the problem. Yeah. Right. And we want to get that similarity to be unplugged. Right. Because that's where. Because it's got similar structure to it in the same way. Think of it. The guy's making out with the girl and she's into him, and he's into her, and it's Valentine's Day and they're gonna be intimate. And she touches his thigh. But it's a reminder. Similar to Uncle Ed. Now, Uncle Ed's hand was grabby man hand. Hers is dainty female hand, but it's still a fucking hand. Right. So that's where similar gets confused as same. And that's why I can logically know different, but emotionally not feel different. Right. So we want you to be free in seeing the difference between the two so that you get to connect more to your being free.
[42:04] B: Yeah. It just seems so hard because I feel like everything I'm doing right now at Selah is ultimately, like, very similar.
[42:20] A: Is ultimately for your benefit. How similar is that to him?
[42:26] B: Well, I know that.
[42:28] A: Is there a difference? Check this out just for a second. I'm doing all these things and it feels very similar. But you're doing all these things for you. Now, the difference when you were doing all those things is was it for you? How was it for him?
[42:48] B: Maybe that's where the confusion is.
[42:51] A: You think so?
[42:54] B: Good.
[42:54] A: I love it. You're super smart too. That's so cool. Not everybody gets that, but that's where the confusion has been. Right.
[43:04] B: I know.
[43:06] A: Right. So now let's think of you slightly lowering your jaw and resting your tongue just slightly down at the bottom of your mouth so that you begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper so that you can expand out awareness. Picking up my fingers, wiggling. And noticing more of the space. Right. Space between, space beyond, space behind, underneath, up above. And how you're noticing more of the space that's Right. Space, time, distance, matter, energy. Right. Those are four coordinates. Matter, energy, space, time. Time is only left hemisphere brain. Space is always under time and then there's matter and energy. Right. We want things to matter. See, what's really cool is that you matter to you now so much more. And that's why you're doing what you're doing now, because you matter to you. Right. By the way, how is your body feeling now? Huh? Notice how that's starting to change. And see, as we provide that space, we can travel back along the timeline. Right. Because even them assisting you in managing an account is for who? Right. And they're not sighting a little bit for her. That in my pocket. Right, Right. We want that to be crystal clear. But see, what's been being merged is that feeling Tone feels real similar. We want to slide back and it doesn't matter what it takes us to, but there'll be a moment in experience that that part of your brain will slide back and bring to your awareness. Right. To clear what's starting to come to mind now.
[45:49] B: Just.
[45:52] A: Weird. Uh huh. Why would that one show up? What does that have to do with this?
[46:01] B: No, I see how it has everything to do with this.
[46:08] A: Oh, it's. So what's the moment that's coming to mind? Happened when you might have been how old?
[46:21] B: Well, what comes to mind is Clyde.
[46:28] A: Yeah.
[46:28] B: And being with him or talking to him or.
[46:35] A: So let's think of a specific time and an age. Being with him and talking to him to benefit me. Huh. But was it really?
[46:50] B: Ultimately I felt like it was, yes.
[46:55] A: Right. Isn't that a quid pro quo? The first time that our president got impeached, it was for that second time for supposedly. They're both supposedly. Right, Right. So let's think of a time where back then when you were talking to him, it felt like it was for your benefit.
[47:28] B: He got me an apartment.
[47:30] A: Uh huh. Might have been. How old?
[47:35] B: 18.
[47:35] A: 18. Right. And he had gotten you. So how did that happen? You didn't have a place to stay or you weren't wanting to stay with mom. Yeah. Huh. Like I can't stay with her. Yeah.
[47:52] B: I have nowhere to stay.
[47:53] A: I have nowhere to stay. And he said.
[47:57] B: Well, let's look for a place.
[47:59] A: Good job. Right. Let's look for a place. Right. And then we found a place. Right, Good. And he put the money down for the deposit and he paid the first, last, whatever.
[48:11] B: He paid for everything.
[48:12] A: Uh huh. At the apartment. Uh huh. And then got you a vehicle, right? That's right. So you can remember that happening, right? What did that come with?
[48:26] B: Time, Patience.
[48:31] A: Well, did it come with time and patience?
[48:33] B: Well, I mean, I had to put in time.
[48:37] A: Time for what?
[48:38] B: Him.
[48:39] A: Oh, you had to put in time with him?
[48:40] B: Yes.
[48:41] A: Oh, right. So you said that he paid for it all.
[48:44] B: Yeah.
[48:45] A: Uh huh. What you thought meant the apartment and car. Huh huh. Right.
[48:57] B: Yeah.
[48:58] A: Uh huh. And he didn't have like keys to either apartment or car, so he could only get in when you. But there was a requirement in him getting the apartment and the car, wasn't there?
[49:17] B: Yeah, Time.
[49:19] A: Uh huh. Time. End.
[49:21] B: Attention and I don't know.
[49:27] A: Time, Attention. Activities. Things that you did that I didn't want to do. Oh, for him.
[49:36] B: Yeah.
[49:36] A: Oh. Oh, you mean you actually lost freedom? Yeah. By getting an apartment and a car. He actually had more control.
[49:46] B: Yeah.
[49:47] A: Oh, because he had more say in having you do things that you actually didn't want to do.
[49:53] B: Yep.
[49:54] A: Oh, what might have been one of those things that he had you do that you didn't want to do that you couldn't not do because he was giving you a car in an apartment.
[50:02] B: Even as simple as calling him.
[50:04] A: Uh huh. Even as simple as calling him.
[50:07] B: Yeah, I didn't even want to do that.
[50:09] A: That's right. That's right. So remember that happening with him, and that's just a small example was, you know, having to call him. But then there was other stuff probably had to happen. Do stuff with your body with him that was also stuff that you didn't want to do. Right, Right. So you back then was thinking getting out of your mom's house and getting your own place and your own car meant that you were free. Yeah. How free were you?
[50:50] B: Not free at all.
[50:51] A: Not free at all.
[50:52] B: Right, Exactly. That's why I feel the way that I feel now.
[50:56] A: Oh, what do you have to do now? See, isn't it more what you're not able to fully do versus what you have to do? Isn't that different? See, because you can remember that happening and that you back then actually thought.
[51:14] B: That she was free or at least in that direction.
[51:19] A: Yes, she thought that she was free. But was she really free? No. Oh, so you can remember all that happening, Right? You can remember putting your jeans on? Yes. Try. Stop putting on your jeans. Well, stop him from doing that. Well, no, he's not doing that. Right. Well then stop living in that apartment. Then stop calling him.
[51:36] B: I'm not calling.
[51:37] A: Well, stop doing those things to him.
[51:39] B: I'm not.
[51:40] A: We'll stop him from doing those things to You.
[51:42] B: He's not.
[51:43] A: Well, then stop living in that apartment. Well, stop driving that car. Well, then you stop putting on your New balance. So then where is that experience?
[51:53] B: It's in the back.
[51:54] A: It no longer exists because there isn't a place that we can go to to watch it. Even though you have a memory of it, we don't actually have an actual physical place. Timbuktu. Physical place that no longer exists that you didn't know. When he said that he would do those things, she thought she was going to be free to be able to do what she wanted to do. Was she?
[52:25] B: No.
[52:26] A: No. Right, right. She didn't know that it was the same thing. Go ahead, pick. Really? Which outfit do you want to wear? You know, my oldest daughter, I'd ask her and she'd go, daddy, I don't know. You pick my youngest daughter. Hold out two, right? Different kids. Youngest daughter, I'd have to have three outfits. If I had three outfits, she'd go for it. If I only had two, get my own chip. So funny. Right? But see, you didn't know that you were in a controlled choice that wasn't your choice. That's the difference. The difference is that you were in a controlled choice that wasn't your choice. You thought you were choosing, but you had no choice. That's right.
[53:34] B: So fast forward.
[53:36] A: So now wait before you. All right, fast forward, Go ahead. Fast forward.
[53:41] B: Yeah, fast forward. Now I feel like I'm having controlled choices and I'm not. Is it like, is that the illusion that my mind is creating?
[53:56] A: Yeah. The difference. Right? Yeah. Is that back then you thought that you chose and that you were free and I wasn't. And you were. Because you couldn't not call him. What would happen if you didn't?
[54:11] B: Well, he'd stop paying.
[54:13] A: Uh huh. How free are you then?
[54:16] B: I'm not free.
[54:18] A: Right. So close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You let her know that that's over, finished. That it no longer exists. Let that you know that she thought that she was choosing and that she was free. But as you're seeing it, and she got it. Clearly she wasn't free. That's right. That he was controlling her based on what was best for him, not her. Right. Which is why you ultimately got away. Because what he was doing wasn't. It was the illusion that it was what was best for you, but it was really what was best for him. That's right. So that you're getting it now and that earlier you is getting it, that she's out of there now. Right. And that you're free to choose something fully for you. And because you're smart and you know the outcome of going the other direction, you made the choice to enter this program. Right. For you. Not for him, not for what he wanted, but for what you want for you. And if that means there's some parts of it that stretch me or make me uncomfortable or I don't particularly like to, unfortunately, there's a very big difference. So check that out right now. What do you notice as that's happening? The difference between what that was and where you are now, which is all about you and what you want for you, Even if there are certain parts of it that I regrettingly. Right. It's just solely for me. Uh huh. That's right. For the first time. Mm. It's my life. Mm. Right. I'm free to direct my life. Right. And as that's starting to get in Trish, what do you notice happening in your body now?
[56:56] B: More space.
[56:57] A: More space. Huh? What's it like to connect to more space? What's happening now?
[57:26] B: This one's tough.
[57:27] A: What?
[57:29] B: It's kind of exhausting.
[57:31] A: Uh huh. Well, what's happening now? What are you noticing in you as you're connecting to more space? Well, that's a good breath.
[57:46] B: I'm a little resistant.
[57:51] A: Uh huh. To what?
[57:53] B: Space.
[57:54] A: Uh huh. Oh, right. Cause you wouldn't want to experience more of it. I know.
[57:59] B: I mean, my thoughts exactly.
[58:02] A: Space and freedom to connect to you. Choosing you for the first time. Right. Totally free to be doing stuff for me, only me. Not a quip pro quo. Right. Got the difference. Even then going. Hey, we want you to move this in so that it's yours, all in your name. We can assist you. For you.
[58:48] B: Those assholes.
[58:52] A: Damn them. Right, Right. What's happening now?
[59:05] B: I don't know why I'm still confused.
[59:07] A: Oh, what are you confused about?
[59:09] B: Why is this so hard for me?
[59:11] A: Well, is it hard right now as it's becoming more clear?
[59:15] B: I mean, it's totally clear.
[59:17] A: Oh, it is clear. Right. How's your body feeling now that it's totally clear?
[59:24] B: Better.
[59:25] A: But it is. Oh, okay.
[59:27] B: I still. I don't know if I'm like. I feel like I'm in a parallel universe where, like, I see and I know and I feel great. But then like in this parallel universe, I'm still trapped.
[59:56] A: Except you're not.
[59:57] B: Except I'm not.
[59:58] A: You're just literally in the middle.
[60:00] B: Yeah.
[60:02] A: Halfway through a program.
[60:04] B: Yeah.
[60:04] A: That's about supporting you, becoming even More free and a better version of you making good decisions for yourself. Uh huh. Right. And we don't always like all aspects of programming. No, no. But will we? Do we like all aspects of any job? No. No. I can have a great job and love lots of it. I don't love all of it. Right. I don't like writing notes. It comes with a job. You can't not write a fucking note. I don't really like it. I don't like when I go home that I'm sitting on the computer typing. No. There's so many other things that I'd rather be doing than that. But I can't not do it. I guess I could just like you could, Lee. Right. No. No. Right, right. Because in the same way, what if somebody comes in and I get audited and they need to see my note and I can do it just like if you leave and you break probation. No. Don't want to do that. Okay. Okay. Write the date note. Right. Right. That doesn't mean that all aspects of it we like. But what's starting to get really crystallized and clear is how different. Because for the first time, even though you don't like all of it, you're doing it totally 100% for you. And there's not something that you've got to give to somebody to get. That's the difference in being free. Make sense what's happening now? You're doing so good. I'm really proud of you. I am. Cause there was that thing, right?
[62:21] B: Yeah.
[62:21] A: Yeah. What happened? I do feel like, oh, what's the quid pro quo here?
[62:30] B: I'm giving a lot of time.
[62:33] A: Oh, an effort. Yeah. To better your life. Fuck. Sucks.
[62:39] B: I know. And that's the sim. That's where the similar thing is, is that's. That's how I felt.
[62:46] A: Oh, but was that really to better your life?
[62:49] B: Well, like fast forward looking back. Hell no.
[62:52] A: Oh, right. She didn't know that.
[62:54] B: Yeah. And she didn't know that.
[62:56] A: Oh, right. What if she does? What happens right now? If you close your eyes and you picture that you that was living in that apartment, driving that car and she was literally thinking that that was bettering her life. Have her fast forward and see what you know. Was it really so that she sees it clearly because she didn't know that that's what's being confused. And how different is that than where you are now, than what you're actually doing for you now, which is totally for you and your benefit. Right. What happens when the earlier you realizes it right. What's happening now? All right, what's happening now?
[64:18] B: I mean, I know that the odds are slim, but I'm gonna look back.
[64:22] A: And think, well, what's the difference when she got it? Cause she thought that that was really for her betterment.
[64:30] B: She knows that it's not.
[64:32] A: Oh, okay. How about you? Right now?
[64:37] B: No, it's not the same.
[64:41] A: Uh huh.
[64:42] B: Before it's different.
[64:44] A: Uh huh. Right. Right now it's not the same as it was. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Uh huh. Isn't there a little bit of relief there? Yeah. Huh. Feeling right. Yeah, right, right.
[65:08] B: Just still skeptical.
[65:10] A: Oh, oh, you're skeptical because you don't trust in you.
[65:14] B: Yes.
[65:15] A: Oh, I wonder what would happen if you started to trust in you. Not trust others, just trust in you. See, the deal with trust isn't about trusting others. That was the problem back then. Even in getting in the fucking car. Did not tell me the whole fucking story. Right. That was all about you trusting others. And so why you get questioned and why I'm defensive is because like, now I gotta trust them. No, it's not about trusting them. See, trust is that thing that if I and the other person have my both of our best interest in mind, it feels like we're on the same page going. But as soon as my best interest no longer matches theirs, they're not having mine. Right. That's why I was saying they would be asking the question of where did the money come? Whether it was Trish or somebody else in programming that then brought up that I have this extra money to buy this thing. Had nothing to do with Trish. But see, Trish thought, fuck man, had all to do with me. But as you're thinking about it now and we're seeing it more clearly, did it have anything to do with you? No, had everything to do with. That is a part of being in this particular program, right, that you're seeing as a benefit for you to improve your life. Uh huh. Oh, that's right. And you're doing it, aren't you 100% committed? Sometimes begrudgingly, but 100% committed doing it. See, that's the part that I go, this gal's amazing. Right? Right. So what starts to happen when you begin to trust in you?
[67:08] B: Feels a lot better.
[67:10] A: It does, doesn't it? See, that's what's been missing is you trusting in you that I'm guided, that my compass has been more regulated, that I'm actually doing this totally for me. Right. Because I see it as an opportunity for me. Uh huh. Right. And yeah. What does it require of me? Time, energy, effort. What in life that's actually beneficial. Doesn't require time, energy and effort. That's beneficial. Kicking back, eating, you know, bon bons, watching tv doesn't require. With a bag of potato chips doesn't require a lot of effort or energy or sacrifice. Right. Oh, but you're worth it to you. Right? And you really get it now. Right? So I wonder what happens is that earlier you fully realizes that you're worth it to you and you're doing the right steps and you're taking the right actions on the way and that maybe I could even enjoy the ride getting there begrudgingly sometimes, but enjoy the ride getting there. Right. So what's happening now?
[68:43] B: Seems a little better.
[68:45] A: It does, doesn't it?
[68:46] B: Yeah.
[68:47] A: Yeah. Right. Cause they're not so tied together. Check. See if it's all tied together now. Isn't that cool?
[68:58] B: Yeah.
[68:58] A: Yeah. Good job. You did great today. You're so much fun. So good to get connected with you. I'm really, really honored that I get to be on your journey. Thank you. And supporting your growth and development.
[69:19] B: It's nice to have you along the ride.
[69:22] A: Cool. All right, my dear, you can come with me. We will head on out.
