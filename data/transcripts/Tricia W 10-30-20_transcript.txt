[00:00] A: Okay, so today is the 30th of October, Trish. This is our first meeting and we're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And given what we do is useful, valuable and transformative for you, it may be made available in teaching and training professionals and how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes?
[00:18] B: Yes, sir.
[00:18] A: Okay, cool. So as I was saying earlier, what we're really interested in is getting now to work better. So some people in the now go. You know what? For me, I'm a lot more on edge. I'm quick, short tempered. I'm easily irritated, agitated and aggravated. I might be a little more defensive, quick to kind of react to stuff. My reactions sometimes are way more than the situation needs. I'd like to settle down a little bit. I'd like to not be so uptight and tense in that way. Some people go, well, for me, I'm more like nervous. I get like uneasy and discomfort in situations, social situations, worrying about what others might be thinking about me. And my mind is like freaking overactive. Sometimes when I try to sleep at night, it's just like on, I'd like that to be done. Sometimes it affects me sleeping, sometimes it's panic. You know, Some people go, for me, you know, at night. I kind of get flooded at times with like bad dreams where all of a sudden I'm remembering yucky shit that happened. I don't like feeling that way. I don't want that to happen. Some people go, for me, I'm more down, I'm depressed. I'm not having the same zest or interest in life like I used to. I'm just kind of like going through the motions of things. I'm like doing stuff, but it's like I don't have that same kind of thing. Some people go, for me, there's a whole bunch of shit that's happened. And although it's over, I know it's like underneath the surface affecting me. It's not that I think about it all the time, but like if I do or shit reminds me of it, I'm like right there. I'd like that to be gone. Some people go, for me, I got unwanted desires, cravings, interests to use. I'd like that to stop because fucking doesn't support me. Those are kind of like the broad categories, Trish, of the things that I can get better. So that being said, what is it that we would be wanting time to do for you?
[02:05] B: For me?
[02:06] A: Well, there's A good start.
[02:10] B: I think that I have. I'm not really sure my focus point on what I want to get better at or be better in is relationships. Because I hate men. Yeah. I hate men. And I don't know, I feel like I have problems because I don't know what I want. Like, I mean, I know that I want to be with a man.
[02:43] A: Fuck, that's really hard.
[02:45] B: Although, like, I also.
[02:47] A: That we could have a love hate relationship there.
[02:49] B: Yeah. I just struggle. I struggle and I don't. I don't know. And then now, after I've been in prison for so long, like, holding conversations with men is the hardest thing I've ever had to do because I feel like now all men have been categorized as authority figures in my life, which is already a problem that I have. It's authority or somebody like over me or overpowering me.
[03:17] A: So we want you to be more on the same level.
[03:19] B: Yeah, but.
[03:20] A: Or I had above to step like.
[03:22] B: To get deeper and deeper into this. My trauma began when I was a child being molested by somebody that I loved and trust and then only loved and trust him more as I grew up. And he's somebody who has been very prominent and in my life up until my release from prison. He was somebody that I depended on for everything. Somebody that I could trust for everything. So I'm like trauma bonded there.
[03:51] A: Ah, yeah. Okay.
[03:54] B: And there's like a centipede crawling on your floor that I can't stop looking at.
[04:02] A: What are you doing? There you go. Thanks for letting me know.
[04:13] B: He was distracting me.
[04:15] A: You think? Yeah. What is that thing moving on the ground over there? It's fucking close to Halloween. But that's fucking creepy thinking this part of the thing.
[04:29] B: I didn't know if that was a thing.
[04:31] A: Oh yeah. What else is coming out of the wall? Okay. So thinking that there's been some bonding with that person. So there's been like screwed up stuff. He's somebody that you trusted and depended on in lots of different ways, yet he was also somebody who. Who had been doing stuff that wasn't okay to have done.
[04:49] B: Yes. Like to a point where I thought he was gonna kill me. And I told on him because I was scared to death I was gonna die like that he was gonna kill me when I turned 18 and decided to do what I wanted to do and not do what he told me to do.
[05:05] A: Hmm.
[05:06] B: Yeah.
[05:06] A: Okay. So he didn't.
[05:11] B: No.
[05:12] A: Right. Cause you're here.
[05:13] B: Yeah.
[05:13] A: Yeah.
[05:13] B: You know, I was in prison for 10 years though, and I went in like not long after 18.
[05:21] A: Well, that was a good way to make sure that he couldn't.
[05:23] B: Yeah. Not that I did it on purpose.
[05:26] A: No. But I mean, seriously, he didn't have any access.
[05:29] B: Yeah. No, he didn't.
[05:30] A: To get in and do that. No. Right. Yeah. Those, those things, you know, don't make you feel safe inside. But definitely the other people on the outside can't get in.
[05:38] B: Yeah.
[05:38] A: Unless they do something really fucked up.
[05:40] B: Yeah. And then end up in a female prison.
[05:43] A: Yeah, that wouldn't happen. Yeah. Okay. So there's been all that. So the impact that that's had, we want cleared. And even though you know better now, there's still some of that bonding.
[05:57] B: Yeah, I do believe that there is because I'm very strong in my. No, like, I do not want to call him. I do not want to depend on him. I don't want to, like, feel like I have that safety net that, like, oh, if anything happens, like, I know I can call him.
[06:19] A: And like, wouldn't be better for you to be your own.
[06:23] B: Yes. And that's what I want.
[06:25] A: Okay.
[06:25] B: That's what I want.
[06:26] A: That, like, you're okay regardless of what might show up.
[06:29] B: Yeah. And I want to know that, like, I could do it for myself.
[06:32] A: Yeah.
[06:33] B: That's what I want. But like, there's something.
[06:35] A: Because you don't already know that yet.
[06:37] B: I feel like I know that.
[06:38] A: But then, like, you only know it up here. You don't know it here.
[06:41] B: Yeah. I've never been put in a position where, like, I've been on my own and done it myself.
[06:49] A: Except you went eight and a half years on your own doing it yourself in a really difficult place to do that.
[06:56] B: Yeah. But I had him.
[06:58] A: How so?
[06:59] B: I called him every day and he financially supported me. Yeah. I mean, that was the gist of it.
[07:10] A: Yes. So you may have gotten some funds and you may have spoken to him, but he wasn't the one behind bars. And having to deal with the day to day challenges of being in a place that you have no flexibility of whether you can leave even if you wanted to. Oh, sorry. You know what? I've kind of done this long enough and I. No, yeah, right. Your freedoms, your choices, your. You don't have that there. Right. Even if he, you know, provided some funds and was like an ear to talk to, you actually did that one because he wasn't in there, like on your own.
[07:54] B: Yeah.
[07:55] A: Yeah. Okay. But you want to be fully clear.
[08:00] B: Yeah.
[08:02] A: Free from him. Yeah.
[08:04] B: I don't want to care about if I'm hurting his feelings or not.
[08:09] A: Okay. Is that how you're feeling now? Sometimes that me not talking to him now or me having told is hurting his feelings?
[08:17] B: I guess. Or sometimes, like, I wonder. I don't know what I wonder, but yeah.
[08:28] A: Yeah. What's happening now?
[08:33] B: I don't know. He's just somebody who's always been in my life, and, like, I hate him, but at the same time, like, he's all I've ever had to depend on. Like, there were moments in my life where, like, I would turn to him before I would even turn to, like, my mom or anybody. And, like. But I hate him so much.
[08:59] A: You hate him so much, and your hate is because.
[09:04] B: Because I trusted him and he was wrong for everything that he did. Like, I was a kid, and him and his wife. Really?
[09:20] A: Yeah.
[09:20] B: They both fucked me up.
[09:23] A: Okay, so you hate him for having done wrong things to you that fucked you up, but you have affinity love for him because he was a support and he was a caretaker and he provided some finances and had you feel like he cares.
[09:47] B: Yeah.
[09:48] A: Right. Which he does in a fucked up way.
[09:50] B: Yeah. I feel like I could trust him or like, he would never. He's like the one person in the world that would never leave me.
[09:59] A: Yeah. Okay. So there's a whole entanglement.
[10:04] B: Oh, yeah.
[10:05] A: With all that. Right?
[10:07] B: Yeah.
[10:08] A: That we want to get untangled. Okay. I can get behind doing that. I know what to do with that. Okay. What else would it be useful for me to know? What else do we want our time to be doing for you?
[10:25] B: Okay. Well, I don't, like. I don't want men to be in their own authority category anymore. That's another thing, like, being put in a position to have conversations with men. Like, I. I put boundaries up immediately, almost like, I guess because I didn't notice it while I was in. In prison. I thought I was doing great and, like, I wasn't institutionalized and whatever. But then coming out, I got a job at a restaurant and, like, I. I caught myself accidentally, like, calling the chef sarge, and I was like, holy cow. But then I also noticed that, like, if I was in the conversation and one of the guys came up and they got in the conversation, like, I would take myself out of it. No personal conversations with men. And that was a. A prison thing, because I didn't want to be involved in, like, the filthy ring with the men in prison.
[11:32] A: And so, like, the guards. Yes.
[11:36] B: Because every man that's been in my life, you know, up until now, has been Officers, they've all. Any man contact that we had was all officers. And you catch a new charge, you know, personal relationship with officers. So I just cut myself out of.
[12:03] A: Which was wise there.
[12:05] B: Yeah. And out here it's not. Because I can't have conversations. And I feel like I put all men in a category where they're all like, authority figures. And so I can't even have a friendly conversation without feeling like I'm crossing boundaries. Like.
[12:29] A: Crossing boundaries. Like I'm being flirtatious or like I'm.
[12:34] B: Establishing a personal relationship. Yeah.
[12:38] A: Like that causes a great deal of discomfort.
[12:42] B: Yeah.
[12:42] A: It felt like there's been a power balance, a power imbalance.
[12:46] B: Yes.
[12:48] A: Because the men, even that guy, were older. Right. And also in authority.
[12:56] B: Yes.
[12:57] A: So out of prison, that model is still active in you. Or somehow I'm down here and they're up there. Yes. And it's an inequitable place. Okay, so we want that shifted.
[13:15] B: Yep.
[13:16] A: Okay.
[13:19] B: And I mean, I feel like I could go on and on of. With things.
[13:25] A: Yeah. That would be useful because.
[13:28] B: Okay.
[13:28] A: So I thought Trish could go on and on about things because certainly we want to get it. As I said to you right off the bat, we want to get it so that you're on the same level. Or at least a head above.
[13:38] B: Yeah. Well, yeah. If that's possible.
[13:43] A: Why wouldn't it be?
[13:44] B: I'd like equality.
[13:47] A: Yeah.
[13:47] B: So that I'm not so uncomfortable.
[13:50] A: Right. Why? And I'd be thinking a little more step beyond equality. Women, if it's in a dating world, women who have successful relationships with men or women who hold the keys, not the guy. But. Right. That's weird. Right. Because you've been in it the other way. Right. But women who have successful relationships with men are women who hold the keys. The reason that is is that women are the object of desire. Right. In the world of worlds, men get turned on by women because women are beautiful, sensual, provocative, shapely, they smell good, their body moves in different ways. It's got different parts. But women aren't turned on by men. It's not what the guy looks like. That may be secondary, but it's not like primary. So woman holds the keys. Woman determines whether I'm going to allow the guy to spend time with me. Right. Woman doesn't chase after man, ever. Female panther, even though it feels like it. Female panther, when she's in heat, really horny. Wants it. Is not chasing after the male. Running down, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me. She's not doing that. She lets him Know I'm approachable. Just don't fucking approach if I'm not wanting. Right. Yeah, but she makes him work hard to get me because I'm worth it. So we want you actually on the inside to get your own worth. Yes. Right, Right. Which you're already starting to because you actually got into a program. Yes. Right. Because you're worth it to you.
[15:23] B: Yes.
[15:25] A: And you want your life to be better.
[15:26] B: Yes.
[15:27] A: Yeah. Right. So we're already on our way. We got a good head start right now. We just want. Right now we want to do other stuff, to actually have it fully integrated.
[15:35] B: Yes.
[15:36] A: Right, Right. So that's why it's not just on the same level. It's really like a head above so that you see more. Right, right. Because you felt below and under. Right. And the representation, by the way, do you know where that comes from? Authority being up and me being down when we're little? Because anybody in authority is bigger, taller, stronger, faster, they know more, they're always up. So I feel small in relationship to them. Even if I'm grown up still, the representation is still the same. So we want to get that shifted so that at a deeper level you get that you're grown up.
[16:27] B: Yeah.
[16:28] A: Right. Okay, cool. I know what to do with that. Alright, so what else would be useful for me to know? What else are we wanting our time to do for you?
[16:43] B: I guess just like relationships and I don't know if I would call myself confused or not. This is definitely something I've never talked about before, so.
[17:01] A: Good.
[17:05] B: Because like, I've been with men and women and I want to be with men, but like when I'm in a relationship, I end up hating them so much. Like when I get them where I want them, I hate them. And then I want to discard them. Like after sex I'm like, I feel disgusted almost.
[17:32] A: Hmm.
[17:35] B: Or like ashamed. Even though, like, you know, I have not been in very many relationships that were like long relationships. I was. I really just kind of like was promiscuous, I guess.
[17:52] A: Right. Which is like fucking like a guy.
[17:54] B: Yeah. That's what I was.
[17:55] A: Which is one of the common things that happen when girls get exposed. Sexual abuse happens when they're kids. Is that what it gets inside of them? Is that they either repulse it altogether or they fuck like guys. Right. Guy can have a one night stand and be like, oh, yeah, no big deal. Right. There was a. I don't know if you remember this show. It was called Sex and the City.
[18:20] B: I vaguely remember it.
[18:22] A: Character in that was a newspaper writer. And she said, now that women are having the same kind of jobs, working at the same kind of places, earning the same kind of money, can women have sex like men? And the answer is yes, but. And the but is women have a chemical that causes them to be endeared towards who they're with when they're being sexually intimate with somebody. So it's a yes, but. But women who have had that sexual abuse, they tend to fuck like guys. Right? Typical example would be woman who's cheating on her husband is not having sex with her husband. Man who's cheating on his wife is having sex with the woman that he's cheating with and his wife maybe in the same day. Because he's like, cool more times than not.
[19:06] B: Yeah, yeah. I think it made me feel like I had a little bit of control.
[19:11] A: Right. That's what it does. Like, it's on my terms. I've decided it. Yeah. Which it always is on your terms. See, funny story, had a woman one time, there was a guy that she liked, kind of flirted with. She was married, he was married. They're at a conference out of state together. They had a couple drinks and they flirted and she went to his room and, you know, they made out. And she says to me, she goes, what was really great is he didn't go farther than I wanted, than I was comfortable with him going. I said, awesome. I guess I mean, because if he went further than you were comfortable with, we call that rape. So I guess if you want to give him kudos that he didn't rape you, great.
[19:51] B: Right.
[20:01] A: So we want to get that thing straightened out as well for you because whatever that is, there may be an attraction to guys, but we don't want the feeling of disgust after being intimate and sexual with them. Yeah, right, right. And we want you to like, own your own power so that you're okay with you on the inside. That it's always on my terms. Right. Because guys are different than gals in that guys tend to not ever say no. If the gal says, you know, would you? Yes. She didn't even have to get the whole words out. Yes. Like, he's there 3:00 in the morning, she wakes up. Billy Horde. Am I okay? You gotta be to work at 6, though. Yeah, it's okay. I'm a guy. It doesn't take long. We're good. Right? I mean, that's the whole essence of it. Right? Women are not like that. He wakes her up at 3 o'clock, get that thing away from you. Oh, God, gross. What are you doing? Stop. Right? It's a whole different world. So men are always yeses. I had a woman one time, I taught her this thing, and she goes, you're gonna be really proud of me. I went on that first date and I didn't have sex with her. Oh, hey, that's great. Awesome, right? You know, and then she goes, but I did give him a blowjob. I'm like, no, no, you missed the whole fucking point. You missed the point because the guy goes, oh, you mean I don't have to do any. Okay, yeah, sure. So. So, I mean, that's kind of the thing that's off sometimes. Does that make sense? So we want to get that whole thing turned around so that the program's running the right way in you.
[21:37] B: Yeah. Yes. Well, so I, like, I want to be in a relationship. I want to get married. I want to do all the things. But, like, even at this point in my life, like, I've been with Selah for eight weeks now, but prior to that, I was six weeks at home with my family between incarceration and here. And I did not go out and sexually engage with anything or body. And. But, like, out of fear more than anything, like, I don't want to be in those kinds of relationships anymore. I don't want to. I want to be healthy enough to be in a relationship without, like, being scared that I'm going to end up hating this person. Person right after.
[22:29] A: Right. And some of that is I'm not having sex right away.
[22:33] B: Yeah, no.
[22:36] A: Right. That it gets to be totally on my terms. And he's lucky that I'm allowing him to spend any amount of time with me, because in the world of world, a woman needs a man about as much as a fish needs a bicycle, which isn't at all right. The penis wasn't even designed always for her pleasure. It was designed to make a baby. A woman has a body part, her clitoris. Totally purpose sexual pleasure. If a guy had one of those, like, we have a hard enough time not touching ours to begin with. If we had something that. That's all it did all day long. What are you doing?
[23:16] B: Nothing.
[23:17] A: I mean, all day long we get nothing fucking up. Right? So women. It's also the other thing. A woman can have at times an enjoyable sexual experience without an orgasm. And a guy can't if it doesn't end in that for him. He's like, not okay.
[23:34] B: Right, Right.
[23:35] A: But that's because for her, it happens along the way. And for him, it's the ending. She can have more than one. If we could have more than one, we'd not stop. Honey, it's been 265. I know. Let's try to get to 300. Fucking exhausted. Leave me alone. Right? I mean, like that, right? So we want to get that whole system that's kind of backwards and screwed up some from shit that's happened. We want that straightened out so that it's running the right way in you and that you get your own okayness with all of it and your own power. Cool. I know how to do that. All right. What else?
[24:15] B: What else? I guess I, like, have really bad abandonment problems.
[24:23] A: What does that mean?
[24:24] B: So my. Okay, well, so just, I guess a little backstory. My dad left when I was, like, 11. Well, he didn't leave. My mom kicked him out. Kicked him out. He was a cheater. And. And I was like. I was the oldest daughter, so a lot of responsibilities were put on my plate. My mom got two jobs, and I ended up watching my little sister, who was nine years younger than me, and, like, she became, like, my wingman. I literally couldn't do anything without her. And my dad turned into, like, a raging alcoholic and was in and out of jail. And, like, it was, like, really good.
[25:10] A: Male role model right there.
[25:11] B: Yeah. Yeah, he was.
[25:13] A: I don't know why there's neat for men.
[25:15] B: It gets worse, I bet. Okay, so my dad. My dad ended up having sex with my best friend. She was 16. And then, you know, he was on the run for whatever this charge was. Lou. Or. No.
[25:39] A: Having sex with a minor.
[25:40] B: Yeah. Who was my best friend at the time. And I told on him because I found out the next day and was like, mom, this is what I'm hearing. So I ended up telling on my dad, and he ended up getting sent to prison. Prison for it. And so I haven't seen my dad since I was 15, maybe. And then. So, like, I feel like I suffer from a lot of abandonment issues from my dad, but not only my dad. Like, I've always felt like my mom doesn't love me. And I know that she does. Like, I know that she does, but I guess, like, just little situations as a kid. Like, she would come to school for one of my brother's assemblies or whatever, and I'd be like, mom. And she just would not even, like, make eye contact with me. Like, she knew it was a big deal. And then I'd be, like, crying at school because, you know, she didn't see me. But I guess, meanwhile, like, I had all this other stuff at night going on with Clyde, and, you know, she didn't know. And I expected her to know for a while.
[26:57] A: Yeah.
[26:58] B: And she just didn't. And then when I was.
[27:00] A: How many kids did Palm have?
[27:01] B: Four.
[27:01] A: Oh, God.
[27:02] B: Yeah. And dad just left all of us. And so I. I struggle with guys, but also, like, abandonment issues with just anybody, I guess. And I think, like, I stuffed a lot of that as a kid because my little sister.
[27:22] A: Well, no wonder why, when you got attention from that guy Clyde.
[27:26] B: Yeah.
[27:27] A: Did that, like, feel good? Because mom wasn't attentive. Not because she doesn't love you, but because she had a fucking shitload of crap happening. Yeah. Four kids, two jobs, a husband who's alcoholic and cheating. Like, mom had a whole bunch of shit.
[27:46] B: Yeah. Well, now that I'm an adult, like, I. I can look back and see.
[27:50] A: Yeah.
[27:50] B: What my mom was going through at the time and, like, put most of it together and be like, well, you.
[27:55] A: Can get it here. It's not done here.
[27:57] B: Yeah. No. I'm still like.
[27:59] A: So that's where we want to get it shifted.
[28:01] B: Yeah.
[28:02] A: Right. Is at that deeper feeling level. So that what. You know, where you're logical and from an adult, looking back, you also feel at an emotional level.
[28:13] B: Yes. Also, even moving forward on in my life, when I got sentenced to prison, I have two kids, okay. And they were adopted by my grandparents.
[28:26] A: Okay.
[28:27] B: And, like, the second that the adoption was finalized, they made me all kinds of promises, like, we're gonna send you, you know, their report cards, and, like, every two weeks, you know, we'll. We'll make, like, a package. They made all these promises that I did not ask for, like, visitation every couple of months with the kids. And they weren't trying to be mom and dad, and they just wanted to give the kids a start, like, the start that they couldn't give me in my life, because by the time I went and lived with my grandparents, I was gone, lost already and defiant and rejected their authority and whatever. And I was like. I trusted them and believed in them and believed all of their promises. And, like, it was almost easy for me because I want nothing but the best for my children. You know, I want them to have better than what I had, and my grandparents have all the resources and finances to do anything for them. And so I signed, and, like, weeks later, they sent me a letter that was pretty much like, this will be the last time you ever hear from us, and we'll let the kids know that they had a birth mother who could not take care of them and then they moved away. And.
[30:02] A: So that's hard and heavy. Even just you thinking about it. There's a whole bunch of like, upset there, right?
[30:07] B: Yeah. Because it's still something that, like, I'm going through and every day is kind of a struggle.
[30:13] A: Yeah.
[30:13] B: You know, every day, like, I wake.
[30:14] A: Up and how old are the kids now?
[30:17] B: My daughter's about to be 12 and my son's about to be 10.
[30:21] A: Okay.
[30:24] B: So. And I haven't seen them the whole time I was in prison.
[30:29] A: Yeah. But they're actually with people with means. Yeah.
[30:34] B: They're very well taken care of.
[30:36] A: And they're very much loved. And they're loved and taken care of.
[30:41] B: That's been my mantra.
[30:42] A: The difficult thing is that they told you that you were going to be involved, even if it was on the outside.
[30:50] B: Yeah.
[30:51] A: And afterwards you got a letter saying, we're cutting all of that. And that's been really hard.
[31:00] B: Yeah.
[31:01] A: Because if you had known that ahead of time, you wouldn't have signed the paper.
[31:06] B: Well, I think I wouldn't have signed it so easily. Like, I think it would have been hard.
[31:13] A: So then you're mad at yourself for it having not been harder to sign the paper.
[31:17] B: Well, no. So, like, they, they also, like, they not only did they cut me off, which like, I guess in a sense, like, there was a big part of me that was like, you could expect this, you know, you weren't making good choices. You did.
[31:34] A: But they cut mom off too.
[31:35] B: Yeah. Well, then they cut my, my mom off and then they cut my sisters off. And then like. And then they upped and moved and nobody even knew where they were. But like, I found their address Right. On Google.
[31:48] A: Right.
[31:49] B: And like, I've been in contact with my grandparents, but they still are kind of like, you know, we want what's best for you, but we really want what's best for the kids. And their intention, like.
[31:59] A: Yeah.
[32:00] B: Their potential. They, they will. I don't know, they're just not ready to disrupt their lives for, like, the things that.
[32:07] A: Well, they don't know whether you're better.
[32:09] B: Yeah.
[32:10] A: And they're not willing to chance you not being better. That could fuck them up. Your kids. Follow me.
[32:18] B: Yeah.
[32:19] A: So they grandparents have your kids best interest in mind.
[32:23] B: Yes.
[32:24] A: Based on the shit that you went through and stuff that you did. They're not quite sure yet. Yeah.
[32:31] B: I think.
[32:32] A: And they want to make sure that it doesn't fuck the kids up. Right. So as you become More at peace with things, even though we don't like the outcome. As you become more clear, as you get more freedom, that may adjust because you do also want what's best for them.
[33:00] B: Yes, absolutely.
[33:01] A: So the part that you were really intentional about is I want what's best for those kids. I want what's best for my kids. And knowing that me at this stage of my life and what fucked up shit's going on with me, I'm not best for them right now. Right. And what you're also intending is as I get better and I get well, I could be connected at some point. Right. Hope to be well. Yeah. Well, that's you getting better and well. Right. Because then you'll be different. Right. I worked with somebody else whose mom wanted nothing to do with her. And as she changed, as things were better in her, she did healing inside, it changed who she is for mom. Right. Okay. So we want you to be more at peace with what happened. So the hurt and the anger and then the somewhat self critical blame for just quickly and easily. But again, the quickly and easily wasn't because you didn't care about them. It was based on what they had told you and you wanting what's best for your kids. How cool is that? So I'm wondering what it would be like, Trish, for you to actually lighten up on you. Because there's. Right. So what we really want is you to lighten up on you. Because what you had in mind, you doing it quickly, wasn't because you wanted to get rid of them, get them off my plate. No, it's. I wanted them to be in a situation where they had two adults that could care for them and probably, you know, like grandparent probably like looks down and went, well, we fucked up with mom. Yeah, well, we fucked up with our granddaughter. Let's not fuck up the third. Right? I mean, when you haven't done, I'm sure a full genogram yet.
[35:16] B: No, not yet.
[35:17] A: So as that kind of gets, you'll go. Okay. Yeah.
[35:29] B: I think.
[35:31] A: All right, so we got that. I know what to do with that too.
[35:34] B: Thank God.
[35:37] A: This is exciting. I know what to do with all that stuff. I know how to detangle the stuff with that Clyde guy. I know how to get it so that you're much more at peace. I know how to adjust this stuff with like this love hate shit thing with men so that you get your own worth, your own power, your own lovability. I know what to do to take care of the stuff with grandparents Cool. So that's good. Anything else that comes to mind that we would want to be doing for you?
[36:11] B: Not that. No, not that I can think of. I think that's. Those are like the big major.
[36:18] A: Yeah.
[36:19] B: Everything else is kind of things in between that all are literally like the same. Hate or abandonment issues or self critiquing.
[36:30] A: Yeah. Yeah. And that's the other part. That whole feeling like I wasn't quite lovable.
[36:37] B: Yeah. That's definitely my negative self talk. Because I'm not important. I'm not lovable.
[36:43] A: Yeah. Yeah. And you recognize that it wasn't that you weren't important to mom. It's that there's all that other shit going on. You also recognize dad wasn't well. So dad being fucked up couldn't be what I would have wanted from a dad. Because he's fucked up. The problem is that even in knowing that, it still feels like it was about me. If I was more worthy, if I was more lovable. If I was, then they wouldn't have been. Follow me. Notice how that's a little bit there.
[37:33] B: Not a control thing.
[37:34] A: It's not a control thing. It's that when we're little children, one of the major, like, imprints that happen to us in life is that we're trained to believe that good things happen when I'm being good. Right. Santa brings presents. I get praise, I get cookies, I get candy, I get hugs, I get love. Great good things happen when I'm good. We lie to kids. If you're good, your life will be good. You'll get to live happily ever after.
[38:00] B: Yeah.
[38:01] A: Fucking lie.
[38:02] B: Yeah, but it is a lie, right?
[38:04] A: Yeah. But what it also installs is the reverse. If good things happen when I'm being good, it must mean bad things happen because I'm bad. Or there's something wrong with me. Or maybe it's because I'm not good enough. Or maybe it has something to do with my worth or my lovability. See, if I was more lovable, Daddy wouldn't have been a drunk. That's the messaging that happens when we're little children. As if somehow Dad's being a drunk has something to do with my lovability. No, it has something to do with him being fucked up. It's nothing to do with me because it wouldn't matter whether I was in that situation or somebody else at my age was in that situation that was fucked up over there. But because when we're little, we're also trained to believe that I caused the world. Right? It's fine to be a four year old narcissist. It's all about me. Because four year olds are all about me. It's my world. Everybody else lives in it. When my daughter was 4, we drive up and I go, whose house is that? She goes, daphne's house. I go, it's Daphne's house.
[39:00] B: Huh?
[39:01] A: Right. Daddy just pays for, you know, the house and the mortgage and everything that's in the house. Right. It's Daphne's house for totally. That's whose house is. But. Right. So it's fine to be a four year old. We're trained to think that. I cause how everybody feels. You make me happy, you make me sad. You make me angry. You make me glad.
[39:25] B: I did feel like that when I was in prison. My dad like, okay, so when I went into prison, my dad got out of prison. We kind of like, it's like a trade, just. Yes. And I talked to him like two or three times until the money on my grandma on his side's phone was gone. And then I never heard from him again. And he stopped writing me. So I would write him angry letters, and then I'd write him sorry letters. And then I'd write him like, I love you and I don't care if you ever write me back again letters. And then I'd do it all over again. Like my feelings or the way that I was feeling was going to get him to write me back. And I guess this is an important detail that I left out too. My dad committed suicide last year.
[40:09] A: Oh, all right.
[40:10] B: Yeah, there we go.
[40:11] A: So that's pretty heavy too, just thinking about it. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Trisha, we want you to be more okay with all that too.
[40:22] B: Yeah.
[40:22] A: Yeah. Yep.
[40:25] B: Like, I feel okay with it sometimes until, like, now.
[40:28] A: Right. Well, that's because you were talking about all that other stuff.
[40:31] B: Yeah.
[40:31] A: And then there was like, again the internal thing. Well, maybe my, like, contributed to that.
[40:36] B: Yeah.
[40:38] A: Yeah.
[40:38] B: And then I was like, great. I wrote him a letter two weeks before telling him how much of a shit bag he was. But it was okay that I was gonna love him because I loved him and he didn't have to love me back and whatever. And I was like, ugh. But so I guess that's like, also where, like, my abandonment issues come out. And, like, my dad has literally just fallen fueled that bonfire my whole entire life.
[41:04] A: Yeah. What we want to have shifted is at a deep level, getting that you're okay. Yeah. Even if that stuff happened, which means you didn't need whatever you Thought you did from them. In order for you to be. In order for you to make it through prison, in order for you to choose to be in a program that's about bettering you. Right.
[41:37] B: Yeah, I did that.
[41:38] A: I know you did. Right, right. And we want you to feel really, really good about that because again, one of the things that you're going to have awareness of with the genogram is how I kind of got born into the way that it went.
[41:56] B: Yeah.
[41:57] A: That's not all on me.
[41:59] B: As opposed to manipulating the way that it went.
[42:02] A: As opposed to. I'm like to blame for it. All. Right. There were factors going on before you were ever born.
[42:13] B: Sounds right.
[42:16] A: Yeah. And the cool part is you get to change it for you and moving forward. Right.
[42:26] B: Good. That's why. That's what I hoped for.
[42:30] A: Yeah. Yeah. So I'm gonna give you a couple thoughts that I think will be interesting but unusual. Okay. So the lens we tend to look at when we deal with stuff, current, past, future, is to look through the lens. That. That stuff makes me feel this way. Right. That person saying that thing made me feel this way. When that happened, I felt like this. When I did that, it makes me feel this way. It's stuff causes feelings. That lens is not a problem. But it gives us about this much power because we only have two choices. Change stuff. Fuck. We work really hard to change this stuff. Can't change it. I try to avoid it and get the fuck away from it, but in life you've already discovered there's some stuff I can't change. There's some stuff I can't fully, maybe don't fully want to get away from. And then there's a whole bunch of fucked up stuff that I can't get the fucked up stuff to have not happened.
[43:34] B: Yeah.
[43:35] A: So we got to do something else, which is where I get. Come in. So my job is all about adjusting how the automatic, preconscious, emotional part of your brain reacts and responds to the stuff. So the silly example goes, when a lion approaches a zebra, you and I and most everybody else would agree the lion is making zebra scared right now. I don't disagree. But if we looked at it from another lens, we go, wait, isn't it actually when the zebra itself sees, senses, feels, smells, thinks that lion is approaching, it's really the zebra's brain, not the lion, that's immediately making zebra alert, motivated and strong. We call this carrot. It runs away now. Yes. The brain of the zebra is doing it to the zebra in response to the lion approaching. But it's the zebra's brain, right? Isn't that cool? So from that lens, there's been ways in which your brain has been working that causes you to feel bad. By bad, we're meaning the down, the unlovable, or not worthy, the anger, the hurt, the sadness, the remorse, the regret, the guilt, the shame. Your brain might be doing all of that to you in response to stuff. Current shit, past shit, future shit. But you recognize that way of your brain working has been problematic for you. That's what we're gonna get tuned up so that it stops doing that to you. Got it?
[45:08] B: Yes.
[45:09] A: Second part. We know that why we stay haunted, pain, troubled by shit that's happened isn't because it happened. Which sounds fucking weird.
[45:19] B: It does sound weird.
[45:21] A: But I'll give you a different example. If I fell out of a tree when I was 11 and I broke my arm, and if, as I told you, you look at me like, what the fuck's wrong with this guy? His arm is fine. However, if I told you what my Uncle Ed did to me when I was 11 and I started to get, you'd be like, yeah, of course. So isn't it weird? The physical wound goes, well, that heals, should be no issue. Emotional wound, fuck, that stays on forever.
[45:49] B: Yeah.
[45:50] A: Isn't that crazy?
[45:51] B: Yes.
[45:52] A: But it's not that the emotional wound can't heal, heal. It hasn't. Because emotionally, part of the brain doesn't know that it's over. So the deal is, when we go through negative experiences, they short circuit. That moment, it gets frozen, and then it, like, kind of gets disintegrated from the rest of our nervous system. So the rest of me moves on. That part starts. Stays stuck. Which is why anytime I think about it or something reminds me of it, I got all the stuff of it. So where therapy missed is therapy thought that I repressed it. I buried it, I shoved it under the carpet, I locked it behind closed doors. And the therapist's job, you know, like a horror movie, is to provide a nurturing, safe, warm environment and encourage the person to emote, relive those worst moments to get them out like they're eating popcorn at a horror movie. I don't like people to feel bad when they're with me. I actually like them to feel good. And that's the problem. People don't have feelings trapped inside of them. It's not about getting it out. See, what we've all learned to do with the shit that makes us feel bad is figure out ways to not think about it. Fuck, man. That doesn't mean I can't always not think about it, but I figure out ways to not think about it. Most of the time might come in somewhat sideways, but so it's not actually about getting the feelings out. And even if you do, it's like throwing up. You might feel better for a little bit, but then fucking retriggered by the same shit. So it's actually the reverse. It's about getting the good news in to the part of the brain that doesn't know that moment's over. Or moments, because there might be many as soon as the brain gets the good news. Like light switch turning on, pain gone. Not there anymore. Gone, Done. That doesn't have emotional charge. Isn't that cool?
[47:54] B: Yeah.
[47:54] A: So that immediately gets flipped, right? Then what I know actually gets into. So I can feel it, I feel it on the inside that it's not about me, huh? Like, people literally go, well, I'll go think about that thing that you normally would have all that think about it right now. Try to feel it. And they're like, it's not there anymore. Fuck, it's not there anymore. Where'd it go? Like, well, I get it later. I'm like, no, because it's like Santa. Because as soon as you realize that Santa's not real, boom, it's done. You can't go back to believing in him. It's fucking over.
[48:28] B: Yeah, right?
[48:32] A: So that's what we want to be doing so that we can re educate on the inside and you get to be more at peace with the stuff.
[48:41] B: That happened and not let it control.
[48:44] A: Me, which doesn't require any amount of forgiveness. Whether it be forgiving myself for shit that I did or forgiving others for shit they did to me, it's not about that at all. It's literally about getting you free from the effect that it's had so that you can see it clearly. What we already know is that we want you up on the same level, all grown up, so that you're head above, right? We want you to be at peace and comfortable in your own skin. We want you to be a lot lighter, right? We want your brain to be set up in such a way that it's bringing thoughts to your awareness of things that are beneficial, appealing, and possible for you. And as they come to mind, it's like, hey, I could be doing this. And then you're in action, doing it, feeling really good, right? We want the impact of that prior stuff to be completely cleared and gone. I still have data and memory, but it no longer produces any of that stuff. Stuff. So that I might. Good. With me. This is the you that I'm seeing when we're done. Got it? Yes, You. By the way, Trish don't have to see this. You just like me. Okay? Because the question isn't how it's gonna happen that I get you here. The question is, would it be okay?
[50:06] B: Yes, I'd be honored to be there.
[50:09] A: Right? And see, I'd be honored to do it. And that's the third part. And I'll leave you with this. All other forms of therapy, self help, recovery, it's all on you to do the work to get you better. This isn't on you at all to get you better. It's 100% my responsibility. It's my job. So when you go to a dental hygienist, it's totally her job to clean your teeth. Now she needs you there. And you're collaborating and cooperating with her because you both have the same outcome in mind. But it's absolutely her job to do all the work. Same thing with this.
[50:48] B: That requires trust.
[50:50] A: I don't think it does.
[50:51] B: You don't?
[50:52] A: No. You don't have to trust me at all. See, I think trust is a bad idea in the world we live in because it's a really crooked world. And to think that somebody's always going to have my best interest in mind is probably done right. So it's not about trust. It's about collaborating towards a mutual, worthwhile goal that we're both interested in. Which doesn't require you trusting me at all. Because all along the way, it's about, hey, this is where we're going. We're doing things that are designed to get you here. And you and I can be on the same page with that. Does that make sense? So it's not about trusting at all. I do. I tell people all the time it's a bad idea to trust. If I'm at a red light and light turns green, I do not trust that nobody's running a red. I look, I proceed to go. But I look through the intersection first to make sure nobody's coming. Yeah, right?
[51:43] B: Yeah.
[51:44] A: I don't trust that my house won't catch on fire. It's why I have a fire detector now. I don't think it's going to. I didn't buy this house when this one's gonna go up in flames one day. But I'm glad I have the fire detectors. Why? Because they are Going to alert me at the soonest moment that I can do something about it. Because the sooner I learn about something, the more options I have and how to handle it. Does that make sense?
[52:09] B: Yeah.
[52:09] A: Right. People go, well, you know, you've been married and it's going to be 19 years in November. And they go, well, like, you must trust your wife. I go, no, it's not that I trust or not trust. Trust is the invisible leg of the table. It only shows up when there's a lack of it. What I do is I pay attention. You know, we know each other. So if all of a sudden her behavior was a little bit awkward and weird, different. Like, she started being secretive. Like, she'd have her phone out, and then I'd walk by and she'd flip it over. Okay, something's off there. Like, what is she not wanting me to see? Right. That would be weird. If she goes, I'm going out, working out, and then three hours later, she comes back and she didn't have any of her workout clothes. Like I'd be paying attention. Right. So it's not whether I trust or not trust. I don't think she's going to go do something, but I'm not naive enough to think she never would. So it's always about trust. We think it's over there. See, trust we need to have in here that I have a good thermometer, that I've got a really good compass. Got it. So where we actually want you to develop trust is in you, not out here. Because that's a bad idea. Thinking that somebody will always have my bad best interest in mind is bad. That's when I can get blindsided. Okay. My daughter goes, daddy, I want to show you something in the room. She's gonna walk me through the house. Close your eyes. You know, she's leading me through. I'm looking. Cause she. I know her intention isn't to bang me into the counter, but I'm not so sure she won't.
[53:49] B: Yeah. Okay.
[53:52] A: Got it. So it's not about that at all. It's about our collaboration. Yeah. And that's what we also want to develop in you is that trust in you that I'm seeing things clearly for what they are, and I'm able to navigate my course in a way that's best for me. Got it?
[54:16] B: Yes.
[54:17] A: Cool. Any questions before we stop? For now.
[54:21] B: How often?
[54:22] A: Oh, no, we're gonna get for a chunk of time. Like, probably like three hours. Like, all at once. Done. It's gonna change it. Like Literally change it. Like, four things people tell me. One, the shit that used to really bother them, it's not bothering them. Two, the intensity in which they experience stress less, way less. The frequency in which it used to spike for them, way less. The duration in which an upset lasts, weigh less. So instead of having to climb over the mountain to the other side, it's like a speed bump. Still fucking annoying, but you're beyond it pretty quick. Okay, yeah, I know that sounds weird, right? Like, how can you. But, you know, that's like, if you go to a surgeon, the surgeon is going to like, maybe you got a problem with your knee. Surgeon's gonna take an X ray, maybe an mri, find out what's wrong with the knee. Once the surgeon knows what's wrong with the knee, the surgeon's gonna schedule surgery to fix it. He's not gonna do it on a weekly basis. Okay. So the first thing we're gonna do is make one incision next week. You come back next week, we're gonna. He finishes the fucker.
[55:25] B: Yeah. Right.
[55:26] A: So that when you leave, it's done with this kind of like, it's better to be task versus time oriented. We want to actually change it so that when you leave, it's better. And then we'll get back together, like, in several weeks to be checking in, because you're going to be noticing all this stuff that's new and different and better for me. Great. And that's where we're headed. Yeah. You did great. Cool. All right, so we'll stop with that for now.
