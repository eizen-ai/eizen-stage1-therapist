[00:00] A: Okay. So today is the 6th of November, Tricia. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is beneficial, transformative for you, it may be made available in teaching and training other professionals and how to do this kind of work. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Yes.
[00:17] B: Yes.
[00:18] A: All right, cool. So what I wrote down from the last time that we were in here is that you have a love hate relationship with men. Sometimes more hate than love.
[00:29] B: It's always love and then hate.
[00:31] A: And that you were like concerned, like, if I ever go to date later on in life, like, how the hell is that gonna work for me? Yes. Right. Then you mentioned that there's stuff that happened with Clyde and that there's some still connection and that you thought he was gonna kill you at 18, but he didn't. But you actually got yourself away and in a place that he couldn't. Yes. But you still stayed in contact with him while you were there.
[00:53] B: Yeah.
[00:54] A: And there's that whole tangled mess with that kind of crap. Right. You had mentioned to me that mom wasn't always like, there available. Like she might have been there, but wasn't like actually like there. And that may have led to why that was. Their dad left like I guess when you were like 11. So that was also challenging because, like there's like four of you and you were the oldest, and so there was all that kind of thing going on. Okay. Then you had mentioned to me that you had. Well, so you had grandparents. Yes. Right. That and those grandparents. Because this is a crazy story, right? You have grandparents that didn't do a good job with your mom, didn't always do a great job with you. But when you had a child, said, we're gonna take that child. You'll have access. And then when you said, okay, cool, they said, fuck you, we're not gonna give you access at all. And you're like, both. So there's that aspect of things. Then there's like he went to jail and served like eight and a half of a ten year sentence. Okay. And then like you said, like, I have some like, abandonment issues. I have no idea why. I mean, that just seems like. Right. Wait a minute. So like these people that I think are there that are going to take care of and I thought were going. Are like acting in ways that are very contrary to what I thought that was going to be. Right. So. And then you said that there's also a tendency for you to be hard on you more negative, critical thoughts kind of get down on you at times. And then you had mentioned sometimes I don't feel like I'm, you know, good enough. Yeah. So that's the kind of stuff that I wrote down. Yeah. In terms of what we talked about, out of what I said or had found, is there anything that I missed?
[02:47] B: No, that's it in a nutshell. Up to date.
[02:54] A: Cool. Right. And you're out of jail, which is really cool. Yes. Yeah. Right. What was it that had you go.
[03:03] B: A violation of probation.
[03:05] A: A violation of probation had you get 10 years?
[03:08] B: Yes.
[03:08] A: Fuck, man.
[03:10] B: Well.
[03:12] A: There'S other stuff too.
[03:14] B: No, so it's a really. It's a long story. The original charges I got when I was only 15. Yeah. I was 15 years old and it was a robbery gone wrong. So two people ended up losing their lives. And originally because I was a youthful offender, under the youthful offender status, they could only sentence me up to six years. So they split it. Probation, house arrest, two years, house arrest, four years probation. On my last year, I violated with a technical. So I guess ultimately in the long run, 10 years on a case where two people lost their lives, that's not a bad deal.
[04:03] A: Okay.
[04:04] B: Yeah. Especially I have co defendants who will never be out.
[04:11] A: But were they the people that actually.
[04:13] B: Yes, they were inside the house and killed.
[04:16] A: The people who died, they knew what was going on. You were outside.
[04:20] B: Yeah.
[04:23] A: That's great. Hey, we're gonna go do this. Okay, cool. I'm 15. I'll do it.
[04:27] B: Yeah.
[04:27] A: I mean, because when we're 15, we're not the sharpest tools in the shed. We're not like, we don't have consequence based thinking, we don't have foresight.
[04:36] B: I definitely did not think that far ahead or in that direction at all.
[04:40] A: In any way, shape or form. Right. No, no. Right, right. Because here's the funny part. If you had known ahead of time, prior to any of that happening, that that's what was gonna go down, would you have gone with them? No. Right. See, right. No, see, that's the thing, and I was just curious why I asked that question is if you have had any bad feelings about having gotten involved in that, like, you know, any guilt or regret or remorse. Because my whole thinking goes, well, I can have that from here and I can from here, look back at the earlier me and go, fucking idiot. What were you thinking?
[05:22] B: Definitely.
[05:23] A: Right. But if we look at it clearly, if we were to be sitting here now and we were to float back along the timeline prior to you ever going and that you back then has the foresight and knows everything that you know in terms of how it went down, would she have gone? No, no. Right. Notice how clear that is. And see, the thing is with that, we can't have regret and remorse or guilt and shame about something that we didn't know was going to happen. And that earlier you back then didn't know any of that because we already know if she had, she wouldn't have gone. Right, Right. So we actually want to lighten up on her a little. Right. Because she didn't always have the best circumstances surrounding her or the best people around that were guiding, helping her on the path. See, again, right, like it wasn't like all on her. And that's why we want to lighten up on her. And what I shared with you the last time, just a little bit, how we're going to go about changing things is changing the way that the brain responds to stuff. I gave you the silly example. I said when a lion approaches a zebra, we all agree that the lion makes the zebra scared. Yeah, of course. But then we go, wait, no, Isn't it really the zebra's brain making the zebra alert, motivated and stronger? As soon as the zebra itself sees senses, smells, thinks, feels lion coming, it's zebra's brain that's doing it to zebra. Right. And when we look at it through that lens, we have more power. Because in life there's a lot of shit that has happened that we can't get the bad shit to have not happened. Right. There's a lot of stuff in life that either I can't change or can't fully get away from, or maybe don't fully want to get away. Right. So we want to have another way to adjust stuff, make sense. And then with that whole part of having been negative and critical or not feeling like I'm as good as, or worthy or lovable, we want to get that whole thing shifted and cleared. Because again, from a long distance and outsider perspective, you have a lot more wisdom now than you did when you were a little child. Meaning when you were a little child, there would have been thoughts back then that mom being absent, dad leaving, must have something to do with me. Because when we're little, we are totally hypnotized to believe that good things happen. When I'm being good little kids fucking lied to all the time. The basis of our culture is lie to those little kids, everybody in authority. And it's not just lie, lie, but know you're lying. Like it's one thing to lie, but not realize that you're really lying. It's another thing to just perpetuate the lies. Good happens when you're good. I mean, every single TV show for little children purport the same messages. You know, good things happen when we're good. Look what happened to the bad person. Bad things only happen to bad people because they're bad. Great. Mm. All the stories, right? What do good children get once a year? Some strange dude who's always watching them, which is a little bit disturbing to begin with. Old fat man watching little children. That should give us our first indication that the guy's a pervert, right? And then we place our children on his lap. Okay, who came up with that idea? Put the kid on the pervert's lap, right? But we have the messaging that when you're a good boy, when you're a good girl, this strange character will drop gifts off to you just because you're good. And if you're not, you get coal. Which kids nowadays go, what the hell is that? Right? They've got those messages that when you're bad, bad things happen to you. They happen to you because you are bad or you're being bad, or somehow there's something not okay in you. That's how it always gets labeled, right? The little kid who's struggling in class because of the way that the teacher's teaching doesn't have the wherewithal to go, you know what? That teacher is not teaching in a style that's good for my ability to learn. No. The little kid thinks, well, I must be stupid, right? I've got this. I've got this guy who's a ninth grader right now, and he struggles in math. And of course, because he struggles in math, and he doesn't want to look stupid. He fools around, and then he gets in trouble, and then he gets kissed out of class, which has this perpetual cycle. I go, you know, might be better. Might just. I'm gonna throw this out there just as a thought. I said, you may want to say to the teacher, like, I really struggle with this, so. And I don't want to look, like, stupid and dumb in front of all the other kids. So I don't raise my hand to ask a question because I'm embarrassed that I would even be having a question, because, like, they all know, and I'm gonna show off that I don't know, right? So I'm embarrassed about it, right? And, you know, is there a way that I could get, you know, like, extra help from you? He goes, really? Yeah. You know, kind of put it out there that, like, it's confusing and hard for you and you don't want to feel like dumb in front of all the other kids and then get the teacher actually involved in helping you because like she's a teacher and their whole thing is like to teach and they actually go to school and they like it. Right? So he's like, oh, I'll have to give that a try. Right? Yeah, that might be useful versus being the behavior problem because you're the behavior problem. Because she's giving you time to work on the assignment and you don't understand it. Yeah, Isn't that interesting? Right? So, so, but we all have those messaging. Good things happen when I'm being good. Great. Bad things happen when I'm being bad. So nobody shocked, let's say 27 year old got a promotion at work, right? Co workers are excited, let's go out and celebrate. So they go out and celebrate. One of the co workers brought a friend who had a roommate. Great. That guy was there. He seemed to be pretty nice. He was celebrating, high fiving. He actually bought her a couple drinks. Right? Okay, cool. This is great. You know, he's kind of cute, so she flirted a little bit with him. Right? But you know, I'm having a great time because I got the promotion. He even says, hey, you know what, you're on the way home, I'll drop you off. Nice guy. She doesn't live in the best neighborhood. So he's like, well, I'll just walk you to your door, nice guy. And then of course she goes to get in and then he forces himself in and then rapes her. What the fuck happened to the nice guy? But see, here's the crazy part. Trisha, nobody would be shocked if she came back and said, you know what, I don't know how I'm ever going to forgive myself for being so stupid and careless and putting myself in that dangerous situation. And we go, what? What? A co worker's roommate probably what? What? But because it was bad immediately, it's my fault, right? And in our culture, the system goes, well, I mean, you did show cleavage. Oh, so because I showed a little cleavage that meant he could do whatever he wanted to my body. Like, what the fuck, man? Right. But we have those messaging that gets installed, of course. Because it must be my fault in some way, shape or form, even if logically I know it wasn't at all. That's the messaging make sense.
[13:52] B: Yeah.
[13:52] A: So what, what do we go through well, life in and of itself isn't a bowl of cherries, right? We all have shitty things that happen. There's not a single one of us that makes it through the human experience without going through awful shit. Some people more than others, some people bigger ones than others. But there's not a single one of us that has had nothing but good things happen all of our life. And if I meet that person, I'm going to punch them in the face and go, how about now, huh? What do you think? You haven't had one thing Kick him in the balls. How about now, right? You know, well, I didn't want you to be excluded, right? But the problem with that messaging that good things happen when I'm good, if it's bad, it's my fault. Well, we go through negative experiences, boom, they slam into consciousness, boom, they get stuck, boom, they happen. And because they've happened, what must have something to do with me, right? So the four year old whose next door neighbor touched her. Well, yeah, she was wearing a nightgown, right? Because that's what she wore to go to bed. And there wasn't anything that she was doing that would have lended that guy to go, oh yeah, no, she's totally wanting me, right? You're like, what the fuck is going on? Right? But of course, at 4 she's gonna feel because he's telling, don't you tell anybody. Because they're thinking, oh, now it's layered in, I'm bad. And then that thing can perpetuate multiple times through years. Of course, because it's about me, right?
[15:33] B: The common denominator, right?
[15:35] A: Through all that stuff must be me, right? I mean, that has to be what it is, right? And even if some of touching felt good, it wasn't because I wanted it. And so that gets confusing for people all the time too, because, well, I knew it was wrong, but some of it felt good. So was my body betraying me or like somehow, like did I really want it even though I knew it was bad? No, none of those things are true. When a body part is touched in a certain way, certain body parts, they're designed to feel good though. That's the design of them. So of course that's gonna happen, right? So that's part of the problem. We got all those negative things that have been lodged in along the way that create programming in us. So now I'm more reactive, now I'm more sensitive now I immediately go to it's about me. Even if I logically know, well, you know, that Person's shit is their shit. I don't feel like it. I feel like it's really about my worth and my loveability and see what is our brain left to do. If shit is active, it doesn't matter what I know up here. At a deeper level, and I'll give you a different example. I had this woman one time, she was raped when she was like 14 by a large, fat, grotesque guy, black in nails, who happened to have a red bandana around his neck. Right. 40 years later. 40 years. So that happened at 14. She's 54. She went to a holiday party, introduced to somebody that worked with a friend of hers who happened to be a, you know, tiny like 4 foot 11, blonde, couldn't hurt a fly, maybe 100 pounds soaking wet, but happened to be wearing a lovely red silk scarf around her neck. And the woman's like, I don't know, there's something about her I just don't like. What is it? Is she mean? Is she rude? Is she nasty? Did she have bad breath? I mean, what was it? No, she was actually very pleasant and friendly. But I don't ever want to see her again. And we're going, right? And of course, the issue when the thing happened with the yucky guy had nothing to do with the red scarf, the bandana. That was not the disturbing part of the issue. What he did. That's the disturbing part, but it happened at the same time. They get stuck. I had a woman who was repulsed by Nilla wafer cookies. Little teeny cookies. She was so distraught that her best friend had the nerve to put them in banana pudding when she brought them over for dessert along with her crazy right now come to find out. When she was 9, mom and dad sat her down to tell her they were divorcing. She happened to be eating a Nilla wafer. Crazy, right? Right. Now, it wasn't logical. Clearly the logical brain doesn't go well. Nilla wafers mean divorce.
[18:48] B: Right?
[18:50] A: Just like red scarfs mean rape. Logically, that makes no freaking sense at all. But the part of our brain that directs all the emotions isn't logical. And it's just looking for something that's similar. And if it's got even the smallest, tiniest little bit of similarity to any of the shit that was painful, it activates.
[19:13] B: It's the same.
[19:14] A: Yes, because for the rabbit, and that's what you're going to begin to understand more, the part that directs our feelings works like an animal animal in terms of survival, the sooner and the more intensely it Responds to stress, threat. The better chance it has to survive. Right? The rabbit who heard the twig snap and ran. That rabbit's still around. The one who heard the twig snap thought it was George. Oh, fuck. That dude's not here anymore. So it got bred out, right? So we also have that same thing. And that's why a lot of times somebody can know better, but doesn't feel any better. I realized that what my uncle did to me when I was 11 was not my fault. I realized that it had to do with him being off and screwed up stuff with him. I even get that some of the touching felt good or the attention felt good, but not because I wanted it in that way and not because I'm gay, but because the body touched in certain ways are designed to feel good. Totally get it. I've even done the intellectual job of forgiving him for what he did. Why the hell inside do I still feel all the guilt and the shame and the hurt and the anger and the sadness and the pain? You would think once I got it, I got it. But no, it doesn't matter what I know up here until it changes. Down here, it doesn't change. Isn't that crazy?
[20:48] B: No.
[20:48] A: So what's happening now? I mean, it is. You're going, no, I get it. Yeah.
[20:53] B: No, it makes tons of sense, doesn't it?
[20:58] A: Right? And that's why therapy doesn't get emotional things better. Because therapy goes, well, here's a new way to think about it. Great.
[21:07] B: I did years of therapy, right, Right.
[21:11] A: Therapy goes, oh, yeah, no, I got it. I even in therapy can have a good understanding of what my triggers are, where they came from, how come I have them, how this thing relates to that. And knowing that still doesn't fucking stop me from getting triggered. Right? You would think with all that work. But the problem is we are not intellectual beings who have the ability to feel. We are feeling beings, primary, who secondarily have the ability to think. And all of that is first and the error. And that's what always amazes me still to this day, because I've been doing this kind of work with people since 2006. So it still blows my mind that the conventional wisdom is, well, when the person went through the bad experience, they weren't able to fully express it. So they buried it, they suppressed it, they locked it behind the closed door, they put it underneath the carpet, they tried to pretend. And that our job as professionals are, you know, to perform, you know, the nice, warm, encouraging, supportive, loving, caring, nurturing environment and Then encourage the person to re experience, get out the worst moments of their life. Kind of like I'm watching a horror movie, eating popcorn. Keep crying. No, it's really good. Keep it up. And I'm like, fuck, man, that is the wrong way. Because people aren't troubled by what they went through because it happened. And of course, the best way that we all have to deal with awful shit that makes us feel bad is to figure out fucking ways to not think about it and go this way. Doesn't mean it still doesn't come out sometimes. So it's not about getting the bad feeling out. It's literally the reverse. Because the error is part of the brain froze the moment and it got disintegrated. So it's stuck by itself as an island, not connected to the rest of the nervous system, but always hyperon. So the error isn't about, oh, we gotta get it out. It's about getting the good news in that what happened stopped. That the memory is different than the experience. Because where it's frozen, memory and experience literally are the same freaking thing. Isn't that crazy? Yeah, right? So we want to get that whole thing to be unplugged as soon. And this is to me again, probably most remarkable, amazing thing, because as soon as the brain emotionally realizes that what happened stopped, that it's data about something that's finished, as dramatic as a light switch done. Like the pain that I had just a moment ago thinking about that, it's not there anymore. And I go, what? Like it's not there. Like what happened? Secondarily, it doesn't reactivate again. Because when the brain gets that it's information instead of happening, it goes, oh, never mind. It won't go in reverse, right? Like, you can't unlearn that Santa is fake. Once you've learned it, once you've learned that he's not a real character, which, you know, today's world, kids are a little bit smarter. How in the does a guy get around the whole world in a day? It's a big freaking place. There's, you know, 300 plus million people just in the United States. There's 7 billion in China. How the fuck does this guy get everywhere, right? He's got fast reindeer and they don't get hungry at all, right? And it's with reindeer.
[25:36] B: And no bathroom breaks.
[25:37] A: Nope. No, they're on. But the dude is eaten at every single house, right? He has got a bladder, though, that is made of steel, right? How does the guy not have an upset stomach? At the end of the day.
[25:58] B: I stopped thinking about it as soon as I saw my parents.
[26:02] A: Right? So that's the thing. Once your brain gets it, it can't unlearn it. It can't go back to thinking it's happening. The only reason that it was staying troubling is because the brain thought it was happening still. So that part's done. It's like, done done. Then what I know actually begins to integrate it. So I totally fully get it. And then my brain no longer confuses the similar stuff as same. It sees similar as separate and different. Right? So the gal I had, this gal one time, she had a lot of yucky stuff happen to her. But like, if her husband touched her back. Cause all sorts of. Because that's where they would do that. We cleared it out. Now her husband's sitting there like it's gone. And she goes, well, no, we gotta try it. Like, there's never been a time where I haven't been. Go ahead, do it. And he does it. And she's like, it's incredible. Cool, right? Isn't that cool?
[27:08] B: Yeah.
[27:09] A: It was neat to see that. She's like, what? This has never been like that ever. But it got cleared, right? And that's the thing that we want to be doing. We want to get the impact that it's had gone. So that instead I get to be at peace, that I'm good with me, that I lighten up, that I see things clearly for what they were and what they are. And I've got more freedom in moving around the stuff that might come my way. That's where we're headed. Got it?
[27:44] B: Yeah.
[27:48] A: So that being said, I'm gonna lay in two other pieces that I think are useful. One, it's always beneficial to know how you want to be when we're done. Right? So first of all, when you told me this step stuff the last time, and even as I'm talking about different things, there's been different emotions that you've been. As we've been talking about stuff. So I want you to do this real quick. Think about whatever you need to think about around any of the yucky stuff. Just feel a tiny little bit of the bad feelings right now. Right. Notice how it doesn't take long. Right? But here's the cool part. You on purpose did it because I asked you to. You were being cooperative. That wouldn't be a problem if it only happened when you chose to do it. The problem is your brain does that kind of shit to you at times. That you're not deciding. That's the glitch. Right? And we've lit up the problem. So now the you that I'm seeing, that kind of feeling, the you that I'm seeing, she remembers having had it. But if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't know how to get it. It's like, gone. Meaning the lingering effect of all the prior stuff where there's been the hurt or the guilt or the anger or the shame or the resentment or the pain or the sadness, that's gone. So the you that I'm seeing is emotionally present. She's at peace. Her mind is clear. The you that I am seeing is much lighter. So that she's seeing things clearly for what they were and what they are. The you that I'm seeing feels much more centered and whole. Feeling really good with who she is on the way to creating more of who she's becoming. Feeling really good about where she's headed. Got it. This is the you that I'm seeing. Make sense? So the question, Tricia, isn't how it's going to happen that I get you here. The question is, would it be okay? Yes. Right. See if we got a green light. Right? Exactly. Now we've got a green light. Your brain is organizing. Next, I want to give you a way of understanding, kind of like body stuff, because to me, it's really interesting. Most of the time, most of us walk around thinking that we are our bodies. But what if you're not your body? What if you have a body? What if your body is totally yours, but it isn't you? Here's what I mean. My mom, when she was 17, lost the tip of her finger in a snow cone machine accident, right? So when she goes over to visit people now, they don't say to her, susie, I am so glad almost all of you could come over. They don't say that to her because even though that part is missing, she's all there, right? Neuroscience will tell us that there's not a single cell within your body today. That's the same as it was when you were little. It's all been replaced, yet you're still you. Your feet alone are longer than they were when you were two, yet you're still you. Weird, right?
[31:14] B: Yeah.
[31:15] A: So we could start saying, you have a body, it's totally yours, but it isn't actually you. So think of a time when you were outside in nature and you see something and it's beautiful. Like the moment you're looking at it, you're like wow. What is it that you see?
[31:31] B: The sunset.
[31:32] A: Yeah. And isn't there a moment that as you're seeing the sunset, you feel both that sense of, like, peace and excitement and it's all at the same time? And people would say to you, well, dove, just being there and seeing that gives you those kinds of feelings. But if we looked at it from another lens, we go, wait, no. What if seeing that and being there simply drew your awareness down and in towards your center? Because at your center, you always are peaceful and excited. Kind of like if I'm at the campfire, I'm cold, and bring my hands down towards the flames, and I go, holy shit, this fire is getting hot. Is it really that the fire is getting hotter? No, I am totally becoming more aware of the heat.
[32:21] B: You're getting closer.
[32:23] A: That's right. So we know that in your life, through lots of experiences and situations, there have been times that awareness has been anywhere but at your center. The stressors, the upsets, the angers, the hurts, the pains, the guilt, the shame. But no matter where awareness has been always at your center. You're peaceful and excited in the same way. You know, two of us are in here now. How do you know it? You look around. Your senses bring in the data. Your intellect organizes it. We call that knowledge. Sometimes people call knowledge light. So we'll call it light of knowledge. Let's say that at your center, it's a brighter light. It's light of wisdom. So now we've got knowledge and wisdom. And, you know, I work with all sorts of different people and all sorts of different stuff that happened. But I remember working with this one girl, and it was shit that happened with her older brother when she was little, like five or six. He used to take Matchbox cars, drive them up her leg and park them in her. So we had a lot of around all of that, plus other shit that happened along the way. But as we were working together, we totally cleared it out. And I said to her, I go, you know, all of that pain, the hurt, the anger, I go, where was it? And she looks at me, huge glowing smile, and she goes, it's gone. I don't feel it. I know. Isn't that cool? She goes, yeah. I go, but my question was, where was it? She started thinking, and I go, well, like, was it at the surface level? And she's like, no, it wasn't an intellectual thing. I go, oh, maybe it was buried in your center. And she's like, dude, really? How could that stuff survive in light where I'm Peaceful and excited. I said, well, then where was it? She goes, well, it was hiding. I'm, like, hiding where? She goes, well, in the shadows. In the shadows. She goes, yeah, in between the lights. I said, well, what happened? She goes, the lights have joined, shadows are gone. I'm at peace. I said, well, that's cool. And that's when we started talking about bodies that you're not it. It's yours, not you. Then she goes, okay. I go, well, did you know that you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? She goes, what do you mean? I go, well, you know, you think thoughts, but you're not the thinker of them. I go, well, you have a brain, yeah, and your brain is yours, and your brain is the thinker of your thoughts, but you are not your brain. Just like you are not your heart or your lungs or your kidneys. You have it. It's yours. It's not you. She goes, oh. I go, well, and feelings, right? You have them. They're your feelings, but they're not you. Because there's multitudes of different ways you feel at different times. Angry, happy, sad, glad. But you're you regardless of how you feel. I go, and you're also not what you do. She goes, come on. I go, really? You're not what you do. Because there have been many things you've done through life. And when you stop doing one of those things, you didn't stop existing, so you can't be what you do. Which led us to, like, the craziest question of all. If you're not what you do or your feelings or your thoughts or your body, well, then, what the heck are you? Right? Weird. So I said, let's just say, for our purposes, that the who you are is what you became aware of as you see the sunset. That the who you are is the light at the center. And what's really cool about light is that it can't be touched or hurt or harmed. It's absolutely whole and complete, totally indestructible. And I say that, Tricia, because when people come in to see me, you'll never believe this, but they fuck up identity words. They tell me things like they're depressed, they're anxious, they're obsessive, they're shy. They think that the way they feel is who they are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm pissed when I come back and you're like, what happened? Go, oh, he was an asshole. What did he do? Well, he put me on one of those Chairs. You're like, yeah. And my head went down and my feet went up. You're like, yeah. He positioned the light right in my eyes. I can't see. He takes a cold instrument, shoves it inside of me. And you're like, oh, my God. And you're what? And I go, trisha, I'm at the dentist. My mouth. But it's the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother. I said, when you were little, your brother, he messed with your stuff. And she goes, he did. And for a long time, it hurt my feelings and it screwed up my thinking. And then she looked at me and she started having that same peaceful glow. And she goes, but you know what? He never actually touched me. He messed with my body. It screwed up my thinking, it hurt my feelings, but he never touched me. I said, whoa, that is powerful. And so, as we're organizing towards this you, we can also add unconscious response by symbolizing this future you. I say symbolizing because advertisers know that the deeper parts of our brain respond to symbols. That's why they always pair them with products. It's why when you see a big yellow arch on the side of the road, you go, oh, McDonald's. It's why when you see a swoosh mark on somebody sneaker, you go, oh, that's Nike. Even though you also can realize that the yellow arch and the swoosh have nothing to do with cheeseburgers, athletic apparel, but they're symbols of the company. Right? Our mind responds to symbols. We want to get a way to symbolize the you who's present, who's clear, who's at peace, who's centered, who's free. And we can use a wild animal or something out in nature, something up in the sky, something that grows from the ground, a natural formation of the earth. What comes to mind to symbolize this? You. That's a start.
[38:42] B: I don't know.
[38:48] A: I know because we're making it up. How could you know ahead of time? But if we were to symbolize a Y you, who's present, who's clear, who's at peace, who's free. Wild animal, something out in nature, something up in the sky. What comes to mind?
[39:10] B: A hawk.
[39:11] A: A hawk? Yeah. As you see the hawk, is it moving or still?
[39:15] B: It's flying.
[39:16] A: Yeah. Like soaring or flapping.
[39:19] B: Soaring.
[39:19] A: Yeah. Beautiful. So now we've got the hawk becoming a powerful self symbol. We're going to do some processes that utilize neuroscientific brain levers that are designed to put your body more into a state of rest. And the reason that we want your body at rest is because that's what allows all accelerated healing to happen. Right. Whether you have a cold or a flu or surgery. What do we tell people to do? Rest. Because that enables the body to do the internal healing make sense at a more accelerated pace. So the first lever that I'm going to teach you is the silliest lever there is because it's about slightly lowering your jaw. Now, I don't mean like, ah, I mean just a tiny little bit, maybe the width of an index finger. And I'm going to demonstrate. You can do it with mouth closed. Doesn't matter, but it's just a little bit. Right? You slightly lower your jaw. Second lever. I'm so silly. The second lever is you're going to rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. So you slightly lower your jaw and you rest your tongue. The third lever is you're going to look up and out and think soaring Hawk, as you take a slow breath in. So your jaw is lowered, you're resting your tongue. That's right. Look up and out through think Hawk, and breathe in. And that's the first part of that. That was pretty easy, right? Yeah. Next we're going to do the exact same thing. This time though, after inhaling, you exhale. So again, your jaws lowered, you're resting your tongue, you look up and out, you think hawk as you breathe in. And then you exhale. Beautiful. And notice that as you're doing this, your breathing is becoming just a little bit slower and a little bit deeper than how you automatically breathe. And as you're doing all of that right now, just check. How's your body beginning to feel? It is beginning to feel more relaxed. Isn't that a cool thing? Right, so we want to add to that. This time though, we'll do the same exact thing. But when you exhale, you close your eyes. So your jaw's lowered, you rest your tongue, you look up and out. Think Hawk, as you breathe in, exhale and close your eyes. Good. And now you can open your eyes. Same thing. But now we want to expand awareness. So when we're really stressed, we're in high body levels of beta. Beta is fine for most waking states because it's good for conversation, concentration, focus, arithmetic, that kind of stuff. Not so good when it gets elevated. Where we're moving towards is alpha waves. Alpha waves are highly correlated with what surfers like to call flow states, with what athletes call being in the zone. It's more of an alert, relaxed state. Kind of like how I'd want to be if I'm driving. I don't want to be white knuckle in the fucker. I want to be driving. Noticing what's well behind sensing space. And that's the other thing we're going to add. See, if I were to ask you, Trisha, to tell me what you notice in this room, you would be looking around and you would tell me all the objects you see, whether. Whether it's lamps or artwork or couches or chairs or desks or what have you. What you wouldn't tell me is, well, you know, I'm kind of noticing the space that's in between me and the doors over to my left. You wouldn't say that. You know, I kind of can sense the space between you and me and how the space actually goes well beyond you towards the wall. You're not going. You know what? I actually even notice the space, like how much there is, you know, from the top of my head to the ceiling. Right. Because space is the thing that we disappear. Like we don't ever see it. Right. Isn't that weird?
[43:35] B: Yeah, that's really weird.
[43:37] A: But see, when you bring your awareness and you notice more of the space, it starts to move your body brain waves into alpha. So again, you're going to slightly lower your jaw, you're going to rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. You're going to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and a little bit deeper. Noticing that in your mind's eye you can think of that soaring hawk. That's right. But you can also come across and look over at me. Notice that as you see me with your peripheral vision, you can also see my fingers wiggling. Right. Which means you're with peripheral vision becoming more aware of space both in between you and me and beyond me. Space towards the sides of the room, space behind you, space underneath, space up above. And even begin to notice that the space goes actually well beyond the confines of this room. How space actually goes all the way out in all directions and in all ways, and that it's unending. Isn't that kind of cool? And as you're noticing more of the space, again, just check. How's your body feeling now? What are you noticing?
[45:01] B: I'm right here.
[45:03] A: You are becoming more and more present. Right. And it's a little bit quieter up there. That's right. Because we're in the state of connecting towards where we're headed, which is this future you, that's been symbolized by the hawk. And just as I said to that teenager, sometimes it's about getting out from under and being up above, having the bird's eye view. So we know what it's like to see the hawk up above, soaring, flying, gliding and moving, maybe making big turns and curves. But I wonder what it would be like to imagine being like the hawk, way up above it all. So again, you're going to slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. Breathing in this way that's a little bit slower and deeper. Noticing that you can, in your mind's eye, think about that hawk soaring. You can also see me. You can notice my fingers out here. You can connect more to the space, right? How the space goes out in all directions. Space in between, space behind, space underneath and up above. And then again, just for a moment, close your eyes and imagine what it would be like to float up and out of your body, beyond the ceiling, beyond the roof, so that you're way up above it all, like the hawk. Soaring, flying, moving, making those big wide turns and curves, arching angles, soaring up above and over it all freely moving, gliding, flying. That's right. Bring your awareness back down and into your body, reassociating inside. You. Take a deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And again. Those short moments that eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself? You are, aren't you? That's right. And see the coolest part, Knowing that you're here is all that there is for you to do to heal. Meaning in a moment, I'm gonna ask your unconscious to travel back through negative things that have happened in your own history. Stuff that normally when you think about it and your mind's gonna begin to group again, categorize those things, and then it's going to narrow, pinpointing. Bring a particular experience to your awareness and see what there is for you to do is just intend to emotionally be with me. And there's a really good reason that you want to be doing that. First is this is what's happening and that isn't. Two, we're working on a mutual worthwhile goal that we're both interested in. Three, I am way more fun than sucky stuff, and I don't have to try hard. So I want you with me. Got it. And that's the intention. Because we're going to collaborate towards that same goal. Makes sense. So what's going to happen, Trish, is your unconscious is going to travel back through experiences It's a warehouse of everything you've gone through, the good, the bad, the ugly. And it also knows which experience experiences would be useful to clear. So as it travels back, back, back and may grow you younger, it may not be in sequential time oriented ways. It doesn't have to, but it's just going to narrow, pinpoint and bring a particular negative experience to your awareness. Now. Right. What is it that comes to mind? You got it. Good. Good job. The one that just came to mind happened about how long ago you might have been. How old?
[48:54] B: I don't remember.
[48:57] A: Well, good. So was it older than 10? Younger than 10? Younger than around 10. There we go. Right. And notice how there's emotion and there's emotion there, not because it happened. There's emotion only because your brain doesn't know that it's not happening. Now you do. You're here. Hi. Right. So you're going to intend to be with me. Second, if it happened when you were 10, there have been many things you've done after that moment that were way more enjoyable than that moment. What's one thing? Anytime from when that happened until heck, yesterday, that was more fun than that moment.
[49:39] B: There's so many.
[49:40] A: Yeah. Well, what's one?
[49:42] B: Going to Busch Garden.
[49:43] A: Yeah, going to Busch Gardens. Way more fun than that. Good. Something else.
[49:49] B: Having my kids.
[49:50] A: Yeah, having your kids. Good. And one other thing.
[49:56] B: I want to say. Christmas mornings.
[49:59] A: Yeah, Christmas mornings. Right. Getting out of jail.
[50:01] B: Oh, getting out of jail.
[50:02] A: All of those things happen after that. That moment. There's a part of your brain that froze it, it got disintegrated, that doesn't know anything beyond that moment. So we actually have good news to get in. A, that it stopped. B, that there's been more enjoyable things. Got it. So how you tell it to me is you're just going to tell me facts while being here. It'll go, that happened. That happened. That happened, that happened, that happened. Then it was done. Good. So you're about 10 when it happened and you were where?
[50:35] B: In a room.
[50:36] A: In a room. Good. Like in a house or an apartment. In a house. Right. In like your house or somebody else's house. Right. Good job. And so you're in the room and is there a bed or their chair or couch or.
[50:45] B: I'm on a bed.
[50:45] A: You're on a bed. Good job. Right. And so you're on the bed. Right. And there's a comforter. Are you under the comforter?
[50:52] B: I'm under a sheet.
[50:53] A: You're under a sheet. Good job. Good detail. See? Right. And what color is she?
[50:56] B: I don't remember.
[50:57] A: Right. Notice how that's irrelevant.
[50:58] B: It was dark.
[50:59] A: That's right. Good job. So it was dark in the room. See, isn't that another good detail? And then what happened next?
[51:05] B: Clyde came in the room.
[51:06] A: So he came into the room. Good job. Right. And then what happened? And be here. Hi. Notice how you're going there.
[51:12] B: Yep.
[51:13] A: Hi. I want you to be here. Hi. See, my job, by the way, is to keep you here. Hi. You just intend to be here, but notice how you were there. So I got you here again. Hi.
[51:22] B: He came in the room.
[51:23] A: So he came in the room. Right. Good. Then did he get in the bed?
[51:25] B: No.
[51:25] A: No. So he was in the room. Right. Good. And then what happened next? And he was like on top. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[51:31] B: I was. I left my mind. I disassociated myself.
[51:37] A: Well, I don't know whether you did.
[51:38] B: Yeah.
[51:39] A: Right. Because that wasn't the first time that something like that happened.
[51:41] B: No.
[51:42] A: Right. So you knew something was going to happen to your body. Yes. And do you know that that's really cool.
[51:47] B: No.
[51:48] A: That your brain is able to take you away. Do you know that that's what happens with an animal? Have you ever seen, like a National Geographic, like, chase scene between a predator and a prey?
[51:58] B: Yes.
[51:59] A: Right. So let's think of. The rabbit is running for its life. Fox is chasing it. Right. Rabbit keeps looking for exits. There's no exits. So eventually rabbit has the awareness that it's death is inevitable. It's not going to get away. Right. And do you know that there will be a moment that the rabbit will stop? There will be moments before fox ever catches it that the rabbit will stop. The rabbit's body will be completely still. And in that moment, Rabbit's essence takes it away. So it doesn't have to be there for what's happening to the body. Right. And I've worked with people where there's been war stuff and they've gone away. Her torture gal knew that the cigar burn was coming and she's gone. And it woke her up when people were outside of the cell going, we've got a key, you can get out. It's powerful that our brain takes us away so that we don't have to be there for what was happening to the body. Right. Right. So he was hovering. Your brain took you away. He did whatever he did to the body, which he may have touched your body, he may have put his finger in your vagina. He may have put his Penis in different places. Right. And then what might have happened next?
[53:27] B: I woke up.
[53:28] A: Well, then he would have left. Yeah, right. Which was better than when he was doing that. Yeah, right. And then you woke up with it being over. Maybe sore in different spots, but it over. Right. And then what happened next?
[53:44] B: I just went about my morning.
[53:45] A: Well, you. Right, you went about your morning and you left. Right. And then that was over. And then later on, you did something more fun like go to Busch Gardens or have your kids. Yeah, right. Or Christmas morning. Right. Or get out of jail. Yeah, right. Good. So notice as you're recalling that there was some discomfort. Not because that was such a yucky experience. It was. But because your brain was confusing the memory, thinking it was happening. Now, here's the craziest thing. I know you've never heard this before, but have you ever noticed when people remember stuff, they always go from the beginning of the memory towards the end. They never go from the end of the memory back to before it happened. Isn't that weird? But see, the coolest part is when you do it literally unplugs it. It flattens out the neurons and takes away the charge. So we're going to go backwards. So we got getting out of jail, we got Christmas mornings, we got having the kids, we got going to Busch Gardens. Right. And then you were off doing your day, and then he had left, and then you were back in your body, and then he had done whatever he had done to your body, and then you were gone, and then he was hovering, and then he had walked in, and then you were in the bed, and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing right now. As I ran through backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it?
[54:59] B: A lot easier.
[55:00] A: Isn't that crazy? Because your brain is beginning to get that it's data about something that happened versus happening. Third part, emotional brain doesn't work with logic. It gets patterns of association. And remember, the memory and the experience are glued, so they're living as if they're the same thing. Yet there are lots of things that you can remember doing, even just earlier this morning, that you are certain you're not doing one of them. Putting the sweatshirt on. You can remember doing it. You can remember where you were when you did did it. But if I said to you, you know, remember getting dressed, putting the sweatshirt on, And I went, tricia, stop putting on your sweatshirt. You look at me and go, I am not putting on my sweatshirt. Because what's crystal clear is there's a huge difference between the Memory of you doing it and you doing it. Right. So you can remember that happening. You can remember putting on your sweatshirt. Trisha, stop putting on your sweatshirt. Say, I am not putting on my sweatshirt.
[56:01] B: I am not putting on my sweatshirt.
[56:02] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you're not putting on your shirt.
[56:06] B: You're not putting on your shirt.
[56:07] A: Well, then you stop putting on your sneakers. Say, I am not putting on my sneakers. Well, stop me from putting on my jeans. Say you're not putting on your jeans.
[56:12] B: You're not putting on your jeans.
[56:13] A: Well, then stop him from hovering over you. Say he's not hovering over me. Stop him from doing that stuff to your body. Say he's not doing that stuff to my body. Well, then stop that from happening. Say it's not happening.
[56:23] B: It's not happening.
[56:24] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. Right? Right. Last piece to this, that earlier you thought him doing that may have something to do with you.
[56:40] B: Had nothing to do with me.
[56:42] A: Had nothing to do with you at all. Had everything to do with what was off with him. Right. Isn't that interesting?
[56:48] B: Yeah.
[56:49] A: Right. Which is becoming more and more clear. But that you back then wasn't fully sure. Second, not being in my body was confusing then. Meaning not fully remembering all that went down in body because I wasn't in it would have been confusing. Follow me. Right. And that is the most common thing, by the way, that happens to people who have had that kind of stuff happen with the same person more than one time. Most common thing that happens because they get it at a different level that there's nothing that I can do to not have it happen. So therefore it's better for me to not be in my body as it's happening and bring me back when there's shit for me to actually do. Yeah, got it.
[57:57] B: Yeah.
[57:58] A: Right. So we actually want to get that how resourceful wise that earlier, younger you was that she didn't have to be in her body when that stuff was happening to her body. Right, Right. It's like I remember working with a woman one time who as an adult, she was raped and she felt so bad because she, you know, had started fighting, but then like, he like much bigger and hurt her more. And so then she just laid there. She's just like, she's like, I just laid there and I let it happen. And she was so like disgusted with herself that she like had that. And I go, do you realize that by doing that that was the Fastest way to get it done. He goes, what? I go, well, yeah, like if you had continued to fight, how much longer would it have gone on? Right, right. So the laying there was actually the best strategy to get it over with fast. I mean, he's a guy. It's like, right. So we want to get in the good news, A, that it's over. B, that it happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with him. So that the younger you gets it. See how resourceful you are at that age to be out while that stuff is happening to Bodi and back when there was actually stuff for you to do. Right. So that that younger you gets to be okay, then you're going to let her also know about going to Busch Gardens. Right. You know, getting out of jail the Christmas morning. Right. That kind of stuff. So go ahead and close your eyes. Picture that earlier you just after it's over, letting her know for sure that it's over, finished, completed, defeated, that it no longer exists. Letting her know that that happening had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it then. Letting her know how resourceful she is that she was out of her body as all that stuff was happening and back when there was something for her to do. Let that earlier you know about going to Busch Gardens. Right. Let her know about her kids, Let her know. Right. About a Christmas, Let her know about getting out of jail. Let her know so that she gets it. That's right. And as that earlier you is getting it, what do you notice happening to her face? You got it. That's right. And you can open your eyes, Right. And just notice what's happening inside. How's your body feeling now?
[60:58] B: Happy.
[61:03] A: Right. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah, yeah. Things are getting cleared. That's right. That's right. And notice how we didn't have to really go in at all. And even when I saw you go, no, hi, the exact opposite of the person. Keep going. Yeah, yeah. Tell me more. Right. So as you're thinking about that moment now, what do you notice?
[61:36] B: It's not happening.
[61:38] A: Right.
[61:39] B: I'm here.
[61:40] A: You are. And how resourceful is it, Right. That you didn't have to be in your body as that stuff was happening? Right.
[61:50] B: Thank God.
[61:51] A: What a resourceful unconscious you have. Right, Right. It's really common that somebody may remember bits and pieces of the first time and then not again, and maybe know what the last time was. But Then there's like this whole chunk and they're like, what? Where's the information? Like, I don't. Right. Well, good. Of course you don't have it because you weren't there when it was happening.
[62:22] B: Yeah.
[62:27] A: Because people have this idea, well, I gotta, like, know all of that. Yeah. But if you weren't in your body as it was going on, then. Right. You know. Right. Because the really good news that's getting in, because the part that was troubling isn't that it happened, but the brain didn't know that it's over. Right. And see, that starts the chain of changing. So just like, if you've ever seen Wheel of Fortune, it's really hard to know when they say, you know, it's a city and there's like this. I have no idea what it is.
[63:07] B: There's a lot of cities.
[63:09] A: Right? There's a lot of cities. As soon as they start flipping over some of the. Then it starts to get clear. Unless you're like, me, I have to wait until, like, it's almost all the way full and I'm still like, what is it? But why I say that is one of the things that our brain does is it takes specific and generalizes. For example, we all learned how to tie sneakers on one pair. They didn't have, like a bunch of different colors. The red one, the blue one, the green one, the yellow one, the orange one, and the white one. Okay, here's how you do the white one. Let me show you how to do the orange one. Because once we mastered it on one piece pair of sneakers, it generalized to all. And of course, when we learn the size shoe that we wore is different than the size shoe that we wear now and you can still tie.
[64:01] B: Right?
[64:02] A: Right. So your brain starts to generalize. Now, the cool part is it's easier to generalize from more than one than from one. Like, if I said to you orange, you could guess, am I thinking about the fruit? Am I thinking about the color? But if I said orange, banana, apple. Okay. It's the fruit.
[64:31] B: Yeah.
[64:32] A: I don't have to list every single fruit out there for you to pick it up. Right. So it's the same kind of thing. So again, as we're organizing towards the you that's been simple, symbolized by that soaring hawk, that unconscious part is going to travel back through things that have happened in your own history, and it's going to narrow, pinpoint, and bring another moment to mind. Right. This one happened when my dad.
[65:01] B: When I was 13.
[65:04] A: Yeah. And what happened. So you're 13, 14, and you might have been where?
[65:12] B: We were at his house.
[65:13] A: So you're at dad's house. Right. And you're like in the living room, kitchen, dining room. You're in the living room, like on a couch or a chair. So you're on the couch. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[65:23] B: He's drunk.
[65:24] A: Right. So that's drinking. Right. Good. Then what happened?
[65:29] B: He passed out.
[65:31] A: That's right. Like on the floor, on a couch.
[65:34] B: On the couch.
[65:35] A: On the couch. Right, Good. And then what happened next?
[65:41] B: Well, I, I.
[65:48] A: Yeah.
[65:49] B: What did I do next?
[65:50] A: Right.
[65:51] B: I drove. I stole his truck.
[65:54] A: Right, good. So you got in the truck and you started driving.
[65:56] B: Yeah.
[65:57] A: Right, good.
[65:58] B: Drove my friend home.
[66:00] A: That's right. Good job, good detail. Cause like, she needed to get home.
[66:03] B: Yeah.
[66:03] A: Right.
[66:04] B: Because there was something weird between her and my dad going on.
[66:09] A: Uh huh. Right. And so you drove her home.
[66:13] B: Drove her home.
[66:13] A: Right.
[66:14] B: So then I get back to dad's house and he's awake.
[66:17] A: Right. Good job, good details. You pull the truck in and now he's awake and you're like, fuck.
[66:20] B: Yeah.
[66:21] A: Right. And then what happened?
[66:22] B: And he's saying like real nasty things about my mom. Nasty comments.
[66:29] A: Right. So he's like bitching appropriate comments about my mom. Right.
[66:33] B: And I get mad and I leave.
[66:34] A: And then you leave, get in the truck. No, no, you just.
[66:37] B: Yeah, I walked.
[66:39] A: Right.
[66:39] B: And my mom came and picked me up.
[66:41] A: Right. And the mom came and got you?
[66:43] B: Yeah.
[66:44] A: And then that was over? Yeah, Right. That moment.
[66:47] B: Yeah.
[66:48] A: Right. And then later on you did something more fun. You.
[66:51] B: Yeah.
[66:51] A: Like, you know, have a Christmas morning or have your kids. Yeah, right. Or get out of jail.
[66:57] B: Yeah.
[66:57] A: Right. And what's happening now?
[67:02] B: My dad had sex with my friend. He went and picked her up.
[67:06] A: Right. That night he did.
[67:08] B: After I left.
[67:10] A: After you left?
[67:11] B: Yeah.
[67:12] A: Dad got in the truck, drove over to her place, brought her back. Huh. And how'd you find that out?
[67:18] B: She told me.
[67:19] A: So like the next day. Yeah, she's like, your dad came back and got me and.
[67:25] B: Yeah, well, no, they got caught.
[67:27] A: How so?
[67:28] B: His, my dad's girlfriend walked in.
[67:30] A: So dad was doing stuff with her and dad's girlfriend came home.
[67:33] B: Yeah. Well, no, she didn't live there. She like, surprise visited.
[67:37] A: Oh, she came to visit?
[67:38] B: Yeah.
[67:38] A: Oh, cool. You're having sex with a minor. Awesome surprise.
[67:42] B: Yeah.
[67:43] A: Right.
[67:44] B: So by her being caught, Nicole ended up. I don't know how she got home.
[67:53] A: Right.
[67:53] B: But I used to go to her house in the mornings to get ready for School.
[67:56] A: Good job, good detail. Right. So you're at her house.
[67:59] B: Yeah.
[67:59] A: And she's there.
[68:00] B: Yep.
[68:01] A: Right.
[68:01] B: And she's crying.
[68:02] A: And she's crying. Right.
[68:03] B: She loves my dad.
[68:04] A: And how much she loves your dad. And you're going, that's weird.
[68:07] B: Yeah. She didn't tell me details when I called. Called my mom.
[68:10] A: Right. And told my mom that Nicole's in love with dad.
[68:13] B: Yeah. And something crazy happened.
[68:14] A: That's right. Good job, good detail. Right. And then what happened?
[68:18] B: And then my mom told her parents.
[68:21] A: Good job, good detail. Right.
[68:23] B: And then her parents went to my dad's house waiting for the.
[68:29] A: Good job, good detail. Right. So they went to. Right. And then what happened?
[68:32] B: Well, I sat in the car and watched Nicole's dad with a baseball bat out from my dad's house.
[68:37] A: Good job, good detail. Right. Because Nicole was crying, saying how much she loved your dad.
[68:41] B: Yeah.
[68:42] A: And her dad's like, what the.
[68:43] B: Yeah.
[68:44] A: And then drove you both over there, and the two of you are sitting in the car watching him with the bat. No, no, no.
[68:50] B: He. I called my mom. My mom came, picked.
[68:53] A: Good job, good detail. Okay. Yeah. And drove you over towards where dad's was.
[68:58] B: Yeah. Went to my dad's house. Her dad was outside with the bat.
[69:02] A: Good job, good detail. Right. And then what happened?
[69:06] B: My dad went to jail.
[69:07] A: Then the police came.
[69:08] B: Yeah.
[69:09] A: And then they arrested him. Yes. And they went to jail.
[69:11] B: Yes.
[69:11] A: Right. And then that moment ended.
[69:12] B: Yes.
[69:13] A: Yeah. And then later on, you did something more fun. Yeah. Like Bush Gardens.
[69:22] B: Getting out of jail.
[69:24] A: Right. Good. So we are getting out of jail. We got going to Bush Gardens. You gotta have the kids. Right. And then dad had gotten taken to jail. And then you guys were waiting outside, and then you saw the bad. And then mom had come and got you, and then you had called mom and said something really weird happened. Then she was crying, telling you how much she loved dad. Right. And then mom, you. You had gotten dropped off or gone over to her house. Right. Good. And then before that, you were home, and then mom had picked you up. Right. And then you had left Dad's. And then dad was saying bitchy, shitty things about mom. And then you walked in. Right. And then you had dropped your friend off, and then you guys had taken the truck. And then dad passed out of town. And then before that, they were kind of like weirdy, flirty stuff. Yeah. Right. And then she'd come over with you. Right. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Right. Good. Then again, as we go backwards compared to forward Emotionally, how was it?
[70:15] B: That was great.
[70:17] A: You can remember all that happening, right? You can remember putting your shirt on. Trisha, stop putting on your shirt.
[70:23] B: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[70:24] A: Well, then stop dad from doing that.
[70:26] B: Dad's not doing that.
[70:27] A: Well, then stop her from doing that.
[70:28] B: She's not doing that.
[70:29] A: Well, then stop putting on your sneakers.
[70:30] B: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[70:31] A: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Well, stop it from happening. It's not happening. Right. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[70:38] B: It no longer exists.
[70:39] A: Right. By the way, any of that happening have anything to do with you?
[70:43] B: Nope.
[70:44] A: No. Had to do with stuff being off a table and maybe a little stuffing off with that friend. Right, Right.
[70:54] B: That was easy.
[70:56] A: It was, wasn't it? Right. Because your brain is getting it that it's data. Right. Oh, and by the way, despite that happening, you know, having a dad that's somewhat off. Right. Had nothing to do with you. And did you need a dad to be well in order for you to love your kids?
[71:19] B: No.
[71:20] A: That's right. That's right. And want them to be in a safe environment. Right, Right.
[71:30] B: That was me.
[71:31] A: Yes. You did that. Meaning have them go with grandparents because you knew it was a safe environment and they had resources and you knew that would be best for them, which has everything to do with your love for them, even if grandparents have been a hole since then. Got it. Yeah. So as you think about that moment now, what do you notice?
[72:04] B: I did something good.
[72:06] A: You did, didn't you?
[72:07] B: Yeah.
[72:07] A: Yeah.
[72:08] B: I made a good choice.
[72:09] A: Yeah. Right. So close your eyes. Think back to that earlier. You let her know that that's over, finished, completed. That it no longer exists. That that happening had nothing to do with you. That she did exactly what there was for her to do in that situation. That's right. So that the earlier you is getting that you're okay. That's right. That she didn't need dad to be well in order for you to be okay. Right. You can open your eyes. What a great way to surprise him.
[72:50] B: Yeah.
[72:51] A: Yeah. And really problematic that, you know, he went back out and got her to bring her back. Yeah, Right.
[73:07] B: Yeah. Weirdo.
[73:10] A: Yeah. Right, Right. And you don't need him to be well in order for you to be okay. Right. Isn't that a good news thing? In order for you to actually have your own moral compass?
[73:28] B: Yeah.
[73:30] A: Great. Yeah. So what's happening now? What are you noticing for yourself?
[73:39] B: That I'm not a product of my father?
[73:46] A: Yeah.
[73:47] B: That I didn't need him to make decisions to keep my own kids safe. That he has not aided in much of my life or choices.
[74:05] A: Yeah, yeah.
[74:07] B: His decisions haven't affected me or mine.
[74:10] A: Right, right. That you're okay despite having a dad who's kind of screwed up. Yeah, yeah. Right. And that you had your friend's best interest in mind too. Right. Because one of the two in the situation was the adult and it wasn't her. So she didn't get to have consent. No. Right.
[74:40] B: No matter what it looked like.
[74:42] A: That's right. No matter what he was doing to convince her.
[74:46] B: Yeah.
[74:46] A: We could call that hypnotizing. Interesting.
[74:51] B: Yeah.
[74:52] A: Yeah. Right. Because he had her convinced. Mm. Right.
[74:59] B: Kind of like the same way Clyde had me convinced. Convinced.
[75:05] A: Right. See, now you're beginning to see things clearly. Oh, yeah, right. Isn't that a good news thing? See, that's what starts to happen as we gain perspective. Distance. As we have a more up above and that we're a grown up view of things, we can see things more clearly for what they were. Right. And see, that's the part that we're getting shifted around you with authority. Because we all have it in our mind that people who are older or wiser. Well, clearly that was not the case.
[75:48] B: No, not at all.
[75:53] A: Clearly that was not the case for them. Being older did not mean wiser. Right? Right.
[76:03] B: Not at all.
[76:04] A: Yeah. So check what's happening now inside you.
[76:13] B: Older and wiser you are.
[76:16] A: Right? Right. You were actually wise, wiser then. Right?
[76:21] B: I was younger and wiser.
[76:23] A: That's right. That's right. Yeah. So again, I want you to think of the hawk. Take a deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Good. With eyes closed, they rest. Once again, you can lower your jaw and rest your tongue, maybe even relaxing the back of your tongue as you can continue to breathe in this way that's a little bit slower and slightly deeper. Your unconscious integrating what it's already got and learned all the way through. So that all aspects of your mind and body getting that same good news. Healing, clearing, freeing, connecting to more of who you are. Soaring, flying, gliding, moving all around in all ways and in all directions. Space. That's right. So that you're enjoying this present. Quiet, quiet, calm, peaceful resting. That's right. And then when you're ready, you can find your way back with a big deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. There we go. Good job. And again. What do you noticing now?
[78:04] B: I'm here.
[78:06] A: You are, aren't you? Yeah. And again. The unconscious part Will travel back through things that have happened in your own history. And again we'll narrow pinpoint in bring another moment to. Well, it's coming to mind now.
[78:30] B: Space.
[78:32] A: Space. Isn't that cool? Yeah.
[78:46] B: I'm not picking up anything.
[78:48] A: Isn't that interesting? Right. Notice how different that is.
[78:54] B: Great.
[78:55] A: Right. From how it's been. Yeah. That you're becoming more okay in you. Right. You're becoming more at peace with you. Right. And so we want to do that part because that, you know, 15 year old you with the, you know, robbery gone wrong. Right. See you from here for a long time prior to today have been looking back at that 15 year old you going, you fucking idiot. Dumbass.
[79:35] B: Stupid.
[79:36] A: Right, but see, what do we know.
[79:38] B: Now that's not happening.
[79:41] A: Yes. And if you had known what was going to happen, you wouldn't have gone there. Right. Third, we're also beginning to get that part of why you were even in this situation, to have even had the chance to go to something like that had everything to do with the environment you were being raised in and the people who were somewhat screwed up raising you. Right. Right. So for the longest time it's been blaming me for having been stupid. Right. But as we're looking at it clearly based on the environment that she was in and the people that were raising her and all the other stuff that was happening in her world and then prior to what had happened. Right, right. Good. That she was the one that was outside. Right. That she was wise enough not to be the one inside.
[81:00] B: Yeah.
[81:01] A: At least like if we're looking at the role of who got the role in this thing, we got the best fucking part.
[81:08] B: Yeah. It's true.
[81:11] A: Right? That's right. So what would it be like if you were to lighten up on that earlier you. That was weird, wasn't it? Yeah. The speakers, for whatever reason, sometimes turn themselves off, which is what just happened. We had nice music that was playing in the background and now the speakers, for whatever reason, turn themselves off. I don't know why it does that, but sometimes it does. And then every once in a while now that they're turned off, they'll go. Because they somehow lose connection with each other. Huh. That's what happens when you buy cheap Bluetooth speakers instead of, you know, investing in like expensive ones. But who would have thought that that is what was going to happen to it? Ice for people. So what happens when you lighten up on the earlier you gaining the context that a lot of it had to do do with the situation, Circumstances that she was being raised in that led her to even have that as a possibility. Right. And that her role in it was the best role that there was in that particular play. Right.
[82:37] B: She wasn't a bad kid.
[82:38] A: No. And if she had known that that's what it was gonna be, she certainly wouldn't have done that. Right. That was the farthest thing, not even on the map. It wasn't like, okay, this is a possibility. It wasn't even on the map. The radar had nothing. Follow me with that.
[82:58] B: Yeah.
[82:59] A: So again, close your eyes and think back to that earlier. You letting her know what you know now. A, that it's over. B, that you realize the context that she was in led her to even have that as a possibility. See that you know that she wouldn't have done it if she had known what you know. So that. Right. That she's actually a good kid. Right. In a difficult situation, surrounded by certain people that are kind of screwed up. Right. Let her know that despite all of that, you did your time. That's right. Let her know about her kids and making sure they're in an environment that is supportive of them. Right. Let her know about getting out of jail. Right. And choosing to be in a program that's about bettering her life. That's right. Right. And as all of that gets in, what do you notice happening to the earlier you? Because you're more okay with her.
[84:12] B: She's more okay.
[84:14] A: Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. There you go. And you can open your eyes because people really do do better when they feel better.
[84:28] B: Yeah.
[84:28] A: Yeah. Guilt and shame isn't good motivator. Not a great strategy for wellness.
[84:36] B: No.
[84:37] A: Isn't that weird?
[84:38] B: Yeah.
[84:40] A: So turn this off. Turn it back on. It does that. Turn this one off. Now it's connecting. Now it's connected. And now I get my fun music back.
[85:27] B: Yeah.
[85:27] A: So what's happening now? What do you notice? With you?
[85:31] B: I'm just very aware of your room.
[85:35] A: Oh, you're actually noticing more of the space, aren't you?
[85:37] B: Yeah.
[85:38] A: Uh huh. You're like more here. Right. Cause you know now it's actually okay to be in your body. Right? Mm. And be present here. Yeah. So I want you to check in because like you said, like, there's been these feelings and we use the word abandonment. But do you know that abandonment isn't a feeling? And it's not even a what happened? Like, you know, if somebody said to you, my best friend betrayed me, do you know what their best friend actually did hurt your Feelings. That's a guess, isn't it?
[86:18] B: Yeah.
[86:18] A: You don't actually know.
[86:21] B: Yeah.
[86:22] A: Right. Even though yucky word like somebody raped me. Do we know specifically what actually happened? No. So they're all meaning words. Right. When stuff happens, our mind attaches a meaning, but then that meaning frequently lives as if that is what happened. Right. What's happening now?
[86:51] B: I'm thinking about the word abandoned and how many times I've used that reference.
[86:57] A: Right, Right. So clearly, given that the meaning got attached, there have been certain things that have happened along the way. So if you were to trail that back, what's one of the things that happened where then that meaning got attached?
[87:29] B: My mom.
[87:31] A: Right. If it travels back, what's a experience that comes to mind with Mom?
[87:39] B: I guess when my mom started dating.
[87:43] A: So you might have been how old?
[87:46] B: 12.
[87:47] A: 12. Right.
[87:48] B: Ish.
[87:49] A: And you know, dad had left and then like, it was you and your siblings and Mom.
[87:58] B: Yeah, I was taking care of my siblings. Mom was never there.
[88:03] A: Cause mom was what?
[88:04] B: Dating?
[88:05] A: Dating or working?
[88:06] B: Living or working.
[88:09] A: Right, right. Did she start dating right away? Right after dad left?
[88:14] B: Um, nobody. Later.
[88:19] A: Right. So for a period of time, mom was just working.
[88:22] B: Yeah.
[88:23] A: Right. And then you were doing some of the stuff that mom used to do.
[88:27] B: Yeah.
[88:28] A: In terms of taking care of the younger ones, like making sure that they got fed, making sure that they got their baths, got to bed, you know, those kinds of things. Which was good training.
[88:41] B: Yeah, yeah. No, Well, I think that it, like, for whatever reason, just made me want my own. Like I was resentful for having to take care of hers.
[88:58] A: Right, right. So mom started dating. And would that have been. Mom would have been out in the evening.
[89:07] B: Yeah, all the time.
[89:08] A: So you guys would have gotten home?
[89:11] B: As soon as I was getting home, mom was leaving.
[89:13] A: Leaving. Like, was the guy in the car?
[89:16] B: No, she would be getting ready to go out on a date or on days that she wasn't working, which she worked at a strip club. So she worked all night.
[89:32] A: Right, right. And mom's dates might have not been just dates.
[89:41] B: I don't know.
[89:42] A: We don't know.
[89:43] B: Yeah. What is a date?
[89:46] A: Well, there might have been other things exchanged. I mean, because mom was working at a strip club just as the bartender or as a dancer. Yes, she was. Right. Which means she was used to exchanging services for money. Right. And where was she meeting the high quality guys to go on dates with?
[90:21] B: Well, she had one steady boyfriend.
[90:23] A: Like match.com?
[90:25] B: No, I don't know how she met him. I don't know.
[90:29] A: Well, I mean, you know, normally where do people meet people as adults? You know, they might like as a young adult in your 20s, you might meet people your same age, like at college or like out.
[90:42] B: Probably at a bar.
[90:43] A: At a bar, Right. Which you're always getting high quality people. No, you know, shit. Based at the bar. Right. And as they get a little bit older. Right. You know, like in their late 20s and 30s, where are you meeting people? Maybe at a happy hour. Maybe at the establishments that you work. Right. And who knows what that like long term boyfriend was.
[91:19] B: Yeah.
[91:22] A: Or wasn't a boyfriend. I mean, because he was always over at the house. Right?
[91:29] B: Not for a while.
[91:30] A: No.
[91:31] B: No.
[91:33] A: Well, then she did the one good thing which was, you know, keep her kids away from the person she was dating until she was like more committed.
[91:41] B: Yes.
[91:42] A: Uh huh. Well, that part was actually good.
[91:47] B: Yeah.
[91:48] A: Right.
[91:50] B: Yeah. She was with him for a couple years before. Well, she was with him maybe for like a year and a half when we finally got to meet him.
[92:01] A: Right.
[92:02] B: In person. And then he ended up buying a house and we all moved in together.
[92:11] A: Right. And did she stay working?
[92:16] B: Not.
[92:17] A: No, not at the, at the strip club. No. After he bought the house and they moved in.
[92:23] B: Yeah.
[92:24] A: Right. But up until that time she was working nights.
[92:31] B: Yeah.
[92:32] A: So.
[92:33] B: Or going out. She was going out a lot.
[92:36] A: Which might also been part of working.
[92:38] B: Or staying at his house.
[92:40] A: Right.
[92:40] B: Yeah. I'm not sure where she went when she was gone. She never answered the phone. I'd call her a million times.
[92:46] A: Right. So you can remember calling her. Yeah. And her not answering.
[92:49] B: Yes.
[92:49] A: Right. You can remember putting your signatures on.
[92:51] B: Yeah, I can remember her voicemail.
[92:55] A: Right.
[92:55] B: And exactly what it said.
[92:57] A: Word for what? That's right, that's right. Cuz like you heard it a lot. Yeah. More so than her. Yes, that's right. That's right. But see, what's really cool about all of this now is that you felt mom not being around meant something about mom's lack of love. Yes. Did it? No. Right, that's right. Because can you absolutely love your kids.
[93:24] B: Yes.
[93:24] A: Right. And then be with your grandparents?
[93:28] B: Yes.
[93:29] A: Right. They're not exclusive.
[93:34] B: That's right.
[93:35] A: That's right. So it had nothing to do with mom's lack of love, had everything to do with mom's life experiences because I'm sure your grandparents were super pleased that your mom was working at the strip club with four children. Right, Right. But mom was trying to make ends meet at that time because dad had moved out. Right. And you know, a single mom of four. I mean, what are the jobs that are available that you can make a good. And Mom's highly educated. Right. She's got her master's. Uh huh. PhD. She's been a. Yeah, yeah. Mom have all those degrees?
[94:29] B: Well, she's. I don't know what it is in her hypnosis stuff, but she. She was.
[94:38] A: She got certified, has a hypnosis.
[94:41] B: Yeah, she did. She did a lot in my younger years.
[94:45] A: Right, right. But it wasn't like mom had tons of education and lots of options. She could work as a nurse.
[94:55] B: Yeah, she could have.
[94:56] A: Right. And she did for a period of time. Yes.
[94:58] B: Yes.
[94:59] A: Right. But can a nurse make what somebody at a club can make?
[95:04] B: Maybe in a week.
[95:06] A: Right.
[95:07] B: What she was making in a night.
[95:08] A: That's right. And a lot of it, you know, being cash, which also doesn't get taxed. Right, right. So she was trying to make ends meet. So it had nothing to do with her lack of love for you. Right. And she was around more during the day. Of course. You guys were in school.
[95:32] B: Yep.
[95:34] A: But you know, she was at least there to when you called her at Nicole's. Yes. To be able to come and get you.
[95:41] B: Yeah.
[95:41] A: Right. And when you left Dads.
[95:44] B: Yep.
[95:45] A: To make sure that she could come and get you, she answered the phone then.
[95:49] B: Yep.
[95:50] A: That's right. When you actually really needed her to.
[95:56] B: Yes.
[95:56] A: Right. Other times when you called, you didn't actually fully need her. No. You were just like wanting to vent maybe sometimes or maybe ask her a question, but then eventually you figured it out.
[96:08] B: Yeah.
[96:09] A: Right, Right. Because you're really resourceful. Right. But you can remember her not answering.
[96:19] B: Yeah.
[96:20] A: Right. You can remember putting your sweatshirt on. Well, stop putting on your sweatshirt. We'll stop her from not answering. Say she's not doing that. Right. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists. And again, that you thought mom not answering meant that mom didn't care. But as we're looking at it from where we're sitting today, did it have anything to do with mom not caring? She does. And there's probably some like screwed up stuff with mom. Yeah, right. That's right. So again, closure eyes. Think back to that earlier you and let her know that mom doing that not answering had nothing to do with her lack of love, but everything to do with what was off. So that the younger you get that mom loves me. Right. And also begins to realize that I didn't need mom to always be around in order for me to turn out okay. Right. To be a good person. Right. To know how to take care. Right. Of me and others. Mm. That's right. Yeah. And what's happening now? I'm here. You are. Right. Notice how that's not troubling. And it used to.
[97:43] B: Yeah.
[97:43] A: Like really pissed me off.
[97:45] B: Yeah.
[97:45] A: Right.
[97:46] B: Really bad. I used to fight with her about it.
[97:48] A: Right? Yeah. Right. Cuz mom couldn't really get it. Like how that must have been for you at that age. Right. Having to take care of younger ones and being a kid myself. Right. Uh huh. Right. They're not in your mind. Fuck. Right. But notice how you're becoming more okay. And not that it means how mom was. Was okay. Right. But it's not causing all this anymore.
[98:29] B: Because it's not happening.
[98:31] A: Right. And that you're okay. You are. Right. And even check how you navigated yourself through, you know, being in jail. Right. One of the things you told me, you know, because guys are authority, I made sure I didn't get involved in any of that. Right. Because I didn't want to make it any longer. Right. So there's no flirting for me with them. Nope. Not even a smidge. See, no Eva here. Keep my head down and make it through. Right. Kind of just blend. Yeah. Don't be seen, don't be individual. Don't be the person going, hey, right, person, look at me, look at me. No. Right. I'm good at being the invisible kid in the classroom. All right.
[99:46] B: It's better.
[99:47] A: I like that, isn't it? To make it through that situation. Yeah. Right. Isn't that a good news thing? Right. Right. And see, without having gone through what you went through, you wouldn't have had that kind of strategy. Right? Right. Yeah. What are you noticing now?
[100:26] B: I'm okay.
[100:27] A: You are.
[100:29] B: I'm here. I made it through.
[100:32] A: You did.
[100:35] B: On my terms.
[100:36] A: That's right. Mm. And even here, you're doing this because you're worth it to you. Right. And notice how that's beginning to ring true. Right. Right. But it's no longer just here, it's here. Right. You're fully getting it. Mm. Right. Isn't that a good news thing? There you go. So all sorts of things are changing. You're seeing things more clearly. So now let's just check. Kind of thinking in like guy authority, I mean, you dealt with men and you know, in prison, those are the ones in charge. And it was best to be invisible, which you did a really good job. Right. And then you've said, you know, there's been this damn, like love, hate relationship. Right. And as you think about that right now. What do you notice surfacing?
[102:08] B: Something a little awkward.
[102:10] A: Oh, cool. Actually, yeah. What's the awkward thing?
[102:20] B: Well.
[102:25] A: Yeah, that you're doing great. I'm really proud of you. Yeah.
[102:36] B: Okay. I can't think of one time in particular because it's a pattern and it's something that happens every time.
[102:48] A: Well, has happened. Yeah, right.
[102:50] B: Has happened.
[102:51] A: Right.
[102:52] B: Clearly has. Because it's been a decade since I've even been involved with a man in a relationship.
[103:02] A: Right. But.
[103:07] B: I don't know how to explain this.
[103:10] A: You're doing a good job so far. You're doing a good job so far.
[103:18] B: I get into a relationship because I'm attracted to this person.
[103:24] A: Yes.
[103:25] B: And I want to be with this person. I'll even go as far as saying I want to have sex with this person.
[103:31] A: Yeah.
[103:32] B: But then like when I get to that point or like when I like, know. Okay, cool, cool. We're here and we're about to do it. Like in the midst of having sex with this person, I have to like, I have to think about something else or like, I mean, I'm making this connection here.
[104:01] A: You are, aren't you?
[104:01] B: About. Yes. With Clyde and being a kid and having to go somewhere else.
[104:10] A: That's right.
[104:11] B: Or be somewhere else.
[104:12] A: Right.
[104:13] B: And so I do that in my relationships too. Or I have like, I don't know, I have to, I have to think about sometimes even like someone else.
[104:28] A: Right. Cannot think about the person that I'm with. Yeah, right, right. That's how it's been.
[104:35] B: Yeah.
[104:36] A: Right. And it's been that way based on other stuff. Having been still active.
[104:45] B: Yeah.
[104:45] A: Follow me.
[104:46] B: Yeah.
[104:47] A: So what would happen is I would be the one that would want to. And you know, for all women, it's got to be on their terms. If it isn't until rape. I told you that story. Give him kudos. Good job. What a great guy. So what was happening is that would be confused. Right. So you'd have to go elsewhere.
[105:23] B: Yeah.
[105:24] A: Right. And see the stuff with Clyde. Didn't he also have a wife? Yes. And she knew.
[105:34] B: I don't know what she knew, but she was weird too.
[105:37] A: She was, wasn't she?
[105:38] B: Yes.
[105:39] A: Uh huh. Like how so?
[105:40] B: Like she was like a nudist and would lay around naked all the time and then didn't have a problem if we like, if she would like put. I don't know if she did it on purpose or if like she was just scanning channels and then it would pop up. But I mean, it seems weird to think that she would just be like, oh, oh, wow, look at that. And it'd be porn on the tv. And then, like, also she used to do, like, pleasure parties and things like that.
[106:11] A: Yeah.
[106:11] B: So, like.
[106:12] A: So she'd have, like, all the toys.
[106:13] B: Random things. Yeah, look, it's the rabbit sitting around. Like it was not a big deal.
[106:20] A: Right.
[106:20] B: Or that we weren't a bunch of kids, you know, looking at those things.
[106:28] A: Right.
[106:28] B: Her, like, toys of. I don't even know what they were. And then, like, she had a weird.
[106:35] A: Vibrators, dildos, all sorts of weird things. Floggers. She have any of that kind of weird stuff?
[106:41] B: No, those were cool.
[106:43] A: Those are cool. Fathers. Yeah.
[106:44] B: Yeah. Not that, like, they would be like, penises stuck to the wall or.
[106:49] A: Wonderful. Yeah.
[106:51] B: Blow up dolls.
[106:52] A: Oh, lovely.
[106:53] B: With the mouth and all the other holes. And like, she would think it'd be funny to, like, put a cigarette in Betty the blow up doll's mouth.
[107:02] A: Right? Yeah.
[107:05] B: Like, she was. She was just off herself.
[107:07] A: Right.
[107:08] B: It was really weird dynamics. But she was a blackout drunk too.
[107:12] A: Right.
[107:13] B: So after. They didn't sleep in the same bed either. Like, he was always on the couch and she would sleep in her room.
[107:22] A: Right? Yeah.
[107:25] B: Yeah.
[107:26] A: So notice again, you're able to see that clearly. Yeah. Now, you didn't know that that was so off then. No. Follow me with that.
[107:37] B: Yes.
[107:38] A: So you wouldn't have known how inappropriate material was being just out and about. It's not even as if. Well, you know, I went into their nightstand.
[107:57] B: Yeah.
[107:57] A: And I saw the nudie man.
[107:59] B: Yeah.
[107:59] A: I went in the nightstand and they had this thing. And I don't know what this thing was.
[108:02] B: Yeah. It was, boom, out there.
[108:06] A: Right. It was in the living room. Yeah. Right. Right. You didn't know that that was inappropriate. But again, as that stuff starts early, it kind of screws that up. Right. But see, now that you can see it clearly again, close your eyes and think back to the earlier you recognizing and realizing what you know now that she was off. Right. And that with all of that stuff going on, that's what was grooming me to not know always. Right. Whether certain things were okay or not, even though I, at a deeper level, knew not okay. Right. What's happening now? You are right. Yeah. Becoming more good, grounded in you, centered in you. Okay. In you. That I have what I need to deal with any of the stuff that might come my way because look at what I've been able to already make it through and be okay. Right. I just think how resilient, resourceful, strong, Brave, courageous, wise. That earlier you is. That's right. And she can begin to realize that she's a grown up. Like she's all grown up. That's right. And when you're a grown up, it means that you're on the same level. But when you're a grown up, with wisdom, it means you're a head above. That's right. And you can see more clearly. Right. And as you're getting it now again, what do you notice?
[110:47] B: I'm the Hulk.
[110:49] A: Yeah.
[110:53] B: That's where I'm at.
[110:55] A: Yeah. Right. Notice how there's much more contentment in here. Much more. Okay. That although those were things that I went through and stuff that happened to me, it's never been a part of who I am. Right. Isn't that a good news thing?
[111:21] B: Yeah.
[111:22] A: Yeah. Right, Right. And that earlier you. Right. Wouldn't have known so much about what the club was.
[111:46] B: No.
[111:46] A: Right. It's not like mom was bring you.
[111:50] B: No.
[111:51] A: Here, go pick up all the ones. Right. Right. So as we're looking at it and as you'll gain more insight, it won't be emotionally reactive, but you'll gain more insight as you do your genogram. That there was an environment. Environment that I got born into that set me up. Right.
[112:24] B: Yeah.
[112:26] A: Right. And despite having been born in that environment, I moved through it. I navigated it. I learned ways to cope and deal. Deeper parts of my mind took me out and away. So I didn't have to be there. Right. That's why we can say that stuff happened to your body, but not to me. That's right. He never touched you. He messed with your stuff, screwed up your feelings. Stop thinking for a while. Never got who you are. Right. It screwed up because it was still in a body memory. Anytime that similar interactions with guys, even if they were one G were choosing. Right. As your brain distorted distinguishes the difference. Similar no longer gets read as same. Right. Right. And the picker starts to adjust. Because it's always on my terms. And they're lucky. It's if I'm going to allow them to spend any amount of time with me. I think I told you the silly thing. A woman needs a man about as much as a fish needs a bicycle.
[114:08] B: Yes, you said that.
[114:11] A: That's true. Which is not at all so. Therefore, just like seeing a beautiful sunset, the sunset doesn't need you in order for it to be. Be beautiful. Whoa.
[114:27] B: That's true.
[114:30] A: Right. You don't need a guy.
[114:34] B: No.
[114:35] A: Right. In order to be beautiful. And the experience can be added Too. By you seeing it. By being there with somebody that you like and enjoying maybe, you know, crackers and cheese. But none of it is necessary in order for the sunset to be beautiful. It's already whole and complete on its own. Right. And that's what's starting to happen in you. Getting that at a deeper level.
[115:13] B: Yeah.
[115:14] A: Whole and complete and good with you. Right. Becoming more at peace in you. Free like the hawk to soar, fly, move, glide up above and over it all. I'm done with that.
[115:34] B: Yeah, that's right. Now I'm here.
[115:37] A: I know. I can see.
[115:43] B: That was good.
[115:44] A: Yeah. Yeah. Right. So what else are you noticing for you, you know, as you're thinking about stuff right now?
[115:55] B: That I am powerful. That I make good decisions despite the things that happened.
[116:04] A: Right.
[116:05] B: That none of it's happening anymore and I don't ever have to go back.
[116:09] A: Right. Because even if you do right now, think about something that happened with Clyde, what do you notice?
[116:16] B: Just a thought.
[116:17] A: Notice how it doesn't have the. Anymore.
[116:19] B: Yeah.
[116:20] A: Right. Notice how different that is than it's ever been.
[116:25] B: Yeah.
[116:26] A: Right.
[116:27] B: It almost gives me goosebumps.
[116:29] A: Right. Isn't that cool?
[116:30] B: Yeah.
[116:34] A: Which you can't feel them unless you're in you. Yeah, Right? That's right. Yeah.
[116:44] B: That's pretty cool.
[116:45] A: Yeah. Yeah. So one other little component because you mentioned, right. I kind of transitioned. I was headed in as dad was headed, headed out. And then for a period of time, we corresponded. Right. And then there's been some bad feelings. Like there was some anger and hurt, like, fuck. How come you're not talking to me? We'll find you. Don't talk to me, but I love you anyway. And then you learn what he did. Right. So as you think about all of that right now. What, do you notice that, too?
[117:28] B: I notice.
[117:28] A: Yeah. Do we have to, like, that it happened?
[117:32] B: No.
[117:32] A: No. Will we ever like that it happened? No. No. Dad doing that. Did that have anything to do with you?
[117:39] B: No.
[117:39] A: No. Right. What did it have to do with?
[117:45] B: His. His issues.
[117:47] A: Yeah. And him not being well. Right, Right. Cause it wasn't as if life was better for him once he got out. You know, being labeled a sex offender. You know, it's on the computer, so everywhere you go, they know it's you.
[118:06] B: Yeah.
[118:07] A: It's fun.
[118:08] B: Yeah.
[118:09] A: Yeah.
[118:10] B: No, yeah, I definitely see that. Like, he did not do what he did to get away from me.
[118:21] A: Right. Right. Yeah. What's happening now?
[118:41] B: I guess I just feel bad or upset for my dad for the way that he must have felt to bring him to. You know that.
[118:58] A: Yeah.
[119:01] B: And I know that there was nothing I could do.
[119:03] A: Right.
[119:05] B: And it. I guess really what's coming up is that it wasn't a matter of whether I was in his life or not.
[119:15] A: Yeah. So check it out. You're feeling bad about whatever space he must have been in that enabled him to do that has everything to do with your love for him. Right. Despite all the other shit, you love him, which means you're loving. Right. Second part to that, your feeling bad is coming from your love. Let me check. You're feeling bad. Is that serving him or you?
[120:04] B: Me?
[120:05] A: Well, I don't know whether it's serving either of you.
[120:08] B: Yeah, well, then that's where I was headed.
[120:09] A: Right. Is he better off knowing that you're feeling bad and sad? No, because the one thing that we know with him is he was hurting. Right. Which he's not hurting now. Right. I worked with a gentleman yesterday who was a army guy and was, you know, lots of people and parts and where he was stuck. He had a lot of guilt. Like, if I had trained them better, maybe they wouldn't have died. Was one, two, that it shouldn't have happened, and then three, thinking they were still hurting. And this has been, you know, 15 years. So the question was that I said to him, I go, so they've been doing better. First, if it were you and not them, would you be wanting their life to suck?
[121:31] B: No.
[121:32] A: That fucker made it and I didn't.
[121:35] B: Yeah.
[121:35] A: No. So I wonder what it would be like to have a really great life in honor of who they are for you two, you've been thinking that they're hurting because they must have been hurting when it happened. And that gets frozen. But see, they're no longer hurting. They're not hurting at all. They've been at peace with this a lot longer than you have. Right. So one of the weird things in life is it's hard to understand something that's not understandable. And it's hard to forgive something that's unforgivable. So I tell people, what if you don't have to understand it or forgive it in order for you to be at peace? Wouldn't that be a better way to go?
[122:28] B: Yeah.
[122:29] A: Right. And the saying is, everything in life that has happened couldn't have not happened. Not because it had to, but given that it did, we know that it couldn't have not happened. So an example. Let's think of a guy who's walking around the block every day 365 days a year he does the same walk around his block. On this particular day, he comes and there's a big hole in the middle of the sidewalk. He might think to himself, I wonder what caused the hole? But he would never think to himself, I wonder if there was a cause. Because given that it's there, he knows something caused it. He doesn't have to know what the cause was to know that there was a cause.
[123:24] B: Right?
[123:24] A: The existence of it proves cause. Likewise, lightning bolt hits a tree, causes a branch to break off and land on the ground. We know two things. Given that the branch is broken and on the ground, there's no way the lightning bolt could have not hit the tree there. We also know, given that the lightning bolt hit the tree there, there's no way the branch could have not been broken and on the ground. So great. Holes, trees. Let's do it with people. Pedestrians walk over a bridge. Bridge covers a fast rapidous river. In the river, jagged rocks, nobody wants to jump. But as they get to the center, they all hear a young girl screaming. They rush, they see her being taken by the rapid. She's going to die. They're frozen in horror. Except Katie flings herself over the bridge, smashes her foot on a rock, grabs the little girl, drags her to the river shoreline, saves her life. Now, the news reporters who were interviewing Kate afterwards go, Kate, you risked your life to save a complete stranger. Why'd you do it? What made you jump? I don't know. I heard the voice and the next thing I knew, my foot was killing me, she was in my arms. If she didn't know why she did it, she certainly didn't choose it. But looking through the cause and effect lens, we would say, given that it happened, there must have been a cause. Now, what was the cause? Well, what caused the tree and the branch to be the exact way they were when the lightning hit it? And we go millions upon millions of factors over a lot of years. Some of it the genetic makeup in the acorn, some of it the soil it got planted in, some of it the type of weather conditions, other vegetation, rain, sunlight. All those factors over years got it to be the way it was. Well, well, what caused Kate? Same thing. Billions, millions upon millions of factors. Some of it her genetic DNA, what she was born with, some of it her environment, things that happened to her, stuff that she's learned, other experiences, things that she was taught. All those factors came together, that when she heard the voice, it caused her to jump. We know that there's no way Kate could have not done it. And that's why it takes us to the guy nobody likes, and that's Larry, who had been walking the little girl down the river shoreline. He said, look, sweetie, there's a fish in the water. When she bent down to see it, Larry thought it would be fun to push her. So he did. And then when he saw that she was being taken by the rapids, he just leisurely turned and walked away. Now, nobody freaking likes Larry or what Larry did. But we also can realize, given that she's in the water, there's no way Larry could have not pushed her. So we don't have to like that it happened to get that it couldn't have not happened. And when people transition, they're just no longer in their body. But that doesn't always mean that they're not here. Right. There's a limit to what our senses can perceive, Right. If you get in the van to be driven back home and you turn on the radio, you would hear music. But it wasn't as if the radio waves weren't there prior to you turning it on, even though you don't feel them. I blow a whistle, it's not making any sound, but the dog is whistling going. Is it really not making sound, or is the sound outside of our range? Isn't that interesting?
[126:56] B: Yeah.
[126:56] A: When you take a glass of ice and you leave it out on your patio, and an hour goes by and a little kid looks and says, somebody stole the ice. They put water there. We go, no, but he stole the ice. It transformed from solid to liquid. But the molecule H2O is the same. Our perception, like, how we see it changes. Kid goes, okay. Week goes by, it's out on the patio. Kid looks and goes, shit, somebody stole it. It's not there. But, no, nobody stole it. It evaporated. It went from liquid to gas. The molecule that makes it up totally the same how we pick it up, completely, completely different. The kid's looking at us really confused because he goes, but if I don't see it and I can't touch, it's not here. And we go, well, no, it is, because you're in Florida. You can kind of feel it all around you. And then we put him in the desert in Arizona. We go, you don't feel it here, do you? We bring them back to Florida and we show them the rain cloud, and we capture the water and we put it in the freezer because, oh, shit, it's all the same thing. So when people's bodies stop, it's not fully that they stop. It's that their body stop. We don't pick them up in the same way, but it doesn't mean they're not here. What does change is they no longer have the afflictions that were stuck by the brain that they got based on the experiences and the circumstances and the Jedi and all that stuff. So the essence of who they are is the part that ongoing, in a way that's more okay, in a way that's at peace. Einstein, who was a pretty smart dude, the only reason I know that is because everybody after him who's really smart is called an Einstein. So the dude had to be really smart, right? He came up with two very important things. One, who we are is energy plus matter equals this physical, touchable existence. And then what became the second law of thermal dynamics is that energy cannot be destroyed. It transforms. So what if when people's bodies stop, they don't stop working? It's that their bodies stop because they're no longer in need of it, they exit it. And see, where the peace comes in is they're no longer in pain. Because the pain was all about being in that body with that brain and that structure that they're no longer in pain. So the good news with dad is that he's no longer in pain. Right. And him doing that had nothing to do with his lack of love for you, had everything to do with what was off in the way that his structural makeup, brain experience was screwed up. Right? That's right. And as you're realizing this now, what are you noticing?
[130:01] B: I'm here.
[130:02] A: Yeah. What do you notice? Start to happen to the sadness. Right. We still don't like that it happened. But notice how it's not so heavy. Notice how it's begun to lighten up. Because dad certainly isn't wanting you, every time you think about him, to feel sad. Right? That's right. Yeah. And that's good news thing.
[130:36] B: Yeah.
[130:37] A: Yeah. Right? That's cool.
[130:44] B: Yeah. Like, I need to learn how to do this.
[130:50] A: There you go. Yeah. When I. When I went to my first training to learn how to do this, and I was getting, you know, the instructor gave us the directions, keep the person present. Fuck does that mean how? Right. Because I've done therapy, and anytime I've talked with somebody when they've been remembering something that was yucky, they're like, back there with it. And his instruction was, keep them present, keep them with you. He goes, go off and try it. So I'm on this, like, old Florida home, big wraparound porch, rocking chairs. And it's dusk, so it's starting to get dark. There's an open field in front of us. There's woods on one side, woods on the other side. And we're starting to go through this whole process. I got it in the back of my head, keep her present. Keep her present. Keep her present. And she's getting to the part where she's about to tell me the worst of the worst of the Lord. And you can kind of see, like, it's starting to keep her. On her. Keep her present. It was the most miraculous, amazing thing happened. It was if somebody went. Like it was on a movie set. Somebody went, cue the deer. And I'm looking this way, and she's looking that way. And out of the woods, prancing. Come a mama and a baby deer prancing across. And I see them out of the corner of my eyes. She's just about to be in the worst of the worst and the worst. And, like, having, like, the whole, like, thing. And I'm like, keep her pressing. Keep her going. What do I do?
[132:29] B: What do I do?
[132:29] A: And I just go look. And we both watch the mom and the baby go across the open field and disappear in the woods. And she puts it in the. And I look at her, and she goes, it's gone. It's gone. Like, it doesn't. It's gone. Like, I don't. And from that moment, I went, I really want to know how to do this shit really, really well. Cause that's cool.
[133:03] B: Yeah. Yeah, that is cool.
[133:07] A: Like, that's cool. And that's what it is. Like, I came from the mindset that we have to dig it out. Textbook, right? All of the stuff that we learned. Even when I was doing advanced stuff of, like, emdr, the eye movement, it was, like, process through it was still getting it out, having the abreaction. Then as I got to learn more, it's like, wait a minute. And then I put my own spin on it, which is. It's that the brain doesn't know that it's over. It's not what happened. It's not when it happened. It's that part of the brain never got the good news that it's not happening now. So it's merged. Because emotional brain isn't like intellectual brain. Emotional brain is animal. And an animal has no other time than now. A rabbit can't be later, and it can't be earlier. A rabbit's right now, always. But in our mind, we can be future or past. And if I'm thinking about past things that were bad. I'll feel it now. If I'm thinking about future things that might. That would be bad, I'll feel it now. But see, notice what's happening in you is you're becoming more and more emotionally present. Your brain is really reading the yucky stuff that happened as data, and it's installing resources, because if I made it through that shit, what else I can make it through?
[134:36] B: Anything.
[134:37] A: Right. God damn. I have one of the guys that works here, and, you know, he had military stuff, and he had to deal with, like, dead bodies. And he goes, there's not a single day that goes by here now that I don't have the clarity that no matter how shitty I feel or what's going on right now, now it's still better than that. That's pretty powerful.
[135:07] B: Yeah.
[135:07] A: Right. Right. And so you're on your way to soar. Right. Becoming more of who you really are. Connecting to more of you. Becoming more and more at peace and solid in you. Right. Good enough for you.
[135:27] B: Yeah. I'm feeling it.
[135:29] A: I know. That's so cool.
[135:33] B: It is really cool.
[135:34] A: It's exciting.
[135:36] B: I want to bring my mom here.
[135:38] A: Yeah. Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cause there's been lots of stuff. Right?
[135:47] B: Yeah.
[135:49] A: We want mom to be okay. Right.
[135:54] B: Well, it's not just limited to her. Maybe everybody I know.
[136:02] A: Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's an honor to get connected with you and collaborate with you.
[136:12] B: Yeah. That was cool.
[136:13] A: Yeah. Right. Notice how it didn't have anything to do with trust.
[136:17] B: No.
[136:17] A: Right.
[136:19] B: Still.
[136:20] A: Right. Right. Because the thing in life isn't to trust over here.
[136:30] B: Trust here.
[136:31] A: Yeah. Did I have what I need to see things clearly for what they are and that I'm good with collaborating. Right. Because we both have the same intention and the same outcome in mind. Right. And that's what it's about. And then what develops is, oh, well, what this person says they do.
[136:59] B: Yeah.
[137:00] A: Right. And it's always in the doing. That's the full tell. Yeah. Right.
[137:09] B: Not in the trusting.
[137:11] A: No. And not in what they say.
[137:13] B: Yeah.
[137:14] A: Right.
[137:17] B: Good stuff.
[137:18] A: Yeah. Yeah. Cause you have it in you. Mm. Good job. You did great today. Yeah. That was lots of fun.
[137:27] B: That was cool.
[137:29] A: Yeah. Any other. Any questions before we wrap up for today?
[137:36] B: No.
[137:37] A: Cool. So couple different things. You're gonna notice lots of changes. Some of the changes you'll notice right in the moment, you'll be in a situation that normally would trigger. And it might bloop for a moment, but then it goes right away and be like, oh, okay, that's cool. Sometimes you'll go through an experience and you'll be thinking back on, normally, I would have had all, and I didn't. So you'll notice that. Right. So you're going to notice those kinds of changes. Your brain is going to continue to filter and integrate what it's gotten and learn. So that even when you sleep and dream, it'll be integrating all of that. Right. The first few hours of sleep tend to be about the physical restoration of the body. The last few hours of sleep are about emotional restoration and the integration of new learnings. So all of that will circulate even more. Right. Anytime that you think of the hawk or even look up and see a soaring bird, that just continues to reinforce everything that we've done. And you'll notice things becoming solidified. And you'll even check later going, you know what he said? And I know how I feel right now, but let's see what happens tomorrow. You know, I'm just gonna check and think about, you know, like, the clients, maybe what he's supposed to. Yes. It is like Santa. Right. So you're gonna notice all of that kind of stuff for yourself. Cool. That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. Well, you did great today. That was lots of fun. Thanks. Thanks.
[139:16] B: You did great today, too.
[139:17] A: That was a lot of fun. Yeah. Who would have thought that we can deal with shitty stuff like that in a way that we get to have actually fun.
[139:24] B: Yeah. Like a therapy session I have never experienced in my life.
[139:29] A: Right.
[139:30] B: All the years and hours I spent.
[139:33] A: Right. Isn't that crazy?
[139:35] B: Yeah. And this was never the outcome.
[139:36] A: No.
[139:37] B: I never felt like I never left feeling like this. I always felt kind of like, ugh.
[139:44] A: I gotta go back. That sucks. Right? But they say this is on the way to healing, so. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I like it. Because you actually get to experience it and feel it right now. And as the person who was, like, doing work, to see it happen and it change is, like, super cool.
[140:07] B: Yeah.
[140:10] A: Awesome. All right, we will stop with that for now. You did great. You can come with me.
