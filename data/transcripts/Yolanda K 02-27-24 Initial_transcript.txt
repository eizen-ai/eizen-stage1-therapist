[00:00] A: Cool. So today is the 27th of February, Yolanda. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is valuable or transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals in how to do this. And I want to make sure that's okay with you. Cool. Okay. So the kinds of things that I know how to get better. So some people, they come in because they're more on edge. They're more easily irritated or agitated or aggravated. They're quick, they're short tempered, they're reactive. They say or they do things that they wish they hadn't. They don't want to be. So over the top of that. Some people, it's more tense, nervous, anxious, they get racing thoughts. Sometimes it worries about what others might be thinking about me. Sometimes it's like self consciousness going on. Sometimes it moves into full fledged panic, anxiety stuff. Sometimes it affects sleep. They don't want to be feeling like that. Some people have grief stuff that's stuck, meaning they think about a relationship or a loved one and they got all sorts of stuff with that. Some people, as we already know, have crap that's happened and although it's over, it's still underneath the surface of. Not that I think about it all the time, but if I do, it's still there. Right. Some people have, you know, nightmares, night terrors, like bad dreams where they lay down and kind of like in yucky stuff. Some of it probably is yucky stuff that did happen or a conglomeration, they want that to stop. Some people are more down. They used to have a little bit more energy or zest or interest. And so they're kind of like down and depressed. They don't want to be feeling like that. Some people, it's problematic. Urges, desires, cravings to use. They'd like to get that to stop too because they get that that's probably not useful. So those are the big categories of things that we know how to get better. All of them. So good. Well, I'm really glad you're here. That's a great news thing. Awesome. So then what would be useful for me to know, to understand.
[02:15] B: I was kidnapped.
[02:17] A: I don't need to know that.
[02:18] B: Okay.
[02:18] A: No, just think about what's not working, about how you function today.
[02:23] B: I have zero energy.
[02:25] A: Okay.
[02:26] B: It's hard for me to sleep.
[02:28] A: Like hard to get to sleep, hard to stay asleep. Both.
[02:33] B: I know this kind of contradicts each other. Like I'm tired all the time and I feel Like, I sleep all the time, but I don't really sleep, if that makes any sense.
[02:45] A: Like, are you up, up, like eyes open or restless or racy or like.
[02:55] B: Like when I actually do fall asleep, it takes me like an hour, two hours to fall asleep. But once I wake up, I feel like I never slept at all.
[03:03] A: Okay.
[03:04] B: So, like, I have really bad dreams.
[03:08] A: Okay.
[03:09] B: And so I'm to the point like, where I'm up and out of my room before I even realize I'm awake.
[03:17] A: Oh, wow, cool.
[03:20] B: So. And this is where it could be a problem, you know, because I'm in a program and I can't leave. And my last nightmare I had, I was up fully dressed out the door and walking towards the gate when I realized, like, I'm not in my dream anymore. So I'm not sure which scared me more, my dream or the fact that I was leaving. Yeah, so that could be a big problem.
[03:46] A: Okay, so.
[03:49] B: And I have really bad anxiety.
[03:53] A: How so? How does that show up?
[04:01] B: I don't. I don't know. Like, I just.
[04:04] A: Where might you be when you start feeling it? Where do you feel it in your body? What goes on? Are you fidgety?
[04:11] B: My stomach, My chest. I'm fidgety.
[04:13] A: So you feel it in your stomach and your chest?
[04:15] B: Yeah.
[04:16] A: Are there thoughts accompanying it too? Does it happen more in social situations? Does it happen more when you're by yourself?
[04:25] B: Social.
[04:26] A: Social situations. Okay. So there is that self conscious thing going on, worrying about others, whether I'm gonna come across okay. Or say what they're thinking about me or.
[04:42] B: Yeah, okay, well, it's not too much about, like, what they think about me or what are they gonna say about me. It's like, what are they gonna do and what are their motives?
[04:52] A: Hmm. So a lot more guarded, but guarded in a way that doesn't feel protected because you're guarded. But you're kind of looking through this lens at the world, so you're gonna miss a whole bunch of stuff to the side. That makes sense. So we want more of an open, more spaciousness in between you and others. Right. And more better discernment to kind of know what's going on over there. Because it's not about trusting them, because that would be dumb. Right. Like when my daughter was four and she wanted to pull me to her room to show me a surprise, she said, close your eyes. Am I supposed to close my eyes and think that she's not gonna, as she's pulling me to the room, bang me into shit in my house? So I do this. Right. Okay, good. Yeah.
[05:42] B: True.
[05:43] A: Right. So it's not about learning how to trust them because we don't live in a good world where trust is a good idea. Right. Trust is a bad idea in the crooked world we live in. To think that the other person will always have my best interest in mind is dumb. Right? They may have my best interest in mind as long as my interest matches theirs. Makes sense. As soon as their best interest is no longer the same as mine, I'm not thinking that they're looking out for me. Got it. So nobody has a fire detector in their house because they think their house is going to catch on fire one day. But nobody's not, you know, naive enough to not have one thinking this one could never catch. Right. They're there not even to prevent the fire, but they're there to alert us at the furthest distance, the earliest sign. So we have the most amount of ability to deal with it. We want that for you. Right. We want you to have a little more distance from stuff so that you have more ease in. You got it. We want the effect that the prior stuff has had cleared. We want to get it so that it's easier for you to lay down at night and effortlessly rest. Right. We want to get it so that you're feeling more replenished. Because why there's still that drain is that there's active energy being drained from moments of awful stuff that happen that your brain doesn't know is over. So it's still draining. That's why it may seem like I'm laying around or sleeping all the time, but I'm exhausted. Right. Because even when I was sleeping, it didn't feel like I was really sleeping. Right. Or I'm having these weird freaking dreams that are having me get dressed and walk out of the program that would be really bad for me to leave, let alone in a dream state in.
[07:44] B: The middle of a city I've never been in.
[07:47] A: Right? Yeah. No, Right. Okay. Okay. I follow you with that stuff. I know what to do to get that better. What else would be useful for me to know? What else do we want our time to do for you? Um. I don't know.
[08:12] B: Depression?
[08:13] A: What does that mean? How do you know you're depressed?
[08:16] B: Because I lay in my bed and cry all the time.
[08:19] A: Okay, so you feel bad and when you're crying, what do you. Is there a thing that you're crying about half time?
[08:30] B: No.
[08:32] A: So it's just the sensations? Yeah. That same thing with the stomach and. Okay. And that Shows up at different times. Typically when it's in your room.
[08:48] B: Well, I could be walking around, and then, like, all of a sudden, like, I feel, like, really upset about something, I don't even know what, and I just go to my room and isolate.
[09:02] A: So what might be one of those things that all of a sudden you start thinking about and feeling really upset? Like, if you were to think about one of those things now, can you feel a little bit of those feelings? Notice how you get a little bit of the feelings now, isn't that interesting? Do you notice them here and here? Now watch. Just notice those sensations and then make your eyes go big and wide. Okay. And then make the sound of curiosity. Go right. One more time. A bigger. Hmm. Right. And what do you notice starting to happen to the sensations? Isn't that weird? So we know what to do to get. That's just an example, by the way. That's not the treatment, but we know what to do to get the feelings to stop. Right. So when you say depressed, it's that sometimes I find myself thinking about things that when I think about them, I feel bad. And then I go, because I'm feeling bad, I go by myself to cry until I finally get to the place where I stopped crying. And then I get back up and go out and do whatever there is for me to do. Okay. Okay, cool. I understand that. What else would be useful for me to know you're doing great so far. You are. And I know what you do to get things better is really cool.
[10:38] B: I feel like I have zero motivation to do really anything.
[10:44] A: Yeah. So does it feel like you're just kind of, like, going through the motion? You're doing, like, all that you can to just do what you have to do?
[10:51] B: Yeah.
[10:52] A: Yeah. Okay. So we'd like that to be easier.
[10:56] B: Yes.
[10:57] A: Yeah. Because if you recognize a little bit, motivation is really only needed for the first few moments of something. Right. Like, I need to be motivated enough to get myself to that meeting. I need to be motivated enough to get myself to the cafeteria. Right. Once I get to the cafeteria, I'm gonna go ahead and grab the food. Does that make sense? Right. So we think we need to stay motivated, but we only need it to kickstart us doing the activity. Then it's not needed anymore. Like, people talk about it with exercise. Oh, I want to go for a bicycle ride. I need to be motivated to do it. Well, only to the extent that you recognize it's getting your clothes on and getting on the bike. Once you start pedaling, what's the likelihood that you're going to be like, ah, screw this thing, I'm turning around, going home. Right? No, once I get myself, I'm going to go ahead and do it. Okay. So there's been a lack of energy, lack of interest. Kind of feel like I'm just dragging myself through. We'd like to lighten the load a little bit. Okay, cool. What else are we wanting to do? Like I said, you're doing a good job so far. Yeah. Okay. So if we get that better, then we think our time was valuable for you. You think? Yeah. So therefore I'm going to describe to you how I'm envisioning things being for you when we're done. Right. So earlier you thought about whatever you needed to think about. You felt a little bit the you that I'm seeing when we're done. This you. She remembers having had those kinds of feelings, but if you asked her to get it, she wouldn't know how to get it. Meaning the effect of the awful stuff that happened to her, whether it be recent stuff or long time ago, whether it has anything to do with trafficking or not, the effect that it's had is cleared and gone. So the you that I'm seeing is much more emotionally present. Meaning that she's emotionally dealing with what's happening without the emotional effect of what has. She's got the wisdom, so a little more knowledge. Because she's gone through difficult stuff, yet at the same time her emotions are matching what's happening. Got it. The you that I'm seeing is a lot lighter. The you that I'm seeing is feeling much more. Okay. So that her mind is starting to bring to her awareness thoughts of things that are beneficial and possible for her. So that when she has the thought of it, it's like, oh, that'd be good and I can do it. And then it's easier for her to do it. Right. So that she's feeling good about what she's doing, she's satisfied in having done it the way that she did. The you that I'm seeing. When she lays down at night, she's, you know, tired and that it's much easier for her to just effortlessly rest. This is the you that I'm seeing when we're done. Got it. Now here's the crazy part. You don't have to see the you that I just described as clearly as I do, but know that I'm seeing how I'm intending things to breathe for you. Just like I can see you. And that's the question not, you know, is it going to what it would be like, Right. Not how we're going to get there, but would it be okay with you? That'd be okay to be the way I just described. Yeah. Which gives us a green light to organize towards it. Then we want to do a process that's about getting your body to feel more settled. Right. How we do it is we use brain lovers, right? Because if we want to accelerate healing, we want the person's body to be in a state of rest. That's why cold flus and surgery, we go, no, you want to rest, right? Same thing. We got a lever that we want to use to get your body more at a state of rest. The first lever, silly, it's about slightly lowering the jaw. I know it's silly. It's not like, ah, but it's just a little bit. Right. When you slightly lower your jaw, vagus nerve is activated, starts to put the body at a state of rest. Second lever, as you begin to breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale, a little bit longer on the exhale. Right? You can rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. And as you're breathing in, a little bit slower and deeper out, a little bit longer, check inside your body. Yolanda, how's your body starting to feel now? Right. And so one of the things for you to understand is because this is going to sound weird, but we're not troubled by the awful stuff that happened because it happened. So whether it happened a week ago, yesterday, 25 years ago, I'm not troubled because I went through it even though going through it was really fucking troubling. Got it. I'm not troubled now because that was awful then. I'm troubled now because emotionally my brain short circuited when I went through it and doesn't know those moments ended. Survive them. I move through it. I'm okay. Part of the brain never got the good news that it's over. And it doesn't work that way with a physical injury, right. If I fall and I break my arm when I'm 11, and if I told you about it right now and I'm emotional about it, you're gonna look at me like, what is wrong with this guy? He moves his hands all over the place. Why is he upset? But if I told you about what my uncle did to me when I was 11 and I started to get emotional about it, you'd be like, well, yeah, of course. Why does that emotional wound not heal? But this physical wound does, right? It's a weird question, isn't it? We have all sorts of thoughts about it. I wasn't able to fully express how it was making me feel because I was just trying to survive it or I buried it. But the reason that that one hasn't healed is only because part of the brain, when it happened, froze it and doesn't know that it ended. So instead of what therapy wants us to do is process and get bad feelings out of us. This is about getting good news into the part of the brain that doesn't know it ended. It's about unplugging the memory so the brain can read what happened as data about something that happened versus happening. Right. Once it's unplugged, then notice how with most bad things that happen, I feel bad about me, how it sometimes feels a little bit like it was my fault. Right? So the guy who even knows what uncle did, it's been 20 years, he's done therapy. He knows it wasn't his fault. He knows he didn't do anything wrong. He knows it had to do with what uncle and what was screwed up with Uncle. He knows some of it felt good to him, not because he wanted her to see in the guys, but because the body part touched in certain ways. He knows all of that information. He's done the work of forgiving Uncle. Why does he still feel the shame or the hurt or the anger? You would think once he knows that he should feel different. It doesn't work that way. So the problem is, once the bad thing happens, the meaning that gets attached makes it feel like it was more my fault. I should have known better. I shouldn't have been in that situation. I never should have said that thing. I never should have done that thing. I shouldn't, right? All of that goes on, which makes me feel worse about me. And that's why my brain starts looking for anything in the environment that's similar and why similar gets read is identical. Right? The dramatic example is the soldier diving on the ground as the firework explodes in the air. Now he knows he was at the firework celebration. He was the guy that actually lit the firework. But that other part of his brain that beats it hard and breathes for him and causes all the motion, that part has never gotten the good news that he's no longer at war. And so it confused the sound and thought it was a mortar or grenade. And that's why he dove on the ground. Makes sense. So what we know in you, Yolanda, is That there's aspects of your brain when awful moments happen that don't know. Certain awful moments ended. You survived it. You're here, you're okay. We have good news to giving. Just like if there was a soldier that got separated from the troops and he doesn't know the war has ended. When they do find him, we've got good news. The war is over. We've won. You can come home. That's great news for him. We got the same good news to get into aspects of your brain make sense. Any questions about that? You're following what I'm saying, right? So then all we want to do is we want to get your body again in the right state. So you slightly lower your jaw, and you rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. And you begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer. As you're breathing in this way right now, notice that you can look across and see me in my nose. I want you to stay looking at my nose when you see my fingers. And now stay looking at my nose, continuing to breathe as my fingers move all the way out. And just with the sides of your eyes, pick up my fingers wiggling. Isn't that cool that you're noticing more space, Right? Like this space towards the side windows and doors, the space that's between you and me and behind me, the space underneath you and above you and the space that's behind you. And as you're noticing more of the space, Yolanda, again, check inside your body. How's your body feeling now? Again, more relaxed, right? And then what we know is that when we're under a lot of stress, the stress has to be on top of me. That's why I'm telling you I'm under. That's why it sometimes feels like a weight on my chest or shoulders. And that the reversal is to be out from under and above it, having a different metaphor, a bird's eye view, which we know means a view from up there, seeing things underneath and below, right? So one more time, you slightly lower your jaw, you rest your tongue, you breathe a little bit slower and deeper, right? As you do, you see my nose, you notice space, space in the room and space that goes beyond the room, because the space literally goes out in all directions, right? All the way towards outer space and then beyond. So there's a lot of space, Right. As you're noticing the space, imagine what it would be like to float up out of your body beyond the ceiling, and that you're able to see everything underneath and below you. You're like a bird soaring in the sky. And not like perch, but like really flying. Soaring, gliding and moving. And again, as you're thinking about all of this, checking inside your body. How's your body feeling now? Isn't that cool? So now that your body's in this relaxed state, we're going to request that your unconscious travel back down the timeline of yucky moments that happen and bring a moment to your awareness for us to clear. It doesn't have to be the worst of the worst of the worst, but just a moment that whenever you think about it, it still has yuckiness attached. Your brain is going to travel back, Yolanda down. It's going to bring you. And it's going to take a moment and bring it to your awareness. Isn't that interesting? What just came to mind right now? The moment that came to mind happened about how long ago? Yeah. Good. And the feeling that comes up as you think about it. Does it? Anger, hurt, guilt, shame, grief, regret, remorse, angst, upset, worry. A combination. Right? Good. So first question. Would it be okay to get those feelings gone? And if those feelings are gone, would it in any way, shape or form mean what you went through was okay? Right. You get to be okay now, even if that shit wasn't then. Got it. So then how we clear something really, really simple requires one thing from you. Do you want to know what it is? Okay. Good. That probably could useful, right? The one thing is, you're going to intend to emotionally be with me. You're going to do that because this is what's happening and that shit isn't. Right. Two, we're working on a goal that we both want for you, future you. Three, I'm hoping to be at least a little more enjoyable than one of those sucky moments in your life. Got it. So I want you to be with me. And then you're going to tell me just facts. It'll go real fast. It'll go, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened. Then it was done. 3. Because it happened, you know what, when you were 10 or 10 years ago, when you were 14. So given that that happened, then there have been other things you've done after that was over that was way more enjoyable than that moment for you. Right. What's one thing? Anytime from when that was over until heck, yesterday, that was more enjoyable than that moment. Yeah. Playing with your son, way more enjoyable. Good. Something else. How old is he now?
[23:21] B: My son? Seven.
[23:22] A: Seven. So playing with your son right Good. Something else that's more enjoyable than that.
[23:29] B: Going to the beach.
[23:29] A: Yeah, going to the beach. Good. And one other thing.
[23:31] B: Getting my ged.
[23:32] A: Yeah, getting your gd. So we got plan with you. So we're getting your gd. We got going to the beach. All of those moments happen after that moment. There's a part of your brain that doesn't know anything beyond that moment. We have good news to get in. So when that moment happened, you were 14 when it happened. You might have been.
[23:50] B: Where was I?
[23:51] A: Yeah.
[23:52] B: At my uncle's house.
[23:53] A: So you're at your uncle's house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[23:55] B: Nighttime.
[23:55] A: Nighttime. And you're wearing the house. So you're on the couch. Right. And you're, like, watching tv. Right. And was there a blanket? No. So you're sitting, watching couch. Were you laying or just sitting? So you were laying down, watching TV on the couch. All right, good. Now be here. Notice how you're there. Hi. I want you here. Remember? Good job. Now you're coming back here. Good job. See the thing that you wanted? Right. Good job. See, it's way better. Better to be with me than back there then. Right. So all you want to do is intend to be with me because I'm more fun. And this is what's happening. And that's just data. And we want to get your brain to read it as data. So then you're laying on the couch watching tv. It's nighttime. Right. Then what happened next? Yeah, then what happened next? He came over the couch. Right. And then did he sit down on the couch or lay down on the couch? He laid down on the couch next to you. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[24:48] B: He raped me.
[24:49] A: Well, then he did what? He touched your body.
[24:51] B: Yeah.
[24:51] A: Right. And then he put his fingers into different parts of your body. And then he pulled your pants down. And then he put his penis in your vagina. Anywhere else? No. And then he stopped. Right. And then he took his penis out. And then that was over. And then he pulled clothes up. Then you pulled clothes up. Right. And then eventually you got off the couch. Right. And then later on, you did something more fun like play with your son or go to the beach. Right. What was the last one? Getting your ged. Right. Isn't that better? Right. So we got getting your GED Right. Now notice as you were telling me about it, some discomfort, but isn't it interesting that it was already less than normal? Right. Because you're intending to be with me. Now we're gonna go backwards. And when you go backwards with the memory. Literally unplugs it, takes away the charts. Watch. We got getting your gd, we got playing with your son. We got going to the beach. Then eventually you got off the couch, and then you had your clothes on. Then he pulled his clothes down, and then he stopped, and then he had his penis and your vagina, and then he touched different parts of your body. Then he had pulled your clothes off, and then he had laid down on the couch. Then before that, you were laying on the couch, and then before that, you'd gone over to your uncle's, and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. And as we go backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it? Isn't that weird, right? You just said it was fine, right? Normally think that when I think about it makes me feel bad. We just went backwards, and you're like, no, that's fine. Weird, right? Now, here's the third part. The emotional brain doesn't get logic, but it does get patterns of association. And the error is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening are glued. Got it? But there are things you can remember doing today that you know you're not doing right now. For example, putting your boots on. You can remember doing it. You can remember where you were when you did it. But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your boots on? And then I went, you want to stop putting on your boots? You'd look at me and go, I'm not putting on my boots. Because, you know, there's a big difference between the memory of you doing it and you actually doing it. They're not the same thing. If I said, well, then, you know, remember getting dressed, putting your jeans on. Stop putting on your jeans. You'd be like, I'm not putting on my jeans. Because there's a difference between the memory and the experience. Got it? So you can remember putting your boots on. You can remember him doing that, right? Well, you know, stop putting on your boots and say, I'm not putting on my boots. Say that. Well, then stop putting on your jeans. Say, I'm not putting on my jeans. Well, then stop me from putting on my sneaks. Say, you're not putting on your sneaks. Well, then you stop putting on your pants. Say, I'm not putting on my pants, right? Well, then stop him from doing that. Say, he's not doing that. Well, stop him from putting his penis there. Say, he's not putting his penis there. Stop him from touching your body there. Say, he's not doing that. Right. Well, then you stop putting on your sweatshirt, jacket, shirt. Right? Well then stop that from happening. Go. That's not happening. So then where is it? Say it no longer exists, which is what we want to get in. Right? And as this starts to get in, what do you notice happening?
[28:04] B: I'm forgetting about it?
[28:06] A: Well, no, you're remembering it, but it's not causing you to feel bad anymore. Right? Last little piece. That earlier you felt a little bit like that all happening. It's something to do with you did it. You were there. Right. But let's just check. Would it have mattered whether it was you or any other girl with that uncle at that age that was staying over there? Isn't that what he would have done? Right. Right. So did it have anything to do with you or did it have to do with what was screwed up with him? Right. And at 14, you didn't know what was screwed up with him. Because if we went back to it, if, you know, we could float back along the timeline prior to ever going and spending the night at uncle's, and if that you back then had known that he was going to do that, would you have gone? Right. But you didn't know that then. Right? So what we want to get in is the really good news. One, that it's over. That it no longer exists. Two, that him doing that had nothing to do with you, you and everything to do with what was off with him. Three, that you're okay. We want to let the earlier you know about playing with your son. Right? And going to the beach, getting your gd. So go ahead and close your eyes. Picture the earlier you let her know what you know now that it's over, finished, no longer exists. That you're okay. That him doing that had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with him. It's not about me. So that she gets it that you're okay. Right? Right. Let her know about playing with her son. Let her know about going to the beach, getting her ged. Let her know it's not about me, nothing to do with me. Let her know that you're okay. And again, as all of this gets in, what do you notice happening to the earlier view? What happens to her face now? She is okay. Isn't that cool? Notice for the first time ever, she's feeling okay. Hmm. Hmm. What's happening now?
[30:17] B: I don't know. I don't wanna cry.
[30:18] A: I know. But notice how it's not sad. Check it out. Check it out. Are the Tears, sad. Notice how they're of relief. Right, Right. We're on our way. Yolanda, I wanted to give you an experience of noticing what can be different for you. What we can change and get better in a really short period of time because we didn't spend a lot of time. And that one's already better. All right. Try to, you know, think about her. Try to feel really like, you know, shameful. Try to feel like it was your fault. Right. Got it. Yeah. Isn't that cool?
[31:02] B: Yeah.
[31:03] A: Yeah. And so your brain might go, hey, there's other ones that we want to clear too. And we'll get to those. We will. The thing for you to begin to realize is that you're now able to connect with somebody that knows how to get that stuff to be better. Right. Isn't that cool? Yeah. What's happening now? What else are you noticing for? You.
[31:29] B: Feel more relaxed.
[31:31] A: You do, don't you? Yeah. Even in your body. Mm. So we're on our way. Right. And again, this was more of a demonstration of where we're headed, because when we get back together again, we're gonna have a longer chunk of time than we do today to be able to actually do the change work. And notice when I noticed that you were there, what did I do that.
[31:59] B: You snapped me out of it.
[32:01] A: Yeah. Because what's my job in this?
[32:04] B: To keep me in the present.
[32:06] A: Yeah. Because I'm more fun. I'm a happening dude, and this is what's happening. Right. And that's my job. Right. Your job is just to have the intention of being with me so that if that happens, we're able to get you out of it quick. Right. Because notice, you didn't stay there very long, did you? Right. And notice even when you recalled it, it wasn't as. Because you were intending to be here. And now when you think about it, we still don't like it that it happened, but try to feel really bad about you, that somehow it was your fault, that you should have known. Right. And notice how that is, like, literally opposite of how it used to be. Isn't that cool? You're on your way, and then all we're going to do is we're going to give you a process that you can begin to utilize. Right. Because there's an interesting thing about curiosity and curiosity and the sound of curiosity with open eyes, like, is the antidote to anxiety and agitation. So the sensations go away. Right. And notice when you think about that, try to get those sensations, notice how they're not there. Isn't that cool? Right. So all sorts of things are changing in different ways. Your thing that you have to take with you is the process of slightly lowering your jaw, resting your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, and beginning to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer. Right. As you breathe in this way, notice that nose. Notice the fingers. Notice more space. Right. Because as you notice more space, you notice what it's doing inside. Right. As you have more awareness of space, you can be above it all, whether it be eyes opened or closed, kind of soaring like a bird above and over it all, free to move through the expanse of the space up above. All of that is beginning to light up neural circuits within your brain so that we start to rewire and change and update. Because that's really all that's needed is we need to update the brain because there are certain moments that cause glitches and errors in the way that your brain has been functioning for you. And we're going to tune those things up so the whole thing lightens up and you become light more. Okay. More free, more present. Got it. Cool. Any questions? How long have you been in Crossroads for?
[35:07] B: Seven months.
[35:08] A: Seven months. How long is the program?
[35:11] B: Six to 18 months. But I'm trying to get into SAA and there's a 12 month program I'm trying to get into.
[35:18] A: I see. Okay. So how did you get caught with a gun? Like had you had it for long? No, no. Isn't that the best? But definitely get a tattoo. So I always have it with me now.
[35:47] B: Yeah, it's the only one I could carry, so, you know, love it.
[35:54] A: Did it hurt on the hand?
[35:55] B: Yes.
[35:55] A: Yeah, it was well worth it.
[36:00] B: So I used to, like, I would have so much pain on the inside that I couldn't. I couldn't get it out. So I get a tattoo.
[36:08] A: Yeah.
[36:10] B: That's how I deal with my pain.
[36:13] A: And that's not a bad way. But we want to also lighten the load on the inside because aren't we actually doing the thing that alleviates. Isn't that cool? Right. You've been thinking I had to go get tattoos and I've done a good job of it.
[36:29] B: Yeah, Right.
[36:31] A: But what we can actually do is get it so that it's better. Better just by doing this. And this is a lot gentler. Yeah. Cool. Well, I'm way excited that we had a chance to get together. And like I said, I think we can make huge progress. We already have. We're on our way. Right. And that's what there is. We'll get back together again. We'll actually get all sorts of stuff changed. You'll leave and you'll notice it immediately, like you did with this one. But you'll notice it in your interactions. You might already start to notice that in certain situations, where normally I'd be, I'm not. Or if it goes on, it doesn't go so high. It doesn't last as long. So even if it does, it's not for as long as it used to that there's more space and room for things. You get to be more okay in here. That's where we're headed. Cool. Really nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. Cool. So, anything else for you for today? Or are we good for now? All right, cool. Come with me. We'll go out here.
