[00:00] A: So today is the 25th of March, Yolanda. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And you know that. And given what we do is useful, valuable, transformative, that recording might be made available and teaching others and how to do this kind of work, I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:17] B: Yes.
[00:17] A: Cool. All right. So how did our last piece leave you? Right, because we did something that had to do with something that happened when you were 14. Yeah. When you think about that now, what do you notice?
[00:31] B: I don't feel anything.
[00:33] A: Isn't that cool? Right? Yeah. Okay, so that's still better than it was. Okay. So the new thing that's kind of just like been here is I was at that program, now I'm in this program. I was being able to communicate with family. Grandfather passed away. That's been sad. But I haven't been able to like, talk to the people that I that like, I love and support me. And now I'm in this program and for a period of time, I'm not able to talk to them. And that's been troubling, or at least troubling in the moment that you came in. Okay, good. Let me turn that thing off. Hold on. Okay, cool. So what else? And what had you decided? To go to Selah, or at least to the assessment house. Because then you're gonna decide what you want to do after that. Right? Cool.
[01:28] B: The program I was in, I felt like it wasn't for me.
[01:32] A: Okay.
[01:34] B: So I learned what I could from it and moved on.
[01:38] A: Okay. Did you have to like, meet with a judge to do that or.
[01:42] B: My lawyers spoke with the judge and got it cleared.
[01:45] A: Okay. That you could go from Crossroads to the assessment house with Selah and then kind of look at what do I want to do? Do I want to go to their long term program or do something else somewhere else. Okay, cool. All right. Any other stuff that you think would be useful for me to know?
[02:07] B: That's about it right now.
[02:08] A: Okay. Okay. And then as we're thinking about what do we want our time together today to get accomplished for you? Right. Like if we could truly change, Yolanda, problematic ways that you've been ongoingly feeling or thinking or acting or reacting. You know, what do we want to get better? How do we want you to be when we're done?
[02:31] B: Not so depressed.
[02:33] A: Yeah. That was a really good place to start looking too, by the way. Yeah. And if you weren't so depressed, how would you actually be content? More content. Yeah. Okay. And what's it like for you, when you feel content, I'm able to sit.
[02:47] B: With myself and not cry or overthink things.
[02:52] A: Yeah. So we're aiming towards a you becoming much more content so that you're able to just like, be with you and be okay. Yeah. We want to turn down that overthinking so that we're actually done and over it. Yeah. Okay, cool. Right. So we got a you who's, you know, much more content. Right. Much more comfortable. This is quieter. How else do we want you to be.
[03:27] B: Able to sleep?
[03:29] A: Yeah. How has that been?
[03:32] B: Not good.
[03:32] A: Not good.
[03:33] B: I wake up like every hour of the hour.
[03:35] A: Oh, cool. Like the. The bells?
[03:39] B: Yeah.
[03:40] A: Okay, then do you go right back to sleep sometimes?
[03:44] B: Sometimes? No, I toss and turn for a while.
[03:46] A: Okay. Okay. So we want to get your sleep to be more regulated so like, kind of like your nervous system has ways to down regulate at night so that it's easier for you to rest. Yeah. Okay, cool. What else? That's it. I have one more. Maybe more than one, but I have at least one more. You wanna know what it is?
[04:12] B: Yeah.
[04:12] A: Okay. I want you to be free. I want you to be free from the effect that the past stuff has had on you. Whether it be the stuff that you did that there's guilt or regret or resentment or about having done it. Right. Or it's been done to you where there's hurt and anger and pain and sadness and grief. We want you to be free from the effect that it's had so that again, you get to be much more content, more okay. In you. So, like, you can just like, sit with yourself. Right. That this thing has been turned way down so it's a lot quieter. Right. And it's easier for you to rest at night knowing that, like, you're okay. Yeah. This is where we're headed. That makes sense. Yeah. And you don't have to see the you like I do, because the question isn't how it's going to happen, it's would it be okay with you? Yeah, I notice how it's okay. And isn't that a good news? Because we want you to also be lighter. Right. So that nobody feels up and depressed at the same time. They don't go together. Right. So we want you to be a lot lighter, maybe even a little bit easier on you. Make sense? Cool. All right. And we want it to be easier for you to just be with you. Right. Hold on, Let me fix this. Give me one second. My fun music did not turn on. Let's try this Again. There we go. Ah, now we have the fun music. Yeah. So as I said that, right. Like, is there any other stuff that comes to mind? Any other stuff that we want to get better or any other ways that we want you to be when we're done? No, we'll be okay with that. Like if we get you here, you'd leave here going, this is actually a really good Monday. Cool. So we're going for a happy Monday. Got it. So I went really fast the last time that we were here. But I want to lay out a little bit more of the understanding as to how come stuff gets stuck and how we rewire things. Things, right? Because one thing to understand, your brain knows how to heal itself, right? It does it for any cut or any wound. It heals it. And from the inside out, emotional things haven't fully healed because brain doesn't know they're over, right? It heals the broken bone because the injury that caused it is over. Right? It can't start healing it until it realizes that it's over. So emotional wounds, which we all have and some more than others, are still on because that emotional brain doesn't know that it's over. So we don't do the get it out of me, we do the get the good news in to the part that doesn't know I survived it, that doesn't know I'm here now and that's not happening, right. That doesn't have that kind of good news about doing other things, right. So we want to get that good news in. The second thing is our brain tends to be a really fast learner and sometimes even a one time learner. So the brain's job is to learn things as fast as it can and put it in automatic processing so I don't have to think about it anymore. Make sense. And then as I go through life, my brain will make predictions about what I'm going to encounter. And the predictions are based on past experiences and imagined future. So I kind of have like a predictive patterned behavior, so to speak, right? So that's what all habits are, right. Whether that be biting my nails or smoking cigarettes or other stuff, right. All habits getting up at the same time are habitual, automatic patterns that our brain runs. Does that make sense with those patterns on? It very much locks our view into a particular perception or story that it got running a narrative, so to speak. And in order to have a narrative, a narrative means that I'm deleting and distorting things that don't fit the narrative. So an example of that silly one would be a teenager. She's like 13, 14, she's going through puberty. She's got acne, she's got braces, she's got glasses, right? She doesn't feel good, like. And her mom tells her about the story of the ugly duckling and how that duck turns into a beautiful swan, right? And tries to tell the girl that all that stuff that's going on with her, it's only temporary, it's not going to last forever. And who you are on the inside is what truly matters. She tells her all that stuff, right? And one of two things will go on for that little girl. It'll go in one ear and right out the other. It'll get deleted or it'll get distorted. You're only saying that because you're my mom. It's not true. Does that make sense? So when I got that particular narrative, that narrative blocks anything that doesn't fit the narrative. And my brain just runs automatic patterned behavior over and over and over again. And if you think about it, many of the ways that you feel that you don't want to be feeling, whether it be in that down depressed way or that anxious way, or you're not choosing to do it right. It's not like you wake up at 6:30 in the morning and say, okay, today I'm going to feel depressed and tired and not really want to get out of bed and feel like I've got a weight on me, right? That that is not something that you decide for yourself. You might feel that way, but it wasn't because you chose it. Make sense. So there are automatic pattern behaviors that we're going to create prediction errors with so that we can change the narrative and the behavior. It's really about changing the relationship. We want to get your brain, when it comes to any of the past stuff, changing the relationship from one where it has it as happening to a different one where it has it as information about something that happened. Got it. We want the patterned behaviors in terms of reactions to stuff, those habits, we want to adjust those so that you're more settled so it's easier for you to feel that sense of calm and ease, content, light. Got it. So those are gonna happen. So we got it. That the troubling moments that we go through, some of them we're totally aware of, but some of them are actually hidden in the background. Like we don't know that we don't know. Right. But are there unconscious does know because it's got everything right. That Stuff stuck because part of the brain doesn't know it ever ended. Second thing, though I might have mentioned this, is when we're little children, we're trained to believe the same things, that good things happen because we're good. So I get toys, I get presents, I get candy, I get praise, I get cookies, I get love because I'm being good. Good things happen when I'm good. We tell that to kids because we want them to be good and grow up to be good boys and girls. The problem with that messaging is that the reverse has to be true as well. Because if the good things happen when I'm being good, it must mean the bad things only happen when I'm being bad or when there's something wrong with me or if I did something wrong. So for all the negative experiences that people go through, the feeling is somehow it was my fault, somehow I shouldn't have been there. Somehow I did something to deserve it. Somehow like that it had something to do with me. Make sense? So when the kid got beaten with a barbed wire fence because he got D's and F's, he's feeling like it's happening because he got bad grades. But, you know, stepdad was three sheets into the wind. And did it have to do with the kids bad grades or did it have to do with whatever was screwed up with Stephen? Stepdad make sense. So because they're bad, it always makes me feel like it's about me. Uncle did this thing to me, and some of what uncle did felt good. Well, it didn't feel good because I wanted him to do it. It felt good because when he manipulated that body part, that's what it's designed to do, right? Like, but the guy's like, really conflicted. How could I have been into that? That when knew it wasn't okay? Like my body betrayed, like all of those things keep going on with people. Does that make sense? Right? That somehow it has to do with somehow my fault. Right. I never should have wore that outfit that night. I never should have walked to the car by myself. I never should have done all these things. Go on. If I hadn't done this thing, then the bad thing wouldn't have happened. So therefore the bad thing happened because I did or didn't do something I should have or shouldn't have done. Got it with that layered on. That's why we walk around scanning, sorting, searching for anything that's similar to anything we went through that was painful. But similar gets read as identical. Right? That's why somebody who is mugged by somebody wearing a hoodie when they were 22, is now 52, and their husband comes around a corner wearing a hoodie, and they go, no, it's their freaking husband. Right. And of course, the issue when that mugging occurred that long ago was not what the person was wearing. That is not the part that bothered her. But because they co occurred, it got stuck. Does that make sense? So that happens to people all the time. Whether it be times of day, times of year, tones of voice, smells, sequences of all sorts of stuff can be triggers or reminders that all of a sudden my brain has the habit of, well, when that goes off, I do this and makes sense. And what we've recognized is that there are several ways in which your brain has been working that have not been the way you wanted it to work. And therefore, we also know, Yolanda, you're not the problem then, because you don't like feeling this way. When you're feeling it, does that make sense? So what's been problematic is that you were born with a supercomputer of a brain, and supercomputers, because they're complicated machines, are prone to error. And so it's just glitches and errors that we're going to tune up. Got it? Any questions from what I've said so far? Okay, cool. So next, I want you to think of a time when you were outside in nature, right? Like, you're there, you're in a natural setting, it's pretty outside, and you see something that captures your attention, and you're like, wow, what is it that you see?
[16:20] B: The sun reflecting off the river.
[16:23] A: Yeah. And isn't there a moment that as you're seeing it, you're feeling that all wonder, peace, excitement? And some people might tell you it is the reflection that's giving you the feelings. But if we looked at it a little differently, we could say that being there and seeing it drew your awareness down and in towards your center. Because what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited? Kind of like if there's a fire or outside, I'm cold, and I bring my hands towards the floor and I say, oh, my goodness, this fire is getting hotter. You would look at me and go, no, the fire's not getting any hotter. You're becoming more aware of the heat. Your hands got closer to the flames. So we know that in your life and in lots of different circumstances and times, your awareness has been anywhere but at your center. But what if at your center, you always are peaceful and excited? You know that there are two of us in here. How do you know that? When you look around and your senses bring in the data, your intellect organizes it, we call that knowledge. People refer to knowledge as light. We call it light of knowledge. At your center, it's a brighter light. It's light of wisdom. So now we've got knowledge, we've got wisdom. And as you know, I work with all sorts of people, have had really awful stuff happen. I remember a girl I worked with so long ago, older brother, Matchbox car, drive them up her leg and park them. So she had a lot around, all of it. And when we worked together that one time, boom. Gone. All the pain, the hurt, the sadness, the grief, the shit, gone. And I asked her, because I'm like, all that. I go, where was it? She goes, it's gone. I don't feel any of it anymore. And I said, that is so cool. And she said, it is. But I went to her, I go, but where was it? And the two of us started thinking. I go, was it at the surface level? And she's like, no, no, it wasn't intellectual. I said, oh, maybe it was hiding in your center. And she's like, really? How could it survive there? And the light where I'm peaceful and excited, I said, huh? Well, then, where was it? And this is what she told me. It's crazy. She goes, it was hiding in the shadows between the lights. I said, well, what happened? She goes, the lights are now touching. The shadows are gone. I said, whoa, that is cool. She said, it is. And then we started talking about how people oftentimes walk around thinking, thinking that they are the body that they're in. Like, you hear it all the time. This is my arm, this is my hand, this is my nose, right? It's my body, so my body must be me. But what if you're not your body? I know it's going to be a weird conversation now, but what if you're not actually your body? What if your body's totally yours, but it isn't actually you, right? Your feet alone are longer than they were when you were two. Yet despite the changes, you're still you. My mom lost the tip of her index finger in a snow cone machine accident. When they see her now, that was when she was 19. She's like 71. When they see her now, they don't say, hey, Susie, I'm glad almost all of you could show up today. She's all there. Totally, right? Even though that part of her body is missing. So we're Going to say, Yolanda, that you totally have a body, your body's totally yours. But what if it's not actually you? And then we go, okay, all right, we'll try that on. If I'm not my body, I must be my thoughts. Except what if you're not your thoughts? What if you're not even the thinker of your thoughts? What if you're really the observer of your thoughts? What if you're not your brain? What if you have a brain and your brain is an organ, just like your heart and your liver and your lungs. That's totally yours, but isn't actually you? Alright, so now we're getting to weird categories, because now we're saying that you're not your body and you're not your thoughts. Oh, well, then maybe you are what you do. Except there's lots of things you've done over time. And when you did this and then that and then that and then that, did you stop existing? No. Alright, so if you're not what you do, and if you're not your thoughts, and if you're not your body, you must be how you feel. Except you feel different ways at different times, so you can't be feeling. So then we go, okay, so if you're not your body, if you're not your thoughts, if you're not your feelings, if you're not what you do, then what the heck are you? Right? So let's just say that the who you are is what you became aware of as you see the light reflection off the river. That in that moment, your awareness was drawn down and in towards your center, where at your center you're peaceful and excited. That delight at the center is you. And the cool thing about light is that it can't be touched or harmed or hurt, right? And so we started talking about, okay, well, maybe I'm the light at the center, that I can't be touched, hurt or harm. And then we started talking about how people screw things up all the time. Like with identity, they say things like, I am depressed, I am anxious, I am shy, I am ocd, I am borderline, I am right. They think that the way that they feel or the category they get labeled is who they actually are. But if I go to the dentist and I'm super upset, and you go, why are you so upset, Yolanda? You'll never believe what the jerk did to me. And you go, what did he do? Well, first he put me in the chair. You're like, yeah, that. Immediately my head is going down. And My feet are coming up, and that's very uncomfortable. You're like, but you're at the dentist. Okay, well, then he takes this light, turns it on, moves it, positions it right in my eyes. I can't see anything. You're like, you're at the dentist. And I go, well, then he took this cold metal instrument, shoved it inside of me. And you're like, Dr. Q. And you're what? I go, you minded my mouth. I'm at the freaking dentist. But that's the same thing that I said to the girl with her brother in the Matchbox Cars. I said, when you were little, he messed with your stuff. And she said, he did. And for a really long time, that screwed up my thinking, that screwed up my feeling. That screwed up a lot of what I did. And then she looked at me and she had that glowing smile again. And she goes, but you know what? He never touched me. He messed with my stuff, but he never got me. And I went, whoa, that's cool. And so we're organizing your brain towards the future you, who's much more content and at any able to sit with herself, is a lot lighter and free, much more okay and comfortable in her own skin. This is the you that we're organizing towards. Now what we're going to do is cause your brain to become even more responsive. Organizing towards this future you. Right. That might even be really well symbolized with the reflection of the sun out the river. That's right. A you, who's much more okay in you. And then all there is to do is that same little process we started with before. You're going to slightly lower your jaw. You can put both feet on the floor. You can rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth. That's right. And begin to breathe. Breathe in a little bit slower and deeper. And then out a little bit longer. Right. Continuing to breathe in this way. Right. What do you notice starting to happen in your body feeling more tense or more calm? That's right. As your body's feeling more calm, you're going to see my nose. And then with the sides of your eyes, pick up my fingers moving out all the way until you see them wiggling. So you again. That's right. Continue to breathe in that slower and deeper way. You see my nose, My fingers, they go out. Stay looking at my nose. Sides of your eyes, pick them up. Wiggling. You're aware of the space. The space between you and me, Right? The space beyond me. That's right. The space behind you, underneath you and above your Head. That's right. The space goes out in all directions. It's truly unending. As you're noticing the space again, check inside your body. How's your body feeling now? It is calm. And then just for a moment, go ahead and close your eyes and imagine that with your eyes closed, you can float up and out of your body beyond the roof, all the way up. Getting above and over it all free. Like a bird is able to soar through the wide open space of the sky. Imagine soaring, flying and gliding and moving through the space of the sky. So much space and room for more. That's right. Of you becoming more okay in you, content just sitting with you. That's right. That's right. Bring your awareness when you're ready, back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you. That's right. And then when you're ready and nice big deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Good job. And again, in those short moments eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourself?
[27:24] B: I was calm.
[27:25] A: Yeah. Body's much more calm. Right. And see, your body, brain is able to rewire. All we're going to do is get your body into the right states for healing. And then we're going to request that your unconscious scan back through moments of things that have happened. Because once we get a pattern to behavior, the next time I go through the same thing, thing, it just gets looped into the same pattern. Kind of like what they do. Have you ever seen somebody make cotton candy? Well, they start with like an empty plastic or paper cone. It's empty and they. There's this machine that's blowing air and, you know, fluffy cottony candy looks like clouds. And so they stick the cone in and they spin it ground like that, and it gathers and it becomes like this big thing of cotton candy. Right? We go through moments that then we go through a similar moment that gets looped into it, that then we go through another moment, then we hit another similar movement that goes through that. And there's multitudes of those that they're being what we call scaffolded on. That's why a lot of times when we get to this present moment, our emotional reaction is way more than the situation actually required. Right. We can think of like two people who are arguing over something that I ask you on a 0 to 10 scale, Yolanda, what's it rated? You're like 2, maybe a 1. It's not that big of a deal. But we see them screaming at each other, faces bright red Pounding the table, Somebody smashing stuff on the ground. Their emotions are like 79. They're clearly not dealing with just what happened. Isn't that weird? They're dealing with all of the past similars that have been looped or accumulated over time. Snowbell. Snowball going down the hill accumulates the snow and becomes bigger. Make sense? What we're going to do is get some linchpins. So what's kept this stuff st is a multitude of factors. But all we got to do is get a couple of the linchpins so that we have leverage points. And then we can change the pattern behavior. We can change the emotion that was connected to the things that happened. We're really doing an update. So it's much easier for you to be present now connected to what is going on. Feeling good? Lighter. Right. That's where we're headed. So one more time I'm going to show you something that I think is kind of interesting. So take this arm and put it on there. Then you're going to take that hand up. You're going to turn it like this. You're going to hold it like that. And like that. You're going to flat there. Good. Like that. You're going to look at that spot right there. Don't do anything at all on purpose. You'll want to move that hand or the fingers. Just kind of look at that spot. Notice that you can narrow in on that spot, but you can also see more than that spot. Like the space around the hand between you and the hand, beyond the hand. And begin to have a little bit of curiosity about what you might notice. That's right. Beginning to happen. As that hand begins to move in different ways than how you would. That's right. On purpose. Decide to move that hand. Become particularly curious. That's right. About when you'll begin to notice slight little. That's right. Vibrations or twitches or wiggles or jumps or jerks. Starts and stops within the fingers of that hand. That's right. Notice that you can see beyond the hand. That's right. That's right. Notice that you're able to drift down deeper inside towards the light at your center. Realizing that every time your eyes blink. That's right. They glance. Every time your eyes blink. That's right. They close. And whenever you're. That's right. Eyes blink and close. That's right. Eyes sometimes wanna stay close. Because when. And they blink and close. And then they stay closed. They rest. And when your eyes rest close, you also rest. You're aware of your Breath and my voice in the background sounds and how it feels to be seated in the way you are able to notice it all at the same time. The other than conscious parts of your brain are also organizing towards the future you now symbolized by the reflection of the sun and the river. That future you who's peaceful, clear, present, free, connecting to what matters, doing the things that feel good, having the satisfaction of having done it, lightness, contentment and ease on the inside. All of this is happening now without you having to do anything at all to do it. Yolanda, your unconscious is doing it for you. As you're resting, it's already begun to scan back, beginning to group categorize sort different moments and experiences. Knowing which moments would be most useful to bring to your awareness and in which order. Getting things set up so that even more healing happens from the inside out. That's right. That's right. And so whenever you're ready and again, you can take your time finding your way back up to open your eyes and see the point. That's right. That there's more than one point of what's happening now. There might be what you're aware of. Then there's all the other stuff that's happening that you don't have to be consciously aware of to begin. That's right. To know that your unconscious is responding to you and organizing inside as you rest. That's right. Take one more deep breath in and a big exhale. That's right. And again. Checking in body. How's your body feeling now? It is calm. And as your body's calm, your unconscious is going to travel back. It's going to narrow back growing you earlier and younger and bring a particular moment to your awareness for us to unplug and clear. Yeah. What comes to mind now? And is there a specific moment with mom's ex boyfriend? Good. So we're going to think about one again. All you're going to do is have the intention of being with me here right now. Because this isn't. That isn't. I'm hoping that this is better than that was. Isn't it already? I mean already this is better than that was what we've been doing so far. Yeah. Right. Good. I'm glad. That's what I want. Right. Because this is. And that isn't. Two, we're working on the goal that we both want for you. Three, I'm more enjoyable to be where I'm right and sometimes I say stupid dumb jokes and I might every once in a while get a smile from you. There it is. Another dumb joke. Right? So we want to get that cleared. You're going to intend to be here when that happened, you were about how old?
[37:00] B: 15.
[37:01] A: 15. Good. Okay. And we know that there have been things that you've done after. I know you told me a couple of them. I wrote them down because I probably wasn't going to remember them. But you told me playing with your son, who's 7, getting your GED and walking on the beach. Those were three things that you told me before. But what's something else? Because I want to know more things that you've done after that that were more fun than that.
[37:20] B: Camping, Spending time with my friends.
[37:22] A: Yeah. Camping, spending time with friends and family. All those things way more enjoyable than that one. There's a part of your brain that doesn't have any access to anything later, like hanging out with good friends or being with family. Right. Going to the beach harder. Being with your son or getting your ged. All those things. Way better. We got good news, don't we? Yeah. So when that one happened, you're about 15. When it happened, you're where?
[37:52] B: At the trailer.
[37:53] A: So you're at the trailer. Good. Was at daytime or nighttime? Daytime. And you're wearing the trailer. You're on the couch, right. And, like, you're sitting, laying down. So you're bent over on the couch. Right. So like this, like sitting on the couch. How you doing? Right now? Be here. Hi. Not there. Here. Good job. Right. So you're sitting on the couch and you're kind of bent over. Right. He's where? He's behind you. Right. Good. And so you're. He's. You're bent over, he's behind you. Right. And then what happened next? He put his penis in your vagina. He did that for a period of time and then he stopped. And then you got moved. Right. And then that moment ended. And then you pulled up your clothes and then you went off and did something else. And then later on, you did something more fun, like go to the beach or play with your son. Right. Or get your ged, hang out with good friends. Right. Again, as you were telling me about it, what'd you notice?
[38:57] B: That I try to stay here.
[38:58] A: I know. And so when you were telling me about it and you were being here, notice how it was a little bit less. Right. Isn't that cool? Good job. So then what do we do? We go backwards, Right. Because we want to unplug the whole thing. So we've got, you know, being at the beach. And playing with your son. We got getting your gdp, right? We got hanging out with good friends, right? And then you were off doing something, and then you put your clothes back on, and then it had stopped, and then he had his penis in your vagina, and then he put his penis in your vagina, and then he had you come over to the couch. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Right? And as I go backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it? Right. Isn't that weird and cool? Both weird and cool at the same time? Right? You can remember him doing that. You can remember putting on your jeans today. So if I said to you, yolanda, stop putting on your jeans, remember doing it, but stop doing it, you'd be like, I'm not doing it. Are you putting your jeans on right now? No. Right, so stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that. Well, stop me from putting on my shirt. Say you're not putting on your shirt. Well, then you stop putting on your jeans. I am not putting on my jeans. Well, stop him from doing that. Say he's not doing that.
[40:07] B: He's not doing that.
[40:08] A: Stop it from happening, though. It's not happening. Where is it? Say it doesn't exist. Bingo. Which is what we want to get in. And again, him doing that, did that have anything to do with you? No. Had to do with what was off with him. Got it. And you didn't fully know that then. Right. So close your eyes, picture the earlier you, and let her know that moment's over, finished, no longer. Exactly. Let her know that you're okay. It's not about me. Had nothing to do with you at all. Had everything to do with. It's not about me. Let her know that you're okay. Let her know about playing with her son. Let her know about advocating to get into a different program that you think will be better. Right. About going to the beach, getting her gd. Let her know. Right. And as it gets into the earlier, you. What do you notice happening to her face?
[40:59] B: She's cheering up.
[41:01] A: She is. Oh, you mean she's cheering up. She's looking lighter. Lightening up, cheering up. Mm. And you can open your eyes, notice how she's not stuck there. Right. And see, depression sometimes is emotion that I can't fully get out in a different way that we're all about getting it lightened and lifted so that you're more okay in you. Right. Even if there are moments where you might feel down, there are only moments, Right? How do you know by the way, when to feel depressed.
[41:39] B: My body just feels like.
[41:41] A: Oh, just feel. Where do you feel it in your body?
[41:44] B: My chest.
[41:45] A: The chest. And what do you notice about your chest? What are the sensations that you're noticing?
[41:49] B: It's heavy.
[41:50] A: Heavy. Does it feel heavy now? A little bit. So you notice a little bit of the heaviness, the weight on your chest. Okay, now watch. We're going to bring a little bit of curiosity to the heaviness. But curiosity like a kid has curiosity, like you're seven older. It's like big eyes, Right. When people have big eyes with curiosity and they make the curious sound, they go, hmm. Right. So I want you to get real curious about the sensations you're noticing in your chest, not have your eyes be real big and go, hmm, Right. One more time. A big verbose. Hmm. Right. What do you start noticing happening to the sensations? It starts going away. Isn't that kind of interesting? Right. Because if those sensations weren't there, would you still be depressed? Right. If it wasn't feeling heavy, would you still be depressed or would you lighten up a little? You would lighten up a little and wouldn't that be better? That's right. That's right. So again, as we're organizing towards the you, that other part's going to travel back in another moment. We'll be brought to your awareness. What comes to mind now?
[43:06] B: David's friend.
[43:07] A: David's friend. David is my mom's boyfriend. Mom's boyfriend. Ex. Boyfriend. When you were how old?
[43:15] B: 15.
[43:15] A: 15. Right. So David's friend. So David's friend. You're where when this one happened. But we want to think of one time that it did. Did he take you to different places? Is it all one strung together or did he do it multiple times? Oh, good. Well, let's go through the whole thing, but you be here really quick like that. Or we could do it like, you know the circus stuff. Right. We could do it at that tempo. Right, right. Well, even just like watch it go by, like just think of like what happened then. Like you might have been like that 15 year old and like we got it that it's strung together with about a bunch of things. Like notice when it starts, we're going to have it go by all the way through and then it was over. Right. And then later on you did something more fun like, you know, play with your son or go to the beach, hang out with good friends. Right, Got it. Right. So even that way, as we went through, what did you notice?
[44:26] B: I'm not sure.
[44:27] A: You're not sure? Well, let's think about it. So it's David's friend, and it starts your. Where?
[44:33] B: I'm at the house.
[44:34] A: You're at the house. Right. He comes over.
[44:38] B: I may go with him.
[44:40] A: So David says you got to go with him.
[44:41] B: Yes.
[44:42] A: Right. So you go with him. Right. He put you in a car, or you guys walked in the truck. So he put you in the truck. Right. And he drove to Jacksonville. Jacksonville. So that was a long drive. Right. Good. So he drove to Jacksonville. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[44:54] B: He got to his house.
[44:56] A: Yes.
[44:56] B: And he locked me in a room.
[44:59] A: Right. Cuz. So he locked you in a room. That was weird. Like. Right, Good. Then what happened next?
[45:06] B: He took advantage of me multiple times.
[45:08] A: He did what? He, like, put his. Took your clothes off, put his penis in different parts of your body, had sex with your body. Right. And different times. Right. Good. When he came into the room. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[45:23] B: Eventually, I got out.
[45:25] A: Well, then he stopped doing that. Right. And then you were able to get out of the room. Right. Good job. Right. Which was better than when you were locked in there. Right. Then what happened next?
[45:34] B: I went to the store and called my uncle.
[45:37] A: Right. So you went to the store, he called uncle. Right. Good. Then what happened next? He drove to Jacksonville and came and got you. Right. And then your uncle drove you back home, and then that moment was over. And then later on, you did something more fun. Right. Like go to the beach or play with your son. Right. Or hang out with good friends. Right. And again, what did you notice as you're being here?
[46:06] B: That it doesn't feel as heavy.
[46:08] A: It doesn't. Oh, it's already lightening up, isn't it? Right. Isn't that cool? By the way, how resourceful is that? Younger you. You don't think so have the things that she couldn't not stop. She couldn't stop certain things from happening, but got herself out of there and got herself home. So literally got it to stop. Well, we want to go backwards so it's totally clear. We got being at the beach, we got, you know, playing with your son, we got getting the gt, we got hanging out with good friends. Right. Then you were back home. Then your uncle drove you home, and then he had gotten you, and then you had called him, and then you'd gone to the store, and then you got out of the room, and then you were in the room, and then he had sex with your body in different ways, different times. And you. Then he came Back in and out of that room, and then he had locked you in the room. And then you guys got to Jacksonville, and then he drove you to Jacksonville, and then you got in the truck, and then you were told, you have to go with this guy. And then you were back at the house. Right. And then he had gotten there. And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. Right. As we go backwards again compared to forward, what do you notice?
[47:20] B: It doesn't have much impact.
[47:22] A: Oh, it doesn't? Oh. Is there anything about it that's troubling? Isn't that cool? You can remember all that happening. You can remember putting your jeans on. Stop putting on your jeans. Say, I'm not putting on my jeans.
[47:35] B: I'm not putting on my jeans.
[47:36] A: Well, stop me from putting on my pants. Say, you're not putting on your pants. Well, then you stop putting on your sandals. Well, then stop him from doing that. Stop him from doing that to your body. Will you stop combing your hair? Stop me from putting on my shirt. Stop him from doing that stuff. So then where is it? Say it doesn't exist. Right? And again, that happening had nothing to do with you. Everything to do with what was off with them. Make sense? And here's the last little part to that. Just check it out. She was there as long as she had to be and then got out and got away. You might want to, you know, feel pretty good about that part. What do you think? I mean, think about it like, you know, looking back at that earlier, you. Wasn't that pretty darn resourceful of her? To get out, to get to a store, to know a number. How many people know phone numbers now?
[48:39] B: Not a lot.
[48:40] A: Not a lot, Right? For you, able to get to a store and make a call, that's pretty impressive. Are you able to get away? Right. So what would it be like to actually start to feel good about that?
[49:01] B: I don't know.
[49:02] A: You don't know? Well, would it be okay to start to feel good about that? That you got it to stop and you got away? I mean, there's a part of your brain, by the way, that doesn't know that you got it to stop and you got away. There are moments when you were thinking when you were in that room and you couldn't get out and it was locked, right. That you were never gonna get out and never get away. Do you follow me with that? What do we want that you, who's stuck in the room to know that I'll make it out and.
[49:36] B: I'll Be okay.
[49:37] A: I got away. I got myself back home. Didn't you? Right to where you have more connections, more resources. That's pretty. Yeah. So close your eyes. Picture that earlier, you let her know what you know. Now, over, finished, completed, defeated, no longer exists. I made it through it. I got out. I got it to stop. I got away. I called somebody to get me. I got away. I got back home. I don't know. It's fully over, finished, no longer exists. I got away. That's right. I'm okay. Let her know about her son. Let her know about getting her ged. Another thing, about being resilient. That's right. Let her know about being at the beach, hanging out with good friends, connections with family, ones that she really likes. Right. Take a deep breath in, exhale, and open your eyes. Yeah. And what do you notice about that? Earlier, you. Now, she is happier, isn't she? Right. And how about you? You are becoming more comfortable. What are you noticing about the weight?
[50:54] B: It's lighter.
[50:55] A: Oh, it is lighter. I wonder what happens if you get a little more curious about what happens when it's lightening up and so that you can notice those sensations and just be like, that's right. Go. Hmm. What do you notice happening to those sensations? What's that?
[51:20] B: I don't know.
[51:21] A: You don't know what happened to them? Are they there? Did they move? Keep checking. I know. Keep checking because that's where you go to find it, right? Is it there anymore? Oh, isn't that cool? Well, then, how does it feel?
[51:37] B: Fine.
[51:38] A: Fine. Oh, like content. Oh. Huh. Isn't that cool? Feeling more content? Mm. That is a good news thing. Right? So let's think one more time. We're gonna do a little process that's going to have your brain become even more responsive to you. So we think of the river or the reflection of the light. See that? In your mind's eye. Take a deep breath in and then exhale and close your eyes. Notice that with your eyes closed, your eyes can rest. And that as your eyes are resting closed, you can also rest. That's right. And as you're resting with your eyes closed, everything else that needs to happen is happening on its own. Your unconscious is now taking. Integrating what it's gotten and learned, reorganizing your relationship so that the brain begins to read all of that as data. That reinforces how strong you really are to have made it through all of that and more. That's right. That's right. Beginning to become more and more clear. That's right. That there was lots of grooming that caused me to be in the places I was and do the things I did. That's right. And that you're on your way to becoming even more free. Just that the light reflects off the river. Free to be much more okay in you. Peace, Fully integrating inside you are. That's right. And then, whenever you're ready, once again, taking your time, slowly find your way back. Up and up. And eyes are open. Good job. And again. How's your body feeling now?
[54:34] B: Calm and relaxed.
[54:35] A: It is calm and relaxed. So as your body stays calm and relaxed, that unconscious part travels back down the timeline of experiences in your own history and will bring another moment. By the way, when you think about those two, that one with stepdad, that one with that stepdad's friend, what do you notice about him now?
[54:59] B: No feelings attached.
[55:01] A: No feelings attached. Right. And even when you go to, you know, locate them, are they in the same spot when you go to remember them, notice how they're not even in the same location that they used to be. They're probably moving back towards the things that used to be true that aren't. Right. Like things like I used to be too, but I'm not. Like, I know it used to be true, but I clearly. No, not in hell. Right, Right. So again, another moment will be brought to your awareness to clear what's coming to mind.
[55:36] B: Now, my dad's ex girlfriend.
[55:39] A: Yeah, that one happened when you were how old? 16. 16. You're aware and what happened?
[55:48] B: It's my brother's birthday.
[55:49] A: So it's your brother's birthday and you're over at your dad's. Yeah. Good job. Right. So you're at the house or the trailer or wherever it was that he lived.
[55:58] B: I went with her to pick up a birthday cake.
[56:00] A: Yes. Good job. So she was driving, you were in the passenger seat.
[56:04] B: Yeah.
[56:05] A: Right.
[56:05] B: And stopped to get something to drink.
[56:07] A: Yes.
[56:08] B: And she put something in my drink.
[56:11] A: So that you knew of?
[56:13] B: No.
[56:13] A: Oh, so you guys stopped to get a drink of like Sprite, Coke, a Polar Pop. Right. Good. So you went to go get a polar Pop, you got one. She must have put something in your drink, but you didn't know it at the time. Got it. So you're drinking it. Right. Good. Right. Then what happened next?
[56:29] B: Then we stop at a hotel.
[56:31] A: Right. Good job. Good detail. Which was weird. Why are we stopping here? Right, Right. This is not where the cake is. Right, Right. Good. Then what happened?
[56:40] B: I started filling. Dizzy.
[56:42] A: Yes. Kajab. Kadita. Right.
[56:44] B: Everything was fuzzy yes. She went to the door.
[56:48] A: Right. Good job at detail. Right. To the door of the hotel. Yeah. Cuz it's one of those rooms that are on the outside. Right. So High Dollar Motel. And we are. Right. If it's on the. If the door's on the outside, it's probably. Yeah. So, right, good. What happened next? Right.
[57:05] B: A guy came out.
[57:06] A: Yes.
[57:06] B: And got me out of the vehicle.
[57:09] A: Right. So he got you out of the vehicle, but you were kind of like all out of it. Right, good. Then what happened next?
[57:14] B: He took me in the room.
[57:15] A: Yes.
[57:16] B: And then I woke up at the hospital.
[57:18] A: He took you in the room. She must have left at some point. Right. And then you woke up and you were in the hospital, which was a weird place to wake up. You're like, what? Right then what happened next?
[57:28] B: The doctor told me that they found 26 different guys semen inside.
[57:33] A: Good job. Get detail. Right, and then what happened next?
[57:36] B: I had to talk to a bunch of cops.
[57:38] A: Yes. Right. And then what happened next?
[57:40] B: My mom came and got me.
[57:42] A: Oh, then your mom came and got you, which was better than when you were having to answer all those questions. And that was happening. Right. And then that was over.
[57:48] B: Yes.
[57:49] A: Oh, and then later on you did something more fun, Right. Like hang out with good friends and go to the beach and, you know, play with your son and get your ged. Right, good. And again, as you were going through it, what did you notice? Same. More or less.
[58:07] B: I don't know.
[58:08] A: Oh, well, how's your body feeling now?
[58:14] B: I don't know, kind of tense.
[58:16] A: It's kind of tense. Good. So check in. Where do you notice the tension? Oh, your chest again. Right. So just, you know, notice the tension in your chest. Right. Get a little curious about it, open your eyes big and go, hmm, Right. Just get real curious, go, I wonder what? And go, hmm, Right. And what do you notice about the sensations happening now? Oh, it is going away, isn't it? Right, so we want to get this one to be completely clear. By the way, do you know what happens with animals and chase scenes? Has anybody ever told you about that? It's a really interesting thing. So when an animal, like a rabbit is running for its life, right. Fox is chasing it, you can see it on like a National Geographic. There will be a moment in that rabbit being that it realizes its death is inevitable. Like it's not going to get away. There's no exit routes that it can see. It's getting tired. Right. Not got enough. The fox is gaining. So the animal has the Deception that its death is inevitable. Okay. There will be a moment when that happens during that chase scene that the body of the rabbit will stop and be completely still. And it'll be moments before the fox ever pounces. And the moment that the body stops and is completely still, the life force takes rabbit. So rabbit doesn't have to be there for what's happening to Bodi. Isn't that interesting? We can do that. Like, I've done that. Like, there's a woman that I worked with, she was in, like, a torture situation, and she remembers the moment right up to where the guy was taking the cigar and about to take the hot embers into. She felt the warmth. She went away, gone. She didn't come back in her body right? Until it was over and she was laying down. And people were like, hey, we got a way out. Come on, follow us. Not crazy. So one of the things that we want to be getting is the information all the way through, right? Because with something like that happening and you being drugged, you weren't there for what was happening with your body. Make sense? So we want to get it to be completely unplugged. So we got, you know, mom bring you home, and then mom coming, getting you, and then you being at the station or jail or wherever it was that they took you to be telling them and answering the questions, Right? And then. Or did you have to do that in the hospital? Oh, good. So then the police had come to the hospital, right? And then they had told you that they had a bunch of different semen specimens in your different body parts. And then you had kind of woken up, Right. And then before that, clearly you'd gotten to the hospital. Then before that, they did whatever they did to your body. Then before that, he had brought you into the room, then he come to the car, and then you were feeling all woozy and dizzy, and then you were drinking down your Polar Pop. And then before that, you would stop to get him. And then before that, you guys were on your way to go get birthday cake for your brother. And then before that, you were getting stuff ready for your brother's birthday. Then before that, you probably got up. And as we go backwards compared to forward again, emotionally, how was it?
[61:42] B: Better.
[61:43] A: Yeah, better. You can remember that happening, or at least the parts that you do that you were there for. Right? But you can also remember putting on your pants. Yolanda, stop putting on your pants. Stop putting on your watch. It'll stop me from putting gel in my hair.
[61:56] B: You're not putting jelly.
[61:58] A: Well, then you stop brushing your teeth.
[61:59] B: I'm not brushing.
[62:00] A: Well, then stop them from doing that.
[62:01] B: They're not doing.
[62:02] A: Well, then you stop drinking the Polar Pop.
[62:03] B: I'm not drinking.
[62:05] A: Right. Well then stop them from doing that to your body. Say they're not doing that. Well, then stop it from happening. Say it's not happening. It's not happening, you said. Then where is it? Say it no longer exists. Dingle. Which is what we want to get in, Right? By the way, is there any part of your body back then that's the same now? No, they've all been replaced millions of times. Isn't that crazy? Like there's no part of your body? I'm going to show you something that's really interesting. So take your hand and hold it like that, okay? Then you're gonna look at that spot right there. As you look at that spot, I'm gonna take my hand and I'm gonna move it towards your hand. So with the sides of your eyes, you'll know that you'll be able to pick up my hand moving in towards your hand. And then. And before my hand ever touches your hand, you're going to notice that you can feel my hand. Notice how you can begin to feel the warmth coming from the palm and my fingers, right? Notice how you can sense the energy between your hand and my hand. Notice how it feels very different with it here than there. And you can see my point that with it here, don't you feel it? You can feel the energy, right? And see as you feel the energy, what this means is I'm coming closer to touching who you really are than anybody that ever messed with your body, screwed up your thinking, or hurt your feelings. Because who you really are can only be touched with respect. And when you want the love that it allows in, right? So I want you to repeat this after me. I have a nose.
[63:48] B: I have a nose.
[63:49] A: I have ten fingers.
[63:51] B: I have ten fingers.
[63:52] A: I need two elbows. I have ten toes.
[63:55] B: I have ten toes.
[63:56] A: I'm not my toes.
[63:57] B: I'm not my toes.
[63:58] A: I'm not my nose.
[63:59] B: I'm not my nose.
[64:00] A: I'm not my fingers.
[64:01] B: I'm not my fingers.
[64:02] A: I'm not my elbows.
[64:03] B: I'm not my elbows.
[64:04] A: I have an ass.
[64:06] B: I have. I have an ass.
[64:07] A: I'm not my ass.
[64:08] B: I'm not my ass.
[64:09] A: It's mine.
[64:10] B: It's mine.
[64:10] A: But it isn't me.
[64:11] B: But it isn't me.
[64:12] A: They mess with my stuff.
[64:13] B: They mess with my stuff.
[64:15] A: Screwed up my thinking and feeling.
[64:16] B: Screwed up my thinking. And feeling.
[64:18] A: But they never touched who I really am.
[64:20] B: But they never touched who I really am.
[64:21] A: They never touched me.
[64:23] B: They never touched me.
[64:24] A: They mess with my stuff.
[64:25] B: They mess with my stuff.
[64:26] A: But they never got me.
[64:28] B: But they never got me.
[64:29] A: Cause who I am.
[64:30] B: That's who I am.
[64:31] A: Can only be touched.
[64:33] B: Can only be touched.
[64:34] A: With respect.
[64:35] B: With respect.
[64:36] A: That's right. And love. So they mess with my stuff. But they never got me.
[64:42] B: But they never got me.
[64:43] A: Good. Take a deep breath in. Exhale. Close your eyes. And that just filters and integrates inside more and more and more of your unconsciousness. Learning is occurring at the deepest levels. Integrating knowledge from here. Let that earlier you know she's getting out of the hospital. That that's over, finished, no longer exists. She made it through it. You're okay. You survived. They never touched who you really are. And there's no part of you right now that's the same as it was when any of that ever happened. That's right. Heck, neuroscience would tell us that if we came back today, a year from now and got together 99.999999, meaning almost all of the subatomic particles that are making you and I up wouldn't be here. That let that earlier you know that you're okay. Let her know about later on getting your ged, playing with her son, Seeing an opportunity to make life better for herself and those that she cares about. All of this is happening now, integrating in multiple ways throughout the entire day of your mind and body. And then once again, when you're ready, take a deep breath. And then exhale and open your eyes. Nice. There we go. And what are you noticing now?
[66:47] B: I'm a lot lighter.
[66:49] A: You are a lot lighter, aren't you? Yeah. And as you check, think about that moment, knowing what happened, having the police officers tell you, you answering certain questions. As you think about that now, what do you notice?
[67:04] B: There's no feelings attached to.
[67:06] A: Isn't that cool? Right? And what happened to the earlier you as she learned from you that it's over, she survived it. That you're okay. That they actually never touched who you really are. That that happened to your body never got you. And that there's no part of your body now that's the same, it's all been replaced nine times and millions and millions of times. Yeah. What happens is that earlier you learns it from. You feel stronger. You do, don't you? Right? Because people that you thought would be for you weren't being for you. Right? Whether it be mom's boyfriend or dad's wife, stepmom. Is that who she was? Lovely. Lot of affinity for her now. Right. Like, can you imagine like, you know, doing that to your kid? All right, here, go do this thing. No. Right. Doesn't even show up as a possibility, does it? Right, right. That tells you how off they are. Make sense that that's what comes to mind for somebody to do. So what do you notice inside of you right now? You do feel content. Huh? Isn't that cool? So think about, you know, it's a blackout period, isn't it, for, you know, you seeing, talking to. And as you know that it's this fly five time. What are you noticing now?
[69:02] B: That I can make it.
[69:03] A: You can, can't you? Right. Because what do we know about you? Uh huh. And you can make it through a lot harder shit than just missing talking to my family for a little bit. Like. Like if you think about like the other shit that you made it through, like this is really the moment. I just don't get to have a conversation with them for a little bit. Right. There are other moments where I'm locked in a fucking room that I can't get out or people are doing all sorts of awful stuff to my body. That. Right, right. Isn't that a good news thing? So I wonder what it would be like for you to be more okay in you. You just check in with that too. Just kind of be curious. I wonder what it would be like for me to be more okay in me and give yourself one of those big eyes and go, hmm, right. I wonder what it would be like for me to be fully okay in me. Hmm. And what do you notice? You are calm. Now open your mouth wide and relax the back of your tongue. It's like this. And when you do something like this, it's going to cause either a yawn or a deep breath in. But see, either way it's going to down regulate the nervous system. Because it's stimulating the vagal nerve, we want ways to down regulate the nervous system. Got it. So again, as we're organizing towards this future you, it's even been symbolized by the reflection of the light off the water. That other part of your brain is going to travel back and we'll bring another moment to your awareness to clear. Yeah. What's coming to mind now?
[71:09] B: Nothing really.
[71:11] A: Nothing really. Hmm. Isn't that interesting? I wonder what it would be like to get curious about that. Nothing. Nothing really's coming to mind. H. Right. Just do that for a second. Nothing really is coming to mind. Hmm. Right. And what are you noticing?
[71:39] B: Okay.
[71:40] A: What's it like to be realizing that nothing's coming to mind? You don't know, do you? Huh? But isn't one of the things that you had is that this does overthinking, what's happening with it now? Nothing's coming to mind. Maybe it's over, the overthinking, so it's done with it. What do you think?
[72:14] B: That would be awesome.
[72:15] A: Yeah. Well, is it on now? Oh, it isn't. And you weren't even paying attention that it's not on, but you're noticing that it isn't. Is it? Isn't that cool? Yeah. Right. And so that's a lot of stuff that happened. Stuff that happened to you. I'm wondering, curious, if there's other stuff that you did that now, looking back, you wish you hadn't or that still has strong emotions attached that we also want to get cleared so that you're free to be okay in you, free to be fully present, connecting to what is experiencing more joy, feeling good about the things that you're up to, feeling satisfied and having done them, feeling more content than ease. Right. So again, as we're organizing towards this, you, that other part of your brain is going to travel back, back, back, back, back, back and narrow. And brain, a moment. What comes to mind now?
[73:21] B: Me choosing drugs over my kids.
[73:23] A: Oh, that. Oh, good. Look at even how that emotion's there. I'm not sure that that's a true statement, but there's a moment that's coming to mind. You got one. Okay, so the first question is, would it be okay for you to feel okay even if what you did wasn't?
[73:44] B: I know.
[73:45] A: That's a really weird question, isn't it? I'm gonna say it again. Would it be okay, Yolanda, for you to feel okay even if what you did wasn't okay? Meaning you being okay right now doesn't excuse that, doesn't make what you did okay. However, you get to be okay, even though that wasn't. There's a saying by a Harvard social psychologist. Her name is Ellen Langer. And it is. People are always so concerned about making the right decisions, but it's not about making all the right decisions. It's about making the decisions right. Make sense? Constantly adjusting. So what's the moment that's coming to mind where you said the whole choosing drugs over my son? So you're about how long ago you're where, and what happened?
[74:49] B: Was that my friend's house?
[74:51] A: Right. So you're at your friend's house. Good. Was it daytime or nighttime?
[74:53] B: Daytime.
[74:54] A: Daytime. And this was about like how long ago?
[74:57] B: About two years ago.
[74:58] A: So two years ago. So he was like five, four, five, six. Six, yeah, five, five, right? Yeah. So. So he's like five. Is he with you when you're at your friend's house or he's somewhere else?
[75:07] B: No, he's at my grandma.
[75:08] A: So he's at grandma's house. Right. So you're at your friend's house. Right. Good. And then what happened next?
[75:13] B: I'm on phone and he asked me if he'll come, if I'll come home.
[75:17] A: Right. So he's like, can you come and get me from grandma's?
[75:19] B: Yeah.
[75:20] A: Right. Good job. Or were you living at grandma's?
[75:23] B: I was supposed to, but I stayed high so I never was home.
[75:28] A: Ah, good. So you were back, you were with that friend. Right. And so he had called and said, hey, can you come home? Right. And you probably said sure or something. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[75:39] B: I just stayed and got high.
[75:41] A: Well, then you got off the phone with him. Right. And then there was the drug. What was the drug? Meth. So then you smoked the meth. Right. And then that moment ended. And then what happened next?
[75:55] B: I continued to get high.
[75:56] A: Right. Until.
[75:59] B: Until eventually I went home.
[76:01] A: Until you stopped. And then you went home. Right. And that was days later.
[76:07] B: Sometimes you.
[76:08] A: Sometimes. Well then you eventually went home. Right. And then what happened next?
[76:11] B: I spent time with my son.
[76:13] A: Oh, you spent time with your son. Right. Cause you love him. Right. And then there was other times that you left and you went and did math and eventually then that all stopped. How'd it stop?
[76:24] B: I went to jail.
[76:25] A: Oh, you went to jail. Right? It stopped. That's right. Right, right. And then like, how long has it been now?
[76:39] B: A year and some odd days.
[76:43] A: Yeah, Isn't that cool? So it's a year and some odd days. So you really just passed a year. Isn't that cool? Good job. You wouldn't want to start to feel good about that.
[76:53] B: I've been in jail and in a program the whole time.
[76:57] A: Uh huh. Right. And.
[77:02] B: I haven't been around it.
[77:07] A: Probably a good idea to not ever be around it. Yeah, you know, I don't spend a lot of time around it either. I've never done it.
[77:13] B: That's good.
[77:17] A: Do you think somebody can be around it and not do it? It's like Oreos. There's only so long that you can go without having the Oreo if it's there Right. You haven't been around it. Good. Isn't that a good news thing? That you haven't been around it? Right. Some of it was like, you know, I'm in a program. But couldn't you have left? You could have, didn't you? Both of them. You can walk out of the assessment house, you can leave, you know, but you didn't. And that could. You wouldn't want to start to feel good about that. Maybe just a little. You don't know. You don't think it would be good to feel just a little good about that? That you've got over a year clean and clear from meth, even if some of the time was in jail and programs or all the time was in jail and programs, whatever.
[78:17] B: I don't think I want to leave.
[78:18] A: Because the only one that you actually couldn't leave.
[78:22] B: I have seven years over my head. So really, I can't really leave.
[78:26] A: Well, you could. You don't like the consequence. Do you follow me with that? So it's not that you can't, because you absolutely can. You could leave Crossroads, you could leave, but you don't want to have the consequence that comes along with it. Makes sense. So we got it that we're kind of pigeonholed in, like what I have options of doing because either I do these things where I don't, and then I got consequences to deal with if I don't, which those consequences don't look good to me. Seven years in prison. Yeah, that doesn't look good. That's not really where you want to spend your time, right? So isn't that cool? See, it's cool in that you got yourself set up in such a way to get away from the stuff in a way that really had it set up that it doesn't allow you have access to it. Because the issue isn't whether I can or I can't, it's that I don't, right? If somebody comes up to me and says, hey, do you want a cigarette? And I say to them, I don't smoke. Do they keep offering it to me? No, but if I. If they come up and they go, hey, you want a cigarette? And I go, no, I can't. What do they lend you? Well, come on, why not? Why can't you? That makes sense. If I say to myself, I can't have the cheesecake, what does that make me want to do? Sometimes? Yeah. But if I say to you, I don't eat cheesecake, does it make me feel like I'm withholding it from you. Right, right. But you got yourself set up in such a way that it allows you to have lots of time and space from it. So the more distance, the more clearly you can see it for what it was. Gaining more distance and becoming more. Okay, it looks less and less appealing. Follow me with that. Right. Because then we got something to, like, you know, go towards. Yeah. Because I would think that that would be something to start to feel good about. I mean, you might go, well, but it's the bare minimum. But still better than the alternative. You could be fugitive on the run, doing whatever you needed to do to get the funds to buy the math. Does that sound appealing? See, right. Yeah. So you might want to start to feel good about getting yourself into the position that you've gotten yourself space and time away to get more clear and present and free. Yeah. So the thing that's been feeling bad is that you had done that. Right. Because, like, you know, the first time, did you think that, like, it was going to be one of those things that was going to have you want to do it? Right. Because isn't that the problem with the substance? It's okay if the substance only shows up when I decide that I want to do it, which is, like, how it happens, like, a lot of times for people. The first time, well, I decided I wanted to do it, so I did it. Drinking, smoking, math, whatever. Right. But then after time, it stops being me that's deciding to do it. It's the thing that's wanting me to do it. And then it causes me to have all sorts of stuff to get me to do it and get the chase to get the stuff to get to do it and then do it. And then it's like, until the next time that it causes the thing to get me to want to do it. Right. Like, there's no freedom in that. You're becoming more free to be okay. And see, that's what was problematic. We go, oh, well, you know, if you truly loved your son, you would have never done meth. Right. But did doing meth have anything to do with your lack of love for your son? I mean, do you love him any less? Do you love him anymore now that you're not?
[82:40] B: No, I love him alive, whether I was on drugs or not.
[82:44] A: That's right. So your using had nothing to do with your love? Was he in a safe spot with somebody that cares for him? Oh, right. So you made sure that he was taken care of. Right. See, what hasn't been included in this? And I don't Know whether you've ever considered it, you could have been setting things up in such a way that he was in danger while you were using. But in this situation, was he. No, he was with somebody that cares for him, cares about him. Right. He was safe. Oh, right. You made sure your kid was safe when you were using. You wouldn't actually want to feel good about that. Right? I mean, what might be worse would be like, you know, getting him and selling him to, you know, some dude that wanted to do stuff with a little boy. That would be worse, don't you think? Got it. So you made sure he was in a safe location with a safe person. Right. That if you weren't home, he was still okay. Right. That's all out of your love for him. Right. And see, that hasn't been included when you've been thinking about it. But as we include it, what do you notice? What's happening to the feeling of guilt? It is going away. Yeah. Right. Because you took care of him. You made sure he was okay. Right. Even if you weren't, because, you know, when you were actively using meth, were you really okay? In moments I might have thought I was okay, but I was clearly not okay. Got it. Yeah. And as it sinks in, what are you noticing? That was a really good breath, by the way. I know you didn't consciously do it, but it was a nice, long, slow exhale. Right. What are you noticing in you now?
[85:11] B: That I need a lot of deep breaths.
[85:13] A: I don't know about that. Because things are getting lightened and lifted, aren't they? I mean, do you feel so heavy now? No. You feel a lot lighter, don't you? Right. Those burdens, the weights. Right. If we had a mom who was addicted to a substance and couldn't get herself off the substance, not because she didn't care about her kid, but she was hooked on the substance. That's what it's called. Like, the fish is not able to get it hooked. Right. I mean, it's just right. It needs something else to intervene with. It. Got it. But that was going on. Wouldn't the best thing. The best thing that she could do is make sure her kid was okay in. In a location that had somebody that was caring for him? Yes. Huh? Isn't that what you did?
[86:05] B: Yes.
[86:05] A: Right. And that a good news thing? Huh? So it had nothing to do with you choosing drugs over your kid. It had everything to do with getting hooked. Because, you know, I mean, the first time that you did meth, were you like, I can't Wait to get hooked? No, wasn't that. I can't wait for it to, like, I get on the phone call and I should be going back to my son because I think that that would be the better thing to do. But that's right here, so I don't. Right. Like you weren't hoping for that. You weren't even expecting any of that. Make sense. Right. But given that was going on, you handled it in the way that would have been best for somebody with that going on to have handled it for the people that they care about. Right. And that's what you want to start to feel good about. Right. And is it okay to start to feel okay about? Is. Isn't it cool? Yeah. So again, as we organize towards the you who's present and clear and free and at peace, much more content and comfortable, able to just sit with herself, have moments where this thing is just quieted down. Right. Again, that other part's going to travel back through moments of things that have happened, things you've done, things that have happened to you recent, long time ago yesterday, whatever it's going to. And then bring another moment to mind. And what's happening now? Hmm? You don't know? Well, I mean, as you went looking for it and then what'd you notice?
[88:07] B: Couldn't find anything.
[88:09] A: Oh, you couldn't find anything. Isn't that cool? Yeah. Isn't that a good news thing? Right. That's weird, though, isn't it?
[88:20] B: Yeah.
[88:20] A: For you to not, like, find anything. I mean, you know, go looking for it where it normally is, see if you can find any of the stuff that kind of makes you feel down and weighted and heavy and crappy and bad person. Bad Mom.
[88:43] B: My grandpa not being able to see me sober before he passed away.
[88:47] A: Oh, how long ago was that?
[88:50] B: A week and a half.
[88:53] A: Grandpa passed away a week and a half ago. Ah, okay. Have you felt him with you at all? Do you have any beliefs, religious stuff that provides comfort around death, Tying grief, loss. What's that?
[89:10] B: That I'll see him again one day.
[89:12] A: Okay. Like, he's not gone gone. You'll see him. Maybe not in the same way you see him now or did see him because he's not in his body, by the way. He was in his body either. His body stopped working. He didn't. Which is a weird thought to have, but just check it out, because I'm. I'm thinking it would be useful for you to realize that he knows, doesn't. That you're clean and sober. He does know that doesn't he? Right? Whether he sees you, he knows it, right? And really proud of you, don't you think? I mean, he's like, amazed at his granddaughter and how strong and courageous and brave she is because she's had like, you know, a lot of fucked up shit that's happened to her. And she's got a fucking gun on her hand fast, right? So he gets it. There's been a lot of fucked up shit that's happened to her, right? And knowing that you're okay and on your way to being better. But we have to understand a couple things about that grief and loss. Because it's the shock of finding out of the moment that kind of blocks access to who they are for me. So I'll give you an example. Like if we took a glass of ice, right, and we put it out on the patio and an hour goes by and we come back and there's a little kid with us. And the little kid looks and says, oh my goodness, somebody stole the ice and replaced it with water. We would laugh inside and then educate the child that nobody stole the ice. That what happened with the ice is that because it was outside the ice and it was warm, the ice melted. It went from the solid state into the liquid state. But the molecule that is making up the water now is the same as when it made up the ice identically. How we're experiencing it is totally changed. And the kid looks at us and he's like, okay, I understand. We then leave that glass of water now out on the patio and a week goes by and the kid comes back and looks and goes, oh, my goodness, somebody drank it. They stole it. The water's gone. No, the water didn't go. They didn't drink it. It evaporated. He goes, what's that? I go, well, it went from liquid state to gas state. The molecule of H2O, totally identically the same. Our way that we experience it is completely different. And he goes, but if I don't see it, how can I feel it? Can't touch it. We go, well, sure, you can feel it because you're in Florida and it's all around you. And then we put him in the desert of Arizona and we go, you don't feel any of it here, do you? And we bring him back to Florida and we show him the rain cloud and we capture the water we put in the freezer. He discovers it's all the same thing. So what if when people's bodies stop working, it's not that they stop working. It's that their bodies stop working, and because they're no longer in need of it, they exit it. We don't pick them up in the same way we did, but it doesn't mean that they're not here. There are many things that our five senses are limited in what we're able to pick up. Right? The way that we see, hear, taste, touch, and smell is limited. We know that dogs have a much better sniffer than we do. Make sense that they're being taught how to sniff out cancers in humans. Isn't that crazy? We know we can blow the whistle and we don't hear any of the sound. But the dog is going, is it not making a noise or is the noise outside of the range in which we can hear? Right. I can go to the car and I can turn the radio on and music starts playing. But it wasn't that the music started as soon as I turned on the car. The radio waves are there. They're here. Do you feel them? Because I don't got it. So there's a lot of stuff that are 3D lens that we live in the world through, we don't pick up. So the idea is when the person's body stops working, it's not that they stop, it's that their body stops because they're no longer in need of it. They exit it. We don't pick them up in the same way we did, but it doesn't mean that they're not here. Just like your love for Grandpa is as strong now as it's always ever been, he fully feels it. His love for you is as strong as it's always ever been. The difference is that you haven't been feeling it. Not because it's not here, but because the shock of having known him in his body now knowing that he's no longer in it is blocking access. Make sense? So the thing that we want to be understanding a little bit is what do we get from the people that matter to us? Right? What do we really gain? Is it the stuff that they give us? The trinkets, the things? Or is it the experiences? Right. And once you've acquired the experience, can you lose it? I went to Disney for the first time when I was 11. Can anybody take it away? God, if I. You could lose access to it, but you can't actually lose it. Can you lose something that you don't yet have? Can you lose it if you've never acquired it? Right. So you can't lose what you have acquired, and you can't lose what you don't yet have. So then where's the loss? What if when people's bodies stop, they don't. Their body does, they exit it. We just don't pick them up in the same way we did. I remember a woman telling me that her parents are in her closet. And I'm like, is this a confession? This is weird, right? She goes, no, no, not my parents. What remains. The remains of my parents are in the closet. No, the remains. I go, that's not even what remains of your parents. That's what remains of your parents body. What remains of your parents is in the experiences you acquired in being with them. That's who they are for you. Just like grandpa. That's who he is for you. Makes sense. And the problem is that you just haven't been feeling it. But he's closer because he's here. He hasn't ever left here. And Einstein is a really smart dude. The only reason why I know that is because everybody after him who's very smart is called an Einstein. So he had to be brilliant, right? He said two things that are really important. Energy plus matter equals this physical, touchable, tangible existence. And then what became the second law of three? Thermal dynamics. Energy cannot be destroyed, it transforms. So when people's bodies stop, it's not that they stop, their body stops. Who we are is energy plus matter. It equals the existence. But I'll show you something about energy and matter. See, this is a ping pong ball. And everybody's played ping pong pretty much at least once. But this one doesn't bounce because it's got the most metal pieces. But when I touch, makes a noise, which is kind of interesting, that makes a weird noise. But if you were to take a finger and touch. Notice how it doesn't do it? But if you were to take your other finger and touch. That'll get spooky. Stay spooky. Right. Isn't that interesting? And you know how it works? Yes.
[96:34] B: Like a light bulb.
[96:35] A: Like a light bulb, exactly. That when the energy is connected, it's able to flow. So when I'm connected, the energy flows. When we're separated, the energy doesn't. When we got connected, the energy flows. Who we are is energy plus matter. So how'd you find out about Grandpa? You're where? When you found out?
[96:55] B: In a counselor's office.
[96:57] A: So you're in the counselor's office. Office. Good. Did they call you into the office? You're already in the counselor's office. So you were sitting right? They Were behind a desk. Yes. And you're like, in the chair. Right. And then what happened?
[97:12] B: The tech came and told the counselor that I needed to call my mom. It's an emergency.
[97:18] A: Right. So the tech says, you gotta call mom. It's an emergency.
[97:21] B: So I call my mom.
[97:22] A: So you call your mom.
[97:23] B: She's crying. Crying.
[97:23] A: She's crying. Right. You're. What's going on, Mom? What's happening? Right.
[97:26] B: She asked to speak with my counselor.
[97:28] A: Right. Good. So she said, I need to talk to your counselor. You're like, what the.
[97:32] B: I kind of knew what was going on right.
[97:35] A: At that point, but it was weird that she needs out. You can't tell me. You got to tell him. Yeah.
[97:39] B: So he said that. There's no easy way to put it. Your grandpa.
[97:44] A: So mom told him that and then got off the phone?
[97:47] B: No, she was still.
[97:48] A: She was still on the phone. So he's like, okay, no easy way to tell you. Grandpa died. Then what happened next? Literally just Right. Just like that. Right. Good, Good. Grandma died. Right. Good. Then what happened next?
[97:58] B: I started crying.
[97:59] A: Right, Good. Right. And then what happened next?
[98:00] B: Talked to my mom. She checked on me.
[98:03] A: Right. And then you got off the phone to mom, and then that time was over. Right. And then later on, you did something more enjoyable than that call, like eat something at the assessment house.
[98:14] B: Yes.
[98:15] A: Right. That was more enjoyable than that call. Putting your sandals on today. More enjoyable than not call. Right. We got having a meal at the assessment house. Right. Then you had gone back to where you were, and then you had left the counselor's room. And then you got off the phone with mom, and then the phone was passed back to you. And then he said, there's no easy way to tell your grandpa's dad. And then she was talking to him, and then she's like, I need to talk to him. And then she's crying. And then you called, and then the tech came in and told you to call, and then you were meeting with the counselor, and then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing. And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward, what do you notice?
[98:47] B: It doesn't hit as hard.
[98:49] A: Right, Right. You can remember her telling you that. You can remember putting your jeans on. Stop putting in your jeans. Stop her from telling you that. Well, then stop that from happening, though. It's not happening.
[98:59] B: It's not happening.
[99:00] A: Where is it? Say it no longer exists. Now, we want to let the earlier you know that who grandpa is for you is more than he was and is by body that who he is for you is still ongoing. Because when you think about Grandpa and shared interest, things you do with grandpa that you love, that Grandpa loves, what's the thing that you do that you love that Grandpa loves?
[99:19] B: Fishing.
[99:20] A: Fishing, Right. Grandpa's a fisherman. A fisherman. Yeah. Right. Good. Right. You can think about times as you're thinking about times of remembering Grandpa fishing. Imagine being up above. So you're up above. You're seeing you and him. Would you be in a boat or off a dock or just in a pond or on the side of the river? So you're on the side of the river, Right, with Grandpa and you've got your own rod. Yeah. Right. So from up above, see you and Grandpa. Down below, see the image of you and grandpa together. So that you see you and him in a picture together. Like as you're fishing. Right. As you're seeing it now, what are you noticing?
[100:08] B: That we're happy.
[100:10] A: You are. Right. And how's your body feeling? Because you wouldn't want to get more connected to Grandpa. I mean, you know, you do come through him, right? I mean, he's like a bio grandpa. So you got some of his DNA in you. Did you know that? Yeah. Right. And he also passed down his love for fishing. That's right. See, I wonder what it's going to be like the next time you've got a rod and reel in your hand and you're fishing to be feeling him with you. Right. Because he's with you. See, he hasn't left. Right. And see that earlier you didn't know it. She thought he was his body. That when his body started to you is gone. But who he is for you isn't gone. Can't you still hear him? Right. When you think about fishing, notice how as you're thinking about it, it's not showing up so sad. See, when grief gets frozen, what it does is it blocks access to joyful moments or clouds them. So that even when I go to remember a time that was fun, it's clouded by that they're not here anymore. Coming it. So then I feel bad about it. I don't even get to feel good in the memory. But notice how you were actually happy as you're. Right, Right. Because your brain is updating. That makes sense. Things are getting updated so that you're lightening up and becoming more okay in you. That's right. And that's what we want, is you to be more okay in you. Free, lighter, clear, able to just sit with yourself. Because isn't that part of what Fishing is all about. Yeah, right. There's a lot of time in fishing where you're just kind of sitting with yourself. That's right. And what would it be like to be really enjoying the moments of sitting with yourself, you know, as you're fishing? Yeah, right. Right. So see the. You joyfully fishing, knowing that he's with you. That's right. Because he is, isn't he? That's right. And as you're realizing it now, take a deep breath in and a long exhale. One more deep breath in. Exhale and close your eyes. Eyes are closed. They rest. As they rest, you also rest aware of your breath sounds, my voice, background sounds, how it feels to be seated in the way you are noticing all of this at the same time. Your unconscious is responding and organizing towards the future. You becoming even that much more okay in you where lightning up present, taking the right steps and doing the right actions, focusing on the smallest next step. That's towards how you want to be light and content free. That's right. To be able to sit with yourself. That's right. That's right. Notice what it's like right now, sitting with yourself. Right. And then when you're ready, taking your time, finding your way back. Big breath in and open your eyes. There we go. So just kind of check, kind of from the top, neck, chest, abdomen, stomach, all, all the way down, all the way back up. Check inside of you. Yolanda, what are you noticing?
[104:52] B: I'm okay.
[104:53] A: You're okay. What's it like to say that out loud?
[105:00] B: Nice.
[105:01] A: It is nice. When was the last time that you actually felt okay?
[105:05] B: I don't remember.
[105:07] A: Ah, right. So you're feeling okay now, hmm? Isn't that cool? Yeah. What do you notice happening to that weight?
[105:21] B: Feel lifted?
[105:22] A: Oh, it has. Well, then try to feel depressed. You know, think about whatever you need to think about to try to feel depressed now. Oh, you're not getting it, huh? What are some of the things that you normally find yourself waking up thinking about or dreams that you have?
[105:43] B: I don't really dream.
[105:44] A: Oh, you don't? That you remember. Right. But you wake up. Right? And some of that is like a restlessness, tossing and turning. Some of it is, I gotta go to bed. Some of it's like a. The clock struck 12. The clock struck one. The clock struck three. Right. So maybe we just want to update your unconscious, that we don't need to know time by the hour anymore. Right. That we could just get lost in the moment of sleep. And see, we know that when we sleep all there is for us to ever do is to lay down and rest. Right. Resting is an option that happens when I lay down and my body weight is equally distributed. I can close my eyes, I just rest, breathe in a little bit slower, exhale a little bit longer. Resting. Because you know what happens when people are laying on the couch on a Sunday afternoon watching something mindless on TV that they don't really care about. They're just laying there resting. You know what happens right in the middle of that? A lot?
[107:04] B: They fall asleep.
[107:05] A: They do, don't they? And they didn't put any effort into it at all. Isn't that cool? It just happened when they were resting. So I wonder what it would be like at night for you to simply rest. Right. Without trying, putting any effort into falling asleep, just laying there resting. Yeah. And again, as all of this is happening, what do you notice? You do feel okay. Yeah. And what's even better than feeling okay? Is it being okay to feel okay? Right. Notice how there's not conflict? Yeah. But I was using meth instead of seeing my kid. Right. Or somehow me being wished way to Jacksonville was my fault. I should have known that when I got in the truck, we were driving to fucking Jacksonville. What do you notice?
[108:22] B: I'm okay.
[108:23] A: You are. Think about that stuff that happened to your body. Think about the police going, oh, yeah, no, that. We've had lots of semen.
[108:31] B: I'm not that person anymore.
[108:33] A: That's right. And there's not a part of you that's the same. It's all been replaced. They didn't touch you. You weren't even there when all that stuff was happening to your body. Right. Right before meth. What was the other Drugs? Weed. Weed. Just weed. And Matt like to smoke things. Things. How does it move from. From weed to meth. Where. Where was that space?
[109:12] B: All the stuff that happened? I didn't want to sleep anymore.
[109:15] A: So all the stuff that happened, like what we talked about or other stuff?
[109:20] B: The stuff we talked about.
[109:22] A: Oh. Cuz all that stuff happened. Okay. And so because all that stuff happened, you wanted to stop sleeping? Yes. Because when you were sleeping it would be uncomfortable.
[109:34] B: Yes.
[109:34] A: Oh. What was uncomfortable about sleeping then?
[109:38] B: Nightmares.
[109:39] A: Oh, but you don't have those anymore.
[109:42] B: I don't have any dreams anymore.
[109:44] A: You don't? Are you on medication? No. But you're not having any dreams anymore. Maybe you're not having any more nightmares.
[109:55] B: Nightmares. Dreams.
[109:57] A: You're not having any more nightmares. It might be time to start having dreams. Dreams of like, you know, a different Better life for you and your kid. I mean, those are dreams it would be okay to start having, don't you think? I mean, isn't that what you've already started? Well, I mean, you. You went from using, right, to getting arrested, to going to jail, to going to a diversionary program, to realizing that isn't the best diversionary program for me, to requesting a different program, to going to a new program. And then while at this program, kind of determining what. What is the next best place for me to go, whether it be with Sayla, freedom, or hello. All of that is out of, like, having life be different than it was. Right. Isn't that a good news thing? Yeah. So aren't you already dreaming of a different life than the one you had?
[111:07] B: Yes.
[111:07] A: Yeah. While you were using meth, was there anything that you had to do with your body in order to get it? Oh, okay. That all happened when you were younger, so you didn't have to do any other stuff with your body after that. Isn't that a good news thing? Oh, you mean you got all of that to stop happening even though you were doing meth? Yes. Yeah. That's pretty miraculous, do you know that? I mean, that's pretty amazing, don't you think, that it didn't turn into, like, some dude that, like, then owned me and did me out to. As I got older, all that stuff stopped. Huh. I think that's pretty remarkable. You probably don't, because, like, you lived it, so it doesn't feel like it's that remarkable. Right. Plus, I don't want to, like, you know, get a big head. But see, here's the cool part, Yolanda. I don't think you could ever get a big head.
[112:12] B: I think his stay is the same size, right?
[112:15] A: It does. Yeah. And you're becoming more okay in you. You're beginning to lighten up. So when we think back towards that earlier, you. Is there any lingering, like, guilt or regret or remorse or shame or. Isn't that cool? Right. Right. Do other family members know of what happened when you were a kid? Teenager? They do now. Are those people who did that still around or are they. No. Okay. So that's stepmom gone, the mom's boyfriend, and dude, David, gone. So we don't have to interact with them anymore. Right. That's a good news thing, too, right? It really is. Yeah. Okay. And then where's the family again?
[113:05] B: Hardy.
[113:06] A: Oh, they're in Hardy. That's right. That is, like, up towards that way. Does it go up the. Is Hardy towards The Panhandle. Ish. Like going up that way, or is it middle stage?
[113:16] B: It's in the middle.
[113:17] A: Middle lake above Lake Claremont. You know where Claremont is?
[113:21] B: It's here in Lakeland.
[113:25] A: Oh, that middle Hardy is Lakeland. Okay, Where's Polk? Polk is up higher than that.
[113:31] B: Then Polk is Lakeland.
[113:35] A: Polk is Lakeland.
[113:36] B: Yeah.
[113:36] A: Hardy is in the middle.
[113:37] B: Hardy's right beside Polk.
[113:38] A: Oh, all right.
[113:40] B: Is Charlotte. Do you know where Charlotte is? Yeah, Charlotte County.
[113:46] A: Yeah.
[113:47] B: DeSoto County. Hardy County. Polk County.
[113:50] A: Oh, goes that way across. Okay. And then Orlando's in Orange County. Is that what it is? Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah. So what do you notice for you?
[114:01] B: That I'm okay.
[114:02] A: You are okay. Did you think that was gonna happen? What happens when the earlier you gets that they never touched you, that who you are never got touched by them, they just messed with your stuff? Yeah. Isn't that cool? Yeah. So any other stuff that kind of starts popping coming to mind, any other stuff that we wanted to have our time together get accomplished for you today? You are okay. Oh, so we did it. So do we get to have like, you know, Happy Monday. Good job. Awesome. Any questions for me? No questions. None at all. Are you sure?
[115:04] B: Will the fillings come back?
[115:06] A: Try to get them. See if you can.
[115:09] B: I can't right now. But will they come back in the future?
[115:14] A: Well, try to get them. Think about whatever you need to think about that you used to think about and try to feel them.
[115:20] B: I can't.
[115:21] A: Oh, that's weird. So normally you would have avoid thinking about it because whenever you did, it felt bad. Now we're saying on purpose. Try to get the feeling and you can not there. So when your brain realizes as a kid that Santa Clause is make believe, can you go back to believing in them? No. Right. Once your brain gets that it's data, that it's information about something that's happened, that's over. Can it ever go back to thinking it's happening? No. Right. You might have moments where you might feel some heaviness or weight or some anxiousness or some irritation. Because in life there are going to be things that go on that might produce those responses. Got it. What you're going to be noticing though, is that the intensity, the frequency, the duration are all much less make sense. So even if it does go off, it's not going to go as high, it's not going to last as long, it's not going to happen as frequent. Isn't that cool? Right. And isn't your boy better off without you feeling bad. Right, Right. Because he gets a mom who's on her way to becoming better. Mm. Isn't that a good news thing?
[116:55] B: Yes.
[116:56] A: For you and him. Cool. You did great.
[117:01] B: Thanks.
[117:02] A: You're welcome. It was lots of fun. Any other questions? Okay, so you also have a powerful tool you can use at any time, which is that part where you lower your jaw a little and you rest your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower. Deeper. So even at night, if you did that part where you just noticed, your breathing become a little bit slower and deeper. Right. That's gonna. Again, down regulate the nervous system. If you open your mouth wide and relax the back of your tongue, you'll either take. That's right. A deep breath or near a yawn. Both. Down regulate the nervous system so that you become more settled. Got it. Those are two tools that you can use. Yeah. And then, you know, we can get back together again. You get to decide what you're gonna do. Yeah. Cool. All right, well, if there's nothing else left for you for today, I think we're in a good spot to stop. Yeah?
[118:12] B: Yes.
[118:13] A: Okay, cool. Come with me. We will head out here.
