[00:00] A: Today is the 20th of May, Yolanda. We're making an audio recording of what we're doing. And given what we do is useful, valuable and transformative, the recording might be made available in teaching and training other professionals. I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[00:14] B: Yes.
[00:14] A: Cool. All right, so give me an update because it's been a while. I know that we got first together during the time that you were at the First Step program, then you would transition. We did our treatment session. Right. And now it's been a good long chunk of time since we've gotten together. So I'm really curious in terms of what you've noticed for yourself that's like, new and different. And even when you think about the stuff that we talked about and cleared, when you think about those moments and you might not have, but if you do, what do you notice that's different?
[00:45] B: I don't mind talking about it as much. There's no feelings really attached. Like, I know I've been through it and it's part of my story, but it no longer bothers me.
[01:01] A: Yeah. Isn't that cool? Even the thing about having to go to Jacksonville with that guy?
[01:05] B: Yeah.
[01:06] A: Yeah. Cool. That's a really good news thing. What else have you noticed? Like, how has stuff been with sleep interactions? Because you've had lots of transition to get to where you are now.
[01:22] B: I know when I don't want to remember something, I say it backwards.
[01:28] A: That's great.
[01:31] B: And it works.
[01:32] A: Isn't that cool?
[01:34] B: Yes.
[01:35] A: Yeah. Yeah. All you do is just take it in reverse.
[01:38] B: Right?
[01:38] A: Right. And the brain goes, oh, then it can't be happening. Right. Because the error with any troubling moment that I can remember, if it's still troubling, is that the brain doesn't know it ended. So if it goes backwards, it can't still be happening. Yeah. Cool. Good job. That's great. What else have you noticed for you?
[02:01] B: So I'm terrified of bridges.
[02:03] A: Okay. You just learned that or you've known that for a while?
[02:08] B: I've known that. But, like, where I'm from, there's no bridges.
[02:14] A: Oh.
[02:15] B: So I haven't, like, had to go over water on a bridge until recently.
[02:21] A: You want to go across water on the bridge.
[02:26] B: Right.
[02:27] A: Just across, not over. Nobody wants to go over the bridge. They do want to go across the bridge.
[02:36] B: Right. But I don't want to fall through.
[02:38] A: The bridge and drown, because that's what's going to happen, because that happens all the time. I mean, most of the cars that drive across Bridges actually fall into the water and people drown.
[02:46] B: Yes, yes.
[02:47] A: It's realistic.
[02:49] B: Right, right.
[02:50] A: Okay, so that's way heightened for you. You'd like to get it so that you have more ease in doing that.
[02:54] B: Yeah, that'd be cool.
[02:56] A: Okay, we can do that.
[02:59] B: Terrified of bridges. Like I can't even. Okay.
[03:02] A: Like even you just thinking about it right now, you have some of the discomfort.
[03:05] B: Yes.
[03:06] A: Yeah. Yeah. So if that wasn't going on and you didn't have any of that discomfort, like how would you be.
[03:13] B: I'd be okay. Like I could ride in the vehicle.
[03:16] A: What would it be like for you to feel okay as you're riding across the bridge?
[03:21] B: I feel like other people in the vehicle aren't judging me for being afraid of a bridge.
[03:26] A: Uh huh. Well, even if they were, they are catching you.
[03:32] B: Yes.
[03:33] A: Oh, they think it's weird or you shouldn't be.
[03:34] B: Yes.
[03:35] A: So we should definitely be concerned with what others think of us. No, no, we shouldn't, should we? We should like actually not care.
[03:43] B: Right.
[03:43] A: Because if I'm not, I'm not learning about me when I get what others are thinking.
[03:48] B: Right.
[03:49] A: I'm learning about what they might be thinking about something I'm doing or how I'm feeling.
[03:54] B: Right. It's none of my business.
[03:56] A: No, not none of your business. It's not about you.
[03:59] B: Right.
[04:00] A: Do you get the difference? None of my business is a whole different thing. It's not about you. You're learning about their thoughts about some way that you've been feeling. That's just a way that you've been feeling that's not even you. We're not learning about you, we're learning about them. That's what we want. More installed too. Right. Because not just. I mean, I'm thinking that, you know the part of getting it so that you have much more ease as you go across the bridge. So like it's like a non thing to you isn't about them not judging you. I think it's about you being more comfortable in you. Maybe like you being more okay in you.
[04:41] B: Yeah.
[04:41] A: Yeah. So we're not so concerned about what others are thinking. Yeah. Okay, cool. What else?
[04:50] B: But I don't care how they think.
[04:52] A: You do sometimes think that they're judging you.
[04:55] B: Right. Either way, if they judge me or not, I'm still terrified of this bridge.
[04:58] A: Understood. Right. So you said earlier when I said like, so if it's no longer causing any of that discomfort.
[05:05] B: Yes.
[05:05] A: Right. And you're absolutely okay. So like it's like a non thing okay.
[05:09] B: Yeah.
[05:09] A: How would you be? And you'd be like, well, one of the things is that, you know, they wouldn't be worrying. They wouldn't be judging me. No, that has nothing to do with you being okay about going over a bridge.
[05:20] B: True.
[05:22] A: Right. We want you to feel, like, light, comfortable. Right. Like it's a non thing. Make sense?
[05:31] B: Yes.
[05:32] A: Like, oh, no, I just drove by a sign on the side of the road. Ah, right. Like, it'd be like that. Like, you see the sign, you go right by the sign. Does that make sense?
[05:44] B: Yes.
[05:44] A: Similar kind of thing. Okay, cool. We can do that. What else do we want our time to do?
[05:53] B: How to deal with other people's attitudes, maybe.
[05:57] A: Okay, so say more. What would be useful for me to know. To understand what you mean when you say how to deal with other people's attitudes.
[06:06] B: So you know how Salah is. So I, like, it's. Can't really get into any conflict, so you can. Not without getting in trouble. And I don't want to get in trouble. I don't like getting in trouble. So when you're in trouble, you gotta work harder to learn something that you already kind of know. But you didn't put it in perspective that time.
[06:36] A: You didn't put it in practice.
[06:37] B: Yeah. So. So when a girl asked me to do something and then I. I'm the only. She asked the whole living room to do something and I'm the only person that got up to help her. And she says, God forbid anybody help me. What you mean I just got up to help you? And then she was like, selling out. Empty.
[07:07] A: What does that mean, selling out?
[07:10] B: Just trash talking.
[07:12] A: Oh, that's another way. Okay.
[07:14] B: Yeah. And it just.
[07:19] A: So you got a little bit offended.
[07:22] B: Yeah.
[07:23] A: Right.
[07:23] B: That, like, you don't have to be rude to me.
[07:26] A: I got up to help you and you blanketed us. All.
[07:30] B: Right.
[07:31] A: Yeah. So feelings got hurt a little bit. Felt a little disrespected.
[07:37] B: I got mad because I felt like she was disrespecting me when I was the only person that got up to help her.
[07:42] A: Yeah. Yeah. So was she?
[07:47] B: Yes.
[07:48] A: Disrespecting you?
[07:50] B: All of us, including me.
[07:54] A: She was. Bitch.
[07:56] B: Yeah.
[07:57] A: Saying like, bullshit. Nobody's gonna help me with this.
[07:59] B: Yes.
[08:01] A: Except you were up to help. Right, Right. But she was saying that to everybody. It's bullshit that nobody's helping me.
[08:08] B: Right. And she was acting like I wasn't helping her because every time I would go to grab something, she would grab it from me, so I just walked away.
[08:19] A: Right. Because she was already upset that nobody else got up.
[08:24] B: Right. But she made the whole mess by herself.
[08:27] A: She did.
[08:27] B: Yes.
[08:28] A: But you got tangled in it.
[08:30] B: Yes.
[08:31] A: You'd like to get it so that you're not so getting so tangled.
[08:35] B: Right. I could have.
[08:36] A: In other people's stuff.
[08:39] B: Right. But she was gonna set the house on fire because she left pizza in the oven and she didn't know how to get it out.
[08:45] A: Mm.
[08:46] B: And then when I started to get it out, she snatched it from me and I could have got burnt. I don't know how to cook, so I would have got burnt.
[08:55] A: You didn't.
[08:56] B: I didn't.
[08:57] A: No. But you didn't get burnt.
[08:58] B: I could have.
[09:00] A: But you did. Doesn't make it okay.
[09:04] B: No.
[09:05] A: Better that you didn't.
[09:07] B: Right.
[09:07] A: Right.
[09:08] B: Still not. Okay.
[09:09] A: Still not okay. You're gonna. I don't.
[09:14] B: Is it not disrespectful to snatch something out of someone's hands?
[09:18] A: So disrespectful is a meaning. So if I said to you, my best friend betrayed me.
[09:35] B: Okay.
[09:36] A: Do you know what? My best friend did.
[09:40] B: Something that you didn't believe.
[09:43] A: You have no idea what he did, do you?
[09:45] B: No.
[09:46] A: Cause I told you a meaning.
[09:48] B: Okay.
[09:48] A: I didn't tell you what he actually did.
[09:50] B: Okay.
[09:51] A: Right. I told you a meaning.
[09:55] B: So, like a filling.
[09:57] A: Yeah. My mom abandoned me. Do you know what actually happened? Right. Oh, she left me at the department store by accident. Right. And then came back and got. Right. But, like, you can hear somebody say they abandoned me. You don't know what they actually. What actually happened. Because, like, abandoned, disrespected. They're all, like, meaning heavy words. Right. And notice that her acting like that and doing that touched certain buttons in you that had you feel a certain way. Yeah. Right? Yes, I see.
[10:44] B: Like, really mad.
[10:45] A: Yeah. Right. And what we cannot prevent in life is people like that pressing these kinds of buttons. Follow me with that. Like, we can't get the world out there to not press the buttons on you that did that to you. So we can't do that. But do you know what we can do? Unplug the buttons so that even when that presses them, it doesn't cause that in you.
[11:14] B: Okay.
[11:15] A: Does that make sense?
[11:16] B: Yes.
[11:17] A: Right. So that you're, again, more distanced. You're more clear. You're reading that situation accurately as being about her and whatever the fuck's going on with her, not about me. Make sense. Right. It wouldn't have mattered in the situation. You some of the one other girl getting up and not you going to Help. She would have been all bitchy like that. Whether it was you or somebody else getting up to help, she wouldn't have been happy.
[11:51] B: She's never happy with anything. She's always bitching.
[11:54] A: Yeah. So we want to be experiencing her bitching as being about her. And it not hit me so personally, so I'm offended by it because I'm feeling like, you know, dissed or disrespected. You don't get to talk to me like that. Right. Because that's what gets riled up. That makes sense. And sometimes it's fine to be confrontational with that. But you already said I don't actually. Confrontational in the setting that I'm in isn't going to be the best for me based on what I want and what my goals are out of programming. And that make sense?
[12:37] B: Yes.
[12:38] A: Right. Gandhi realized that, you know, he wasn't going to be able to fight them. So he was non passive resistant. And even when they smacked him, he didn't come back and try to get him. He just. Not that I'm thinking that you need to be Gandhi. Okay. But you get that in this situation, me being offended by that stuff, me having it hit personal work, like it makes me like, isn't helpful for how I want to be here.
[13:13] B: I don't think no matter what we do, if a person hits me, I'm.
[13:17] A: Hit's a whole different story. Yes, hit is a different story. They got physical and invaded somebody being bitchy and you getting your feelings hurt. Right, right. And ruffling your feathers. That's the part that we want to get changed. That makes sense. Right. It's just getting it so that that's lighter for you. So that you're reading it as being about them, but it's not finding it pressing those buttons in you. Okay, so we got Bridges of Madison County. We've got Madison County. Yeah. That's a movie that they came out. They had a lot of bridges in Madison County. You wouldn't want to put that right now.
[14:06] B: I lived in Madison County.
[14:08] A: Did you?
[14:09] B: Yeah.
[14:09] A: Madison county in Georgia.
[14:11] B: No, Florida.
[14:12] A: Florida.
[14:14] B: I was like, there's no bridges in Madison.
[14:17] A: Not that Madison.
[14:18] B: Right.
[14:18] A: But the other Madison.
[14:19] B: Don't go to Georgia.
[14:20] A: Madison or go to Georgia and you know, have fun riding across the bridges.
[14:24] B: No, no.
[14:25] A: Well, not right now, but when we're done. So that it's actually enjoyable. Right. It's kind of like the kid who like didn't want to get on the amusement park ride because they were scared and it caused them a Lot of anxiety. And they thought about it and worried about it. They didn't want to do it, and they were scared. And then they finally go on it, and they have a really good time.
[14:44] B: I love roller coasters.
[14:46] A: Yes. Now, there might have been a time that you didn't because you weren't sure because it was kind of like, new, different. What we want is we want you to have the same comfort. Right. And ease inside when you go across the bridge. Right. We'll get there. So we got bridges. We got this whole thing turning down the reactivity in me based on what the other residents say or do, because what I've recognized is that my reactivity is more than I want it to be in response to them being pitchy. Cool. Okay. What else?
[15:23] B: That's it.
[15:25] A: That's it. We're done. No other things?
[15:30] B: I'm pretty sure we took all care of it all last time.
[15:37] A: Okay. So then I think then what we want to be doing is getting it so that you have more ease both in dealing with the residents and in going across bridges so that you've got more comfort in you. Yeah. Cool. So then all you want to do is you want to put both feet on the floor, you want to slightly lower your jaw, rest your tongue at the bottom of your mouth, begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper, and then out a little bit longer so that you'll notice you can intentionally cause your breath. Right. And when you do, you make it happen a little bit different than normal. Right. As you're aware of your breath, it also alters your state of consciousness because you consciously become aware of a process that requires no conscious effort. And when you're consciously aware of a process that requires no conscious effort, it's always altering your state of consciousness. It's beginning to fuel the trance formation inside so that your body begins to settle and quiet and calm. Right. Notice that you can see my nose and my fingers. As my fingers move out with the sides of your eyes, you pick up the wiggling. You're noticing more space. And as you notice more space inside. Yolanda, Check. How's your body beginning to feel now? Relaxed it is. And as your body's feeling relaxed, just close your eyes and then imagine floating up and out of your body beyond the ceiling and the roof, rising way up above it all in the sky, having a bird's eye view to see everything underneath and below, above and over it all. Soaring, flying, gliding, and moving all around in different ways in different directions. That's right. Free. When you're ready. Bring your awareness back down and into your body to re associate. Take a nice big deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. Good. Again, check in with your body. What are you noticing now? It is relaxed. And how much more relaxed do you want to feel as you go across the bridge? Yeah, how much more relaxed do you want to feel as you go across the bridge?
[18:38] B: I don't know. This relaxed, I guess.
[18:40] A: Oh, you want to feel this relaxed? That's right. And wouldn't that be nice if you were feeling this relaxed as you go across the bridge? That's right. Right. So then we're organizing towards the you who's, you know, just like this relaxed going across the bridge. Right. Then one more time, take a deep breath in. A long exhale and close your eyes. Eyes close. They rest. As they rest, you rest aware of your breath. My voice. Background sounds. Inside, outside the room. The space between and beyond. Behind and under. To your left, to your right. All the way up above. That's right. And let's think of a you up above, floating above as we see a you riding in one of the sailor vehicles. So you're the you up above, like the bird able to see the you down below. Maybe in the van or a car. Right. Driving to wherever you're going, feeling clear, maybe listening to the music, maybe talking, realizing, oh, my, we just went across that bridge, huh? That was pretty cool, right? That's right. Notice what you're noticing from up above. Listening to music, maybe singing along, chit chatting, maybe just closing eyes, resting, and then realizing, wow, we're already in St. Pete, huh? Yeah. See, I wonder what it would be like to know, wow. Feeling relaxed, lighter. Bring your awareness back and integrate inside of you all the way back to now. Take a deep breath in. And then big exhale. One more deep breath in. And then exhale and open your eyes. There and again. Checking in your body. How's your body feeling now? Right now it's nervous. Yeah. Where do you feel it in your body?
[21:42] B: My chest.
[21:42] A: You feel it in your chest. And what is it that you're seeing as you're feeling the nervousness in your chest?
[21:52] B: Nothing. I don't know.
[21:53] A: What are you remembering as you're feeling the nervousness in your chest?
[22:00] B: A bridge collapsing.
[22:02] A: A bridge collapsing that you were on?
[22:07] B: No.
[22:09] A: Or that you saw on TV or a different time.
[22:15] B: So, like during hurricanes or whatever, like all the bridges collapsed and where? In Arcadia.
[22:28] A: In Arcadia. So you're in Arcadia. So there's a moment that came to mind. Oh, Interesting. Well, then get here. Because I'm fun, right? At least more fun than that was. Right? Yeah. That happened how long ago? Which storm?
[22:45] B: Ian.
[22:46] A: Ian. Okay, so that happened then. Right. And what's something you've done later that was fun?
[22:56] B: Ride an airboat, play kickball, swim with my son.
[22:59] A: Swim with your son, ride an airboat, play kickball. All those moments happen after that, and they were a lot more fun than that. Right. And there's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond it. So you have good news. So that happened. You're in Arcadia. Right. Daytime or nighttime?
[23:15] B: Day and night?
[23:16] A: Well, like, as it started. So it's daytime.
[23:19] B: Daytime, as it started.
[23:20] A: Right. And then what happened? You're where, at the house. You're at the house. Right. Good. And are you watching the news?
[23:28] B: No.
[23:29] A: No.
[23:29] B: After the hurricane.
[23:33] A: So the hurricane had come through?
[23:34] B: Yes.
[23:35] A: Right. And kind of passed by then.
[23:38] B: Yeah, it destroyed everything.
[23:40] A: There was lots of stuff all over the place.
[23:42] B: Yes.
[23:43] A: Right.
[23:45] B: And.
[23:46] A: And then you, like, went outside.
[23:47] B: Yeah.
[23:48] A: And that's where you saw stuff all over the place?
[23:50] B: Yeah.
[23:51] A: Trees pulled up and. Right, Good. Then what happened next?
[23:55] B: We got in the car to go pick up someone.
[23:59] A: Right.
[24:00] B: Stuck in the storm.
[24:01] A: Right. Good. So you went to go drive to get somebody. Right?
[24:03] B: Yes.
[24:05] A: And then what happened?
[24:06] B: And the car went off a bridge.
[24:08] A: And then you guys were driving and you went off the bridge.
[24:10] B: Yeah. Yes.
[24:11] A: Right. And went into the water.
[24:12] B: Yes.
[24:13] A: And that was scary.
[24:13] B: Yes.
[24:14] A: Right. And then what happened next?
[24:17] B: I almost got trapped in the car.
[24:18] A: No, but then what happened next? You were scared. You were in the car. You opened the door or rolled down a window or. How'd you get out?
[24:24] B: I don't know.
[24:25] A: But somehow you got out. Somebody pull you out?
[24:27] B: I don't know.
[24:28] A: We don't know. But somehow you got out.
[24:30] B: Right?
[24:30] A: Right. And then you got to the side, and then you got. Got back up on dry ground.
[24:36] B: I don't know. I just remember.
[24:38] A: Well, you had to have. Do you know how we know that? Because you're here. Right. We absolutely know with certainty that clearly you got out of the water. Because it's not wet right now. Got it. Right. So then what happened next? Because you don't remember that, but clearly you got out of the water. Then what might have happened next?
[25:01] B: I honestly don't remember.
[25:03] A: Right. Because the mind stops the story at the worst spots. Well, you got out of the water, so that was better. Then you went to wherever you went, and then that particular time ended. And then later on, you did something more Fun, like play kickball or, you know, be with your son. What was the other one? Oh, go waterboating. Waterboat. What is it called? Airboating. Yeah, airboating. That's what it's called, right? Yeah. Right. It's got the big fan on the back of it or whatever. Yeah. Right. So again, notice you were telling me about it. Discomfort, brain. Not getting that it's fully over we go. What, with a memory? Yeah. So what if you went backwards? We'd start with, what, you know, going airboat riding. Right. And then we'd be doing something with sun and then playing kickball. Right. And then you're off. And then you had gotten out of the water. Right. And then somehow you'd gotten out of the car, and then the car had gone in the water. Then you guys had started to cross the bridge that wasn't there. And then you went to go get the person, and then before that, they had called. And then before that, this storm was happening. And then before that, you'd gotten prepared or at least gotten inside. Then before that, you were told that, hey, you know, there's a storm that's going to go somewhere else, but no, no, it's actually going to come here. Right, Right. So again, as we go backwards compared to forward, emotionally, how was it funny? It's funny because you can remember that happening. You can remember putting your watch on. Well, stop putting on your watch. Well, then stop doing that. Say we're not doing that. Well, stop it from happening. Say it's not happening.
[26:43] B: It's not happening.
[26:44] A: So then where is it? Say it no longer exists.
[26:46] B: It no longer exists.
[26:47] A: That's right. And as that gets in, what do you notice feeling right now, as you think about it, what do you notice? You are okay. Right. And that person didn't know that the bridge wasn't there.
[27:06] B: I guess. Right? Yeah.
[27:09] A: Right. As you go to cross a bridge, if you think it's there but it's not there, then you're going to fall in the water. Right. But you would see ahead of time that the bridge wasn't there.
[27:21] B: It was underwater.
[27:23] A: The bridge was underwater. Right. So it's not good to cross a bridge that's underwater. And it was underwater because there was so much water, not because it somehow was broken.
[27:33] B: No, the bridge wasn't there.
[27:36] A: The bridge wasn't there because the bridge was underwater because the water had risen so high that it was above the bridge. Am I understanding that right?
[27:47] B: Okay. The. Okay, so the water that was on that road, it was like ankle.
[27:57] A: Yeah.
[27:57] B: Or so deep.
[27:58] A: Yeah.
[27:59] B: So like we were going through it slow, and then the bridge was out, but we couldn't see it. All we could see is the dark water.
[28:09] A: Got it. And you didn't know. Right, right. He didn't know that the bridge wasn't there. Right, right. Right. Isn't that different than driving across a bridge that you know is there?
[28:27] B: Right. But all bridges collapse the same.
[28:31] A: So that bridge didn't collapse. It was under the water, but it.
[28:35] B: Was collapsed under the water.
[28:38] A: It was the water that caused it to collapse.
[28:41] B: Right.
[28:41] A: When the water got above it. Do you follow me?
[28:46] B: Yes.
[28:46] A: When the water rose above the bridge, it caused the bridge to collapse. Maybe the weight of a different car or does that make sense? So there's a very big difference between what was going on in terms of timing. See, what hasn't been included in the picture as we think about bridges is that you were going right after a hurricane where you were already driving in deep water, which isn't the best to be driving in to begin with. Unless we have a very large wheeled vehicle, you fall and even then, not that great to do. Right. You didn't have an amphibian. Right. That can go in water and land. Amphibious would have been cool, especially then. Right. They call them. In Boston, they call them the Duck Tours. There's like these jeeps that can drive through the water as well, and then you come back up out of them on the dry land. Kind of interesting. They float.
[29:49] B: I want one.
[29:51] A: Yeah. They don't go very fast.
[29:53] B: I'm okay with it.
[29:54] A: Yeah.
[29:54] B: I wouldn't be scared of a bridge.
[29:56] A: Well, I don't think that. Again, what's not being included is that you were driving when the road was already covered by water.
[30:02] B: Right. But you know how many bridge bridges collapse even without the standing water?
[30:10] A: Not as many as don't. So we can't have an argument about whether this is a logical thing because it is not. Right. You're trying to logically argue that we're in danger every time we go across a bridge. Tick tock, tick tock. Right. And that doesn't mean that there aren't bridges that collapse, but there's only certain contingencies that you can make for everything in life. But this isn't a logical argument. It's an emotional thing. Right. You've been thinking that that happened because the bridge had collapsed, that you guys went into the water. You didn't go into the water because the bridge collapsed. You went into the water because you were driving already in too deep water to Try to go over a r. You follow me with that?
[31:08] B: Yes. But the bridge wasn't there.
[31:11] A: And you drove into the water because the bridge wasn't there. Right? Right. You didn't drive into the water because the bridge was there. You drove into water because the bridge wasn't there. When you're driving across bridges, it means they're there. That's why you can drive across them. You went because the bridge wasn't there. See, the thing that you've been doing is that you've been thinking that the thing that's troubling me is that the bridge wasn't there. Yes, that is the thing that was troubling. That's why you went in the water. The bridge wasn't there. We're not having that issue. If the bridge isn't there and you guys are driving towards it, say, hey, stop. There's no bridge up there. I don't want to go in the water. Do you follow me with that? Right. So when the bridge is there, you're not going in the water. That's the thing that you go across to the other side. See, the thing that's been troubling you is that you've been thinking that this thing happened because the bridge wasn't there. And it did because the bridge wasn't there. It's not an issue when the bridge actually is there.
[32:22] B: Like I've been having multiple dreams of me being on top of a bridge. The bridge is there and I'm in traffic and the bridge gives out or goes down and I'm stuck in this car and I'm drowning.
[32:38] A: Uh huh. Right. That's been going on, Yolanda, because that other moment was still active. I don't know whether that's still going to go on. I want you to check because when you think about the moment of you guys driving into the water and you drove into the water because the bridge wasn't there. You don't ever have to worry about driving into the water when the bridge is there because that's the thing that takes you across to the other side. Does that make sense? No, but see, that was broken. See, the bridge didn't break. The bridge is already broken. And you drove into the water. Right. So the thing that keeps going on with this, the loop, so check it out. That you thought you were going to die. There's a part of your brain that when the car drove into the water, thought you were going to die. We're trapped and we're going to die. What do we know?
[33:38] B: I feel that way Every time I'm.
[33:40] A: Going over, what do we know right now?
[33:44] B: That I'm not dead yet.
[33:46] A: You didn't die. There's a watch. The error is that there's a part of your brain that doesn't know. You didn't die in a car that was underwater because you drove where there was no bridge. That part of your brain doesn't know that you survived, that you got out. You didn't even have to know how to survive a car going underwater when you drive over into the water. You didn't have to know how to survive it in order to survive it, did you? No. That you back then doesn't know that you survived it, that you got out of the car, that you're okay. I wonder what would happen when that part of your brain starts to learn that you made it through it, you got out, you're okay. That that was on the way to hanging out with your son and playing kickball and going out on an airboat. I wonder what would happen if that part of the brain got it. What do you think would happen? That there's a part of your brain that thinks currently, ongoingly, you're in the middle of drowning. Did you know that? That's literally what's going on. There's a part of your brain that thinks you're drowning. Stop that from happening. It's not happening.
[35:10] B: It's not happening.
[35:11] A: Well, then you stop putting on your pants.
[35:12] B: I'm not putting on my pants.
[35:14] A: Well, then stop him from driving into the water.
[35:16] B: He isn't driving in the water.
[35:18] A: Right. Well, then stop the car from sinking.
[35:20] B: It's not sinking.
[35:21] A: Right. Well, then you stop putting on your shirt.
[35:23] B: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[35:24] A: Right. Well, then stop that from happening.
[35:26] B: It's not happening.
[35:27] A: Where is it?
[35:28] B: In the past?
[35:29] A: No. Where is it?
[35:30] B: No longer there.
[35:31] A: It no longer there. It doesn't exist. There isn't a place where it is. There might be a place where the car is still if they didn't get it out, but we can't go back to watch that happen to you because that experience no longer exists. As that starts to get into the earlier you. What happens when you close your eyes and think back to that you who was panicking, stuck in a car that was sinking in the water, thinking she was going to die, and you let her know what happened? Clearly, you got out. You got out of the car, you got out of the water, you got up to dry land. You survived that, you're okay. Let that you know about playing kickball and hanging out with her, boy. And going on that airboat. Let that earlier, you know. What do you notice happening to the earlier you?
[36:26] B: She's okay.
[36:28] A: She's okay. Do you think she's like, better than okay. That was a scary, awful thing that happened, man. I made it through it.
[36:39] B: Yeah.
[36:40] A: Like, I survived that. Sure. The guns. Not that gun. These guns. Right. What do you notice happened to the earlier you?
[36:55] B: She was good.
[36:57] A: What's happening in your body? You are okay. What's it like when you feel okay?
[37:06] B: I feel okay.
[37:07] A: You do. And when you feel okay, aren't you much more relaxed?
[37:11] B: Yes.
[37:11] A: And how much more relaxed you want to be is you just, you know, like, riding. I worked with a woman one time. It was really funny. On an airplane. Well, actually in it. Don't ever get on an airplane because it's a bad ride. You want to get into the airplane. That's why we say we don't want to go over the bridge. We want to go across it. Not so trouble. But I'm in an airplane, I get there early. I'm coming back home. I'm like in like the top, like first group A. And I sit down and there's a woman already sitting next to me. So you know that she was like a person who needed assistance. Right. Because they all go first, Right. So I sit down and I put my bag underneath the seat in front of me. And she turns and she looks at me, she goes, are you a good flyer? I'm like, I don't know. I mean, I just kind of sit here, right? The person that we want to be a good flyer is that guy up there, pilot. And I'm reaching into my bag to grab a piece of gum. She's like, what are you doing? I'm going getting a piece of gum. Would you like one? Yeah. And then she says to me, I'm really tense and nervous. I go, huh?
[38:22] B: Yeah.
[38:22] A: I couldn't tell. She goes, well, like, I haven't flown. I'm going to see my best friend and my uncle molested me. And she's telling me all this stuff like, whoa, whoa. It's like 7:30 in the morning. Would you want us to do something with all that? You can? I'm like, yeah, no, we can. We can take care of it. Right? So think about where are we headed? We're headed towards a you who's got much more ease and comfort and who's emotionally experiencing other people's bitchiness as being about them. Not that she likes it, but she's got a lot more Space from it. Right. Because would it be so troubling if you felt it further away from you? I get it. That you're in the same house. Right. But notice how for you, even when you were talking about it kind of feels like it's pretty close to you. Right. Even the word that you used. I went to go get the pizza out, and then she snatched it from me. Right. Like, that's like, really, Like, I could have burned my arm because I'm not a cook. I know. It's so perfect, though. Right. But notice how it all feels so close. And I get it. You're in the same household and she was physically close. But what if you had more space?
[39:51] B: I would have been okay.
[39:53] A: Yes. What if you had more space inside from what goes on outside? Because most of you on the inside is made up of space just like most on the outside. If we were to think about it, science, neuroscience has discovered that the part of us that's solid, you have to go out 5 decimal points. It's.00001% of the human body is solid. The rest of us is space. That if you and I were to come back one year from today, 99.9999, meaning almost all of the subatomic particles that are making you and I up right now would not be here.
[40:46] B: Right?
[40:47] A: Right. Why do we. Right. Well, it's the same thing as a ceiling fan on high. Right. When it's off, we know that it's got five blades, but when it's on high, it's spinning so fast that your hand just bounces off of it like it's a solid disc. Isn't that interesting?
[41:08] B: I would not put my hand.
[41:11] A: Nobody wants to do that. But that's what it does. It bounces off because it's like a solid disc. Right. So we are made up of small, tiny, little subatomic particles that are constantly vibrating and they vibrate in unison and they're constantly changing. So if most of us is space, what if we could have more space inside even though we don't have physical space that you felt more spacious inside, so them being that way didn't touch you like it has been. Does that make sense?
[41:47] B: Yes.
[41:48] A: Yeah. So then as that goes on, what you want to do is you want to take. Actually do this. Take this arm, Just place it like that, hand up, turn it like that, hand out, put it there like that. Look at that spot where that wrinkle is right there. Just notice that spot. Don't do anything at all on purpose to move the hand or the fingers. Just look right there at that little ridge. As you look at the little ridge, become curious. You can even make the sound of curiosity. Go, hmm, that's right. I wonder what I'll be able to notice about that hand moving that I wasn't noticing before. Become a little curious about whether the movement you'll notice first will be a twitch or a wiggle. Maybe it'll be a jump or a jerk or a start or stop or just a vibration. Become curious about which one you'll notice first. And then when you notice it, you just think the word yes. Because as you notice the movement, the way it's moving, and you think, yes to. Each time you notice that it's moving. Yes. Each time you notice that hand moving and you think, yes, it's you responding to your unconscious responding to you. That's right. And your unconscious knows so much more about space than you. Your unconscious has direct. That's right. Access to the control panels of your brain and therefore knows. That's right. Which buttons to press and knobs to turn and levers to shift and switches to flip to reorganize and restructure your brain so that it becomes more. That's right. Optimized to work in ways that are best for you based on the situation you're in. So there's more flexibility in how you respond. There's more freedom in what it does. That's right. And see, you, Yolanda, don't have to even know how all of this change will happen to know that your unconscious knows what to do on the inside. That's right. And again, check. What are you noticing in your body right now?
[44:48] B: Feels rested.
[44:49] A: It does feel rested. Right. So think about as your body's rested and we know what it's like when you're relaxed, you know, and think about what it might be like. You know, what's one of those bridges that you commonly have to go over when you're with Saila?
[45:04] B: The one to Anna Mariana.
[45:06] A: That one. So it's a lower bridge. Got that right. And as you think about it right now, what are you noticing? Is it same? Is it more? Is it less? It's already a little less. But think about being in. Where might you be seated? Are you, like, in the front seat? Are you like, in the back? Where. Where are you in the front? So you're like in the front seat, passenger seat. Right. And you're headed up to it. Right. And you're getting ready to go across. What are you noticing?
[45:39] B: Now then I'm gonna roll my window down.
[45:43] A: What are you noticing now? Are you getting a little discomfort?
[45:48] B: I'm okay as long as I have my window down.
[45:52] A: Got it. But are you. So even if the window's not down, say it's stuck. And notice as we're going across that bridge, notice that you got a little bit of discomfort. Right. And when you notice the discomfort, is it still where you feel it in your chest or do you feel it elsewhere?
[46:18] B: Still in my chest, but it's like not as bad.
[46:22] A: You notice how it's already less even though you're feeling it in your chest. Now just notice the sensations in your chest. And then you make the eyes wide and you make the sound of curiosity. You go, right. You get big eyes and you go. And then what do you start noticing happening to those sensations? It does start going away. And then to down regulate the nervous system, we open our jaw wide and we rest our tongue. And you already know that it's going to induce either a yawn or a deep breath in. Both ways. As it does that, it'll begin to down regulate the nervous system. So open your jaw wide, rest your tongue, and notice that it'll either induce a deep breath in or a yawn. That begins to down regulate the nervous system. Right. And as you're checking in your body, what are you noticing now? You are relaxed. Right. And how much more relaxed do you want to be as you drive across the bridge? Because are we excited to get to where we're going when we're going to Anna Maria? Because we're going to the beach and that's fun, to go to the beach and in the water. Right. And see what's on the sand. Yeah. Right. So now you guys have had your day at the beach and of course you're headed home. You still might be in the passenger driver's passenger front seat. Yeah. And so you might be headed across the bridge back towards the residential house. And as you're thinking of doing it, what do you notice? You are. Okay. What do you notice here?
[48:15] B: There's no tension.
[48:16] A: Oh, there's no tension. How much more relaxed do you want to be? Oh, just this relaxed.
[48:25] B: Yeah.
[48:30] A: Right. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. Right. So then as we think of having much more space, Right. If we were to imagine, just for a moment, like there's you seated here talking to me, what would happen if you were to be in an observer position? So an observer might be like, you would be up above kind of looking at both of us. You could see Both of us, Right. Kind of watching the interaction. So I'm wondering what it might be like for us to think about that situation with that other resident where she's like, hey, anybody want to. Who can help me with this? I don't know how to do it. Right. And you're getting up and she's like, ain't none of you want to help me. And then you go, I'm not really sure how to do this. And you start getting out and. Right. Because we know something like that's going to happen. She does those kinds of things. How do we want you to be feeling?
[49:38] B: Relax.
[49:39] A: Relax. And what would happen if you were to be watching you and her in the interaction?
[49:46] B: I'd be relaxed.
[49:48] A: Oh, interesting. So if you were watching the interaction between you and her, what do you notice happening?
[50:00] B: I'm not as angry.
[50:02] A: You are. What are we learning more about her?
[50:05] B: She's an angry person.
[50:07] A: Well, at least in that situation, she was a little bit stressed, a little bit frazzled, a little bit upset, not knowing what to do, not feeling like she was getting the right help. That's what we learned about her. Weren't we? Were we learning anything about you?
[50:25] B: I can handle it.
[50:27] A: Well, but were we learning anything about you? You can handle her. Of course. You can handle lots of situations. That's the thing that we know about you. Follow me with that. Like, you are one of the most resilient, resourceful, amazingly able to make it through difficult shit people I've ever met. So we got it. You can make it through it. And you're really interested in learning a range of tools. Right. So it's not. Not about striking back if somebody hits me. Right. It's about having the restraint that I don't have to. That it's not just knee jerk. Follow me with that. That there's a moment in between when I get the thing before I react. Because too often what happens with people, it comes in and boom, they react. Right. We want it to come in, we want it to go up. Ah. And then have a range of options of how I respond. Because sometimes I might respond in a way that's very, very firm and direct. At other times, I might respond in a way that's more like, you know, whatever. Other times it might be, you know, compassionate and caring. Other times it might just go by because, like, it wasn't about me anyway. So. Right. We want to have the flexibility in responding even more to different situations. Follow me with that. Yeah, yeah. And see the girl that was stuck in the car that Was underwater. She was correct in that the problem was that you guys drove when the bridge wasn't there. Right. So anytime and you have my permission, if as you guys are driving and you see that the bridge isn't there, tell them to stop. Okay. My permission when you see, if you see that the bridge isn't there, say no, no, no, stop. We don't need to go to the island today. There's no bridge. Got it. Because that will absolutely avoid going in the water. Make sense?
[52:48] B: Yes.
[52:48] A: Yeah. Yeah. So again, as we think about it, what's another scenario, situation, time thing that might happen with, you know, living with a bunch of gals that normally like kind of sets you off?
[53:10] B: Someone over talking. Talking to me.
[53:13] A: What does that mean?
[53:14] B: Like I'm trying to tell you something, but someone else is talking louder than me trying to tell you something.
[53:20] A: Got it.
[53:21] B: When I was already talking to you?
[53:23] A: Yeah. Okay. Right. So you can know that. Right. Think about somebody doing that. Maybe it's a particular person and you're trying to talk to another resident or advocate. Or advocate. Yeah. And then they're jumping in. And louder than how you're talking. Right. Where do you feel it? Like where do you feel that? In your body? Like where is it?
[53:53] B: My whole body.
[53:55] A: Oh, you feel it in your whole body? You feel it in your arms?
[53:57] B: Yes.
[53:58] A: In your pinkies?
[53:59] B: Not in my pinkies, but like my arms. My chest?
[54:02] A: Yeah, you feel it in your arms? Chest and stomach. Stomach. Right. Close your eyes. Let that feeling tone take you back. Let that feeling tone, Yolanda, take you back and grow you younger and earlier and earlier and younger. Back. Back towards one of the first times you had that kind of a feeling. What experience is coming to mind now?
[54:45] B: There's no experience.
[54:46] A: Interesting, huh? What are you noticing happening to the sensations?
[54:52] B: They're going away.
[54:54] A: They are going away. So think about it again. You're talking to one of the advocates and this person is just getting loud trying to notice how you feel it. Right. Is this how you want to be feeling that tension?
[55:13] B: I feel okay. It's just annoying.
[55:16] A: Uh huh. So well, do you want to be feeling annoyed? How do you want to be?
[55:38] B: I honestly don't know because when like when they over talk me, it's like, okay, I'll walk away, I'll come back and like I'm okay. It's just when like I'm trying to stay there and talk about it. So like I just found that I just need to walk away and come back to the thing. That's how I cope with It.
[56:11] A: And that's been a useful tool.
[56:13] B: Yes.
[56:14] A: Right. What is it that has. You feel like you've got to stay.
[56:23] B: Just not listening to my coping skill.
[56:28] A: Or you were right in the middle of sharing something.
[56:30] B: Yeah.
[56:31] A: And like, you had their attention.
[56:34] B: Right.
[56:34] A: And now their attention is elsewhere.
[56:36] B: Right. So I just. When that happens, I just walk away. Normally, they'll either come back to me or they'll cut that argument. Like you see us talking.
[56:47] A: So what if you were to just pause?
[56:52] B: I do that, too.
[56:54] A: Okay. And that person flirts it all out, and then it's up to the advocate to be like, we'll get to that in a minute. I was having a conversation here.
[57:04] B: Yeah.
[57:06] A: Right. So a pause. You can move away. You got that? Those are strategies that have been useful strategies. What I want to get is when you're trying to. Because you're just about finishing your point and this person's blurting in now, they took their attention away. Feel that discomfort? Like that. The emotion could be one of, like, that whole word that you use, disrespect or. Right. Isn't that the thing? Right. So I want you to get that feeling where it feels like I've been really disrespected and grab a hold of that feeling, close your eyes, and then let that feeling, like a zipline, take you back towards one of the first times you had that kind of a feeling, which probably has nothing to do with this at all, but it goes all the way back in the moment. Yeah. What comes to mind?
[58:14] B: I don't know.
[58:16] A: You don't know. Right. You probably don't know. What's your unconscious come up with that you're going, what does that have to do with any of this?
[58:27] B: My mom disrespecting mine.
[58:29] A: And then an interesting thing, that your unconscious did come up with something, but you're like, that's not about me and nothing to do with me. So you're how old? What happened?
[58:39] B: My dad.
[58:40] A: You're where? Like where?
[58:42] B: At the house.
[58:43] A: You're at the house? You're like, how old a kid? Yeah. Like, younger than 5. Older than 5.
[58:49] B: Older.
[58:50] A: Like younger than 10. Older than 10. Like 9. So, like, you're 9 and you're wearing the house. Right. Like, sitting on the couch watching tv. Right. And then dad came home, or dad was already there and he was sitting in the room.
[59:06] B: No, he walked out of his bedroom and started yelling at.
[59:09] A: So he walked out of the bedroom and then he was yelling at Mom. Right. Saying what? Where's my food? Your bitch. I don't know, whatever he was saying, just disrespecting her. No, he. He was doing what? You dumbass. You stupid. What? What. What might he have been saying?
[59:26] B: All of it.
[59:26] A: Said all those kinds of things, right? And mom was standing there, right? And then what happened next?
[59:32] B: He put his hands on her and.
[59:33] A: Then he grabbed her, right? Like on her shoulders, her arms or.
[59:38] B: No, he just like slapped her.
[59:40] A: So he like whacked her. Right? Good. And then what happened next?
[59:47] B: He started fighting.
[59:48] A: So then she was screaming back at him, right? She might have hit him, then he might have hit her again.
[59:56] B: My mom never hit anyone.
[59:57] A: Okay, so she just screamed at him, right? What the fuck are you doing? Right then what might happen next?
[60:08] B: I left and went to my room.
[60:10] A: And then you went to your room. Right? And then eventually they stopped fighting. And then that moment ended. And then later on, you did something more fun like play kickball or go see your son or go on the airboat. Right. So we got going on the airboat, seeing your son playing kickball, Right? Being in your room. Well, no, them stopping. Then you went to your room. And then you heard that. And then mom was yelling back. And then dad had hit her. And then dad was calling her all sorts of names. And then dad had come out from the bedroom. And then you had gone to the living room to watch tv. And then before that you were doing whatever you're doing as we go backwards again compared to forward. What do you notice?
[60:50] B: I'm okay.
[60:51] A: You are. What do you notice happened in the discomfort?
[60:54] B: He's not there.
[60:55] A: Oh, isn't that cool? You can remember him doing that? You can remember putting on your sandals. Stop putting on your sandals. Stop him from doing that. Stop him from saying that. You stop putting on your shirt. Well, then stop that from happening. Where is it? Yes, that's right. It's gone. No longer exists. Again, as that gets in, what do you notice? Was that about dad? Stepdad? That guy? Was it about mom.
[61:24] B: I care about?
[61:26] A: You do, Right? But him treating her like that, did that have anything to do with her lovability or worth? Or did it have to do with his fucked upness?
[61:38] B: His messed upness?
[61:39] A: Didn't it? Right. You didn't know how messed up he was. You knew some of the things he did was messed up. Right. But you didn't know how messed up he was. Make sense?
[61:53] B: Yes, sir.
[61:55] A: So close your eyes. Think back to the nine year old. You let her know that's over, finished. The experience no longer exists. Let her know that him doing that to mom had nothing to do with mom. Everything to do with what was off with him. Right. Let the you know that you're okay. What is that you earlier you need to know about mom.
[62:32] B: She's okay.
[62:33] A: She is. Did she get away from him?
[62:34] B: Yes.
[62:35] A: Oh, she did, didn't she? So what happens if that earlier you gets it that she got away and that she's okay?
[62:43] B: I feel okay.
[62:44] A: You do feel okay. Right? Right. Were we learning anything about mom?
[62:51] B: She's strong.
[62:53] A: We got that she's strong. Right. But we weren't learning about her with his behavior or his words, like if he called her stupid, dumb, whatever. We weren't learning that she was a stupid, dumb, whatever. You follow me with that? We're learning about him. That's what we want more and more of is you experiencing the other people's stuff. Residents, staff, people at meetings, jobs, wherever, as being more about them. Not you. Right. Think of another time where like, you might have felt disrespectful, whether it be when you've been here or elsewhere in life. Colin.
[63:48] B: No, no, I'm trying to think.
[63:50] A: No, other times that you were disrespected.
[63:52] B: I'm sure there was a bunch of times, but I don't.
[63:55] A: Or other times that you were treated in ways that you didn't want to be treated.
[63:58] B: Right?
[63:59] A: Right, Right. But just check it out now. Think about, you know, her snatching the pizza or somebody just popping off, going. But what do you notice? Yeah, right, Right. Is it making you feel bad about you? Is it making you angry? Right. Isn't that cool? Because we want more space inside you to connect to more of the space inside it. Both ends of the spectrum. Right. We can always see things that are bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. Right? Because we can go from there's Lakewood Ranch to there's Manatee county to There's. There's all of Florida to. There's all of the United States to. There's all of North America to. There's all of North America middle and South America to. There's the entirety of the continent. Right. Like, you can go up, but we can also go down. Small, small, small, small, small, small, small, small. Right. In every direction. It's to infinity. So there's always more space for you to become more okay in you, for you to lighten up on you, for you to have more comfort in here, for this to quiet. Right? Right. So again, if we think about you, right, Like, I mean, let's just think, you know, you might be headed towards, like, I don't know, maybe there's some sort of art festival or a museum that you guys want to go see in St. Pete. So you all pile in, and you start driving. And you might be in the front seat or you might be in one of the other seats. You go up over the thing, and then you're on your way. And then you see, like, the toll, and you're driving. Then a little bit of that is across the water. Then you kind of keep going. You see the rest area thing, and then you start going up, and you can even see where the old bridge was and where it's not. And that's the one that you don't want to drive because that bridge isn't there. But you keep going up. You know, the skyway keep going up and then to the top, and then it kind of comes down like a roller coaster, except you don't get to go as fast. Just kind of goes down. You can kind of see the vista. You can even see the top of Tropicana Field. Depending on if the ray is one, it might be orange. All right. Kind of come back down. What do you notice?
[66:45] B: I'm okay.
[66:46] A: You are okay. Isn't that cool? Notice how that's different?
[66:51] B: Yes.
[66:52] A: Yeah. What does this say?
[66:59] B: Bang.
[67:00] A: Bang. Oh, well, perfect. We got the gun and we got the. I didn't see the bang before. This is even better. That's fantastic. Right? You're way too young to remember old Batman, but they used to do, like, when they would get in fights, they'd go bang or boom or bop, and they'd have, like, big letters. And so as you're checking in, what do you notice?
[67:29] B: I'm okay.
[67:30] A: You are. Think about, you know, something else that might happen at the house or elsewhere, you know, somebody, like, might be that, you know, I don't know. That's pretty much disrespecting me, you looking at me like that. Huh?
[67:48] B: It don't bother me when someone looks at me.
[67:51] A: Crazy. Damn right it doesn't. But a lot of people, it would.
[68:00] B: Right?
[68:01] A: Right. For you. You're like, enjoy the view, right? Yeah. So, again, checking in. What do you notice?
[68:21] B: That I'm okay.
[68:22] A: You are okay. What's it like to know that you're okay?
[68:26] B: Feels good.
[68:26] A: It does, doesn't it? Because for a long time, there are lots of stuff stuck on where you weren't feeling like you're okay.
[68:33] B: Right.
[68:34] A: Right now you're getting it. And it's keeping getting deeper and deeper. Like, the more you say it. I'm okay. It's like a deeper, guttural, like, I'm okay. Like down solid. Isn't that cool? Right? I mean, that's literally. Your voice changes. If we took that recording and you could hear earlier ones, it. It's deeper when you say I'm okay. It's even more internalized. Yeah. Isn't that cool? What other stuff? Like, where are you in programming now? Like, are you in. You're not in action yet.
[69:10] B: No.
[69:11] A: You're in like the pre. Contemplation phase.
[69:14] B: Exploration.
[69:15] A: Exploration. That's what they always call. I always forget that. Yeah. Where you're just like, exploring. Yes. You're like Dora.
[69:24] B: I'm like, what?
[69:25] A: Dora.
[69:26] B: Oh, yeah.
[69:26] A: The explorer.
[69:28] B: Yeah.
[69:28] A: You're exploring. What have you explored so far?
[69:31] B: The pond.
[69:32] A: The pond, yeah.
[69:34] B: The art room.
[69:35] A: Okay.
[69:36] B: The property. The house.
[69:38] A: Yeah.
[69:40] B: A lot of stuff.
[69:41] A: Yeah. And in exploring, what are you supposed to get out of it?
[69:49] B: Knowledge of surroundings.
[69:52] A: Kind of know where you are, what's around you. Do you explore? Like, maybe what I might be interested in doing.
[70:00] B: Yes.
[70:02] A: What goes on with that for you?
[70:03] B: I read a lot and listen to music.
[70:07] A: Good music.
[70:09] B: Yeah.
[70:10] A: There's a really fun song. It's depressing song, but it's a really fun song. I don't know if it's called Season of the Styx, but it could be called Season of the Styx, but it's a part where this guy goes into the chorus, he goes, I love Vermont but it's the season of the sticks and I saw your mom she forgot that I existed it's half my fault I just like to play the victim I drink alcohol till my friends come home for Christmas and I'll dream each night of some version of you that I did not have but I did not lose and your tire tracks in one pair of shoes that all that's left and that'll have to do because my other half was you. Like, that's a really sad song. But how he does that whole thing, it's really fun. I don't know. Have you ever heard it?
[70:58] B: Yes.
[70:58] A: Okay. But it's a sad, depressing song. But the way he sings it is all like, upbeat, like banjo. Yeah, yeah. It's like that kind of like he's got like a. Just an acoustic guitar that he's playing that way. Yeah. Yeah. How about, like, you know, thinking about, like. Because in exploration, then you start thinking about, like, what do you want to do? Like in. Like, what do you want to get out of this program? What do you. Where do you want to go? What do you want to do.
[71:31] B: I wrote a list of things I want to get out of the program. It's like two pages.
[71:36] A: Oh, cool. So what's some of them?
[71:40] B: How to get health insurance, how to apply for dental insurance.
[71:44] A: Okay.
[71:44] B: How to rent an apartment and read a lease and stuff like that.
[71:52] A: Okay. How about work, job stuff?
[71:57] B: I want to go to school for auto mechanics or really abuse counseling.
[72:01] A: Either or. Those are, like, very varied.
[72:04] B: I know.
[72:05] A: I'm the substance abuse mechanic. That's so cool.
[72:10] B: I want to do substance abuse, like, but at the same time, like a.
[72:17] A: Peer connection thing or, like, actually do counseling stuff.
[72:23] B: Like, counseling stuff.
[72:25] A: Okay.
[72:26] B: I want to work at a treatment center.
[72:28] A: Okay, sure.
[72:29] B: So, yeah. And then I want to do auto on my own time. Like, I don't want anybody to. I don't want to pay anybody to fix my vehicle.
[72:41] A: I just want to know how to fix your vehicle.
[72:43] B: Yes.
[72:44] A: Yeah. I got a funny story for you. Not funny. Funny. So in February, my car needed some stuff done. New tires, some other stuff. So it's going to be like, five grand. Okay, good. I talked to the people. I'm like, okay, so if we do all this, like, everything else looking really good. You kind of checked all the other stuff. Like, we're going to be set. Because I don't really want to do anymore. We're going to be set, like, in a year from now. I'm going to start saving some money and, you know, to get a different car. Like, yeah, no, no. This is. You're. You'll be good. So two weeks ago, my car ac done. Gone. Like, stopped working. So go back to them. Yeah. So we got some bad news. I'm like, what do you mean? He go, well, you know, you need to have the converter, and you need to have this other part that goes with it, the converter, 1600. And the other part to go with it is 1400. So that's $3,000. And then it's 25. 25 hours of labor time. So it'd be like seven grand. I'm like, I'm done. I don't want to put any more in the car.
[73:44] B: Pull the windows down and go 60.
[73:46] A: I did for a while. And then like, okay, I guess we'll go get a different car a little earlier than we had anticipated, but. And then I get the new car. And this is a crazy story, too. So I get the new car. I got 52 miles on it. And all of a sudden, this warning light comes on. Not a check engine, motor failure warning. It's an electric car. So it doesn't even have an engine. So motor failure. And I'm going up the skyway, and I get to the top and it stops. So I just coast down the skyway, and when I finally get to a spot, I pull off to the side of the road. I'm like, okay, this is awful. It's a brand new car. Like, I've not had a new new car in, like, 22 years. That's crazy, right? Four more times, like, so I rebooted it, thought, like, maybe that's it. Drove it little ways, died again. Drove it another little ways, died again. Finally, like, in front of where you turn to go to Walmart and Texas Roadhouse, like, stopped. I'm like, call the tow people to get it back up to them. Brand new car. Like, I've had it for an hour and a half now, right? Oh, you need to pay A$610. I'm like, Finally I get a call from the sales manager who says, I'm so sorry, you don't have to keep this car. Can you get it home? Yes, I'll get it home. Okay. We'll send you a loaner for. And then we'll get you your car. So that's what they did. But what a freaking. That's crazy, right? Right? Yeah. What are you gonna do?
[75:28] B: I bought a Jeep, like, last year, and I paid $150 for it. It did not run at all, period.
[75:36] A: Nice.
[75:38] B: And I got it. Took me a week, but I got it running.
[75:44] A: Nice heat.
[75:46] B: I didn't need ac.
[75:48] A: So it's a Jeep, right? Yeah.
[75:50] B: It's waste, but I got heat in it.
[75:52] A: Wow.
[75:54] B: It was really good on gas. The starter kept going out, but I think it was like a wiring thing. So I just put two wires on the starter and the battery, ran it to the key thing. So I just turned over the key and mashed the wires together.
[76:15] A: Beautiful.
[76:15] B: Started up, and my starter never went bad after that.
[76:18] A: Nice.
[76:21] B: Yeah. So there was a lot of stuff I had to do to it, but I got it running by myself.
[76:26] A: And you knew how to do all that?
[76:27] B: Yes.
[76:28] A: That's pretty impressive.
[76:29] B: Yeah. So, like, I already know a lot of stuff about mechanics. Now I just want to get certified with it.
[76:37] A: Good for you.
[76:38] B: So.
[76:38] A: Well, that's cool. So you can do that and you can do some work at a substance abuse place.
[76:45] B: Yes.
[76:45] A: Yeah. And show people that you can change.
[76:50] B: Yes.
[76:51] A: Isn't that cool? Awesome. Yay. Yeah. So think about, you know, I mean, you might go over the Skyway. I mean, across it Nobody wants to go over it. What do you notice?
[77:05] B: I'm okay.
[77:06] A: You are okay. Isn't that interesting? Yeah. And what if one of the residents, you know, starts.
[77:15] B: That's on them. That's on them.
[77:21] A: It is, isn't it? That's right. Are we learning anything about you?
[77:26] B: No.
[77:27] A: No. Yeah. Yeah. And as you kind of check inside, what do you notice?
[77:34] B: I'm okay.
[77:35] A: Yeah. Cool. Any other stuff that comes to mind?
[77:41] B: No.
[77:42] A: No. Okay. Deb sent me an email. I don't know what it said, though.
[77:48] B: We gotta talk about Bridges.
[77:49] A: Is that what it was? Probably. Was that. Yeah, we talked about bridges.
[77:55] B: Yeah.
[77:56] A: How you doing with bridges now? You are, aren't you? Yeah. Isn't it neat how things transform?
[78:04] B: Yeah.
[78:06] A: Right. Because check. You can check with the feeling. Notice how it's different. It's not even located in the same spot.
[78:14] B: Right.
[78:14] A: Isn't that interesting? I think it's really cool how our brain can, like, rewire itself. Right. That's the whole world of neuroplasticity. That is the game changer of all of therapy. We can rewire faulty programming in neural networks in the brain so that it optimizes, fires, and works more in the way that the person wants it to. That's a cool thing to know.
[78:41] B: So where did you learn this?
[78:46] A: Let's see. So I learned some of this from a guy back in 2006. He did a course on trauma resolution treatment. And I'd done trauma stuff, and I didn't like it because it was yucky and uncomfortable for the person and myself because I worked with Bosnian refugees, and I did EMDR at the time. And they would relive the worst moments while they were with me. And that sucked for them and me. But I moved down here and I start my own business. And this was something. I'm like, all right, well, let me go to this training. It was beautiful at a retreat center up in Brooksville. So it was, like, in the middle of, like, no cabins, woods all around you. It's really, really pretty. And first thing was watching a video of a guy doing a treatment session with somebody. And when they were talking about what happened to them, they were fully present and. Okay. And I'm like, that's amazing. I want to know how to do that. So that got me started. And so I learned from that person. I probably with him for three or four years, where I went to tons and tons of training and did lots of stuff. Stuff with that. And then there are some things that he knew how to do, but he wasn't Sharing. So I went to neuro linguistic programming training. So nlp, that kind of is really giving you some background and understanding of how the brain works. So, like a silly example is when people are accessing emotions, they tend to look down into the right, which is why somebody says that makes me downright angry or I'm downright impatient. It's a literal thing. Make sense. So then you can pay attention to somebody and notice where they're going. When people are visualizing a future, they look up into the right. When they're visually remembering a past, they look up into their left. So getting a better understanding of the mechanism of the human being. Like you're in the body, what does. How does the body paying more attention to how the body communicates. Right. Because that's going to be most closely connected to unconscious. So I went and learned all that. And then I went to a training with a guy named John Overdurf, who is phenomenal. And he has both those pieces. And I've been training with him ever since. I think I started with him in, I don't know, 2013, 2014. And it's been awesome. He is wonderful. So I continue to learn new and different things, which is awesome because he continues to put out new and different things.
[81:24] B: That's cool.
[81:25] A: So it works. Yeah. And then he doesn't do this. He does something else altogether. You know, he works with people, but he does a whole different thing. Like, I kind of really cater towards trauma, emotional wound stuff. That's more my. That's the part that when you get that better, it's better and people feel different and it's immediate and it's neat.
[81:47] B: Yeah, that's cool.
[81:51] A: Yeah. Yeah. So I got into something that then, like, it's fun to do and I get to feel good doing it. Yeah. That's why when you talk about, like, oh, I want to work in a substance abuse rehab center and I want to do stuff. Not that I work as an auto mechanic, but know how to do my own stuff. Both of those two things are things that you enjoy. Like you had the natural curiosity to go, what is it that's causing the error with the starter that it's not turning over? Huh. I wonder if it's wiring. Well, let me try new wires to that and this and let's see. And every time I cranked it, it worked. Okay, cool. That's great. Yeah, that's really cool. Yeah. Where do you. Where are you from from?
[82:45] B: I was born in Tallahassee, but I was raised in Madison county in Florida.
[82:50] A: Madison County, Florida. Okay.
[82:53] B: Yeah.
[82:53] A: And then you were in Arcadia for a period of time?
[82:56] B: Yeah. Then I moved down to Hardy when I was 16, and then I just lived in Arcadia and Hardy.
[83:03] A: Okay. What year did you get that? How old were you.
[83:10] B: Last year? Year before last.
[83:12] A: Nice.
[83:12] B: Probably a year before last.
[83:14] A: Okay.
[83:16] B: Yeah.
[83:18] A: Did you get bang at the same time?
[83:19] B: Yeah, I got the gun and bang.
[83:26] A: On the same day. Of course, you can't. Not Right.
[83:29] B: Right.
[83:32] A: Do these pieces hurt? Yes, they are. Because I figured that I know the inside. When I got the inside of my arm done, that hurt a lot.
[83:41] B: But, yeah, I'm gonna try to get the scar covered.
[83:46] A: Yeah.
[83:46] B: And I feel like it's really gonna hurt.
[83:49] A: Maybe.
[83:52] B: I don't know.
[83:54] A: Yeah. Cool.
[83:55] B: Find out when it comes.
[83:57] A: Yeah. Yeah. So keep me updated on how things are going. Do you go to graduation? Are you going to graduation?
[84:04] B: Yes.
[84:05] A: Not that you're graduating, but you're going to graduation. I got a fun talk to them going to do. Hopefully it'll be really useful for people, but it's going to bring up different ideas. First idea, one of them is everybody's behavior makes sense to them or they wouldn't do it. Even if their behavior makes no sense to you at all.
[84:27] B: Right.
[84:29] A: Right. So that's an interesting concept. Right. So everybody's behavior makes sense to them or they wouldn't do it.
[84:37] B: Right.
[84:38] A: And life is not about making the right decisions. It's about making the decision. Right. Adjusting the course. Isn't that a cool way to say that? Yeah. Yeah. So there's more little stuff, but I think it'll be a fun thing. I'm still not done with it. I probably won't be until it's not for a couple weeks. You know those things, like, you need to have a little heat on you before you actually, like, do it.
[85:08] B: Yeah.
[85:09] A: Like, I'm not good at, like, you know. Oh, well, no, I already wrote it out three weeks ago. I need to have a little heat before I get it.
[85:16] B: Like, I wrote it out last night type thing.
[85:19] A: Could be that some people do it that way. That's fine. Yeah. I'll probably have it outlined and then maybe tweak some stuff and do all that. But yeah. Yeah. Cool. Well, I'm glad that things are going well and I'm glad what we've done so far has been helpful.
[85:35] B: Thank you.
[85:35] A: Yeah, you've done great. I'm super excited for you and really excited about all the changes. Good job.
[85:43] B: Thanks.
[85:44] A: Cool. I think we're done for today. What do you think? Unless there's something else.
[85:51] B: No.
[85:52] A: All right. We'll be done for now.
