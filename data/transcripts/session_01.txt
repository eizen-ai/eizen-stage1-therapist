[DOCTOR]: Okay, so we're making a recording of what we're doing and you know that.
[PATIENT]: Yes, I know that.
[PATIENT]: We did last time also.
[DOCTOR]: I'd say yes.
[DOCTOR]: So before we get started with what we're doing today, because it's been a while since we got together, kind of thinking about what do we want our time together?
[DOCTOR]: We can meet more than this time, but what do we want today to do for you, right?
[DOCTOR]: And I got like, okay, there was that whole insecurity of, oh no, he might be mad.
[DOCTOR]: I certainly remember some of what we talked about, but you know,
[DOCTOR]: What do we want our time to focus on today?
[DOCTOR]: What do we want to get better for you?
[DOCTOR]: How do we want you to be when we're done?
[PATIENT]: I...
[PATIENT]: I want to feel peaceful.
[PATIENT]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: Right now, a lot of things are going on.
[PATIENT]: At work also, it's pretty hectic.
[PATIENT]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: Just trying to figure out everything.
[PATIENT]: And I'm in constant hurry.
[PATIENT]: I don't want to miss anything.
[PATIENT]: If one staff or any of my tasks.
[PATIENT]: So that's how.
[PATIENT]: And...
[PATIENT]: Recently, I'm feeling a lot of pain in my body also.
[PATIENT]: In body, in sense, my right leg.
[PATIENT]: So whenever I'm stressed or whenever I'm overthinking or whenever I'm triggered from my past, so it's like kind of start hurting a lot.
[DOCTOR]: Where in the life?
[PATIENT]: Like right side of, right side below knee till toes.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And what kind of hurt is it?
[DOCTOR]: Is it an ache?
[DOCTOR]: Is it a stab?
[DOCTOR]: Is it a...
[PATIENT]: It's an ache.
[DOCTOR]: It's an ache.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Whenever I stretch, I feel like, okay, this is a good position.
[PATIENT]: This feels better.
[PATIENT]: Whenever I... So when I was in shelter home, I used to tie my leg with something, some cloth, a long cloth piece.
[PATIENT]: I would tie it like very hard so that I don't feel that pain.
[PATIENT]: It just like...
[PATIENT]: That pain just goes away, I feel like.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, that's what you used to do when you were in the shelter home.
[DOCTOR]: You'd put that around your leg.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: When I started Neurofeedback, the pain, it went away.
[PATIENT]: And it has been a year that I'm not following up on Neurofeedback sessions.
[PATIENT]: So the pain started again because I started thinking a lot and I started getting triggered of my past insecurities, abandonment issue or something like that.
[PATIENT]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: So for now, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And even you just talking about it right now, you're feeling some of it.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: So whatever it is that causes that, we want to get that to stop.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So that that's not happening, that feeling stuff.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Cool.
[PATIENT]: Why do I cry every time whenever I meet you?
[DOCTOR]: I don't know, I get more tears than Oprah, who knows?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[DOCTOR]: Right, well, cause this is like, you know, stuff that's been really difficult, right?
[DOCTOR]: And really heavy.
[DOCTOR]: And, you know, we're just, you know, dipping our toe in the water and yeah, there's a lot there, right?
[DOCTOR]: And before we deal with any of the stuff that's there, we wanna understand how come it's continued to affect you and how we wanna get you better, right?
[DOCTOR]: So one thing you said is you wanna be more peaceful, right?
[DOCTOR]: You wanna be more emotionally present because you've been recognizing that sometimes I'm reminded or thinking or triggered by, and I find myself then there, not here.
[DOCTOR]: So we want you to be more peaceful.
[DOCTOR]: We want you to be much more emotionally present.
[DOCTOR]: We want you to be...
[DOCTOR]: my word, but like lighter and easier on you because there's been with what I went through, lots of insecurities or second guessing myself or worrying about what others or how I'm going to, or if it's good, right.
[DOCTOR]: There's been a lot of that stuff that's been happening.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So we want to get it so that you're lighter, more okay in you.
[DOCTOR]: not so heavily dependent on the worry about what others might think.
[DOCTOR]: Like more grounded in you.
[DOCTOR]: Does that make sense?
[PATIENT]: Yes, completely.
[PATIENT]: I want that.
[DOCTOR]: I see that.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: What else comes to mind?
[PATIENT]: So this I mentioned that to you when we met last time also and recently I'm struggling with that thought again.
[PATIENT]: So I'm finding difficulty to
[PATIENT]: maintain my relationship like friendship with my best friend so I always kind of I always feel like I am disappointing him and I am not able to fulfill the expectation he is putting on me
[PATIENT]: And he feels like since I got a boyfriend... What do you know?
[DOCTOR]: Like, just check for a second.
[DOCTOR]: How do you know when you... How do you know when to feel like you're disappointing him?
[DOCTOR]: What is it that's happening in that moment?
[PATIENT]: He's always complaining about how I don't call him.
[PATIENT]: And he's always complaining that you're not giving time.
[PATIENT]: He's always complaining that you give a lot of your time to your boyfriend.
[PATIENT]: he's always in that but it's not that I'm always busy with my work and I'm not a person who always pick up the phone and calls everyone and I'm not even a person who texts a lot so
[PATIENT]: Like in-person meetings are really good for me.
[PATIENT]: But the digital thing doesn't work really well with me.
[PATIENT]: Especially with friends and someone who's... So he's in that zone, like he's always complaining and that gives me so anxiety that... He's complaining.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And when you say it gives you anxiety, what do you find yourself feeling and where in your body do you feel it?
[PATIENT]: I feel so much anger that... Okay, anger.
[DOCTOR]: And where are you feeling the anger?
[DOCTOR]: Where is it in your body as you feel it?
[PATIENT]: In my mind and in my chest, I feel it.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, so up here and here.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: All right.
[DOCTOR]: So keep going.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So you feel it there, right?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: I feel like, see, I'm not, I told you multiple times that I'm not the kind of person who calls everyone and it's not you only.
[PATIENT]: I don't call my other best friend also.
[PATIENT]: So you keep complaining that I give my lot of time to my boyfriend.
[PATIENT]: It's not that too.
[PATIENT]: It's just my work and I'm just busy with myself.
[PATIENT]: There is nothing else.
[PATIENT]: There's nothing.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So that relationship and his upset has put a lot of pressure on you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And you feel really angry that why are you putting all this pressure on me when I told you it's not like about you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then there's all that angst.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Since I feel...
[PATIENT]: my boyfriend so I after a long time I came into a healthy relationship in which like I am getting appreciated I feel good about myself and I am pushing myself towards growth more not just like there is no one who is holding me back yeah
[PATIENT]: so i'm really i feel good about about my relationship and feel secure and everything it's nice but i feel like since i got into a relationship so sorry just nothing you're good
[PATIENT]: So I feel like I started disappointing my old friends when I used to have my school friends, actually, and even my sister, which I have from shelter home.
[PATIENT]: So their relationship is not so good.
[PATIENT]: They don't have a good bond, my boyfriend and my sister and my best friend.
[PATIENT]: So I am struggling in between.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: I feel like I'm stuck.
[DOCTOR]: Your boyfriend doesn't get along with your sister and your best friend and your best friend doesn't get along with them either.
[DOCTOR]: And your sister doesn't get along.
[DOCTOR]: So you're in the middle of a, I get along with this person and this person and this person, but those people don't get along with each other.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, and when we are out, it just feels like I need to make everyone happy.
[PATIENT]: I need to spend this much time with this person, this much time with this person.
[PATIENT]: And now we will be going on a trip as a group.
[DOCTOR]: All four of you?
[PATIENT]: A lot of people are there.
[PATIENT]: 12 to 15 people are there.
[PATIENT]: But I am getting stressed about that.
[PATIENT]: If this kind of situation are right there,
[PATIENT]: I had this traumatic breakdown last week when we were on a trip.
[PATIENT]: And I kind of burst out and started yelling, started like, took out all the- Yeah, really.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Last time it happened.
[DOCTOR]: The last time you went on a trip with them?
[PATIENT]: Yes, yes.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: I don't want this time to happen like that.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: And that's coming up when?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, rather than being excited about the trip, I am getting stressed about the trip.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, when is the trip happening?
[PATIENT]: We are starting the trip from 14th July.
[DOCTOR]: Okay, cool.
[DOCTOR]: So you want to get it so that you don't feel so much pressure to have to make sure that everyone is okay with each other, knowing that they don't really like each other.
[DOCTOR]: And you're constantly on trying to make sure that everybody's okay.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, that takes a lot of effort and work.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, it's so-so.
[PATIENT]: I don't know where is it coming from.
[PATIENT]: Is it from my childhood or anything?
[DOCTOR]: I don't know whether it matters where it's coming from.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, but it's so, so stressing me out.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, the thing that matters...
[DOCTOR]: is that what's happening in that situation, knowing that they don't all like each other and knowing that there's this whole like time thing, you're feeling like you're having to contort and change and make sure and shape shift and chameleon eyes and to make sure everybody's okay all the time.
[DOCTOR]: And that has been very heavy and emotionally draining.
[DOCTOR]: And it also feels like the people that you're doing this with don't really understand.
[DOCTOR]: the pressure that they're putting and what the discomfort of each other does to you.
[DOCTOR]: They don't get that either.
[DOCTOR]: I'm getting it.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So again, the thing that we want is we want you to have more space and separation.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: I want to be comfortable.
[PATIENT]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: They don't have regulation.
[PATIENT]: It's okay.
[PATIENT]: It's not my problem.
[PATIENT]: They have different personalities.
[PATIENT]: They have their own things.
[PATIENT]: That's okay.
[PATIENT]: I want to be comfortable with that.
[PATIENT]: I want to...
[PATIENT]: Okay, that person don't understand my situation.
[PATIENT]: That's okay.
[PATIENT]: I'm only comfortable with that.
[PATIENT]: I want to feel in that way.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how at a logical level, you get it that it's their stuff.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: But at an emotional level, it doesn't feel that way.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, I always feel in my emotional level.
[DOCTOR]: So we want to get that shifted.
[DOCTOR]: So that in the way that I'll say it is we want you to experience more space in between you and other people's stuff.
[DOCTOR]: So that you actually internally experience other people's stuff as being about them.
[DOCTOR]: Not about me.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And in that, who you're learning about is always them.
[DOCTOR]: And therefore, sometimes you might be learning that something you said or did upset them.
[DOCTOR]: And depending on the situation and who it's with and what it was about, you may respond in a way that's very caring, kind, compassionate, empathetic understanding.
[DOCTOR]: You might respond in a way that's really clear and direct.
[DOCTOR]: Like you might not respond at all because there's nothing for you to say.
[DOCTOR]: We want you to have that range and that freedom in those interactions.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So that you experience the space and emotionally you're getting it to their stuff.
[DOCTOR]: It's not meaning something about you or your lovability or your worth or whether you're good enough or any of that kind of stuff.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: So how do we want you to be?
[DOCTOR]: A, we want you to be much more peaceful inside.
[DOCTOR]: Much more comfortable in your own skin.
[DOCTOR]: We want you to be a lot lighter inside.
[DOCTOR]: so that you're much more emotionally present.
[DOCTOR]: We want you to be experiencing more space in between you and other people's stuff so that emotionally and internally you experience their stuff as being about them and have flexibility
[DOCTOR]: based on the situation and how you respond to it.
[DOCTOR]: And then lastly, we want whatever effect past stuff has had, recent or long time ago, we want the effect that that's had to be lifted and gone so it no longer weighs on you and those reminders or similars no longer trigger that in you.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Cool.
[DOCTOR]: All right.
[DOCTOR]: So that's where we're headed.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And the question isn't how it's going to happen that we get you there.
[DOCTOR]: The question is, would it be okay with you?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: It would be okay with me.
[PATIENT]: I want that.
[DOCTOR]: I know, right?
[DOCTOR]: So it's okay with you.
[DOCTOR]: So with it okay with you, we get a green light to organize your brain towards the future you.
[DOCTOR]: So what we're going to do is we're going to have you do a short little process with me that starts to put your body into a state of rest.
[DOCTOR]: We want your body in a state of rest because resting is what enables inside healing to accelerate.
[DOCTOR]: It's why colds, flus, and surgery, we tell people the same thing.
[DOCTOR]: We want you to get rest.
[DOCTOR]: And so we've got really cool levers that are designed to put the body at rest.
[DOCTOR]: First lever, super silly.
[DOCTOR]: It's about slightly lowering the jaw.
[DOCTOR]: So not a complete drop like, ah, but just a little bit like, and when you slightly lower your jaw, it stimulates the vagus nerve and starts to put the body into more of a resting state, right?
[DOCTOR]: The second lever is you're going to relax the back of your tongue so that your tongue rests at the bottom of your mouth.
[DOCTOR]: So it's like this.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Third, you're going to intentionally breathe in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper on the inhale and then a little bit longer on the exhale.
[DOCTOR]: So your jaw is slightly lowered.
[DOCTOR]: You're relaxing your tongue so it rests at the bottom of your mouth.
[DOCTOR]: You now begin to breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer, right?
[DOCTOR]: And as you're beginning to intentionally breathe in this way, just check inside your body.
[DOCTOR]: How's your body feeling now?
[DOCTOR]: Like more tense or more calm?
[DOCTOR]: It's feeling more calm, right?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So then we want to add the next lever.
[DOCTOR]: Like when we're stressed and anxious and agitated, the beta waves become really narrow.
[DOCTOR]: They're tunneled, right?
[DOCTOR]: They're highly elevated in tunnel.
[DOCTOR]: We're going to move your brain waves down to the lower end of beta, higher end of alpha, right?
[DOCTOR]: Because in alpha waves, that's what surfers think of as flow states or athletes would call it being in the zone.
[DOCTOR]: It's those moments of alert, aware, relax.
[DOCTOR]: And what it correlates with is an expanding of awareness out towards your peripheral vision.
[DOCTOR]: So one more time, your jaw is slightly lowered.
[DOCTOR]: You relax the back of your tongue.
[DOCTOR]: It rests at the bottom of your mouth.
[DOCTOR]: You breathe in intentionally a little bit slower and deeper, and then out a little bit longer.
[DOCTOR]: And notice as you're continuing to breathe in this way, you can see me and you can see my nose.
[DOCTOR]: You can stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers.
[DOCTOR]: My fingers move off to the side so that with the sides of your eyes, you begin to pick up more of the space towards the sides of the room.
[DOCTOR]: Notice that you're more aware of the space between you and the screen, the space that's beyond the screen.
[DOCTOR]: the space that's behind you, the space that's underneath you, and the space that's above your head.
[DOCTOR]: And as you're aware of more and more of the space, check inside your body once again.
[DOCTOR]: How's your body feeling now?
[DOCTOR]: Again, more tense or more calm.
[PATIENT]: Welcome.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that kind of cool?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: And then you may or may not have ever heard the phrase, I'm under a lot of stress.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: But if some, yeah, but if somebody is underneath stress, where must the stress be?
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that a weird statement, right?
[DOCTOR]: So if I'm under, if I'm here and I'm underneath the stress, where must the stress be?
[PATIENT]: It should be down, but it's above.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, the stress is on top of me.
[DOCTOR]: It's above me, right?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That's why stress sometimes feels like a weight or a weight on my chest, right?
[DOCTOR]: It's on top of me.
[DOCTOR]: So then the reversal is a different metaphor.
[DOCTOR]: It's about getting out from under and rising up above and having that metaphor of a bird's eye view.
[DOCTOR]: And that simply means I'm a bird up above in the sky, able to see everything is being underneath and below me because I'm above and I'm over all of it.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So one more time, slightly lower your jaw, relax your tongue, breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in, a little bit longer on the way out, right?
[DOCTOR]: As you breathe in this way, you can see me and my nose, right?
[DOCTOR]: You can see my fingers.
[DOCTOR]: They go out beyond the screen.
[DOCTOR]: You stay looking at my nose, but with the sides of your eyes, you pick up more of the space.
[DOCTOR]: That's right, towards the side walls, in between the screen and beyond, behind and above.
[DOCTOR]: And notice that the space doesn't just stop in your location, but it goes well beyond the confines of the room you're in.
[DOCTOR]: all the way out in every direction, there's a lot more space towards outer space and beyond.
[DOCTOR]: And now just for a moment, go ahead and close your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: And then with your eyes closed, imagine what it might be like to float up and out of your body, beyond the ceiling and beyond the roof so that you rise way up above it all in the sky.
[DOCTOR]: You're having this bird's eye view.
[DOCTOR]: You're seeing it all as being underneath and below you because you're above and over it.
[DOCTOR]: And like a bird free, soar and glide through the space of the sky.
[DOCTOR]: And move in multiple directions and in different ways.
[DOCTOR]: Big wide arching turns and curves.
[DOCTOR]: You soar, you fly, you glide, you move, you're free.
[DOCTOR]: To be becoming even more okay in you.
[DOCTOR]: Now, go ahead and bring your awareness back down and into your body so that you reassociate inside of you.
[DOCTOR]: Take a nice, slow, deep breath in.
[DOCTOR]: And then a big exhale.
[DOCTOR]: And open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And in those few short moments that your eyes were closed, what did you notice within yourselves?
[PATIENT]: There was nothing.
[PATIENT]: This is bothering me.
[PATIENT]: I felt free.
[DOCTOR]: You felt free.
[DOCTOR]: Wasn't that a nice feeling?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, it was amazing.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, to be both in nothing and feeling free.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And that's where we're headed as a you who's free.
[DOCTOR]: And just a little bit of a recap, we all recognize, and I'm going to say it in a little bit of a different way than the last time, but let's just say because of things that you've gone through throughout your life, there have been bad programming that got installed in you.
[DOCTOR]: Programming that made you more self-conscious.
[DOCTOR]: Programming that made you more question yourself.
[DOCTOR]: Programming that would have past things pop up or make you feel bad or that over concern about others and making sure I've got to do everything to make sure, right?
[DOCTOR]: What we're going to say is that there's been bad programming along the line that got installed.
[DOCTOR]: Does that make sense?
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And the bad programming got installed because you went through crappy stuff, right?
[DOCTOR]: And our brain develops in such a way that it learns how to survive something
[DOCTOR]: But how I learned how to survive it at four or eight or 12 or 16 may be different than now.
[DOCTOR]: So it's not that we want to get rid of any of the stuff that had you survive.
[DOCTOR]: We just want to expand the options that are available because we want those for when those situations, if they were to arise, arise so that we have it.
[DOCTOR]: But in other situations, they're not as effective.
[DOCTOR]: You being constantly worried about what and how all those people are going to feel, that's not helpful.
[DOCTOR]: At other times, a way that that operated worked really well because it was what I needed to survive.
[DOCTOR]: Second part is we understand that physical injuries heal and they heal over time.
[DOCTOR]: So a broken arm or a broken foot over time,
[DOCTOR]: With the right cast or whatever you put on it, it will heal, go through rehab, and then it's better.
[DOCTOR]: We also get that emotional wounds tend to not heal.
[DOCTOR]: No matter how much I talk about it, no matter how far I get away from it, it still seems to be there.
[DOCTOR]: Even though I know that it's over, even though I know it's done, it doesn't feel that way.
[DOCTOR]: And so the reason it doesn't feel that way is that when I went through those experiences, my emotional brain short-circuited.
[DOCTOR]: It got stuck on.
[DOCTOR]: Meaning when that happened, it froze it and doesn't know it ever ended.
[DOCTOR]: So there's a part of your nervous system, there's a part of your emotional brain that has never updated.
[DOCTOR]: So with any of the bad, awful experiences that you've gone through, all those ones that you try to never think about because whenever you do, you feel yucky, right?
[DOCTOR]: Those are experiences that at a different level are still on in you.
[DOCTOR]: So the goal of what we're doing is we want to change the relationship
[DOCTOR]: that stuff so the coding changes from happening to data about something that happened yeah makes sense yes right and that's what we want to do because what got tied into all negative experiences is the additional meaning that it meant something about me at a worth lovability identity level
[DOCTOR]: So when I was a little child and my dad left, I was two and he was no longer in the picture, I didn't have the processing skills that I do now.
[DOCTOR]: I know as an adult now that my dad wasn't, well, he was screwed up in some ways.
[DOCTOR]: And that him not being around wasn't about me or my lovability or whether he loved me or not.
[DOCTOR]: However, when I was a little child, it really felt that way to me.
[DOCTOR]: Because as a little child, it's my world and I've learned good happens when I'm good.
[DOCTOR]: Bad only happens if I'm bad.
[DOCTOR]: So, of course, my dad not being around must have had something to do with my lovability.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: And even though I know that now as an adult, I don't know that where I'm emotional.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And that's what we want to get shifted.
[DOCTOR]: We want to update the parts of the brain that got stuck at the worst moment of the worst experiences.
[DOCTOR]: So that that part of the brain, that moment gets unplugged and then emotionally we're able to experience it as data about something that happened versus where it's been on inside is happening.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Makes sense.
[DOCTOR]: And because it's on inside it happening, it doesn't matter whether I'm actively thinking about it or not.
[DOCTOR]: It's having an effect all the time.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: The guy tells us about getting mugged and he gets to the part where the gun is at his head and his face now gets all contorted and his voice gets all choked up and he's got a tear.
[DOCTOR]: Now we know as he's telling us about that, what the heck is happening?
[DOCTOR]: We all go, he's reliving it.
[DOCTOR]: But what's really happening is that there's a different part of his brain that's confusing the memory.
[DOCTOR]: Thinking it's the experience, that's why it's affecting him.
[DOCTOR]: And we can tell when he was telling us about it because we saw it all over him, right?
[DOCTOR]: But that's the thing.
[DOCTOR]: It was affecting him even over the weekend when he was playing with his kids.
[DOCTOR]: It was under the surface, but still there.
[DOCTOR]: Logically, he knows that he's safe.
[DOCTOR]: He's with us.
[DOCTOR]: He survived.
[DOCTOR]: He's okay.
[DOCTOR]: There's no gun.
[DOCTOR]: The problem is that we're learning that there's another part of his brain that doesn't have the good news.
[DOCTOR]: Did that make sense?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, another part of his brain got stuck.
[DOCTOR]: And then once it's stuck, and this is why you experience it in an ongoing way, my brain is vigilant and sensitive and searching because it wants to keep me alive and it still thinks that awful stuff is happening.
[DOCTOR]: It's scanning, sorting, looking for anything that's a reminder of that stuff.
[DOCTOR]: Even if the reminder wasn't part of the problem, but happened at the same time, it can get confused.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And that's what's been triggering off in you.
[DOCTOR]: And that's what we want to get shifted so that that stops happening.
[DOCTOR]: Now, really, really simple.
[DOCTOR]: And it's really, really simple.
[DOCTOR]: We're going to go through an experience and you're going to be like, really?
[DOCTOR]: It's that easy?
[DOCTOR]: Because the thing that we want to do that's different than what you do normally is when your brain brings an experience to mind, we want you to intend to be emotionally with me.
[DOCTOR]: Be emotionally present.
[DOCTOR]: So your job is to just intend to be with me, right?
[DOCTOR]: My job is to keep you with me.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: But your job is to just intend to be with me.
[DOCTOR]: And the reason that you want to be with me right now is that this is what's happening.
[DOCTOR]: And that stuff isn't.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Two, we're working on the mutual worthwhile goal that we both want for you.
[DOCTOR]: And three, I'm hoping being with me is at least a little more enjoyable than the worst moments of your life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: I'm not going to set the bar very high, but I'm hoping.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And that's what we wanna do.
[DOCTOR]: So in a moment, what we're gonna do is we're gonna guide you back into that calm state.
[DOCTOR]: Your unconscious mind is gonna, as we do that, scan back and begin to sort and categorize different experiences.
[DOCTOR]: And then it's gonna narrow and pinpoint a moment that would be useful for us to unplug.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[DOCTOR]: So again, notice what happens when you slightly lower your jaw.
[DOCTOR]: and you relax the back of your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out.
[DOCTOR]: And as you're breathing in this way, notice that you can become immediately more aware of space.
[DOCTOR]: And as you're more aware of space, notice what that's doing inside.
[DOCTOR]: Go ahead and close your eyes and imagine floating up.
[DOCTOR]: and out of your body, way up above it all in the sky.
[DOCTOR]: Seeing everything as being underneath and below.
[DOCTOR]: You're above, you're over it, free to be becoming even more okay in you.
[DOCTOR]: And as all of this is going on, your unconscious, which has been listening and understands and with you the whole time, is already going back
[DOCTOR]: for us to unplug, categorizing and grouping those moments.
[DOCTOR]: And it'll narrow and pinpoint a particular experience.
[DOCTOR]: Bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate.
[DOCTOR]: And then exhale.
[DOCTOR]: Exhale.
[DOCTOR]: and open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: And again, how's your body feeling now?
[PATIENT]: I felt, you know, so relaxed from my mind, but my body, I don't know, my stomach and my chest, it just was something, it was a weird feeling.
[DOCTOR]: I bet it was at the same time because your unconscious was scanning right back through moments of things that have happened.
[DOCTOR]: And it's going to bring a particular experience to your awareness.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: For us to unplug.
[DOCTOR]: And the one that comes to mind happened about like how long ago you might've been how old?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Like 10, did you say?
[DOCTOR]: No, how old?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, moment, experience that comes to mind.
[DOCTOR]: You might have been how old?
[PATIENT]: Maybe I was seven.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[DOCTOR]: And so the feelings that come up as you think about that one are feelings of what?
[DOCTOR]: Is it hurt, anger, sadness, grief, guilt, shame, regret, remorse, pain, combination?
Yeah.
[PATIENT]: I was sad and disappointed on my mother.
[DOCTOR]: Uh-huh.
[DOCTOR]: So sad.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So first question, right?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: First question, would it be okay to get the sad feelings gone?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And if the sad feelings are gone, does it mean whatever mom did was okay?
[PATIENT]: It wasn't okay.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: I know.
[DOCTOR]: You get to be okay even though that wasn't.
[DOCTOR]: Follow me with that.
[DOCTOR]: Got it.
[DOCTOR]: So how we unplug something, by the way, if that happened when you were seven, there have been lots of things you've done later in life that were more enjoyable than that.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: What's something you've done anytime from seven until yesterday.
[DOCTOR]: That was more fun than that moment.
[PATIENT]: There was a few moments.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: There was moments.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So what's something you've done that was more fun than that at seven, anytime between seven and, you know, yesterday.
Yeah.
[PATIENT]: We did seven on yesterday.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So like in between that timeframe from when that ended until now, there's been things you've done that are fun.
[PATIENT]: There were a lot.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: I want to know three, three moments of things that you've done that were fun after that thing at seven.
[PATIENT]: Okay, I can think of, I was in the shelter home.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: So I had this group of friends and the light gone and we were just, I was just making laugh everyone and we were just laughing and there was no reason to laugh.
[DOCTOR]: Right, so laughing with your friends.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That's something that happened later.
[DOCTOR]: Good, something else.
[PATIENT]: Like recently...
[PATIENT]: fun moment right yeah something that you've done that was at least a little more enjoyable than the thing at seven yeah so recently I I enjoyed I enjoyed rain yeah I love rain so it just makes me feel like a child yeah so the rain and being out in the rain playing in the rain right one other thing that you've done
[PATIENT]: It's about Sunday only.
[PATIENT]: And what else?
[PATIENT]: Yes, there were so many moments.
[PATIENT]: Why can't I remember?
[DOCTOR]: Right, meeting your boyfriend.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, so yeah, meeting my boyfriend.
[DOCTOR]: Right, that was more enjoyable than that.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, that was enjoyable.
[DOCTOR]: Right, so all of those moments happened after the thing at seven.
[DOCTOR]: there's a part of your brain that doesn't know any moment beyond that thing at seven.
[DOCTOR]: So we have some good news to get in.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[DOCTOR]: So when that moment happened and you were seven, when it happened, you were where?
[DOCTOR]: Like, where were you?
[DOCTOR]: Were you at home?
[DOCTOR]: Were you out in a street?
[DOCTOR]: Were you in an apartment?
[PATIENT]: Sleeped.
[PATIENT]: We were at the street.
[DOCTOR]: So you're in the street, right?
[DOCTOR]: Daytime or nighttime?
[PATIENT]: Daytime.
[DOCTOR]: Daytime, right?
[DOCTOR]: And like you're walking or just standing there?
[PATIENT]: I was just standing there and my mother was telling me.
[DOCTOR]: And mom said what?
[DOCTOR]: Mom did what?
[PATIENT]: So my mom just show me like my brother to her is like a one rupee coin to her and I the 25 rupee.
[DOCTOR]: Right, so she says that, right, good.
[DOCTOR]: Right, and then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: I don't remember what happened next.
[DOCTOR]: I know, mine stopped the story at the shitty spot.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Do you follow me?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, I don't remember at all.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, eventually you guys left the street and probably went back home.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then that was over.
[DOCTOR]: And then later on you did something more fun.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Like laugh with your friends at the shelter home.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Or, you know, play outside in the rain.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Or meet your boyfriend.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Now notice, as you were telling me about the experience with mom, there was some discomfort.
[DOCTOR]: It was a little less because you were intending to be with me.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Now here's the crazy thing.
[DOCTOR]: We never go backwards with the memories.
[DOCTOR]: But when we do, it literally unplugs the memory and it takes away the charge.
[DOCTOR]: So we're going to go backwards.
[DOCTOR]: So we've got, you know, playing in the rain.
[DOCTOR]: We got laughing with the friends at the shelter house.
[DOCTOR]: We got meeting your boyfriend.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then you guys were probably back home and then you left the street and then you were standing there.
[DOCTOR]: And then mom said, you're like this and he's like this.
[DOCTOR]: And then you were out at the street.
[DOCTOR]: And then before you walk to the street, then before that, you're doing whatever you're doing.
[DOCTOR]: Now, as I went through it backwards, compared to you telling it to me forward, emotionally, how was it?
[DOCTOR]: Was it same?
[DOCTOR]: Was it more?
[DOCTOR]: Was it less?
[PATIENT]: So you're asking how I felt?
[DOCTOR]: When I went backwards, yeah, compared to when you were telling it to me forward, emotionally, how was it?
[PATIENT]: It was different.
[PATIENT]: It was different.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how it was less.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that interesting?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: It felt like I'm not giving importance to that moment.
[DOCTOR]: It's not right because your brain is beginning to read it as data.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Third, the emotional brain does not get logic, but it does get patterns of association.
[DOCTOR]: And remember, the error is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening got glued together.
[DOCTOR]: So they're living as if they're the same thing.
[DOCTOR]: But there are things that you can remember doing even earlier today that you know you're not doing right now.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: For example, you can remember getting dressed and putting your shirt on.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember doing that.
[DOCTOR]: But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, and then I said, and putting your shirt on, and then I went, stop putting on your shirt.
[DOCTOR]: You would look at me crazy and go, I'm not putting on my shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Because you know there's a difference between the memory of you doing it and you doing it.
[DOCTOR]: They're not the same thing.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that interesting?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: So we're going to use a pattern of association game because you can remember mom saying that.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember putting on your shirt.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So, you know, Jazzy, stop putting on your shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Say, I'm not putting on my shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Say that.
[PATIENT]: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Stop me from putting on my shirt.
[DOCTOR]: And you say, you're not putting on your shirt.
[PATIENT]: You're not putting on your shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Right, well, then you stop putting on your headphones.
[DOCTOR]: Say, I'm not putting on my headphones.
[PATIENT]: I'm not putting on my headphones.
[DOCTOR]: Right, stop me from putting on my headphones.
[DOCTOR]: Say, you're not putting on your headphones.
[PATIENT]: You're not putting on your headphones.
[DOCTOR]: Right, well, then stop mom from saying that.
[DOCTOR]: Say, mom's not saying that.
[PATIENT]: Mom, you're not saying that.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, well, stop mom from doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Say, mom's not doing that.
[PATIENT]: Mom, you stop doing that.
[DOCTOR]: No, say, mom's not doing that.
[PATIENT]: Mom's not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Well, stop her from saying that.
[DOCTOR]: Say mom's not saying that.
[PATIENT]: Mom's not saying that.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then stop that from happening.
[DOCTOR]: Say that's not happening.
[PATIENT]: That's not happening.
[DOCTOR]: So then where is it?
[DOCTOR]: Say it no longer exists.
[PATIENT]: It no longer exists.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And as this gets in, what do you notice happening now?
[PATIENT]: something weird just it feels like that got registered in my mind that uh-huh that is okay that pain is like suddenly went away it did go away didn't it yeah isn't that crazy think about that same moment but that sadness that disappointment
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: It's not there.
[DOCTOR]: You're not feeling it.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[DOCTOR]: So the last part, you know that mom saying that had to do with whatever was screwed up in mom.
[DOCTOR]: Do you follow me with that?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But, you know, when you were a little kid, you didn't know how screwed up mom was.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Like you have a lot more understanding of mom not being well, but mentally, emotionally well, right?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So mom saying that had nothing to do with you and everything to do with whatever was screwed up in her.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: But you didn't know that when you were a kid.
[DOCTOR]: That's why it felt like it meant something about me.
[DOCTOR]: So I want you to repeat these four words after me.
[DOCTOR]: Here we go.
[DOCTOR]: It's.
[DOCTOR]: It's.
[DOCTOR]: Say it's.
[DOCTOR]: Not.
[PATIENT]: It's.
[PATIENT]: It's not.
[DOCTOR]: About.
[PATIENT]: About.
[DOCTOR]: Me.
Me.
[PATIENT]: Me.
[DOCTOR]: Right, it's not.
[PATIENT]: It's not.
[DOCTOR]: About me.
[PATIENT]: About me.
[DOCTOR]: Right, it's not about me.
[PATIENT]: It's not about me.
[DOCTOR]: Now close your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: Picture that younger you just after mom said it, letting her know that that moment is over, finished, completed, it no longer exists.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know that mom's saying that had nothing to do with you or your worth or lovability, but everything to do with what was off with mom.
[DOCTOR]: so that the earlier you get, it's not about me.
[DOCTOR]: Let the earlier you know that you're okay, that you didn't need mom to be well in order for you to be okay, in order for you to laugh with your friends, in order for you to love the rain, in order for you to meet your boyfriend, in order for you, right, so that she gets it that you're okay.
[DOCTOR]: And as the earlier you is getting it, what do you notice happening to her face?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, what happens to the earlier you?
[DOCTOR]: What are you noticing now?
[PATIENT]: There's a slightest smile.
[DOCTOR]: There is, isn't there?
[PATIENT]: Like this.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that interesting?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: She's no longer stuck there.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you can open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And as you're checking in with you, what are you noticing now?
[PATIENT]: Feels like.
[PATIENT]: But particular to that moment, just that my mother comparing me and my brother, it just stayed in that moment.
[PATIENT]: Just, I'm not feeling that now.
[DOCTOR]: And see, it wouldn't actually have mattered whether it was you or some other daughter of hers, your age at that time with that brother.
[DOCTOR]: That's what she would have said.
[DOCTOR]: Or it had nothing to do with you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, it's not... Notice how it's not feeling bad anymore.
[DOCTOR]: I still don't like that she did it.
[DOCTOR]: But it's not making me feel bad anymore.
[PATIENT]: Isn't that cool?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So again, as we're organizing towards the future you...
[DOCTOR]: who's present, who's clear, who's much more peaceful, who has more space and is free, again, that other part of your brain, your unconscious will travel back down the timeline of those moments and experiences and will bring another experience to mind.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And that one happened when?
[PATIENT]: Can I drop my jaw?
[DOCTOR]: Well, no, the moment.
[DOCTOR]: Just check.
[DOCTOR]: Negative experience.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: What comes to mind now?
[PATIENT]: Like whatever I said just now, from that and even...
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So notice that anything that you think about with that experience right now, that doesn't have any charge.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So what we're doing is we're going to ask your unconscious, the other part of your brain.
[DOCTOR]: to travel back down that timeline of other experiences and bring a different moment to mind for us to unplug.
[DOCTOR]: Because each time we unplug, your brain updates and rewires, right?
[DOCTOR]: Part of what's contributed to your over self-consciousness and over worry about others
[DOCTOR]: Is that the camera lens is really jammed inward where it feels like everything and everybody's stuff means something about me.
[DOCTOR]: Even though you logically know it doesn't.
[DOCTOR]: And that started right.
[DOCTOR]: As we started to shift that thing with mom, we're starting to change the lens so that you get more space.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Got it.
[DOCTOR]: Because we do want you to be more okay in you.
[DOCTOR]: more at peace, right?
[DOCTOR]: And see, you can check how's your body feeling now, right?
[DOCTOR]: And notice how body's feeling more okay, right?
[DOCTOR]: Your unconscious can travel back and will bring another experience for us to unplug.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right, and that one happened when?
[PATIENT]: Can I relax?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, well, you might have been how old?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how you're going down right into the feeling?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And that feeling takes you to what experience?
[DOCTOR]: And you got it.
[DOCTOR]: But notice how you got the experience and you're there, not here.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: Notice how you're back there.
[DOCTOR]: Follow me.
[DOCTOR]: I want you to be here.
[DOCTOR]: So get back here, right?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Because, no, no, no, you're perfect.
[DOCTOR]: The reason that you're troubled by that awful thing then isn't because it was an awful thing then.
[DOCTOR]: It's because your brain doesn't know the awful thing ended.
[DOCTOR]: So that's why as you started thinking about it, it kind of traveled you back to being there again.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how I paid attention and I went, no, no, no, get back here, be with me.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because you and I are going to get good news in to that part of your brain that doesn't know the experiences are over.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You survived it.
[DOCTOR]: You made it through it.
[DOCTOR]: You had what you needed.
[DOCTOR]: You're okay.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: We want that, which, you know, to be known in here.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[DOCTOR]: So that particular experience happened when you might have been how old?
[PATIENT]: I was 11 years old.
[DOCTOR]: 11 years old.
[DOCTOR]: Okay, right.
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: And again, how we unplug it, we're going to be here in 10.
[DOCTOR]: I'm going to keep you here.
[DOCTOR]: We're going to go through just the facts.
[DOCTOR]: So literally in a minute or less, we're going to go, that happened, then that happened, then that happened, then that happened, then that happened, then it was over.
[DOCTOR]: So the thing at 11, when it happened, you're where?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Where were you?
[PATIENT]: So can I tell you, with that particular feeling, with that particular moment, there are two, three incidents coming into my mind.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, two or three incidents.
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: So let's do one at a time.
[PATIENT]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Got one and be here because I'm fun.
[DOCTOR]: I'm way more fun than that was, I promise.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So that one happened, you're where?
[PATIENT]: I was on the street and I was running.
[DOCTOR]: You're on the street, good.
[DOCTOR]: Running, yeah, right.
[PATIENT]: I was running from my mother.
[DOCTOR]: Right, so you're running from mom.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, my mother was running behind me by holding a big stick.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Stick or, I don't know, stick.
[PATIENT]: It's not stick.
[PATIENT]: A big wood, wooden thing, which we use in the house.
[DOCTOR]: Like a wooden spoon, like a mallet, like you'd use to whack somebody.
[PATIENT]: Not spoon.
[PATIENT]: It's a big log, something, but not so, not so thick.
[PATIENT]: So, which we use in house building.
Okay.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: So she was carrying that and in the middle of a main road, I was running and she was running behind me and she was abusing me.
[PATIENT]: She was trying to hit you with it.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, she wanted to catch me.
[PATIENT]: So she was hitting you with it.
[PATIENT]: I was just running.
[PATIENT]: She couldn't beat me at that moment.
[DOCTOR]: Right, so you kept running and you got away from her.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, she was abusing me.
[DOCTOR]: Abusing me, meaning what?
[DOCTOR]: What did she do?
[DOCTOR]: Saying mean things, hitting you?
[PATIENT]: Saying mean things to me.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[PATIENT]: She was saying that I slept with someone.
[PATIENT]: Right, in year 11.
[PATIENT]: He was my uncle.
[PATIENT]: And he was like a brother to my mother.
[PATIENT]: And he took care of me because my mother and my stepfather, they both were beating me.
[PATIENT]: So he took me with him to his house.
[PATIENT]: And so the next day, she wanted to beat me so bad that- Right, so she came after you with that thing and was saying that you must have had slept with my brother, right?
[DOCTOR]: So she's saying all that and calling you names and hitting you.
[PATIENT]: And then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: In front of everyone.
[PATIENT]: And I was crying and I was running.
[DOCTOR]: Right, good.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[DOCTOR]: And well, then you ran away.
[PATIENT]: You got away.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then that moment was over.
[PATIENT]: I got away.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then that moment was over.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then later on, you did something more fun.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Like laugh with the girls at the shelter house.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Or, you know, be out in the rain, enjoying it.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Or meet your boyfriend.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And again, notice as you were telling me about it, there was the discomfort.
[DOCTOR]: Not because that was such a yucky moment, but because your brain was confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience.
[DOCTOR]: We go backwards.
[DOCTOR]: So we got meet your boyfriend.
[DOCTOR]: We got laugh one of the women in the shelter home.
[DOCTOR]: We got, you know, being out in the rain.
[DOCTOR]: And then you were away and then you were running and then she was saying those mean and hurtful things and swinging that thing at you.
[DOCTOR]: And then you had gotten back from your uncles and then you'd stayed at your uncles and then they had been saying mean and hurtful things and physically hitting you.
[DOCTOR]: And then before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[DOCTOR]: So as I go backwards again, compared to forward, what do you notice?
[PATIENT]: The discomfort that becomes less.
[DOCTOR]: It's already becoming less.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that interesting?
[DOCTOR]: How cool is that?
[DOCTOR]: Because your brain is getting the good news.
[DOCTOR]: It ended.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember them doing that.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember them saying the mean stuff and hitting you.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember her accusing you of doing something.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember all that happening.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember putting on your headphones.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Stop putting on your headphones.
[DOCTOR]: Say, I'm not putting on my headphones.
[PATIENT]: I'm not putting on my headphones.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then stop her from hitting you.
[DOCTOR]: Say, she's not hitting me.
[PATIENT]: She's not hitting me.
[DOCTOR]: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Say you're not putting on your shirt.
[PATIENT]: You're not putting on your shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Well, stop them from saying that stuff.
[DOCTOR]: Say they're not saying that stuff.
[PATIENT]: They're not saying that stuff to me.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then stop it from happening.
[DOCTOR]: Say it's not happening.
[PATIENT]: It's not happening.
[DOCTOR]: So then where is it?
[DOCTOR]: Say it no longer exists.
[PATIENT]: It no longer exists.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And again, as this gets in, what do you notice?
[PATIENT]: It's just that moment...
[DOCTOR]: Notice how it doesn't have the thing anymore.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And see, you said that there were others that came up.
[DOCTOR]: So what's another moment?
[PATIENT]: Same with the meeting.
[PATIENT]: Like her and him?
[DOCTOR]: Mom and stepdad?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Same about age?
[DOCTOR]: Like 11, 10, 9, 12?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And so you might, this time you're in the house or?
[PATIENT]: In the house.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And afternoon, evening, morning?
[PATIENT]: Evening.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you were where in the house?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, I was in, it was one room.
[PATIENT]: So I was in front of them.
[DOCTOR]: So you're in front of them, right?
[DOCTOR]: And they were, you were standing, they were standing?
Yeah.
[PATIENT]: They were sitting.
[PATIENT]: I was sitting.
[DOCTOR]: They were sitting.
[PATIENT]: You were sitting, right?
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And what happened?
[PATIENT]: My mother started beating me because of my stepfather.
[PATIENT]: So with hands and... With hand, with leg.
[DOCTOR]: Like fist or slap?
[DOCTOR]: Kicks?
[PATIENT]: Fist and kicks.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And so she was hitting you and you were like trying to protect yourself, right?
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[DOCTOR]: And be here.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Be here.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how you were there for a second.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how you're coming back here.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[DOCTOR]: See, we're updating the brain.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: To now.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: After that, I got saved by my uncle.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So uncle came in.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And they stopped.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then you left with him.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then that moment was over.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then later on, you did something more fun.
[DOCTOR]: Like, you know, playing in the rain.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Or laugh at the shelter house.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Or even meet your guy.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So we got meeting the guy.
[DOCTOR]: We got laughing at the shelter house.
[DOCTOR]: We got, you know, playing in the rain.
[DOCTOR]: We got going off with uncle, him coming in, them stopping.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Mom hitting and yelling at you.
[DOCTOR]: You being in the corner.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right, and again, as it goes backwards, what do you notice happening to the feelings?
[PATIENT]: It's not there.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And what was the other one?
[DOCTOR]: Because you said there were a few.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, the other one...
[PATIENT]: When my stepfather got drunk.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: And he, like, did all of my books.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So he knocked down all your books?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, my school books, and I was crying and holding those books.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: I was worried about that.
[PATIENT]: I want to, how will I go to school tomorrow?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: I don't have any books.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[DOCTOR]: How are you doing right now?
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Get back here, right?
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[PATIENT]: I felt helpless in that moment.
[DOCTOR]: Well, sure.
[PATIENT]: But then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: Next day, he said, why are you not going to school?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: And I started crying on that.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: You tore all of my books.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Now you're saying why I'm not going to school.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: I think I went to school.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then that was over.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then later on you did something more fun.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Like dance in the rain.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Or laugh.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So we got laughing with friends.
[DOCTOR]: We got dancing in the rain.
[DOCTOR]: We got being at school.
[DOCTOR]: And then, you know, him asking you crying.
[DOCTOR]: And then you waking up.
[DOCTOR]: And then you finally going to sleep.
[DOCTOR]: And then him throwing all the books.
[DOCTOR]: And then him coming in after being drunk.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And again, as we go through that, you can remember him doing it.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember putting your shirt on.
[DOCTOR]: Well, stop putting on your shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Say, I'm not putting on my shirt.
[PATIENT]: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Well, stop him from doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Say, he's not doing that.
[PATIENT]: He's not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So then where is that experience?
[DOCTOR]: Say, it no longer exists.
[PATIENT]: And doesn't exist anymore.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And what we want to get in is that earlier you again would have felt like with those moments that it had something to do with you or your worth.
[DOCTOR]: As we look at it clearly, did it have anything to do with you?
[DOCTOR]: Or did it have to do with mom and stepdad not being well?
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[DOCTOR]: had to do with them not being well, it had nothing to do with you.
[DOCTOR]: Second, and this is really key, you didn't need them to be well in order for you to turn out as a caring, loving woman.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You didn't actually need that from them in order to be that for others.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Do you follow me with that?
[DOCTOR]: Like you didn't need that closeness, that love in order to be that for others.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[DOCTOR]: So you didn't even need it in order for you to be it.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You at an early age didn't know that.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So one more time, close your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: Picture that earlier you and let the earlier you know what you know now.
[DOCTOR]: Overfinished love.
[DOCTOR]: no longer exists.
[DOCTOR]: It's not about me.
[DOCTOR]: It had nothing to do with me.
[DOCTOR]: It had everything to do with them not being well.
[DOCTOR]: And I didn't need them to be well in order for me to turn out and be a loving person, to be a caring person, to be a kind person.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So that the earlier you gets it, that you're okay.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And as the earlier you is getting it,
[DOCTOR]: Let her know about laughing and which fun she has in the rain so that she's getting it.
[DOCTOR]: Right, what happens to the earlier you now?
[DOCTOR]: Right, what do you notice happening to her face?
[PATIENT]: She's smiling.
[DOCTOR]: She is, she's not stuck there anymore.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And as she's smiling, check inside your body.
[DOCTOR]: How's your body feeling now?
[PATIENT]: Body's feeling relaxed.
[DOCTOR]: It is, isn't it?
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[DOCTOR]: Because it's kind of unusual for your body to be feeling relaxed when you've been thinking about that kind of stuff.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that neat?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, notice how different that is.
[DOCTOR]: What else are you noticing now?
[PATIENT]: It's really good to speak in my life.
[DOCTOR]: There's a what?
[PATIENT]: The leg is hurting.
[DOCTOR]: It is, isn't it?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Uh-huh.
[PATIENT]: That is just tapping.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, huh.
[DOCTOR]: Well, check it out.
[DOCTOR]: Go ahead and open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: And when you think about those experiences...
[DOCTOR]: Stuff that happened with mom, mom chasing you, stuff that happened with stepdad, mom accusing you.
[DOCTOR]: When you think about that and those things now, her saying the thing about you with brother, right?
[DOCTOR]: What do you notice?
[PATIENT]: I'm not feeling sad and disappointed on that.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[PATIENT]: And there's no pressure and I'm not putting in that situation completely.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: I feel that.
[DOCTOR]: And notice how it's not feeling like it was your fault or about you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: It's, I felt it is not about me.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[PATIENT]: It's, was there, you know,
[PATIENT]: They were not okay.
[PATIENT]: They were drunk.
[PATIENT]: They just wanted to mess up.
[PATIENT]: That's why they did it.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: It's not about I'm not worthy of love.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[DOCTOR]: Got it.
[DOCTOR]: Know it is how it's not making you feel unlovable or unworthy.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You're becoming more okay in you.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So I want to give you a way of understanding things when it comes to other kind of stuff that happens, because that's all physical stuff.
[DOCTOR]: And then there's other stuff that happens that might have been violent stuff as well or sexual stuff or any of that kind of stuff.
[DOCTOR]: So the first thing is to kind of think about a time.
[DOCTOR]: And I know we talked about a beautiful thing like a lake, but a time that you're outside in nature and you see something really pretty.
[DOCTOR]: And as you're looking at it, you're like in it and it's like, wow, what is it that you see?
[DOCTOR]: but the beautiful mountain and the flowing river yeah and isn't there a moment that as you're seeing the beautiful mountain with that flowing river that you're feeling this sense of all wonder and peace yeah and some people would tell you it is seeing that that gives you these feelings
[DOCTOR]: But what if we looked at it from another lens and we were to say that seeing that and being there drew your awareness down and in towards your center?
[DOCTOR]: And what if at your center, you're always peaceful and excited?
[DOCTOR]: Kind of like if I'm outside at a bonfire and I'm cold and I take my hands and I move them towards the flames and I say, holy cow, the fire is getting hotter.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Is the fire getting hotter or am I becoming more aware of it?
[PATIENT]: Becoming more aware of it.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And so we know that in your life, there have been many times where your awareness has been anywhere but at your center.
[DOCTOR]: In those pains and hurts and angers and upsets and griefs and confusions and...
[DOCTOR]: But no matter where awareness has been, always at your center, you're peaceful and excited.
[DOCTOR]: And you know that two of us are on this Zoom because your senses can bring in the data.
[DOCTOR]: Your intellect understands it.
[DOCTOR]: That's the knowledge of light.
[DOCTOR]: Light of knowledge.
[DOCTOR]: At your center, it's a brighter light of wisdom.
[DOCTOR]: So we have knowledge, we have wisdom.
[DOCTOR]: And you know that I work with all sorts of people who've had all sorts of awful stuff happen to them.
[DOCTOR]: And I remember one girl, her older brother used to take these little like cars, they're called matchbox cars, and drive them up her leg and park them in her.
[DOCTOR]: So she had a lot of yuck around all of that, right?
[DOCTOR]: Makes sense.
[DOCTOR]: But when we worked together, we cleared it all out, all the yuck gone.
[DOCTOR]: And I asked her the question, I go, all that, I go, where was it?
[DOCTOR]: And she looks at me, big smile, and she goes, it's gone, I don't feel it.
[DOCTOR]: I go, I know, isn't that cool?
[DOCTOR]: And she says, it is.
[DOCTOR]: But I go, my question was, where was it?
[DOCTOR]: And when we started thinking, I go, was it at the surface level?
[DOCTOR]: She's like, no, it wasn't intellectual.
[DOCTOR]: I go, maybe it was in your center.
[DOCTOR]: She's like, dude, how could that stuff survive in light?
[DOCTOR]: Or I'm peaceful and excited.
[DOCTOR]: I said, where was it?
[DOCTOR]: And she goes, huh?
[DOCTOR]: Well, it was hiding in the shadows between the lights.
[DOCTOR]: And she says, the lights are now touching.
[DOCTOR]: So the shadow's gone.
[DOCTOR]: And I said, whoa.
[DOCTOR]: And then we started talking about how people tend to over-identify their body as me.
[DOCTOR]: What if you have a body and your body's totally yours, but what if your body isn't you?
[DOCTOR]: What if there's no cell within your body that's the same as it was?
[DOCTOR]: What if they've all been replaced millions and millions of times, just like your feet are longer than they were when you were three?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: Yet despite the changes, you're still you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So let's just say you totally have a body.
[DOCTOR]: It's yours.
[DOCTOR]: But what if it isn't you?
[DOCTOR]: And then we go, oh, well, you also think thoughts.
[DOCTOR]: But what if you're not the thinker of your thoughts?
[DOCTOR]: What if your brain is the thinker of your thoughts and you are not your brain?
[DOCTOR]: Your brain is an organ just like your heart, liver, and lungs.
[DOCTOR]: Yours, not you.
[DOCTOR]: So now you're not your body.
[DOCTOR]: You're not your thoughts.
[DOCTOR]: You can't be how you feel because you feel different ways at different times.
[DOCTOR]: You can't be a feeling.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, well, maybe you are what you do.
[DOCTOR]: But what if you're not what you do because when you did this and then that, you didn't stop existing?
[DOCTOR]: So you can't be what you do.
[DOCTOR]: So the weirder question becomes, if you're not your body, your thoughts, your feelings, or what you do, then what the heck are you?
[DOCTOR]: Weird question, okay?
[DOCTOR]: So just for our purposes, what we're going to say for today is, what if who you are is what you became aware of as you see that mountain and that river?
[DOCTOR]: That in that moment, your awareness was drawn down and into what we think of as the capital S, self, or what certain religions call essence, soul, spirit.
[DOCTOR]: What if the light that is you can't be touched by any of that stuff?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And that's what I was saying to that woman.
[DOCTOR]: I said, you know, you'll never believe it.
[DOCTOR]: I went to this dentist.
[DOCTOR]: She goes, oh, I don't like the dentist.
[DOCTOR]: I go, well, you know, he put my, I sit down in the chair and all of a sudden my head moves down like this.
[DOCTOR]: She's like, yeah, but you're at the dentist.
[DOCTOR]: I go, well, then what?
[DOCTOR]: He takes this big thing above my face and turns this light on.
[DOCTOR]: And now it's blinding me.
[DOCTOR]: I can't see anything.
[DOCTOR]: And she's like, yeah, but you're at the dentist.
[DOCTOR]: I go, well, then he took this cold instrument and shoved it inside of me.
[DOCTOR]: And she's like, oh my goodness.
[DOCTOR]: And you're what?
[DOCTOR]: And I went, my mouth, I'm at the dentist.
[DOCTOR]: But I said the same thing to her with her brother.
[DOCTOR]: I said, when you were little, he really messed with your stuff.
[DOCTOR]: And she looked at me and she said he did.
[DOCTOR]: And for a long time, that screwed up my thinking and it hurt my feelings.
[DOCTOR]: And then she looked at me and she said, but you know what?
[DOCTOR]: And I'm like, what?
[DOCTOR]: And she said, he never touched me.
[DOCTOR]: He messed with my body.
[DOCTOR]: It screwed up my thinking and feeling, but he never touched me.
[DOCTOR]: And there's not even a cell of me that's the same.
[DOCTOR]: And I went, whoa, isn't that cool?
[DOCTOR]: And so notice what happens now as you slightly lower your jaw and you relax your tongue and you breathe a little bit slower and deeper and you exhale a little bit longer and you notice more space and you notice that with your eyes open, you can see what's out in front of you.
[DOCTOR]: You can see me in the screen.
[DOCTOR]: But notice what happens when you close your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: You no longer see me or the screen or anything else that's in front of you, but instead you're seeing just the backs of your eyelids.
[DOCTOR]: When I see the backs of my eyelids, different hues of colors, dark, bright, go ahead and open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: And as you do realize that you see me out in front of you, you see what's in front of you.
[DOCTOR]: Close your eyes again and notice that what you're actually seeing is just the backs of your eyelids.
[DOCTOR]: And so a really unusual question and get curious about it.
[DOCTOR]: What do you actually see behind you?
[DOCTOR]: Because this might surprise you that what you see behind you now is nothing.
[DOCTOR]: You see nothing behind you.
[DOCTOR]: And I wonder what it might be like to drift in nothing.
[DOCTOR]: Because in nothing, everything exists as a potentiality, even though no thing exists.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: And all we're doing is organizing towards a you, right?
[DOCTOR]: who's present, who's clear, who's much more peaceful and lighter and easier on herself, more comfortable in her own skin and more space between her and other people's stuff so there's more freedom for her and how she maneuvers.
[DOCTOR]: All of this is happening inside of you now.
[DOCTOR]: Bring yourself out of nothing and back into now.
[DOCTOR]: And then when you're ready, take a nice big deep breath in.
[DOCTOR]: And a big long exhale.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And again, just check how's your body feeling now.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, what do you notice?
[DOCTOR]: How's your body feeling now?
[PATIENT]: My body is feeling relaxed, but there is, in my heart, there is something.
[DOCTOR]: There is, I know.
[DOCTOR]: See, that part's going to take you back to the experience.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: It's going to take you back to a moment, one of those ones we don't like to think about.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then all you're going to do is stay with me, because I'm more fun than that was.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: As we go through it in a very matter-of-fact and fast way.
[DOCTOR]: So that one happened, you might have been how old and where?
[PATIENT]: I was 12.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
Right.
[PATIENT]: I was at the place of traffickers.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And is this daytime or nighttime?
[PATIENT]: Daytime.
[DOCTOR]: Daytime, right.
[DOCTOR]: And so you're at their location.
[PATIENT]: They told me that I'm there for to do sex work.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: I need to sleep with men every day because that's what my mother said to me.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So that's what they said, right?
[DOCTOR]: Mom sent you and you got to sleep with men every day, right?
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[DOCTOR]: And be here.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how you want.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how you're there.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Get back here.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: I'm more fun.
[DOCTOR]: This is and that shit isn't.
[DOCTOR]: Uh-huh.
[DOCTOR]: And we're getting in really good news.
[DOCTOR]: Right, so they told you all that, right?
[DOCTOR]: Because that's what mom said, right?
[DOCTOR]: Then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: I felt shocked.
[DOCTOR]: Well, yeah, right, but then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: Then I started, like, crying.
[PATIENT]: Right, good, and then what happened?
[PATIENT]: I don't want to do that.
[DOCTOR]: Right, of course, right, and then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: And then... And be here, hi.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Get here.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[DOCTOR]: Get back here.
[PATIENT]: Hi.
[PATIENT]: And I don't want to.
[DOCTOR]: And they're like, it doesn't matter.
[DOCTOR]: You're going to anyway.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: So I told them I don't want to do that.
[PATIENT]: I just want to go home.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: But your mother only sent you here.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You have to be here.
[DOCTOR]: Mom sent you here.
[DOCTOR]: Can't go home.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And be here.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how you're there again.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, we want you here.
[DOCTOR]: Because this is.
[DOCTOR]: There's an aspect of your brain that doesn't know that's over.
[DOCTOR]: You survived it.
[DOCTOR]: You made it through it.
[DOCTOR]: You're okay.
[DOCTOR]: There's an aspect of your brain, by the way, that doesn't know there's not a single cell in your body right now that's the same as any of the cells that were there then.
[DOCTOR]: All those cells have been replaced.
[DOCTOR]: And see, what if the light that is you can't get touched by any of that stuff?
[DOCTOR]: Right, like they mess with your body, hurt your feelings, screwed up your thing.
[DOCTOR]: But what if...
[DOCTOR]: Never touched you.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So the guy told you all of that.
[DOCTOR]: And then did he have you, did he have some guy come and do stuff to your body?
[PATIENT]: Oh, yeah.
[PATIENT]: Not at that moment.
[DOCTOR]: Not at that moment.
[DOCTOR]: So that, then you went off and did something, then that moment ended.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then later on you did something fun.
[DOCTOR]: Like, you know, dance in the rain.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: We're going to go through later, but we're going to get through this one first.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Because you can remember him telling you all that and saying that mom sent you here and that you have to do it because that's what mom sent you to do.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember all that happening.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember hearing that.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember him telling you that you can remember crying and wanting to go.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember all that happening.
[DOCTOR]: You can also remember putting on your headphones.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You start putting on your headphones.
[DOCTOR]: I'm not putting on my headphones.
[PATIENT]: I'm not putting on my headphones.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then stop him from saying all that stuff.
[DOCTOR]: Say he's not saying all that stuff.
[PATIENT]: He's not saying that.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Well, stop me from putting on my shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Say you're not putting on your shirt.
[PATIENT]: You're not putting on your shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then stop mom from doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Say mom's not doing that.
[PATIENT]: Mom's not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then stop it from happening.
[DOCTOR]: Say it's not happening.
[PATIENT]: It's not happening.
[DOCTOR]: So then where is it?
[DOCTOR]: Say it no longer exists.
[PATIENT]: It's no longer exists.
[DOCTOR]: Bingo, which is what we want to get in.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And again, mom doing that, did that have anything to do with you?
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: No, it had to do with mom.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And mom not being well.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And mom probably having some other struggles financially and these people saying that they're going to get her some money.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: Like, there's whatever was going on over there had nothing to do with you.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[DOCTOR]: You didn't know that then.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So we're going to get that in.
[DOCTOR]: But let's think of a time, because we know that that then happened for a period of time.
[DOCTOR]: Where you, where men did different things to your body.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And you can probably even get it that some of the times I was present, some of the times I was out of my body.
[DOCTOR]: Because there wasn't anything for me to do.
[DOCTOR]: They were doing whatever they were doing to my body.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: We can also recognize that those moments are over.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: That it's yours now.
[DOCTOR]: Totally yours.
[DOCTOR]: That you get to decide what happens with your body.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Don't you?
[DOCTOR]: Like if you wanted to be intimate with your boyfriend, you can, but if you don't want to, you don't.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: It's different now than it was then.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, because you have say.
[DOCTOR]: You didn't have say then.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And that stuff happened to your body.
[DOCTOR]: See, the earlier you doesn't know.
[DOCTOR]: So let's think of a time something happened with one of those guys where they might have done something to your body.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And what might have happened?
[DOCTOR]: Here, I'll make it up and you can tell me if I get it right.
[DOCTOR]: Okay, so guy comes over, he's got a clown nose on.
[DOCTOR]: Is that accurate?
[DOCTOR]: No, he didn't have a clown nose, did he?
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right, but you might've gone into a room
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: He might've pulled his pants down.
[DOCTOR]: He might've had you put his penis in your mouth.
[DOCTOR]: He might have pulled your pants down.
[DOCTOR]: He might've put his penis in your vagina or other spots.
[DOCTOR]: He would have done that for a period of time.
[DOCTOR]: Then he would have stopped.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then he would have pulled his clothes back on and then you would have put your clothes back on and then that time would have ended.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then later on you were dancing in the rain or laughing with the girls.
[DOCTOR]: it so we got laughing with the girls we got dancing in the rain right we are getting away we've got that guy leaving we got him stopping right we've got him putting his penis in different places we've got him touching your body we got him coming into that room we got you going into that room we got um them telling you this is what you have to do right and before that you're doing whatever you're doing and again as we go backwards what do you start noticing happening
[PATIENT]: That didn't go away.
[DOCTOR]: Uh-huh.
[DOCTOR]: What didn't go away?
[DOCTOR]: The feelings?
[DOCTOR]: Oh, right.
[DOCTOR]: So be here, hi, first of all.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So let's just check.
[DOCTOR]: You being okay and no longer hurting over what happened then, would that be okay with you?
[DOCTOR]: See, notice how there's a little bit of conflict coming up, feeling like if I'm no longer hurting over what happened to me, then somehow it excuses it.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Somehow it means like they got away with it and it wasn't okay.
[DOCTOR]: And how am I ever going to feel okay about something that wasn't okay?
[DOCTOR]: Follow me with that?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: And see, that's where the conflict shows up.
[DOCTOR]: So the conflict is if I'm okay and no longer hurting, it means what they did was okay.
[DOCTOR]: So I'm going to give you a different example and it's going to be about a situation.
[DOCTOR]: So when I was 12 years old, I got my own basketball court.
[DOCTOR]: Say I was a fortunate kid, I got a basketball court.
[DOCTOR]: My dad somehow used to think of my basketball court as his driveway.
[DOCTOR]: Sometimes he'd park right in the middle of my basketball court.
[DOCTOR]: Now, I knew we had an old car that if you put it in and it would roll down the gradient of the driveway and be out of my court, I'd be able to shoot.
[DOCTOR]: Now, I don't know what was going on with my dad that day.
[DOCTOR]: But when I went to get out of the car, he was standing there and he was screaming at me at such a high decibel.
[DOCTOR]: I couldn't understand what he was doing.
[DOCTOR]: He grabbed me and began to punch me multiple times.
[DOCTOR]: He punched me so hard that it broke my nose.
[DOCTOR]: It's why I've got this lovely bump.
[DOCTOR]: Now, there was so much blood, you could literally wring out my shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Me being okay, me no longer hurting, no longer angry, no longer resentful over what my dad did to me.
[DOCTOR]: Does that in any way, shape or form mean what my dad did to me was okay?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: I get to be okay now, even though that awful thing wasn't.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: got it so let's just check you being okay and no longer pained or hurting over that stuff that happened does that in any way shape or form mean what happened was okay no you get to right you get to be okay now even though that wasn't then
[DOCTOR]: And the thing that we want to remember, no matter how many times something like that happened, the reason that I'm troubled by it is not because it was awful.
[DOCTOR]: I was troubled as it was happening and it was awful.
[DOCTOR]: But the reason I'm troubled right now isn't because that was awful then.
[DOCTOR]: It's because there's a part of my brain that
[DOCTOR]: that doesn't know it's over, I survived it, I'm okay.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[DOCTOR]: So that's what we want to get in is that kind of news.
[DOCTOR]: So now as you check and you think about it, and we think about a particular time, and we know that there was lots of different times and different things and different things that different people did.
[DOCTOR]: And there were certain times that it was easier and certain times that it wasn't as easy and all the other stuff that goes along with that.
[DOCTOR]: But as we think about it now, would it be okay inside of you to no longer be hurting over any of that sexual stuff that happened then?
[DOCTOR]: And as you check, I want you to check, is there any kind of conflict there?
[DOCTOR]: like something about you being at peace now, about that then, is there anything about that that wouldn't be okay with you?
[PATIENT]: Some of the incident?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: There's the time when I said no for,
[PATIENT]: No for to take.
[PATIENT]: No for to do a blowjob.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: So then my brothers, they first started beating me.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: That you're not allowed to say no for anything.
[DOCTOR]: Right, right, right.
[DOCTOR]: So they beat you, right?
[DOCTOR]: And they told you you weren't allowed to say no, right?
[DOCTOR]: And then they stopped beating you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Which was better than when they were beating you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you know that they're not beating you right now.
[PATIENT]: No, they're not.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You're getting free from them now.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You already got free physically.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But now we're getting you free emotionally.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And that's the question.
[DOCTOR]: Would it be okay for you to be free emotionally?
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And they told you that you couldn't say no.
[DOCTOR]: And so then you had to do the thing.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you can remember all of that.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember not wanting to, and then beating you and telling you you had to, and then having to, you can remember all of that happened in the same way that you can remember putting your headphones on.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Stop putting on your headphones.
[DOCTOR]: I'm not putting on my headphones.
[DOCTOR]: I'm not putting on my headphones.
[DOCTOR]: Stop them from doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Say they're not doing that.
[PATIENT]: I'm not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Well, stop them from forcing you.
[DOCTOR]: Say they're not forcing me.
[PATIENT]: They're not forcing me.
[DOCTOR]: Well, stop that from happening.
[DOCTOR]: Go, it's not happening.
[PATIENT]: It's not happening.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: So then where is that moment?
[DOCTOR]: Say it no longer exists.
[PATIENT]: It no longer exists.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And as you get this now, what do you notice happening to those feelings?
[PATIENT]: I just felt in my heart that it is not there.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that interesting?
[PATIENT]: No one is forcing me now and no one is telling me to do anything.
Right.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: You have full say now.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You have full say now.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: What's it like to know now, right, that it's totally on your terms?
[DOCTOR]: Mm-hmm.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, there's a good breath.
[DOCTOR]: What do you notice now?
[PATIENT]: Another incident?
[DOCTOR]: Oh, another one came to mind.
[DOCTOR]: See, beautiful.
[PATIENT]: How cool is this?
[PATIENT]: No, it didn't come.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, but you said another incident.
[PATIENT]: No, I was asking you, like, are you asking about another incident or not?
[DOCTOR]: Well, let's just check.
[DOCTOR]: I want you to think about that now.
[DOCTOR]: And what happens if you close your eyes and you let the earlier you know that you're out of there, that that period of time is over, finished, you survived it, you're okay.
[DOCTOR]: That them doing that to you and making you do that stuff had nothing to do with you because it wouldn't matter whether it was you or somebody else in that situation.
[DOCTOR]: That's how they would have been.
[DOCTOR]: So that the earlier you get it had nothing to do with me.
[DOCTOR]: It's not about me.
[DOCTOR]: Let the earlier you know that you're okay.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know that there's no cell in you now that's the same as when any of that stuff was happening.
[DOCTOR]: It's all been replaced.
[DOCTOR]: That they messed with your stuff, but they never got you.
[DOCTOR]: You really are.
[DOCTOR]: Can't be touched in that way.
[DOCTOR]: They messed with your body, right?
[DOCTOR]: So that she gets it.
[DOCTOR]: What happens to the earlier you is she's realizing it now.
[DOCTOR]: What happens to her face?
[DOCTOR]: Just think of how resilient she is and brave and courageous to make it through all that.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: To become the woman you are now on the way to becoming even more okay in you.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: Take a deep breath.
[DOCTOR]: And then an exhale.
[DOCTOR]: And then open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: And what do you notice?
[PATIENT]: I notice that pain that I have a right.
[PATIENT]: I have right over and control over my body.
[PATIENT]: And that incident, that beating, just stopped in my memory.
[DOCTOR]: It did.
[PATIENT]: It felt like there's no one beating me.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[DOCTOR]: Because we could say a silly, stupid thing.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: And repeat it after me.
[DOCTOR]: I have a nose.
[PATIENT]: I have a nose.
[DOCTOR]: I have two elbows.
[PATIENT]: I have two elbows.
[DOCTOR]: I have 10 fingers.
[PATIENT]: I have 10 fingers.
[DOCTOR]: I have 10 toes.
[PATIENT]: I have 10 toes.
[DOCTOR]: But I'm not my nose.
[PATIENT]: But I'm not my nose.
[DOCTOR]: I'm not my fingers.
[PATIENT]: I'm not my fingers.
[DOCTOR]: I'm not my elbows.
[PATIENT]: I'm not my elbows.
[DOCTOR]: I'm not my toes.
[PATIENT]: Not my toes.
[DOCTOR]: I have a vagina.
[PATIENT]: I have a vagina.
[DOCTOR]: I'm not my vagina.
[PATIENT]: I'm not my vagina.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: It's mine.
[PATIENT]: It's mine.
[DOCTOR]: But it isn't me.
[PATIENT]: It is not me.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So they messed with my stuff.
[PATIENT]: And for a long time, right?
[DOCTOR]: And for a long time, it hurt my feelings and screwed up my thinking and affected a lot of what I did.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, but you know what?
[DOCTOR]: They never touched me.
[DOCTOR]: They mess with my body, but they never got me.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And again, as this gets in, what do you notice happening to those feelings?
[PATIENT]: They started to dissolve.
[DOCTOR]: They started to dissolve?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And started to what?
[DOCTOR]: Dissolve in what?
[PATIENT]: And disappear.
[DOCTOR]: And disappear.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that interesting?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So that you're becoming more okay and more at peace in you.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: More present, more clear, and more wise.
[DOCTOR]: because I heard this from somebody and I'm stealing it.
[DOCTOR]: But they said, trauma, emotional wounds.
[DOCTOR]: So trauma without emotion equals wisdom.
[DOCTOR]: Right, nobody goes through those kinds of challenges on purpose intentionally to become stronger, more resilient.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: But everybody making it through those awful moments have become stronger.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So I want you to check something because this is going to be really interesting and you're going to notice something different for yourself.
[DOCTOR]: So I want you to think about this upcoming, you know, trip.
[DOCTOR]: Where there's a whole group and, you know, those three others, sister, friend, boyfriend, all going with you.
[DOCTOR]: And you know that they've got their own things with each other.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And just even think about that one friend who's like, hey, you know, it really bothers me that you don't reach out to me anymore.
[DOCTOR]: And it seems like it's less since you got a boyfriend.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you hear that from that friend.
[DOCTOR]: First of all, as you're hearing it, what are you noticing inside of you now that's different?
[PATIENT]: I'm not feeling uncomfortable with that.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how you're not feeling like somehow I'm a bad person.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: I'm not responsible for everything.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[PATIENT]: I'm not responsible that you're not good with each other.
[PATIENT]: So it's not my fault.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And some of it, there's nothing for me to do about it.
[DOCTOR]: Or I don't even feel compelled to have to do something.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how different this is.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[DOCTOR]: Because let's just check.
[DOCTOR]: Think about the experiences.
[DOCTOR]: Think about the time with mom and telling you you're this compared to brother.
[DOCTOR]: Think about the time of mom yelling and beating you and chasing you with that thing that they do to fix houses.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: Think about mom and stepdad yelling and hitting you.
[DOCTOR]: Think about stepdad.
[DOCTOR]: Think about those times.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Think about that time when the guy said, hey, you know, your mom sent you here, so you have to do it and you have to stay here.
[DOCTOR]: Think about that time when you didn't want to and they said you can't not want to, so you have to, so we're going to make sure you do.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: When you think about all those right now, what are you noticing?
[PATIENT]: There is no pain on that, but it's felt like, okay, whatever happened, it wasn't okay.
[PATIENT]: But I'm not feeling that.
[PATIENT]: I'm not feeling not okay with that.
[PATIENT]: I know.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You're okay now, even though that stuff that happened then was not okay.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: It's not feeling like it defined you.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: It's no longer feeling like it was a part of you.
[DOCTOR]: We get it.
[DOCTOR]: It's stuff that happened to you and experiences that you went through.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: But notice how they're not running is happening.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: yeah isn't that cool yeah yeah amazing yay right right just notice what you can that's different now yeah
[DOCTOR]: And this is your job in between now and the next time we get together, which will probably be in a few weeks because I want you to have the time to integrate, meaning going through life experiences that normally would trigger up the same kind of stuff that we talked about and noticing what's different for you, even if it's slight or subtle.
[DOCTOR]: So it might be the thing happens and I get the feeling, but it doesn't last as long or it doesn't spike as high.
[DOCTOR]: Or it might be one of those moments where I'm going through it and as I'm in it, I'd be normally like I, and I'm not feeling all of it.
[DOCTOR]: Or I go through the whole experience and I think back about it and be like, hey, normally I would have been all uptight and anxious and I wasn't feeling it.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So what I want you to pay attention to is what are you noticing that's changed already in your life because we now have new programming running.
[DOCTOR]: Meaning those same experiences, those same triggers, those same reminders, those same things don't cause the same internal response in you.
[DOCTOR]: Because once the brain gets that certain things are over, it stops confusing similar as identical.
[DOCTOR]: And it sees it as similar, but also different.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Cool.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: I mean...
[PATIENT]: I will check on that and try to notice those things.
[DOCTOR]: Well, you will not be able to not notice.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Because you're going to be in situations literally that normally would be producing the same kind of troubling emotions and you're not going to be feeling them.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Or if you do feel them, they're going to be way less and they're not going to last as long.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You'll notice being lighter.
[DOCTOR]: You'll notice when somebody does something and it's not pressing that, oh my goodness, it means something about me button, that you have more ease in your interactions with them.
[DOCTOR]: That's what you're going to notice.
Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right, and you're going to notice being much more present.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you might even think to yourself, wow, I was able to talk myself through that so much better, huh?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But it's because I'm not getting activated like I used to.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[PATIENT]: Yes, complete.
[DOCTOR]: Cool.
[DOCTOR]: Well, you did great.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Thank you so much.
[PATIENT]: Thank you so much.
[DOCTOR]: My pleasure.
[PATIENT]: So, so much, you know, lighter.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Before you started the session.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And just check, think about, you know, all the different things with mom.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And try to feel really hurt.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Try to feel like somehow it was my lovability versus mom's not wellness.
[PATIENT]: And notice what's happening.
[PATIENT]: There's less pain.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: We still don't like what mom did.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: We don't.
[DOCTOR]: But we can't get mom to have not done that.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: We can't get it to have not happened.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And we don't have to.
[DOCTOR]: Because what's happening is you're getting free by for the first time seeing it clearly as screwed up stuff about mom.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And the coolest part is once your brain gets that certain experiences are over, it can't go back to thinking it's happening.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you're going to notice that being really different for you.
[DOCTOR]: Cool.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Awesome.
[DOCTOR]: well you did great thank you yeah i'm so excited we got a chance to get together yay yeah and then yeah we'll we'll we'll want you to go out and live life for a few weeks and then melissa will get another time scheduled for us to get together yes awesome very cool almost calling it
[DOCTOR]: Ah, see, tell them I said hi.
[DOCTOR]: I'll talk to you later.
[DOCTOR]: Bye-bye.
