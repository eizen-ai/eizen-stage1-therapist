[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And so you know that we're making a Zoom recording.
[DOCTOR]: And of course, if you're interested, you can have access to that.
[DOCTOR]: And yeah, just want to make sure it's all okay with you.
[PATIENT]: Oh, perfect.
[PATIENT]: It's perfect.
[DOCTOR]: Okay, cool.
[DOCTOR]: So before we get started, one, do you have any questions for me?
[DOCTOR]: I know we spoke a little bit ago.
[DOCTOR]: I know that there's a bunch of different things that have been currently going on, like the migraine stuff was at the forefront of it.
[DOCTOR]: There have been challenges in relationship.
[DOCTOR]: There's been some breakthroughs that you've had and those kinds of things.
[DOCTOR]: So some of that feels settled.
[DOCTOR]: There's also a whole bunch of stuff that has happened.
[DOCTOR]: Although it's over, it's still underneath the surface impacts you.
[DOCTOR]: And it seems like almost always that's on, not always at a severe level, but seems like it's on like lots of the time.
[DOCTOR]: So that's what I'm remembering.
[PATIENT]: that's good memory that's good memory I feel like for me it feels like I worked through so much trauma I feel like I've forgiven blah blah blah you know all the things and the deeper I've gone into myself and the more settled I feel in my being just being it feels like the migraines has gotten worse and worse so
[PATIENT]: it doesn't really make sense for me.
[PATIENT]: I don't know.
[PATIENT]: I know I have had a lot of trauma, but I don't, I don't have things flashing up.
[PATIENT]: I'm not, it's not something I, I know it's not something I think about anyway.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Sure.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So we don't know whether any of what you've gone through has any effect in today.
[PATIENT]: No, no.
[DOCTOR]: And it actually doesn't matter whether it does.
[PATIENT]: No, that's good.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because the purpose of treatment is to get now to work better.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So that's what we want to do.
[DOCTOR]: We want to get you to be more uptime.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Where that thing has turned down in frequency.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: In duration.
[DOCTOR]: In intensity.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: So that there's less and less of that.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: That would be good.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And if there is anything, we want that unplugged and reoriented because one of the things that is really common for people is that they do...
[DOCTOR]: have things processed in a understanding way where they can even give forgiveness to perp for whatever awful thing that person did.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Even though that's there and they know all of that and it's been years inside at a different level, there's still some of that angst or grief or guilt or
[DOCTOR]: still somewhat feels a little bit more like about me, even when I know it wasn't.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: We want that shifted as well.
[DOCTOR]: Because I think what happens lots is we do get the intellectual understanding and put it to rest.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But the emotional understanding is what changes that internal state of
[DOCTOR]: that gets that little bit of angst.
[DOCTOR]: Again, not that I do it all the time, not that it is intrusive all the time, but if I do think about it, if there is, it still has some of that charge.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: We want any of that stuff that's been there discharged.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: So that being said, two things.
[DOCTOR]: One,
[DOCTOR]: What else are we wanting our time to do for you?
[DOCTOR]: And what else would be useful for me to know to understand?
[PATIENT]: Hmm.
[PATIENT]: I don't know.
[PATIENT]: I feel like there is something just generally holding me back.
[PATIENT]: I don't know if it's the migraines that is depleting my energy or if my energy is depleted and I get migraines.
[PATIENT]: I don't know.
[PATIENT]: But I feel like...
[PATIENT]: I have so much more to give to the world and to the community around me.
[PATIENT]: And it feels like something is... Like I'm still not really stepping forward.
[PATIENT]: I've taken so many steps in...
[PATIENT]: Who I am today is so totally different from who I was six, eight years ago.
[PATIENT]: I was always really anxious and worried and had no self-esteem and always hiding and holding myself back.
[PATIENT]: And I've been such a progress.
[PATIENT]: But I still feel like something is...
[PATIENT]: holding me back still.
[DOCTOR]: How do you know when to feel held back by it?
[PATIENT]: It's just not, I don't know.
[PATIENT]: It feels like I could do more, but when I think about doing more, it's almost like I get stopped by migraines or I get stopped by this feeling depleted and always stuff going on.
[PATIENT]: So it doesn't feel like I can progress more in life, in what I love to do.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Okay, so, so, so going back to that weird question, how do you know when to do it?
[DOCTOR]: Feel held back?
[DOCTOR]: Like, where might you be when it happens?
[DOCTOR]: Because you went to broad landscape.
[DOCTOR]: Yes, generally is right.
[DOCTOR]: We want to go, let's think of a situation where might you be?
[DOCTOR]: when it happens where all of a sudden you're feeling like you should be able to be doing more, but somehow you're not.
[DOCTOR]: And then maybe I get a migraine or I just feel drained.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Give me a sense of like what might be going on when that happens.
[PATIENT]: It's, I think it's when I'm thinking of doing more with my work and reaching more people.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: And it's hard to say, it's just like a... So you might be where?
[DOCTOR]: You might be at your desk?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And you're thinking about how do I reach more people or that I need to reach more people?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, it's how do I reach more people?
[DOCTOR]: How do I reach more people, right?
[DOCTOR]: And then what happens next?
[DOCTOR]: And if I see that, um, then do you start getting the migraine or then do you start getting the fatigue?
[PATIENT]: Like, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: How does that happen?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So you say to yourself, okay, I'm at my desk.
[DOCTOR]: I'm sitting there.
[DOCTOR]: I'm feeling okay.
[DOCTOR]: I really want to make a difference.
[DOCTOR]: I want to impact more people.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Like how do I impact more people?
[PATIENT]: And some, something small can happen first.
[PATIENT]: Like I, I have this, I want to reach more people.
[PATIENT]: I love what I do when I want it to
[PATIENT]: help more people.
[PATIENT]: And I love just to talk about it.
[PATIENT]: And, and then I, maybe I see that somebody has unsubscribed from my YouTube channel or something.
[PATIENT]: And I get that.
[PATIENT]: It just feels like it's that knowing I shouldn't be feeling anything, but I do.
[PATIENT]: It feels like I failed in, in that person unsubscribed.
[DOCTOR]: So I lost them.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And because I'm supposed to be the person for all and every everybody's supposed to time everybody all like, you know, billions of 11 billion people are all supposed to be into my shit.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: The way that I present.
[PATIENT]: Like me.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: That sounds good.
[PATIENT]: Can we do that?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: So that feels like somehow a letdown.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And when that happens, does that then like drain the energy?
[DOCTOR]: Is that when you start noticing like the...
[DOCTOR]: headache yeah it's more like draining the energy and the headaches just creep up on me i don't know okay okay so we want to get that to stop yes so that even if that happens yeah it doesn't make you feel down on you yes right like i oh my god i must have not
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Okay, cool.
[DOCTOR]: So we want to get that adjusted.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: And I think the migraines is linked to my relationship because the thing I did with Kira on the retreat, because she asked me, when do I get more migraines and can I see something?
[PATIENT]: And the thing that has been is when...
[PATIENT]: My husband is home because he lives up north as well.
[PATIENT]: So we do back and forth.
[PATIENT]: And when he's home, I get more migraines.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: But now he has had some kind of awakening, but I'm still getting migraines.
[PATIENT]: So it just feels like I don't really trust him yet.
[PATIENT]: So it feels like it's linked to that as well.
[DOCTOR]: Should you trust him?
[PATIENT]: No, not the way he has been, but he hasn't been able to listen to me or prioritize me or just being present in our relationship.
[PATIENT]: He's been all over the place and helping his exes.
[PATIENT]: But now he has seen that and he doesn't want to do that anymore.
[PATIENT]: And I hear when he talks, he's talking from a totally different place.
[PATIENT]: That's cool.
[PATIENT]: Yes, so he has had some kind of awakening because we came to a crossroad when I said that I'm not doing this anymore.
[PATIENT]: I'm starting to see my own worth and I can't live with a person who doesn't see it.
[PATIENT]: But then he got this awakening and I really hear he's talking from a deeper place and he really has a huge sorrow for how he has been treating me.
[DOCTOR]: So he's wanting to be different and you're wanting him to be different.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Which opens up the possibility.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Of you actually staying.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Because it was to the point where you're like, I'm done.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: I don't want to do this anymore.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, I was ready to leave.
[PATIENT]: I thought that's what's going to happen.
[DOCTOR]: I was ready.
[DOCTOR]: Right, you were ready to be done.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And when you finally got to the point that you were ready to be done, he's like, wait a minute, no, I don't want to be done.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: It's the issue with the guy and the gal.
[DOCTOR]: The woman will go, there's a problem here.
[DOCTOR]: And the guy's like, oh, no, no, no problem.
[DOCTOR]: And then time goes by.
[DOCTOR]: And then the woman goes, there's a problem, there's a problem.
[DOCTOR]: And guy's like, no, no, no problem.
[DOCTOR]: Time goes by again.
[DOCTOR]: Woman goes, there's a problem, there's a problem, there's a problem.
[DOCTOR]: She finally gets to the end.
[DOCTOR]: She's like, there's a problem.
[DOCTOR]: I'm done.
[DOCTOR]: He goes, holy shit, there's a problem.
[DOCTOR]: Yes, exactly.
[DOCTOR]: What the hell?
[DOCTOR]: I've been telling you this for the last.
[DOCTOR]: Yes, yes.
[DOCTOR]: That's it.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: And we want to get rid of the notion of trusting him in general, period.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: We want to be trusting in you.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: That you have discernment to see his stuff for his stuff.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And that you're getting your own worth and value so that you're worth it to you.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: To the point that the dynamic changes that he's lucky.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: If I'm going to allow him to spend time with me.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because I'm worth it.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Okay, cool.
[DOCTOR]: All right.
[DOCTOR]: All right.
[DOCTOR]: So that had elevated.
[DOCTOR]: They're still going on, even though there's been a shift in what he said.
[DOCTOR]: And I'm experiencing him a little different in how I've always wanted him to be.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But I don't know whether that's lasting.
[PATIENT]: No.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: And I'm not so sure.
[DOCTOR]: So I'm still a little hesitant with all that.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: And that's for me is a bit strange because I see what you see.
[PATIENT]: Because I can trust myself now.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Because I said stop to this.
[PATIENT]: So I know I can trust myself.
[PATIENT]: But I still get entangled in this not feeling safe or like I can trust him.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Well, that's the problem.
[DOCTOR]: You're thinking that you need to be able to trust him.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: So people ask me that all the time because I tell people I've been married almost 24 years and they go, well, you must trust your wife.
[DOCTOR]: And I say, I don't.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: I don't trust my wife, but I don't not trust my wife.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: So trust is the invisible leg of the table.
[DOCTOR]: It only shows up when there's a lack of it.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Does that make sense?
[PATIENT]: Yes, it makes total sense.
[DOCTOR]: So I don't trust or not trust my wife.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: I watch.
[DOCTOR]: Does she do what she says?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Does her behavior match what her words?
[DOCTOR]: That's what I check.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And over time, I kind of know some of like if she told me, though, that I'm headed to the gym.
[DOCTOR]: And she comes back several hours later, dressed to the nines and smelling like men's cologne.
[DOCTOR]: Should I just believe her?
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: How was the workout, sweetie?
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Like I want my eyes open and my ears tuned in the same way.
[DOCTOR]: If there's a red light and the light turns green, I don't just gun it.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: I look both ways to make sure nobody's running the red.
[DOCTOR]: I'm never going to trust.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Nobody's running a red light.
[DOCTOR]: I'm still going to proceed, but I'm going to look before I do.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, that's smart.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So the trust isn't in the other person and the trust isn't about preventing.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Anything bad from happening.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So I kind of liken trust to an effective fire detector.
[DOCTOR]: Most of the time, I don't notice them at all.
[DOCTOR]: They're not there because someday I know my house is gonna catch on fire and I need them to alert me.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But I'm not naive enough to not have them there thinking this one will never catch on fire.
[PATIENT]: No.
[PATIENT]: Right?
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: They're not there to prevent the fire.
[DOCTOR]: They're there to alert me at the earliest sign of smoke.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So we want you to be more settled and grounded in you.
[DOCTOR]: experiencing and seeing his stuff as his stuff and continuing to check it, do his actions match his words?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And if they don't, does he acknowledge it and own it?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And apologize and recommit.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Because then there's integrity.
[DOCTOR]: Integrity isn't always doing it right.
[PATIENT]: No, no, I get that.
[DOCTOR]: It's in those moments when I don't, I own it.
[DOCTOR]: I apologize for it.
[DOCTOR]: And I recommit.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And now I'm back in integrity.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: All right, cool.
[DOCTOR]: So there's that.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: What else?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: What else?
[DOCTOR]: Angelica, what else?
[PATIENT]: What else?
[PATIENT]: I don't know.
[PATIENT]: I don't know if there's something more.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: So then what we're wanting is we're wanting a you who's much more emotionally present.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And experiencing other people's emotional stuff as being about them.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So it's not making you feel so much about you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: that there is space and room in between you and their stuff.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: We want you to be much more centered, grounded, and uptime outwardly focused so that you're not spending much time in self-analysis or trying to figure yourself out.
[PATIENT]: Oh, that's good.
[DOCTOR]: Instead, you're present.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You're much more okay and comfortable in your own skin.
[DOCTOR]: the effect of that prior unplugged and gone, and your brain reorganized in such a way that it's serving you more.
[DOCTOR]: So that the frequency, the intensity, and the duration, even if you get them, are way, way, way less.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So this is the you that I'm seeing.
[DOCTOR]: The question isn't the how it's going to happen.
[DOCTOR]: It's the would it be okay?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, it would be.
[DOCTOR]: It would be okay.
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: So we've got a green light to organize your brain towards it.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[DOCTOR]: So now that we've got a green light, we're going to do a couple processes that start to put your body into the right states for healing.
[DOCTOR]: The right states for healing are always states of rest.
[DOCTOR]: It's like colds, flus, and surgery.
[DOCTOR]: We tell people to do the same thing, which is get rest.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And so we've got these really cool tools that neuroscientists discovered by putting fMRI scanners on people's brains.
[DOCTOR]: And the first lever, it sounds silly, is to slightly lower the jaw.
[DOCTOR]: So not drop like ah, but just a little bit like ah.
[DOCTOR]: When you slightly lower your jaw, it stimulates that vagus nerve.
[DOCTOR]: That comes out of the brain and connects to the vital organs in the body.
[DOCTOR]: As it's being stimulated, it starts to move the body towards more of a parasympathetic response.
[DOCTOR]: The second lever is you're going to relax the back of your tongue so it rests at the bottom of your mouth.
[DOCTOR]: Your jaw slightly lowers.
[DOCTOR]: You relax the back of your tongue.
[DOCTOR]: It rests at the bottom of your mouth.
[DOCTOR]: When you do this, it begins to satiate the body and it helps to turn down internal dialogue.
[DOCTOR]: The third lever is you're going to breathe, but it'll be an intentional breath in a way that's a little bit slower and deeper than how you automatically breathe.
[DOCTOR]: And then a little bit longer on the way out than how you automatically breathe.
[DOCTOR]: So your jaw is slightly lowered.
[DOCTOR]: You're resting your tongue at the bottom of your mouth.
[DOCTOR]: You're breathing now a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out.
[DOCTOR]: And you'll notice that as you're attending to your breathing, slower and deeper in, slightly longer on the way out.
[DOCTOR]: what do you start noticing happening in your body?
[DOCTOR]: Feeling more tense or more calm?
[PATIENT]: More calm.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So then the next lever is when we're highly stressed, anxious, agitated, irritated, at states of unease, we're at highly elevated beta waves.
[DOCTOR]: So beta waves are fine.
[DOCTOR]: They're what we're in for waking state.
[DOCTOR]: Conversation, focus, communication, arithmetic, social interaction, all great.
[DOCTOR]: But when it elevates, it escalates.
[DOCTOR]: It runs at a much higher hertz.
[DOCTOR]: It's where all the anxiety, agitation, irritation, fresh, angst, worry, upset, anger live.
[DOCTOR]: And what it literally causes, Angelica, is a tunneling or a narrowing of our vision.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: We want to be moving your brainwaves down beta into higher end of alpha.
[DOCTOR]: alpha brainwaves are correlated with what surfers think of as flow or athletes call being in the zone, alert, aware, relaxed.
[DOCTOR]: And what it's highly correlated also with is an expanding of our awareness, so that we notice more with our peripheral vision.
[DOCTOR]: So how it works again is you slightly lower your jaw,
[DOCTOR]: You relax the back of your tongue so it's resting at the bottom of your mouth.
[DOCTOR]: You breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer, right?
[DOCTOR]: As you're breathing in this way, you can look out and see me and my nose.
[DOCTOR]: You stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers.
[DOCTOR]: Stay looking at my nose as my fingers move out beyond the screen so that with the sides of your eyes, you begin to pick up the space more towards the sides of the room.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Notice the space between you and the screen.
[DOCTOR]: And even the space beyond the screen.
[DOCTOR]: The space that's underneath you.
[DOCTOR]: The space that's behind you.
[DOCTOR]: And the space that's above your head.
[DOCTOR]: And again, as you're checking inside, noticing more of the space, how's your body feeling now?
[PATIENT]: Relaxed.
[DOCTOR]: It is.
[DOCTOR]: And then the last little one, have you ever heard the phrase, maybe used it yourself, I'm under a lot of stress?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And in order for somebody to be underneath stress, where must the stress be?
[PATIENT]: Above.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: So we know the reversal is to get out from under and to rise up above.
[DOCTOR]: Having a different metaphor of bird's eye view.
[DOCTOR]: And what does that mean?
[DOCTOR]: I'm up above.
[DOCTOR]: I'm able to see everything as being underneath and below me.
[DOCTOR]: But not just a bird that might be perched in a tree.
[DOCTOR]: A bird that's able to soar and glide and fly.
[DOCTOR]: moving through the space of the sky, all up above and over it.
[DOCTOR]: So one more time, your jaw is slightly lowered.
[DOCTOR]: You relax.
[DOCTOR]: Your tongue, it rests at the bottom of your mouth.
[DOCTOR]: You breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out.
[DOCTOR]: As you breathe in this way, you see me and my nose, you see my fingers, they move all the way out.
[DOCTOR]: You notice more of the space towards the sides, in between, underneath, behind, and up above, and how the space goes beyond the room that you're in, literally all the way out.
[DOCTOR]: outer space and beyond its endless space.
[DOCTOR]: As you're noticing more of the space, go ahead and close your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: And now with your eyes closed, imagine floating up and out of your body, beyond the ceiling, beyond the roof, so that you rise way up above it all in the sky.
[DOCTOR]: You're having this bird's eye view of seeing everything as being underneath and below you.
[DOCTOR]: Because you are above and over it.
[DOCTOR]: And just like a bird free.
[DOCTOR]: To soar and glide and fly.
[DOCTOR]: Up above.
[DOCTOR]: Through the expanse of the sky.
[DOCTOR]: In any direction.
[DOCTOR]: And in all ways.
[DOCTOR]: Big wide arching turns and curves.
[DOCTOR]: You soar.
[DOCTOR]: You fly.
[DOCTOR]: You glide.
[DOCTOR]: You move.
[DOCTOR]: You're free.
[DOCTOR]: Bring your awareness back down and into your body to re-associate inside of you.
[DOCTOR]: When you're ready, take a nice deep breath in.
[DOCTOR]: Long exhale and open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: And again, in those short moments, eyes were closed.
[DOCTOR]: What did you notice within yourself?
[PATIENT]: Just felt free.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And calm.
[DOCTOR]: And calm.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that a nice feeling to have?
[PATIENT]: It is.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And as your body's feeling free and calm, there's a couple pieces of explanation.
[DOCTOR]: So what I'm going to do next is I'm going to explain in more detail how the programming gets installed in us.
[DOCTOR]: Because what I'm going to suggest to you is that there's some faulty wiring in your system.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: The wiring isn't you, Angelica.
[DOCTOR]: You don't like having those migraines.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: You don't like having that uneasiness.
[DOCTOR]: You don't like having those reactions.
[DOCTOR]: So if you don't like it, you're not the problem.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, true.
[DOCTOR]: What's been problematic has been glitches and errors in the way that your supercomputer brain has been working.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And that's what we wanna tune up.
[DOCTOR]: We wanna keep all of the ways that your brain developed that had you survive and move through different situations.
[DOCTOR]: We want all of that to stay intact.
[DOCTOR]: However, we don't want it bleeding on because we get that some of the programming that got installed in this present moment doesn't serve me like it did in that one.
[DOCTOR]: Like it's not the right solution for this thing, but yet it's the one that comes up for me.
[DOCTOR]: Do you follow me with that?
[DOCTOR]: It's that old adage of, you know, if all I have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So think of there's old patterns and old programming in you that needs updating.
[DOCTOR]: And that's what we want to do.
[DOCTOR]: Your unconscious, so meaning your back brain, the part that beats your heart, directs your emotions, your limbic system, all the automatic stuff, that part of your brain has been with you your entire life.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That part of your brain is a warehouse of everything you've ever gone through, the good, the bad, the ugly.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So that part of your brain knows even more than you do.
[DOCTOR]: whatever experiences, big or small, long time ago, recent, one time, many time, would be useful to unplug.
[DOCTOR]: It may be unplugging because there's just an aspect of it that's still hooked.
[DOCTOR]: Maybe lots of it has already been, but there's a part of it that is still the hook on it.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: I don't know what those moments are going to be.
[DOCTOR]: You probably have an idea.
[DOCTOR]: Your unconscious knows even more.
[DOCTOR]: The second thing to that is your unconscious is the part of you that's been healing you your whole life.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: So anytime you've had a cut, if you've broken a bone, anytime you've had a bloody, anytime you've had any kind of injury or ailment, any kind of sickness, any kind of, your unconscious, your body has been doing the healing on its own inside of you.
[DOCTOR]: So I say all of that to let you know that your unconscious knows how to heal itself, how to rewire, and what moments would be useful to get unplugged so that the brain rewires and optimizes to now.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: The second part to that is it's an error in the way that your brain is working.
[DOCTOR]: not you.
[DOCTOR]: And the reason that your brain has errors is that we've got a turbocharged intellectual part that's highly rational, reasonable, and logical and has access to time.
[DOCTOR]: And the other component that works more like an animal's brain who's timeless and is always in now.
[DOCTOR]: So the problem is typically a timing error.
[DOCTOR]: Because the part of your brain that directs emotions is the same as it is for an animal, any animal.
[DOCTOR]: Animals, Angelica, don't have emotions because their brains are concerned about their mood or their affect or their level of esteem or whether they feel lovable or good enough.
[DOCTOR]: It causes emotion to motivate them to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem.
[DOCTOR]: It's really basic and simple.
[DOCTOR]: When the rabbit sees the fox, the brain makes it experience fear to get it to run, not because it wanted it to have a bad day.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: The squirrel's tail gets caught in the fire pain, but not because it wants the squirrel to hate itself and feel like a stupid idiot for getting too close to the fire.
[DOCTOR]: Now it's marred.
[DOCTOR]: No other squirrel's going to want me.
[DOCTOR]: I'm never going to fight it.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: It's just simple.
[DOCTOR]: Get the freaking tail out of the fire.
[DOCTOR]: So the craziest thing for us to even comprehend sometimes is what if all of the negative emotions we experience, that hurt, that anger, that sadness, that sorrow, that grief, that guilt, that shame, that regret, the remorse, the angst, the upset, the worries, the pains, what if all those emotions are being caused by the same part of our brain?
[DOCTOR]: For the same reason, to motivate us to do something, get something to stop or solve a problem.
[DOCTOR]: The major error is that many times our brain continues to make us feel bad, trying to get us to solve a problem that we can't freaking solve.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Which is why we feel bad over and over about the same kinds of things.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Good news, really good news.
[DOCTOR]: Many of the things that we still feel bad about are in one of two places.
[DOCTOR]: either A, in time periods that no longer exist, or B, in time periods that haven't happened yet.
[DOCTOR]: So in both of those two instances, there's nothing to be done.
[DOCTOR]: So instead of trying to solve the problem, it's an updating of the timing.
[DOCTOR]: Timing is the error that only affects us with negative.
[DOCTOR]: Because somebody telling us about a wonderful trip that they had to, I don't know, Hawaii.
[DOCTOR]: When they were there, they walked on black sand beaches.
[DOCTOR]: They got to see the whales in the ocean.
[DOCTOR]: They went surfing.
[DOCTOR]: They saw an active volcano.
[DOCTOR]: They went into the rainforest.
[DOCTOR]: They tell us all about the wonderful experience they had.
[DOCTOR]: But you and I both know that when they're talking to us about it, they know the difference between the memory of doing it and doing it.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: It's not the same thing.
[DOCTOR]: The problem is all the negative moments.
[DOCTOR]: And again, it doesn't matter whether it's a big one or a little one.
[DOCTOR]: It doesn't matter whether it was a long time ago or recent.
[DOCTOR]: It doesn't matter whether it was one time or many times.
[DOCTOR]: And even the negative shit, the weird, the bad, the awful, the sad, the scary, the confusing, the upsetting, the horrific, the catastrophic, the traumatic, our brain freezes it, doesn't know it's over, and has the tendency to confuse the memory of it thinking it is it.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Which explains why the guy is telling us about getting mugged and gets to the part where the guy's got him by the collar and there's a knife at his throat.
[DOCTOR]: All of a sudden, his face has gone white.
[DOCTOR]: His voice is choked.
[DOCTOR]: His arms tremble and shake and he's got a tear.
[DOCTOR]: You and I are kind, nice people.
[DOCTOR]: We were just listening to him.
[DOCTOR]: What the is happening with him?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And we all say, oh, no, he's reliving it.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But what's happening is part of his brain is confusing the memory, thinking it's the experience.
[DOCTOR]: That's why he's having that reaction.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[DOCTOR]: We can tell it was affecting him when he told us, but that's because we saw it.
[DOCTOR]: It was also affecting him over the weekend when he was out on the golf course with his buddies.
[DOCTOR]: It was under the surface.
[DOCTOR]: Up here, he knows, safe, he survived, he's okay, there's no knife.
[DOCTOR]: Problem is that part never got the good news.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Got it.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So with that part stuck, my brain does a second thing.
[DOCTOR]: And this affects all of us all the time.
[DOCTOR]: Little kids across cultures are lied to by adults, by the stories, by the TV shows, by the books, by the fables, by the fairy tales, everything engineered to who lie to children.
[DOCTOR]: One big lie.
[DOCTOR]: Life is good when you're good.
[DOCTOR]: Good things happen.
[DOCTOR]: We want our kids to grow up to be good.
[DOCTOR]: We tell them that when they're good, good things happen.
[DOCTOR]: And we reinforce it with the TV shows and the books and the games.
[DOCTOR]: And once a year, Santa and all the other stuff that goes along with, look, see what happens when you're good, good things happen.
[DOCTOR]: Which that reinforces that kid from birth until about age seven.
[DOCTOR]: That's what all gets installed.
[DOCTOR]: And of course, if that's what got installed, that good happens when I'm being good, then the opposite also has to be true.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: If it's bad, it must have been my fault.
[DOCTOR]: If it was bad because I did something wrong.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: If it was bad, it must have had something to do with me.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Does that make sense?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: So with all of the negative experiences, what gets triggered into it as well is somehow that meant something about me, but not me, my behavior, me, my freaking identity, like me, like a core lovability, good enough.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And that happens all the time.
[DOCTOR]: So the little kid whose parent doesn't show up to the big game that he was supposed to come to, the little kid doesn't think, Oh, that's because my parents are drunk and alcoholic.
[DOCTOR]: They miss out on me scoring the goals.
[DOCTOR]: No, it's, Oh my goodness.
[DOCTOR]: If I was more lovable, if I mattered to them, if I was worth it, they would be.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: That's what gets stuck.
[DOCTOR]: Or the girl who had gone out on a date and the guy was one of her co-workers' friends.
[DOCTOR]: It was a decent date.
[DOCTOR]: It was a nice time, but it wasn't her kind of guy.
[DOCTOR]: So as he dropped her off at the apartment, she kissed him on the cheek.
[DOCTOR]: They talked for a few moments.
[DOCTOR]: He said to her, hey, do you mind if I use your restroom?
[DOCTOR]: I got a half an hour drive.
[DOCTOR]: Hey, no worries.
[DOCTOR]: He goes in, he does.
[DOCTOR]: She had no idea that when he got out, he was going to violently attack and rape her, which is horrible.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But worse is what she's telling me and you, she's saying things like, you know, I was so stupid.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: No matter, I never should have let him in.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Thinking what?
[DOCTOR]: It was a guy that was a coworker.
[DOCTOR]: You'd let him use your what?
[DOCTOR]: But again, because it was bad.
[DOCTOR]: Somehow I am at fault.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then once that gets stuck in that way, my brain in a hypervigilant and super sensitive and always aroused way, scans sorts and searches for anything I went through that was painful.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: The problem is that similar gets confused as identical.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: I use the example of the soldier diving on the ground after the firework burst, but not because he doesn't know he's at a 4th of July celebration.
[DOCTOR]: He's the dude that lit the
[DOCTOR]: yeah it's a completely different part of his brain confused the sound and thought it was a grenade yeah does that make sense yes it makes right the guy's making out with the gal he's into her she's into him it's feeling really good her hand starts to slide up his inner thigh and he he's like what the heck is wrong with me the girl who i want to be with is touching me in a way that should feel good to me and i yeah there's no similarity
[DOCTOR]: To his uncle when he was 11.
[DOCTOR]: Of course, it's a hand.
[DOCTOR]: It's on my inner thigh.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, but that was dainty female hand with pretty fingernails.
[DOCTOR]: But the brain will confuse it.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And it will confuse things that also co-occurred.
[DOCTOR]: So it's not uncommon for survivors that I work with to drive by a hotel and get triggered.
[DOCTOR]: Of course, the issue wasn't the hotel or even the hotel room.
[DOCTOR]: It was what was happening in the room.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But because they co-occurred, that's what got merged.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Does that make sense?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: So the big error in the human brain is a timing error where certain things got set up and the brain doesn't know that they're over.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Anywhere those moments are, energy is ongoingly being used within the body.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: So we're normally when we think of things, oh, this conscious thing is because of that thing.
[DOCTOR]: When I take care of that thing, it will take care of this thing.
[DOCTOR]: That's not how it works in the body.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Because if it worked in a known way, then it wouldn't be coming out of the place of not knowing.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So how things heal is the body with any of those moments, because it doesn't matter what it is or how I might logically think, how could that even connect to any of what I'm dealing with?
[DOCTOR]: We're not asking you to put the pieces together.
[DOCTOR]: No, that's good.
[DOCTOR]: See, what we created is we went, hey, here we go.
[DOCTOR]: We have a future you.
[DOCTOR]: A you who's present, who's much more at peace and much more okay, much more grounded so that she's trusting in herself that she has discernment and that she notices at the earliest signs so that she has the most amount of options.
[DOCTOR]: she's seeing things clearly.
[DOCTOR]: The effect of the prior unplugged, the intensity, duration, frequency, or even if has turned way, way, way down.
[DOCTOR]: So it's much easier for her to be present.
[DOCTOR]: And when she thinks about making a bigger impact, she's thinking about what is the smallest thing
[DOCTOR]: next step that's towards it versus trying to take all of it on at the same time.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, that's good.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, that's good.
[DOCTOR]: So one more time, slightly lower your jaw, relax your tongue, breathe in a way, right, that's a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out.
[DOCTOR]: Notice that as you're causing your breath to happen, it's different than unconscious breath.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: As you're breathing in this way, notice more space.
[DOCTOR]: As you notice more space, close your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: Notice that with your eyes closed, you no longer see me in the screen.
[DOCTOR]: You absolutely sense the space all around you.
[DOCTOR]: As you're noticing the space, it goes all the way out in an endless way.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Noticing more and more of the space, checking in once again with your body.
[DOCTOR]: How's your body feeling now?
[PATIENT]: Relaxed.
[DOCTOR]: It is.
[DOCTOR]: And you can open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: So then the next thing, once we have an understanding of that, we also want to have an understanding of how do we unplug memory?
[DOCTOR]: Because the idea is when somebody remembers something, even if it's a little bit, they kind of tend to float back into it.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That tends to be the thing that happens.
[DOCTOR]: They float back into it.
[DOCTOR]: So the outcome then is, well, how do we want you to be?
[DOCTOR]: We want you to intend to be emotionally with me.
[DOCTOR]: The reason that you want to be emotionally with me right now here is because this is what's happening.
[DOCTOR]: And none of that shit is.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: I'm a happening guy.
[DOCTOR]: This is what's happening.
[DOCTOR]: That's not happening.
[DOCTOR]: So we want you to intend to be here with me.
[DOCTOR]: My job is to keep you here with me.
[DOCTOR]: So if you start to float into any, then we're all about unplugging, getting you back here.
[DOCTOR]: Two, when somebody goes through a moment, we want to go through it in a very matter of fact way, in a minute or less, and simply saying the facts.
[DOCTOR]: That happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, then it was over.
[DOCTOR]: And with all and any of that stuff, there have been things afterwards in your life that
[DOCTOR]: you've done that were more fun than some of those sucky moments yes right so what's something recent angelica that you've done that was way more enjoyable than one of those sucky moments um attending the retreat yeah attending the retreat way more enjoyable right good something else yeah um yeah i was laughing with my girls the other day laughing with your girl right that thing right and one other thing
[PATIENT]: One more thing.
[PATIENT]: I had a really beautiful conversation with a friend.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So we got a beautiful conversation with a friend.
[DOCTOR]: We've got laughing with your girls.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And we've got being at the retreat.
[DOCTOR]: All of those experiences happened after.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Wherever moments freeze, there's that part that doesn't know anything beyond.
[DOCTOR]: So that's part of the good news that we have to get in.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: Where therapy got it wrong, process get it out.
[DOCTOR]: No, no, no.
[DOCTOR]: We want to get in and unplug.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: We want the brain to get the good news, one, that it's over, that it's finished, that it no longer exists, that I survived it, that I'm okay.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Because in moments of real distress, I wasn't sure I was going to be okay.
[DOCTOR]: In the same way, when the moment of rabbit running for its life as fox is chasing it,
[DOCTOR]: yeah there are no future thoughts for rabbit no there are no thoughts about the rendezvous plan with the cute bunny the next no right no thoughts about a carrot it's fox without end yeah right got it yeah yeah so any questions about those two things
[PATIENT]: No, it's crystal clear.
[DOCTOR]: It makes sense.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So one more time, go ahead and slightly lower your jaw, relax your tongue, breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out.
[DOCTOR]: Notice that as you're breathing in this way, you can see me and my nose, my fingers, they go out.
[DOCTOR]: You notice more space.
[DOCTOR]: As you notice more space, close your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: With your eyes closed, imagine floating up and out of your body, beyond the ceiling and the roof, you're way, way, way up above it all in the sky.
[DOCTOR]: Everything is underneath and below you.
[DOCTOR]: You're above, you're over it, free to soar through the expanse of the sky in every direction.
[DOCTOR]: Big, wide, arching turns and curves, you soar, you fly, you glide.
[DOCTOR]: to be becoming even more of who you really are, beginning to lighten up on you.
[DOCTOR]: And because your unconscious knows more than you do and has been listening to the conversations we've been having, your unconscious knows which moments would be useful to bring to your awareness and in which order.
[DOCTOR]: your unconscious is gonna travel back down the timeline and begin to pluck those moments and experiences and then narrow and pinpoint a particular moment so that as you bring your awareness back down and into your body, your unconscious brings that moment to your awareness so that as you take a nice, big, deep breath in,
[DOCTOR]: You can exhale and open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: And what moment comes to mind?
[DOCTOR]: Huh, that one.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[DOCTOR]: That one happened like how long ago?
[DOCTOR]: You might have been how old?
[PATIENT]: I may have been eight.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[DOCTOR]: And so the feelings, as you think about that, are feelings of what?
[DOCTOR]: Is it hurt, sadness, grief, guilt, shame, regret, remorse, angst, anger, combination?
[PATIENT]: Shame.
[PATIENT]: Shame.
[DOCTOR]: Shame.
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: So first question, would it be okay to get the shame gone?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: And if the shame is gone, does it in any way, shape or form mean what you went through was okay?
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You get to be okay now, even though that wasn't.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you're not, here's the funny part.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how you're feeling a little bit of it now.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: I want you to be here.
[DOCTOR]: I'm more fun.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You're not feeling those feelings now because that was awful then.
[DOCTOR]: That sounds crazy, but you're only feeling them because part of your brain doesn't know that that ended.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And you're okay.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So when that moment happened, you were about eight.
[DOCTOR]: When it happened, you were where?
[PATIENT]: In my bedroom.
[DOCTOR]: So you're in the bedroom.
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: Was it daytime or nighttime?
[PATIENT]: Nighttime.
[DOCTOR]: Nighttime.
[DOCTOR]: And like you're in bed sleeping?
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: You were laying in bed.
[PATIENT]: I was laying in bed.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So you were laying in bed and then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: And my brother and cousin were in the same room.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So they, they were in the room, right?
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[DOCTOR]: How are you doing right now, by the way?
[PATIENT]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how you're going there a little bit.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, I feel it.
[DOCTOR]: Hi, I want you back here with me.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Just feel shame talking about it.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So I want you to be back here with me because I'm fun.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: I'm here.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: This is.
[PATIENT]: It feels hard to talk about it.
[DOCTOR]: It is.
[DOCTOR]: This is the first one.
[DOCTOR]: Watch what starts to happen.
[DOCTOR]: Be here.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: You're doing really big healing work.
[DOCTOR]: There's really good news.
[DOCTOR]: To get in, because you as the adult, you know that the earlier you wasn't wrong or bad.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: No, but she doesn't know that.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: So first we want her to know that the moment is over.
[DOCTOR]: And then we want to get in the good news that it wasn't about her.
[DOCTOR]: And then we want to let her know who she gets to become you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Which is really cool for her.
[PATIENT]: That's good.
[DOCTOR]: I know.
[DOCTOR]: So that she gets to know about laughing with her girls.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because she doesn't know that yet.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: She doesn't.
[DOCTOR]: So it's really good news to get in.
[DOCTOR]: So they're in the room.
[DOCTOR]: It's dark.
[DOCTOR]: It's nighttime.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: My brother and my cousin wanted me to come to them.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So they motioned you to come over.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[DOCTOR]: And they be here.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: Hi.
[DOCTOR]: They did what?
[DOCTOR]: They grabbed you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: They wanted to touch your body.
[DOCTOR]: They had you touch their body.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So they had you touch them.
[DOCTOR]: They might've had you put their penis in your mouth.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Different parts of your body.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then what might've happened next?
[PATIENT]: I didn't really want to do it.
[DOCTOR]: Of course not.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: But you were doing it because choice.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: I don't remember.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how you did it.
[DOCTOR]: Perfect.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, my goodness.
[DOCTOR]: This is the coolest thing in the world.
[DOCTOR]: Wait till you get this.
[DOCTOR]: It's the coolest thing in the world.
[DOCTOR]: I promise.
[DOCTOR]: You stopped.
[DOCTOR]: The story stopped at the worst fucking moment.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Well, eventually what happened is they stopped.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And then they left the room.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then it was over.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then eventually you went to bed.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then later on, you were having that really cool talk with your friend where you were laughing with your girls.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Or you were having that really great time at the retreat.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Notice here's the cool thing.
[DOCTOR]: As you were telling me about it, there was some discomfort.
[DOCTOR]: It was less as you were intending to be here.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: The cool part is we never go backwards with a memory.
[DOCTOR]: But when you go backwards, it unplugs the memory.
[DOCTOR]: It takes away the charge.
[DOCTOR]: So we're going to go backwards.
[DOCTOR]: So we got being at the retreat.
[DOCTOR]: We got laughing with your girls.
[DOCTOR]: We got having that really cool conversation with your friend.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then they were gone.
[DOCTOR]: And then it had stopped.
[DOCTOR]: And then they had been touching your body and having you touch their body.
[DOCTOR]: And then they'd motioned you over.
[DOCTOR]: And then you were laying dead.
[DOCTOR]: And then they'd come in.
[DOCTOR]: And then before that, you had gone.
[DOCTOR]: And then before that, you were doing whatever you were doing.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: As I ran through it backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it?
[DOCTOR]: Fine.
[DOCTOR]: I know.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that crazy?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Cause your brain is reading it as data about something that happened, not happening.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Third, the emotional part of our brain does not get logic, but it does get patterns of association.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And the error for all memories is that the memory of what happened and the experience of it happening have been glued.
[DOCTOR]: But there are things that you can remember doing today that you know you're not doing right now.
[DOCTOR]: For example, putting on your pink shirt.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember doing it.
[DOCTOR]: You can probably remember where you were when you did it.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: But if I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting on your pink shirt, and then I went, Angelica, stop putting on your shirt.
[DOCTOR]: You would look at me and go, I'm not putting on my shirt.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Because you know, there's a crystal clear difference between the memory of you doing it and you doing it.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: They're not the same thing.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Got it.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember that happening.
[DOCTOR]: Them coming in, them motioning you over, them doing all that stuff to your body and having you do that stuff.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember all that happening.
[DOCTOR]: You can also remember putting on your pink shirt.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Angelica, stop putting on your shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Say, I'm not putting on my shirt.
[PATIENT]: I'm not putting on my shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then stop me from putting on my shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Say, you're not putting on your shirt.
[DOCTOR]: You're not putting on your shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then you stop combing your hair.
[DOCTOR]: Say, I'm not combing my hair.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, I'm not combing my hair.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then stop me from brushing my teeth.
[DOCTOR]: Say you're not brushing your teeth.
[DOCTOR]: You're not brushing your teeth.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then stop them from doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Say they're not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: They're not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Stop them from touching your body like that.
[DOCTOR]: Say they're not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: They're not touching me.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Stop them from having you touch their body.
[DOCTOR]: Say they're not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: They're not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then you stop doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Say, I'm not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: I'm not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Then where is it?
[DOCTOR]: Say, it no longer exists.
[DOCTOR]: It doesn't exist.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And as this gets in again, what do you notice happening to those feelings?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that interesting?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Now, the last little part to this, that earlier you thought them doing that had something to do with you.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Did it have anything to do with you?
[DOCTOR]: no no would it have mattered whether it was you in that situation or some other girl your age with those two guys isn't that what they would have done yes got it yeah so what we know is that had nothing to do with you yeah had everything to do with what was off with them yeah earlier you didn't know that so why don't you repeat these four words after me here we go it's it's not
[DOCTOR]: not about about me me right it's not no it's not about me that's right now close your eyes and picture the earlier you letting her know that experience it's over finished completed defeated it no longer exists let her know that you're okay let her know that them doing that had nothing to do with you and everything to do with what was off with them it's not about me let her know
[DOCTOR]: about laughing with her girls and having that cool talk with her friend.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know about being at that workshop.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know so that she's getting it.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know that there's no part of her body that's the same as it was then.
[DOCTOR]: So even though they messed with my stuff, they didn't actually touch me.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: As she starts to get all of this information, what do you notice happening to the earlier you?
[PATIENT]: Oh, she relaxes.
[DOCTOR]: She does, doesn't she?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how she's no longer stuck there.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And you can open.
[DOCTOR]: I know.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how that's not hurting.
[DOCTOR]: Not that you didn't already forgive it.
[DOCTOR]: Not that you didn't already go.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Like I get it.
[DOCTOR]: And it's.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Notice now.
[DOCTOR]: What do you notice different?
[PATIENT]: It's just more free.
[DOCTOR]: You are, aren't you?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: More free.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: That no longer has a hold of you.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: We still know that it happened.
[DOCTOR]: We still don't like it that it happened.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Follow me?
[DOCTOR]: No, no.
[DOCTOR]: But notice how it's not creating any ickiness.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And that is the energy getting released.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: As it's getting redirected.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Towards other healing.
[DOCTOR]: Your mind is responding.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So again, as we're organizing towards the future, you...
[DOCTOR]: who's present, who's clear, who's got that distance and space between her and other stuff, who's much more okay and comfortable, right?
[DOCTOR]: Seeing and aware, present, right?
[DOCTOR]: As we're organizing towards this you again, your unconscious will travel back down the timeline of those experiences and bring another moment that would be useful for us to unplug
[DOCTOR]: hmm yeah what comes to mind now it's not a clear memory it isn't that clear yet is it no no but you might have bound around what age um maybe
[DOCTOR]: teenager yeah so you might have been around being a teen right and then again what might have happened because here's the cool part it will be structurally similar enough for the brain to unplug it just uh so you might have been a teen you might have been where and what might have happened
[PATIENT]: I was home, feeling like I have let my mother down.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So you're home and you're feeling bad.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Because earlier mom was upset over something you did or didn't do.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, she moved.
[DOCTOR]: Mom had moved?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, she moved out one day without telling me.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, good.
[DOCTOR]: So you came home and mom wasn't there.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you're like, where the hell did mom go?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[DOCTOR]: So you're home, you're by yourself.
[DOCTOR]: Mom's not there.
[DOCTOR]: Then what happened?
[PATIENT]: I find my brother who says that my mother has moved.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So mom moved.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: And then I had to live by myself.
[DOCTOR]: Well, so mom moved and then you did whatever you did.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Got some food.
[DOCTOR]: Watch some TV.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then that was over.
[DOCTOR]: You lived however you lived for, then it was over.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then later on you did something more fun.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Like laugh with your girls.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Go to that really cool workshop.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Or have that really neat conversation with your friend.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you can remember having the conversation.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember being at the workshop.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember laughing with your girls.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then what we know happened before.
[DOCTOR]: You did what you did.
[DOCTOR]: You might've gotten some food.
[DOCTOR]: He's like, mom moved out.
[DOCTOR]: You're like, where's mom?
[DOCTOR]: You went home, came home.
[DOCTOR]: Mom wasn't there.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then before that you might've been at school.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And again, as we go backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it?
[PATIENT]: It was, yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember that happening.
[DOCTOR]: Mom doing that and brother telling you that.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember putting on your shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Yep.
[DOCTOR]: Angelica, stop putting on your shirt.
[DOCTOR]: right i'm not doing it yeah we'll stop mom from moving out say she's not moving out no she's not moving out well then stop that from happening say it's not happening it's not happening yeah so then where is it say it no longer exists it doesn't exist that's right and again as this gets in what do you notice it's true it doesn't exist it doesn't no right what do you notice starting to happen to the feelings
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because mom doing that back then felt like it had something to do with her lack of love or your lack of lovability.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: As we're looking at it clearly, did it have anything to do with you or your lack of lovability or even her love for you?
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Or did it have to do with at that time mom wasn't well?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Mom like had her own stuff going on.
[DOCTOR]: And you didn't know that.
[DOCTOR]: And that's really where the problem lies because when we're little children, babies, our parents can do all and every.
[DOCTOR]: They seem like super people.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: As we get older, we realize there are limitations.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: We're little.
[DOCTOR]: We didn't think they had any limitations.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: It's not until we get old.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, my goodness.
[DOCTOR]: They're pretty limited in certain areas.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Second, you didn't need a present mom to be loving in order for you to be a loving present mom.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You thought you did.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Back then you thought you needed that and needed that from her in order for you to be okay.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: But as we're looking at it, clearly you didn't need that from her in order for you to be it for your own.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And that earlier in you doesn't know that.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So once again, close your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: picture that earlier you and let her know that's over, finished, completed, defeated, it no longer exists.
[DOCTOR]: That mom doing that had nothing to do with me or my lovability.
[DOCTOR]: Or even her love for me had everything to do with mom not being well.
[DOCTOR]: There was something that was off then with mom.
[DOCTOR]: So that the earlier you gets, it's not about me.
[DOCTOR]: Let the earlier you know that you didn't actually need that from mom in order for you to be it with your own girls.
[DOCTOR]: so that she gets it.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Let the earlier you know what it's like to be laughing with them.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know, right?
[DOCTOR]: About having those really cool conversations, like-minded people, right?
[DOCTOR]: Being at that workshop, having more breakthroughs, right?
[DOCTOR]: What do you notice happening to the earlier you?
[PATIENT]: Oh, she's happy.
[DOCTOR]: She is, isn't she?
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, that's right.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: She's getting free.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Those weren't her stuff.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: It just felt like it was.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And again, that because when I'm a baby, everything is about me.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: I always loved it when my daughter was like four and I'd say, whose house is that?
[DOCTOR]: And she'd go, it's Daphne's house.
[DOCTOR]: I go, right.
[DOCTOR]: It's Daphne's house.
[DOCTOR]: Dad just pays for everything.
[DOCTOR]: I get it.
[DOCTOR]: It's not dad's house at Daphne's house.
[DOCTOR]: Okay, great.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Cause everything is about me.
[DOCTOR]: It's mine.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And that's what gives the distorted lens.
[DOCTOR]: Because I was trained that good is happening when I'm being good.
[DOCTOR]: The bad only happens if I'm bad.
[DOCTOR]: Bad is my identity.
[DOCTOR]: Good at my identity.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Now those things are getting unplugged.
[DOCTOR]: As they get unplugged, then what you already know, which you already knew, integrates so that you feel it too.
[DOCTOR]: The problem with certain things is they get it in about head deep.
[DOCTOR]: And so, yes, I do feel better, but I don't get it here.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And that's because if we don't unplug the memory, it doesn't matter what I tell myself.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: That part will never feel it.
[DOCTOR]: If the rabbit thinks a fox is just outside, there's nothing you can do to tell the rabbit to be calm.
[DOCTOR]: Dude, bunny, you're fine.
[DOCTOR]: You're safe.
[DOCTOR]: You're indoors.
[DOCTOR]: The fox can't get you.
[DOCTOR]: You're safe.
[DOCTOR]: There's a freaking fox.
[DOCTOR]: I'm off.
[DOCTOR]: So that's where I can get it and get it and get it.
[DOCTOR]: But until it gets in here, I don't fully embody it.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right now, try to think about that stuff with those cousins as somehow it was your fault.
[DOCTOR]: Or somehow you must have been being bad.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: I noticed how that's not there at all.
[PATIENT]: No, no, no.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how it seems like kind of crazy thought.
[DOCTOR]: What do you mean?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Where before it was there.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So things are changing.
[DOCTOR]: They're rewiring inside, right?
[DOCTOR]: That's what's starting to happen.
[DOCTOR]: Neural networks are getting updated, right?
[DOCTOR]: Brains rewiring, optimizing to the present moment.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Have you heard that, I think they call it Hebb's Law, neurons that fire together, wire together.
[PATIENT]: Yes, wire together, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Or wherever attention goes, energy flows.
[PATIENT]: Yes, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So new neural networks are getting organized.
[DOCTOR]: Even when you think about those two moments...
[DOCTOR]: When you think about them now, they're not located in the same place they were.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: They're located in a different place.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: The coding has changed, not the event, but it went from on happening to data about something that happened.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: When things become data, right?
[DOCTOR]: So when we go through adversity and we make it through it physically, we become stronger.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: And anybody other than the Navy SEALs doesn't sign up for adversity, but those guys are doing it.
[DOCTOR]: Like, whatever.
[DOCTOR]: The rest of us get enough adversity on our own without signing up, right?
[DOCTOR]: So we know that we get stronger.
[DOCTOR]: When trauma is without emotion...
[DOCTOR]: It equals wisdom.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So that's when we become wiser, right?
[DOCTOR]: More.
Okay.
[DOCTOR]: So again, go ahead and slightly lower your jaw, relax your tongue, begin to breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out.
[DOCTOR]: Noticing more space.
[DOCTOR]: Notice that with your eyes open, you look out and you see me in the screen.
[DOCTOR]: you can see what's out in front of you.
[DOCTOR]: When you close your eyes, realize that you don't see me anymore, but you actually see just the backs of your eyelids.
[DOCTOR]: When I see the backs of my eyelids, it's different hues of colors, dark or bright.
[DOCTOR]: Go ahead and open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: Notice, Angelica, with your eyes open, you see me and what's out in front of you again.
[DOCTOR]: When you close your eyes,
[DOCTOR]: You no longer see me.
[DOCTOR]: You're just seeing the backs of your eyelids.
[DOCTOR]: And so without using your memory or your imagination, no memory, no imagination, what do you actually see behind you?
[DOCTOR]: Because it might surprise you that what you actually see behind you is nothing.
[DOCTOR]: You see no thing behind you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And I'm wondering what it might be like to drift in nothing.
[DOCTOR]: In the space.
[DOCTOR]: Nothing.
[DOCTOR]: No body.
[DOCTOR]: No thing.
[DOCTOR]: And I don't know whether you realize or not that in nothing, everything exists as a potentiality.
[DOCTOR]: In nothing is the field of possibility.
[DOCTOR]: You're becoming much more okay in you, grounded and centered and present and clear.
[DOCTOR]: beginning to experience other people's emotions as being more about them, not me.
[DOCTOR]: Feeling lighter.
[DOCTOR]: And as you're floating, drifting in nothing, whenever you're ready, bring your awareness back into now.
[DOCTOR]: Here.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And then when you're ready, once again, take a nice big deep breath in and then exhale and open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And what are you noticing now?
[PATIENT]: Just feel calm.
[DOCTOR]: You do feel calm, right?
[DOCTOR]: And as your body's feeling calm, once again, your unconscious will travel back down that timeline of things, experiences, and will bring another moment to your awareness.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And what comes to mind now?
[PATIENT]: It's like I don't get any special memories.
[PATIENT]: It's just a feeling of
[DOCTOR]: It's just the feeling of where?
[PATIENT]: Not just a feeling of not really being safe or loved.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: It feels like I'm young.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: A time when you were young where you weren't feeling safe.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And it might have been scary.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And you might have been unsure.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And what do we know from here?
[DOCTOR]: Even though it was scary, even though I didn't feel safe,
[DOCTOR]: even though I wasn't sure, I made it here.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Which means I've defeated it, whatever that it was, because it no longer exists.
[DOCTOR]: And what I didn't have back then
[DOCTOR]: is the knowing that I didn't have to know, that I didn't have to feel sure.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: That I didn't have to not feel unsafe or safe.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That I had what I needed despite feeling scared and unsafe.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: To maneuver through that situation.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So what starts to happen as you're realizing this from here about what happened then?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Think back to then that even though it felt unsafe and it was scary and I wasn't sure, I made it here.
[DOCTOR]: That means I had what I needed inside to move through the thing that was scary or I felt unsafe and I was unsure.
[DOCTOR]: Hmm.
[DOCTOR]: I wonder what happens when it gets into the earlier you that she had what she needed then.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Because she did.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, she did.
[DOCTOR]: She did, right.
[DOCTOR]: The error is that she didn't know that she did.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That's the only thing that was problematic is that she just didn't know that she did.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: But you do.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And now she does.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Because she had that feeling that she can't trust anyone.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And which was really wise.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because in life, to think that somebody is going to have my best interest in mind all the time is a dumb idea.
[DOCTOR]: they're going to have their best interest in mind as long as it matches theirs.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: If their best interest does not match mine, they don't longer have my best interest in mind, even in a silly thing.
[DOCTOR]: My wife and I are preparing to go away to a workshop and there's prep material for it.
[DOCTOR]: And we were going to listen to one of the meditations together, but I heard that she started and already did one.
[DOCTOR]: Which then I'm like, oh, I see.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: We're going to do it together.
[DOCTOR]: I mean, my best interest, but it didn't fit timing wise.
[DOCTOR]: So you went with what you're his best interest, even in a silly moment, we're going to do what works for them.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And then I heard that and I went and listened to a couple of them and she's like, well, I thought we were going to listen to.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So just kind of check it out.
[DOCTOR]: What do you notice happening in your body now?
[PATIENT]: It's almost like I feel a bit silly.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that interesting?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That that's how much has been discharged.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That it's silly.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how different that is.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And that shit never felt silly before.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: All that shit felt serious before.
[DOCTOR]: It felt serious.
[DOCTOR]: Felt really serious.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: It doesn't feel so serious anymore.
[PATIENT]: No, it feels just, why even talk about it?
[PATIENT]: It's just info.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And it's not running anything in me anymore.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[PATIENT]: It's not running anything in me anymore.
[PATIENT]: That's really good.
[DOCTOR]: I know.
[DOCTOR]: It's not running that in you anymore.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So that your brain updates to now the present situation.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Which is you getting your own worth.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And now the younger you is also getting her own worth.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And how much she's worth it to you.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And what she goes through is worth it because she gets to become you.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Who's really becoming way good in you.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Which is so cool for your girls.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: To have a mom that's like good inside.
That's good.
Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And as those things are healing, they're healing in an energetic and outside of you way.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because it's changing the systems.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that a good news thing?
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So let's just check.
[DOCTOR]: I'd like you to, you know, think about a time where like you might be sitting at your desk.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You've been feeling pretty good and you're having that thought that comes up.
[DOCTOR]: Well, I really want to impact a lot more people.
[DOCTOR]: How do I do it?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And as you're thinking about it now, what do you notice?
[PATIENT]: I just know that I'm in no hurry.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Now I want you to do two things with it.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how it's up here.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And when things are up above, that's fine.
[DOCTOR]: Cause I can look up.
[DOCTOR]: But when things are up above and there's a lot, it's a lot to manage on top.
[DOCTOR]: It's like somebody juggling.
[DOCTOR]: How much can they juggle at a time, really?
[DOCTOR]: Like it's going to all drop, right?
[DOCTOR]: So what happens if you take that and you move it down to the ground below you and you kind of move it a little bit further out and then you get a little bit like maybe if you were up on a ladder, just kind of up above looking down so that you can spread those things out a little more.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right, so that you can kind of get an idea of the sequence, the order and the chunking.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: As you see it down below with you up above and it being a little more spread out, how does it actually feel?
[PATIENT]: It feels like it's not so serious as I thought.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: And it's manageable.
[PATIENT]: It's not.
[PATIENT]: And I'm in no hurry.
[PATIENT]: It's just.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: It's manageable.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And therefore with it manageable, I do what is the next smallest step.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: And my worth isn't invested in it.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, notice how different that is.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Your worth isn't about how many people you impact.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right, where before it was tied into, but if I make more people, then I'll, right.
[PATIENT]: Have some worth, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right, you're more okay in you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, and the impact you are having.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
Right.
[PATIENT]: It almost feels like it's too easy, like I'm cheating or something.
[PATIENT]: Maybe you are.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But here's the part.
[DOCTOR]: It does feel too easy, but we're working with the part of your brain that on an intellectual level operates at the same as like a goat.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, I get that.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: So we really don't want to make it too complicated because then it's like, what do I do with any of this?
[DOCTOR]: I don't know what you're talking about.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Want to make it lighter and easier.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So that we get to see it clearly.
[DOCTOR]: See, you didn't know before we were talking, I didn't know until I saw it, that when you talk about that stuff, it was all overwhelming, all the stuff there is to do, how to do to make a difference and a bigger difference and too much.
[DOCTOR]: If I change and I've got it below me and I'm able to spread it out and I rise up a little bit,
[DOCTOR]: I see more.
[DOCTOR]: I see more of the space in between each of the things.
[DOCTOR]: I can also see how to chunk and sequence it.
[DOCTOR]: What things can get grouped.
[DOCTOR]: I'm going to do these things at this.
[DOCTOR]: And then maybe I'll resequence.
[DOCTOR]: I'm going to do this.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: That's good.
[DOCTOR]: That's good.
[DOCTOR]: Because your worth isn't tied into the difference.
[DOCTOR]: I think you're not worth it because you make a difference and then unworth it because you're not making a difference.
[PATIENT]: No.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Not about the doing anymore.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: I'm being it.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: I'm worth it to me.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So that my kids get how much they're worth it.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And my husband gets how much I'm worth it.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That if he's wanting to be with me and therefore hang out more with them.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: We need him to be a little more checked in.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Versus checked out.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Exactly.
[DOCTOR]: I don't want to be with somebody who's checked out.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: How old are your girls?
[PATIENT]: They are 20 and 17.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, beautiful.
[DOCTOR]: How cool.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That's great.
[DOCTOR]: I have a 16 and 12 year old.
[PATIENT]: Oh, wow.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: They're sweet pies too.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: They're cool.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So again, just check in.
[DOCTOR]: What are you noticing?
[PATIENT]: It feels lighter.
[PATIENT]: And I have this question just about, because I get a lot of migraines when I try to exercise.
[PATIENT]: Do you think this will help that as well?
[PATIENT]: Or is it something else that is...
[DOCTOR]: Well, let's just, I mean, first of all, I'm not a medical doctor, so I can't guarantee anything in any of those things, right?
[DOCTOR]: However, what I know and experience in working with lots of people, your unconscious knows how to heal itself.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: If we're coming from the lens of understanding that your coffee cup had been already full.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And anytime I poured more in, it just was overflowing.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: It didn't have a lot in the reserves.
[DOCTOR]: Does that make sense?
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: As the stuff gets unplugged and unclogged.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: It actually got a spigot.
[DOCTOR]: now things lower down right one of the things that you had mentioned is that your heart rate and blood pressure go up too quickly is that what it was when you're exercising or no i don't think at a certain level it creates more tell me more so i want to understand more
[PATIENT]: Yeah, it's just when my pulse is getting up, that's when I've been having my pulse up for a while, that's when I get migraines after a while.
[PATIENT]: So I can still work out, but then I get severe migraines.
[DOCTOR]: And your working out is about having some form of cardiovascular workout.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, and strength training as well.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: You just have to do powerlifting.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Powerlifting is.
[DOCTOR]: Well, powerlifting requires you to take like four or five minutes in between.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: No, I don't do that.
[DOCTOR]: I know, but you could.
[DOCTOR]: And then your heart rate won't go up.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: But it's not fun.
[DOCTOR]: You can make it fun.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, but aren't we supposed to be able to work out?
[DOCTOR]: Well, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: What precipitated you having the experience that when my pulse has been up for too long, I'm finding myself getting migraines?
[PATIENT]: i think maybe it's linked to i've been burned out four times and i think it feels like it's linked to that does that mean burned out burned out um like job wise yeah or physically and mentally it's just like i uh i did too much time then you got burned out yeah how old when
[PATIENT]: It was in my 30, maybe I was 32 or something.
[DOCTOR]: 32, right.
[DOCTOR]: And how did it happen?
[DOCTOR]: So you had been doing what?
[PATIENT]: I've been exercising a lot.
[PATIENT]: And also I was really mean to myself.
[PATIENT]: How so?
[PATIENT]: In a way that I was always putting myself down, never thinking I was, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Even though you were exercising hard, you were beating yourself up.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, because I thought I had to be better and more fit and to be able to be lovable.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, okay.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So that you back then was thinking that she needed to be having a better fit body to be lovable.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Uh-huh.
[PATIENT]: Because I've always thought that I'm stupid, so no one can love me because I'm smart, so...
[PATIENT]: So, so I have to try to work on my body.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Isn't that interesting?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: So got that feeling of somehow I'm not lovable and nobody's really going to want me.
[DOCTOR]: And I need to look a certain way in order to be wanted.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Got that feeling.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Close your eyes and let that feeling tone guide you back.
[DOCTOR]: Let that feeling tone grow you earlier and younger back.
[DOCTOR]: Back.
[DOCTOR]: Towards one of the first times you had that kind of a feeling.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And the moment that comes to mind, you're how old?
[PATIENT]: 11.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And again, you want to be here because I'm fun.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: You're really fun.
[DOCTOR]: I only set the bar very low.
[DOCTOR]: I only need to do a little more fun and sucky moments in people's lives.
That's good.
[DOCTOR]: So you're 11.
[DOCTOR]: You're where?
[PATIENT]: At school.
[DOCTOR]: So you're at school.
[DOCTOR]: You're 11.
[DOCTOR]: Are you in a classroom or in a hallway?
[PATIENT]: No, we're out on break.
[PATIENT]: So we're outside.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, so you're out on break outside of the school.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: Then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: um a lot of boys were uh chasing the girls right so the boys were chasing the girls right yes and they wanted to touch the girls right and i ran as well yes and then i got left at because um then you were running you ran away far enough you got away then everybody went back into school
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Uh, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then you realize that everybody had gone back to school.
[PATIENT]: That's not really what happened.
[DOCTOR]: What happened?
[PATIENT]: I got laughed at because, uh, they, the boy said that, why are you running?
[PATIENT]: Nobody wants to touch you.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Why are you running?
[DOCTOR]: Nobody wants to touch you.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[PATIENT]: Then I felt, well, no, but then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: Ah, then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: The break was over.
[DOCTOR]: The break was over.
[DOCTOR]: You went back in school.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You went into a class.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then later on, you did something more fun.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Like laugh with your girls.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Retreat.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So we got going to the retreat.
[DOCTOR]: We got laughing with the girls.
[DOCTOR]: We got being back home.
[DOCTOR]: We got going in school.
Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You've got the kid saying, why are you running?
[DOCTOR]: Nobody wants to touch you.
[DOCTOR]: We've got the boys chasing the girls.
[DOCTOR]: We've got you guys going on a break.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Then you're at school.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And again, as it goes backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it?
[DOCTOR]: It was hard to keep up.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember him saying that.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember putting on your pink shirt.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: We'll stop putting on your shirt.
[PATIENT]: Wow.
[DOCTOR]: Stop him from saying that.
[DOCTOR]: Say he's not saying that.
[PATIENT]: You're not saying that.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So then where is it?
[DOCTOR]: Say it no longer exists.
[PATIENT]: It doesn't exist.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And you know, at 12, everybody is the hottest.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You know, all 12 year olds look, think they look great anyway.
[DOCTOR]: I mean, you're not going through the most awkward phase of your life.
[DOCTOR]: Weird things start growing in weird ways in other stuff starts growing in weird stuff and all these hormones stuff.
[DOCTOR]: Like, yeah, I definitely feel pretty.
[DOCTOR]: I don't have acne.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: I remember I had an uncle one time say to me, he goes, I'm 14 years old and just not in a good way.
[DOCTOR]: And he goes, you know, you need to change this attitude because these years are the best years of your life.
[DOCTOR]: Oh.
[DOCTOR]: And I'm like, oh my goodness, if it doesn't get better than this, why am I still here?
[DOCTOR]: It doesn't get better.
[DOCTOR]: This is the best.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So again, that boy saying that had nothing to do with you.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: It had to do with him.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: It just felt like it had something to do with you.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So again, close your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: Let that earlier, you know, that moment is over that it no longer exists that him saying that had nothing to do with you.
[DOCTOR]: It was about him.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know.
[DOCTOR]: Of course, you know, 12 is temporary.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know who she gets to blossom and become into.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know about her girls.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know that you're okay.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know that she's good enough for you.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So that she gets it.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And as she gets it, what do you notice happening to that earlier you?
[PATIENT]: It's like she doesn't really get it.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, right.
[DOCTOR]: So does she know the story of the ugly duckling?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Who I am at 12 is not who I am now.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And if you ask anybody in life, do they want to go back to, you know, 12, 13, 14, 15?
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: There's nobody in life that goes, no.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Let me, let me replay those again.
[DOCTOR]: no right but it's still it still feels like so here's the problem yeah the problem is this back then she thought that everybody needed to be into everybody yeah she didn't know that there were people that have different templates people that have different interests people that have different likes and so the idea when we're little children is we have preferences and choices we have do you want vanilla ice cream or chocolate ice cream yeah
[DOCTOR]: and you have a preference, you're going to pick, which one of the two flavors would you pick?
[DOCTOR]: For you, vanilla or chocolate?
[PATIENT]: Chocolate.
[DOCTOR]: Chocolate.
[DOCTOR]: Does that mean there's something wrong with vanilla?
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: It means you have a preference for chocolate.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Or for vanilla.
[DOCTOR]: Can that change?
[DOCTOR]: Sure.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: I used to love vanilla ice cream.
[DOCTOR]: Now I like chocolate chip cookie dough, which has vanilla ice cream and chocolate chip cookies.
[PATIENT]: I mean, come on.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: That's good.
Right?
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: If somebody buys a Honda Accord and then later on they get a Toyota Camry, does that mean that there was something wrong with the Accord?
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Because in life, in the world of world, there are guys that are interested in you that you're interested in.
[DOCTOR]: That's a good match.
[DOCTOR]: Then there are guys that are interested in you that you're not interested in.
[DOCTOR]: That is not a good match.
[DOCTOR]: And then there are guys that you're interested in that are not interested in you.
[DOCTOR]: That is also not a good match.
[DOCTOR]: And then there's the last one.
[DOCTOR]: Guys that you're not interested that are not interested in you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You don't ever see that.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So the earlier you thought that she was learning about herself, she was learning about his preference.
[DOCTOR]: yeah right and let's just check as she thinks of him was she like really into him because he's like you know no he's that kind of guy that she totally would want to be with no because he was really mean that's right yeah that's right yeah and kids say things not that are true but that'll hurt yes right yeah
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So we were simply learning about him and his preference.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Which is good because you weren't interested in him anyway.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: But somehow he seemed to be after you.
[DOCTOR]: And that's why you're running.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Strange, right?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So again, close your eyes now and let the earlier you know what you know now.
[DOCTOR]: that it's preference.
[DOCTOR]: Just like you're not attracted to all and every, every and all isn't attracted to you.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And that's okay.
[PATIENT]: That's okay.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That is not about me.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So again, as this gets into that earlier you, what do you notice happening?
[PATIENT]: It feels good to know about the preference a bit deeper.
[DOCTOR]: Doesn't that make sense?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: It makes sense.
[PATIENT]: I still have this feeling like I should...
[PATIENT]: Like I'm still not really okay with my body not being thin or fit.
[PATIENT]: I haven't been able to work out the last six months.
[PATIENT]: So I feel like I gained some weight and I still feel like it shouldn't be like this.
[DOCTOR]: Has your husband still wanted to have sex with you?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: So I can change that for him.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, he doesn't seem to mind.
[DOCTOR]: No, no, no.
[DOCTOR]: See, here's the thing about a guy.
[DOCTOR]: If a guy is interested in you, he likes the package.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: I need to get that.
[DOCTOR]: But he's interested in your package, clearly.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Even if the package has a little extra on it.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[PATIENT]: But I'm supposed to be okay with it.
[DOCTOR]: You don't always have to like what your package is looking like.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: No, you don't always have to like what your package is looking like.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: But see where it's starting to change is I used to hate me.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Because of what my package was looking like.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Now I'm not so much hating me, even if I don't always like what my package is looking like.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And I'd like to be doing some things that will help my package look more in the way that I want it to look, which also has more to do with food than it does with exercise.
[PATIENT]: Yes, I know.
[PATIENT]: I know.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: I did not know that.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: For a long time in my life, I had no idea that that had anything to do with that at all.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: I had no idea for a long time.
[DOCTOR]: I would eat.
[DOCTOR]: I don't know.
[DOCTOR]: First, I went plant-based.
[DOCTOR]: So I thought that was going to be really good.
[DOCTOR]: Then I had all sorts of issues with skin and rashes because of the foods that I was eating that was plant-based that I was allergic to.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But then I didn't realize I was eating like 3000 carbs a day, like a ton.
[DOCTOR]: Everything I had was carbs.
[DOCTOR]: So then I cut it all away and I ate carnivore.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And I did that for a period of time.
[DOCTOR]: I lost 15 pounds eating double cheeseburgers with six slices of bacon.
[DOCTOR]: That doesn't make any sense to me, but that's what happened.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Now I'm on this stage where I'm trying to bulk to put some strength on my skinny little body.
[DOCTOR]: And I'm eating, you know, like almost 4,000 calories a day.
[PATIENT]: Hmm.
[DOCTOR]: Which is crazy to get in that many calories.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: But like, I'm at that, I'm in my early fifties.
[DOCTOR]: I don't have a lot of time to be able to put on muscle so that the body will develop a little more.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But check it out.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: So you don't have to always like what your body looks like.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: But check it out that it's not making me feel that there's something wrong with me.
[DOCTOR]: It's not about me anymore.
[DOCTOR]: It's about I'm not satisfied with what my body looks like.
[DOCTOR]: And I'd like to be more physically active.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So the how you go about being more physically active is really slowly.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You kind of want to just dip your toe in the water.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, I'm doing that now.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Like we don't want to go, oh, well, great.
[DOCTOR]: Why don't you just go out for a five mile run and try to get a PR while you're at it?
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, sure.
[DOCTOR]: That's not what we're suggesting.
[DOCTOR]: Maybe a brisk walk around the block.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, I do that.
[PATIENT]: I do that.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Maybe a brisk walk around the block and then kind of notice something.
[DOCTOR]: What if I get it up a little bit?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: I've been doing that as well.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And we can induce that kind of sensation in people.
[DOCTOR]: All you have to do is have them exhale a lot harder than the inhale.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: If you want to induce like panicky stuff in somebody, you get them to.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And if they breathe like that for a period of time, all of a sudden they're going to start feeling warmer in their body.
[DOCTOR]: They're going to start having like the heart palpitation.
[DOCTOR]: It's going to go up, up, up, up, up.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So you can turn it on on purpose if you want.
[DOCTOR]: The only reason to turn it on on purpose is that you want to have the ability to turn it off.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Because the error is as soon as it starts turned on, people get freaked out.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: That's what happens with anxiety.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: I have a disturbing, troubling thought.
[DOCTOR]: Oh no.
[DOCTOR]: Now my heart's starting to beat faster.
[DOCTOR]: Why is my heart beating faster?
[DOCTOR]: Oh, no.
[DOCTOR]: Now I'm feeling like my pulse is a little, oh, no.
[DOCTOR]: Now I'm feeling a little bit lightheaded.
[DOCTOR]: Now I feel like racy.
[DOCTOR]: I feel uneasy.
[DOCTOR]: What's wrong with me?
[DOCTOR]: I don't know.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: I'm moving myself into a full-fledged panic attack.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: So I don't know in terms of you how you're noticing that my pulse is up.
[DOCTOR]: Do you have a monitor, a watch, a band that's letting you know?
[DOCTOR]: Or are you checking it?
[PATIENT]: No, I'm just feeling.
[DOCTOR]: You're feeling?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, where are you feeling it?
[PATIENT]: I just notice.
[PATIENT]: It's not like I'm not afraid of my pulse getting up.
[PATIENT]: It's just that I've noticed that when I exercise more and my body,
[PATIENT]: And my heart rate gets up and I do it for a longer period of time.
[DOCTOR]: That's when I get- How long is a longer period of time?
[PATIENT]: Oh, sometimes it's just about 15 minutes.
[DOCTOR]: 50, five, oh?
[PATIENT]: 15.
[DOCTOR]: One, five.
[PATIENT]: Yes, one, five.
[DOCTOR]: Okay, got it.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: So that's what we get to test.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And kind of push in a little and notice.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because think about your husband.
[DOCTOR]: And although he's gotten the enlightenment of shit, she was going to leave me.
[DOCTOR]: I better shape up and get present.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: I don't want to lose them all.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So that you're causing that for him.
[DOCTOR]: But you're just paying attention.
[DOCTOR]: What's normally the things that he does or is around when he's not up north that typically creates additional stress?
[DOCTOR]: Now I'm having these migrants.
[PATIENT]: His mood and he gets angry.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So think of something that normally he gets pissed off about that normally does this thing for you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: What's something that might happen that normally he gets pissed off about that you get all.
[PATIENT]: He gets pissed off about my daughter not doing school as he thinks it should be.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So he's thinking she should be more.
[PATIENT]: Studying more in a way that he thinks is good.
[DOCTOR]: Does she have bad grades?
[PATIENT]: She has, she did an operation in her brain.
[PATIENT]: She had this too much water in her brain.
[PATIENT]: So it was, she has been tired.
[PATIENT]: So she has, her grades has gone down a bit because she's managing coming back from that.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So the brain's number one job is a resource management center.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So if I'm strained in certain areas, it's not going to be able to send energy
[DOCTOR]: To all the areas like it normally runs.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: It's kind of like shut down a couple of things.
[DOCTOR]: So I'm not as sharp.
[DOCTOR]: I had the experience a couple of weeks ago where I had gotten a really bad night of sleep and, and then I had a really early workout and just life was fast and wife had difficult.
[DOCTOR]: And like, there was a lot like on my plate and I was drained like down.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And what I noticed most is emotional regulation normally is here went woo.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And I noticed I wasn't sharp.
[DOCTOR]: I was foggy.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That's just one night of, you know, like five hours of sleep.
[DOCTOR]: So think about him being mad that she should be doing more and you're knowing that she's doing what she can do now.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Based on what she went through.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And he's mad because he wants what for her?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, he wants the best for her.
[DOCTOR]: He does, right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So think of him getting mad and he might yell or he might huff and puff or how does he get mad?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, he can raise his voice and I just feel his energy is hostile.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So think of him with that hostile energy.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And as you experience him with a hostile energy, where do you feel it in your body?
[PATIENT]: I feel it in my head.
[DOCTOR]: Perfect.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So now just notice the sensations, what you can notice in your head.
[DOCTOR]: Don't do anything with it or about it.
[DOCTOR]: Just notice it.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Kind of sensations.
[DOCTOR]: You can get curious.
[DOCTOR]: You can get curious about how you can notice it changing because it won't stay the same because sensations are always changing.
[DOCTOR]: You can get a little bit curious about that.
[DOCTOR]: And then I want you to think about, you know, what it was like for you in that moment where you're really fully in and laughing with your girls.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You're like fully in and they're there and you're totally present with them and you're laughing with your girls.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Where do you feel it in your body?
[PATIENT]: I mean, my heart.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Like in your heart.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you kind of notice the sensations.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And you can notice that these sensations are different than those sensations.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But they're just sensations.
[DOCTOR]: So just kind of notice these sensations.
[DOCTOR]: Again, not anything do with it or about it.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then think of husband, you know, in that like energetic, angry kind of thing.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You know, how like you feel it when he's in that state.
[DOCTOR]: And you just kind of like know that and like you're feeling.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Again, just kind of notice what you notice about the sensations.
[DOCTOR]: No, not the situation, just sensations.
[DOCTOR]: Get curious.
[DOCTOR]: You notice.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And now think about, you know, being with your girls and you're laughing.
[DOCTOR]: Like you're really like connected and you're laughing.
[DOCTOR]: You're totally present.
[DOCTOR]: What it's like to really be with them.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you're feeling it.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You know what it's like.
[DOCTOR]: And you just notice the sensations.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then you think about your husband.
[DOCTOR]: You know, he might be pissed.
[DOCTOR]: And one of those arenas where he's like, you know, there's that energy because he's in that state.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you notice that you feel it all up there.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And again, just notice what you notice about the sensations.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And now think about, you know, being with the girls and laughing.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Notice what it's like when you're being with the girls laughing.
[DOCTOR]: And now notice that you can hold both of these sensations at the same time.
[DOCTOR]: Husband energy and that thing and girls and laughing.
[DOCTOR]: And the question becomes, are you able to hold onto the sensations long enough to
[DOCTOR]: to allow them to transform into something else.
[DOCTOR]: Because they're sensations, they're not you.
[DOCTOR]: Right, the clouds are not the sky.
[DOCTOR]: The clouds exist within the sky.
[DOCTOR]: They come from the sky, but they are not the sky.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: You are not the sensations, but you can notice the sensations and just like clouds can transform,
[DOCTOR]: dissipate, move into something else, create something new together.
[DOCTOR]: What do you notice happening to those sensations?
[PATIENT]: They're just there.
[DOCTOR]: They're just there.
[PATIENT]: Floating around, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: They are just floating around.
[DOCTOR]: You can notice the space in between.
[DOCTOR]: And this one's all around.
[DOCTOR]: And so the weirder question becomes this one.
[DOCTOR]: Because it's only a question that your body can answer.
[DOCTOR]: Noticing the sensations.
[DOCTOR]: Which if neither are true.
[DOCTOR]: Which if neither exist.
[DOCTOR]: Which if neither are true, which if neither exist.
[DOCTOR]: Because both were just coming from your memory and imagination.
[DOCTOR]: What do you notice now?
[DOCTOR]: Where the sensations are.
[PATIENT]: They're not, they're going away a bit.
[DOCTOR]: They're going away a bit.
[PATIENT]: How do you know?
[PATIENT]: Because I don't feel them as much anymore.
[DOCTOR]: You're not, are you?
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: You're not feeling it as much.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Even if you think about your husband being in that state when he's really in that, he knows energy.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: It's energy.
[PATIENT]: It's okay.
[DOCTOR]: Who are we learning about?
[PATIENT]: Me.
[DOCTOR]: No, him.
[PATIENT]: Him, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: We're not learning about you.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because you can get that sense with that energy.
[DOCTOR]: That feeling tone.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And that feeling tone could take you back.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: When he's in that state and there's that kind of... And kind of cut through the tension in him and...
[DOCTOR]: Notice what it's doing to you.
[DOCTOR]: And you follow that feeling tone back, Angelica.
[DOCTOR]: What does it take you towards?
[PATIENT]: If I try to follow it.
[DOCTOR]: If you followed that feeling back, if you took that feeling tone back so it guided you to an earlier other, an experience, right?
[DOCTOR]: That may or may not have anything to do with him.
[PATIENT]: No, it doesn't have anything to do with him.
[DOCTOR]: What does it take you back towards?
[PATIENT]: To my father.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, there we go.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[DOCTOR]: You can open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: And what's the moment that comes to mind?
[DOCTOR]: I'm so proud of you.
[PATIENT]: Oh, thank you.
[PATIENT]: I wasn't prepared on this.
[PATIENT]: It's my father.
[DOCTOR]: Beautiful, right?
[DOCTOR]: You're how old?
[DOCTOR]: What happened?
[PATIENT]: I think I'm about seven.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And you're where?
[PATIENT]: In the bedroom at my father's.
[DOCTOR]: Right, so you're with dad in the bedroom, right?
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: And I have wet the bed and he was really mad.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, he was mad because you wet the bed, right?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[DOCTOR]: He like yelled at you?
[PATIENT]: Not a bit, but more like just pretending I wasn't there.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, he was like ignoring you.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[PATIENT]: But I felt his anger.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: He was mad, but just kind of like ignoring you.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: Then he took away the mattress.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: He took the sheets off and took away the mattress.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: I was standing in the room.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Then I left, I guess.
[DOCTOR]: Went and did something else.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then it was over.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then later on you did something more fun.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Like laugh.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Go to that workshop.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So you can remember dad looking like that and acting like that.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: You can also remember putting on your pink shirt.
[PATIENT]: Yes, I can.
[DOCTOR]: Stop putting on your pink shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Say, I'm not putting on my pink shirt.
[DOCTOR]: I'm not putting on my pink shirt.
[DOCTOR]: Well, stop that from acting like that.
[DOCTOR]: Say, he's not acting like that.
[DOCTOR]: He's not acting like that.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then stop that from happening.
[DOCTOR]: Say, it's not happening.
[DOCTOR]: It is not happening.
[DOCTOR]: Then where is it?
[DOCTOR]: Say, it no longer exists.
[PATIENT]: It doesn't exist anymore.
[PATIENT]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And it gets in.
[DOCTOR]: What do you notice?
[DOCTOR]: good yeah isn't that interesting right that wasn't about you then either no it was about what happened yeah right yeah right dad was mad at what happened yeah right because he had to deal with freaking changing and cleaning and yes right yeah right but that had to do with dad and dad's upset yeah
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So again, close your eyes and let that earlier you know that that had to do with dad and dad's upset and how dad does upset.
[DOCTOR]: Nothing to do with me, right?
[DOCTOR]: Because as a parent, there's lots of other ways to be handling that.
[DOCTOR]: Oh my goodness, that had to have been so hard for you.
[DOCTOR]: I'm so sorry that that happened to you.
[DOCTOR]: This is not like you intentionally went, you know what I'm going to do?
[DOCTOR]: I'm going to fucking pee.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, it feels good.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, now it's cold.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, no.
[DOCTOR]: Oh.
[DOCTOR]: Let's see if I can get this guy.
[DOCTOR]: How do you like me now?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: As it gets in again, Angelica, what do you notice now?
[PATIENT]: Relief.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how it doesn't have the same weight.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Not a good news thing.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, it's good news.
[DOCTOR]: It is good news.
[PATIENT]: She's laughing.
[DOCTOR]: She is laughing, isn't she?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And you can open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: So now think of your husband.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: He might be in one of those sour moods.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[PATIENT]: He can handle it.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Notice his sour mood, what it's doing to you now.
[PATIENT]: No, I don't particularly like it, but it's okay.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: It's not feeling personal.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That's the difference.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: The other stuff has been feeling too personal.
[PATIENT]: It feels so stupid.
[PATIENT]: I thought I was overtaking things personal.
[DOCTOR]: Well, you are, but not in those ways.
[DOCTOR]: So many different ways you are.
[DOCTOR]: But even think about it.
[DOCTOR]: I mean, there might be somebody that was on your YouTube channel that now isn't.
[PATIENT]: Good for them to do what they want to do.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because I'm really interested in giving information to people who want the information.
[PATIENT]: Yes, exactly.
Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: I don't want to be working on people who don't want to be my client.
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: People who want to.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: No, of course.
[DOCTOR]: Because I don't need to be the all and every.
[PATIENT]: No, no.
[DOCTOR]: I want to be the one that it fits for the people that it fits for.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Because even if I wanted to be the all and every, I can't serve all and every.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And I'm not in a rush anymore.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[PATIENT]: It is.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You did great today.
[PATIENT]: Oh, you did.
[PATIENT]: Thank you.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Notice that you're feeling different.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And your job in between now and the next time that we get together is to pay attention to what you're noticing that's new and different.
[DOCTOR]: Even if it's simple or slight, begin to pay attention to what you notice that's new and different.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[PATIENT]: I will.
[DOCTOR]: Yay.
[PATIENT]: I will.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Well, awesome.
[DOCTOR]: And you'll notice things in moments where you'll be in a situation that normally would produce and it's not.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Or if it does, it doesn't go up as high.
[DOCTOR]: It doesn't last as long.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You'll go through a situation and you'll think back and be like, normally that would have done all that and it didn't.
[DOCTOR]: So you're going to notice in a lot of different ways what's new and different.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then we'll get back together, checking, making sure things are working.
[DOCTOR]: And you want to do a small little test.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: We're not going out for a 50 mile run.
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: We're not even going out for a five mile run.
[DOCTOR]: We're not even doing a mile.
[PATIENT]: No, no.
[DOCTOR]: You might do like a little bit where I get my heart rate up just a smidge.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Maybe I walk a little bit more briskly.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Dog slightly.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: I don't do it for very long, not more than a minute.
[DOCTOR]: Just to kind of check in with me.
[DOCTOR]: What do I notice?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, that's good.
[DOCTOR]: Because we want to start in a way that allows me to never fail.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And if I start with too big of a bite, then like, geez, I can't go the next day.
[DOCTOR]: It's like you go to a workout with a trainer and they work you out really hard and the next day you're sore.
[DOCTOR]: I'm not going back anymore.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: A good trainer leaves you in a place where, all right, that was a good workout, but you don't leave the next day.
[DOCTOR]: I can't move any of my arms.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Yes, I know.
[DOCTOR]: That's once they get you in for a while, then they'll do that to you.
[PATIENT]: Yes, I know.
[PATIENT]: I've been a personal trainer.
[DOCTOR]: Not when you're, I know, that's why I'm saying it.
[DOCTOR]: Not when you start.
[DOCTOR]: When you start, they're really sweet and nice.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: No, they get you in and you're hooked on them.
[DOCTOR]: Then it's like, oh, we're going to make this hard now.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, exactly.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Oh, that's good.
[DOCTOR]: Awesome.
[DOCTOR]: Well, have a great rest of your evening.
[DOCTOR]: And I look forward to getting back in touch with you in a few weeks.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, me too.
[PATIENT]: Take care.
[DOCTOR]: Awesome.
[DOCTOR]: You did great today.
[PATIENT]: Thank you.
[PATIENT]: Thank you.
[DOCTOR]: You're welcome.
[DOCTOR]: Pleasure.
[DOCTOR]: Bye bye.
Bye.
