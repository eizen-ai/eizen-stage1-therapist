[DOCTOR]: All right.
[DOCTOR]: As you know, Katie, we're making a recording of what we're doing.
[DOCTOR]: And given what we do is useful, valuable, it might be made available in teaching others.
[DOCTOR]: And I want to make sure that's okay with you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, of course.
[DOCTOR]: Okay, cool.
[DOCTOR]: So what do I need to know?
[DOCTOR]: What do we want to do for you?
[DOCTOR]: How can I be of assistance?
[DOCTOR]: And it's really great to see you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, it's great to see you.
[PATIENT]: So I'm really in a dilemma with this person who I had a child with.
[PATIENT]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: How old is the child now?
[PATIENT]: She's one.
[PATIENT]: I just had a baby not long ago.
[PATIENT]: He very clearly trafficked me.
[PATIENT]: I'm just having this hard time of letting go and wishing things had been different and wanting things to be different, but it's like
[PATIENT]: yeah I can't get this person I just want to be over this person and done with this person and like work on like the stuff that like he you know did to me and said to me like he never put his hands on me but like almost like I almost feel like the stuff that he did emotionally is worse than like when I got my nose broached you know I'm like you know he did a doozy up here
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: And then like, he's, he's so controlling and manipulative.
[PATIENT]: And it's like, the love is super conditional.
[PATIENT]: So like yesterday he was like, out of nowhere, he's like, I love you.
[PATIENT]: And I miss you.
[PATIENT]: And I can't wait to be with you.
[PATIENT]: And then not even like a couple seconds later, he's like, Oh, can I get $60 by the way?
[PATIENT]: And I was like,
[PATIENT]: wow like I can clearly see like you know like before I was pretty dumb and blind and allowed that stuff to go on and now I like I can see like this person does not care about me in a way that I care about them and I'm tired of it hurting like in here okay you know because that's what it feels like is that
[PATIENT]: you know, like there's just like this pain here.
[PATIENT]: And I'm like, how, how do I get rid of it?
[DOCTOR]: How do you know when to feel it?
[DOCTOR]: The pain here?
[PATIENT]: I don't know.
[PATIENT]: I guess when I think about them.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: So sometimes it happens when you think about them, you're feeling the pain.
[DOCTOR]: So as you were telling me about it, you felt a little bit of the pain here and you want that pain that you feel here to be gone.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And you want to see him more clearly.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Because it gets confusing sometimes.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Because we had a baby together and I have feelings.
[DOCTOR]: And I recognize up here that he doesn't treat me the way that I want to be treated.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: He's not necessarily a great guy for me, yet I got feelings.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: It's like that's kind of my thing.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[PATIENT]: And he does nothing for her, you know?
[PATIENT]: So it's like, like you're asking me for money, but you should be giving me money.
[PATIENT]: No, I'm like.
[DOCTOR]: And is he local?
[PATIENT]: He lives in Florida still.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: So I moved to Iowa because of him.
[DOCTOR]: Got it.
[DOCTOR]: So even when he asking you money, he's asking you to like Venmo with him?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
Okay.
[PATIENT]: Isn't that insane?
[DOCTOR]: Well, the really good news is that you're far away.
[DOCTOR]: And it's you and her.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And you can do a better job, as you know, taking care of her without him.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: So, and then...
[DOCTOR]: It felt good when he was saying things like, I love you, I care about you, and I want to be with you.
[DOCTOR]: And that all felt good.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Until it flipped to, by the way, can you send me 60 bucks?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then you went, wait a minute, that kind of feels like, you know, you're using me.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Got it.
[PATIENT]: And that's where I'm like...
[PATIENT]: why like why do i stick around for this like why do i allow this and probably not the best question i mean truly katie the why is not the best question because even if you knew why you still find yourself doing the same shit yeah that's true yeah i guess maybe it's just like how do i stop
[PATIENT]: this like thing in my mind.
[PATIENT]: And then like my, like, I know, like, I don't know.
[PATIENT]: Like I, it's like a heart and head thing, right?
[PATIENT]: Like.
[PATIENT]: It is, isn't it?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how they're not in coherence.
[PATIENT]: They're not.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: We want your heart and your head to be in alignment.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Cause we've already created physical space.
[DOCTOR]: We want more emotional space.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
Yes.
[DOCTOR]: so that my head and heart are in alignment and I see him clearly for what he is.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: And not for what I want him to be.
[DOCTOR]: Right, I've got more space and room between him and my emotions.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Okay, cool.
[DOCTOR]: I follow you with that.
[DOCTOR]: What else would be useful for me to know?
[PATIENT]: I have his name tattooed six times.
[DOCTOR]: Only six?
[DOCTOR]: Okay, cool.
[DOCTOR]: You're so funny.
[PATIENT]: Well, it was like- We didn't go to lucky number seven.
[DOCTOR]: We got six in though.
[PATIENT]: I know, I know.
[PATIENT]: Well, it was all like a manipulation and a control tactic, right?
[PATIENT]: So the first time I got it really small because I was like, I've been here before.
[PATIENT]: I kind of know a little bit about tattoos because I get them.
[PATIENT]: And then he's like freaked out.
[PATIENT]: He was like, that's too small.
[PATIENT]: It looks like it says Katie.
[PATIENT]: And I was like, you don't have my name on you.
[PATIENT]: And then like the other thing is that like multiple women have his name tattooed.
[PATIENT]: Oh, fun.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: And I'm not the only one, you know?
[PATIENT]: So it's like, it wasn't that special.
[PATIENT]: It was just a way for you to,
[PATIENT]: control me to be able to be like she'll always come back you know because it's clear day on me you know what I mean I have it on my face you know so like not here oh there okay I got it so you know and then my daughter looks like him okay you know so and that like that's the other thing is like
[PATIENT]: I want more room for her.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: You know, like, cause I'm, I'm letting this person, he lives rent free in my head.
[PATIENT]: Like, you know, and it's like, sometimes it's, it's all consuming.
[PATIENT]: And I feel like I,
[PATIENT]: I'm on this constant loop and like this cycle of like, I love him, but I don't, I love him, but I don't, I can't love him because he doesn't love me.
[PATIENT]: And it's like, I don't, I don't know what to do with these feelings.
[PATIENT]: I don't know where to put them.
[PATIENT]: And it leaves me in a constant state of like, just distress and exhaustion.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You know, and you've got enough to deal with just with her.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Little kids aren't easy.
[PATIENT]: No, not toddlers.
[PATIENT]: They're crazy.
[DOCTOR]: No little kid is easy.
[DOCTOR]: No matter how much I care about them or how much I love them.
[DOCTOR]: It's hard.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Very labor intensive.
[PATIENT]: And my daughter is much like me.
[PATIENT]: So she has an attitude galore.
[PATIENT]: Do you remember when I was a little younger?
[PATIENT]: Not you.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Not me.
[PATIENT]: I think the first time I met you.
[DOCTOR]: No, my favorite time is the first time I ever met you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: When you yelled at the sailor gal.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Uh-huh.
[PATIENT]: Yep.
[PATIENT]: Yep.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: So that's Kylie.
[PATIENT]: So perfect.
[PATIENT]: And that show, she just looks like her dad.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: And I think that's like the hardest part of it all is that like, you know, this person is telling me that they love me and they care about me and, but then they asked me for money.
[PATIENT]: And then I remember all of the things that they did to me that were abusive.
[PATIENT]: They were very abusive.
[PATIENT]: Like you didn't have to put your hands on me.
[PATIENT]: For me to feel, yeah, you know, like the constant, like he was always body shaming me, always calling me fat.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: Like, and, and it's something now that I believe, cause you know, if you tell a person that a cow is a horse.
[DOCTOR]: Let's start believing other things.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: I mean, there's so many other things that you could be believing about yourself other than what he told you.
[PATIENT]: That's true.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And see, we want to have access to more.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: So really you created the physical distance.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And out of creating the physical distance, the emotional distance gets a little bit, but the problem is that he's, you know, not just rent free, you're having to pay him.
[PATIENT]: Well, not anymore.
[PATIENT]: I don't give him money.
[DOCTOR]: Okay, good.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, I don't give them money.
[PATIENT]: Number one, I'm a single parent.
[PATIENT]: I don't have money.
[PATIENT]: You mean all single parents aren't wealthy?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Surprise.
[PATIENT]: I think it's just because I'm a white woman or something.
[PATIENT]: I don't know.
[PATIENT]: I don't know.
[PATIENT]: I really think traffickers believe that white people just have money.
[PATIENT]: They're just out here flaunting it.
[PATIENT]: I don't know.
[PATIENT]: I guess.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: But yeah, it's definitely like even me and Misty talked about it.
[PATIENT]: And like, it wasn't like as clear and direct as like, you know, some of the trafficking like I experienced before.
[PATIENT]: But she's like, yeah, Katie.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: You know, I didn't know how to tell you because I was very deep into it.
[PATIENT]: You know what I mean?
[PATIENT]: And even if she would have told me, I wouldn't have listened, you know, so.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Well, the first thing we want to be getting is really, really good for you.
[DOCTOR]: And that you did it, you chose, you moved.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: So first, really cool.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: And that creates space and distance.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Now we want to create inside of you more emotional space and distance and that you see him clearly.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Because there's the idea of who you think he could be, which he isn't.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: And then there's the who he's been for you.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[DOCTOR]: So in the ideal world, it goes, oh, wow, you know, we could be together and raise our child together.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yes, there is the actuality.
[DOCTOR]: So think of the ideal is a small little narrowed window that I'm looking through.
[DOCTOR]: And we need to include the bigger picture.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So what would it be like if he was no longer occupying space in your head or in your heart?
[DOCTOR]: Like, how would you be a person?
[DOCTOR]: How would you be as a person if you were free from the effect that that stuff has had on you?
[PATIENT]: Happy.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Happy.
[PATIENT]: Calm.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Peaceful.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And what's it like for you when you feel calm and peaceful and happy?
[DOCTOR]: It does, doesn't it?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So let's think of this is where we're organizing is towards a you who's much more calm and peaceful and happy, who is much more settled
[DOCTOR]: and has both physical and emotional distance so that all of you, head and heart, is seeing him clearly for what he is.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So that even in the similarities, oh, she kind of looks like him.
[DOCTOR]: We're paying more attention to all the ways that she's not.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Looks like me too.
[PATIENT]: She does, doesn't she?
[PATIENT]: She does.
[DOCTOR]: She might act a little bit like you.
[DOCTOR]: Watch out world.
[PATIENT]: I know.
[DOCTOR]: Here we go.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So as we think about organizing towards this you, again, the question is never the how.
[DOCTOR]: It's going to happen.
[DOCTOR]: It's going to be okay with you.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Please.
[DOCTOR]: Is there anything that shows up conflictual?
[DOCTOR]: Anything about you being clear and free that wouldn't be okay?
[PATIENT]: No, I want to be okay.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, cool.
[DOCTOR]: So then what we want to do is we know that different bands of information exist at different brainwave states.
[DOCTOR]: And we want to begin to get out of the problem and into a resource.
[DOCTOR]: So how we start doing that is we go through this process where you first slightly lower your jaw.
[DOCTOR]: And then relax the back of your tongue so it rests at the bottom of your mouth.
[DOCTOR]: And now intentionally breathe in a little bit slower and deeper and out a little bit longer.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Notice that you're causing your breath to happen now.
[DOCTOR]: And that as you do, you're breathing differently than you do when you're not consciously breathing.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And as you're noticing your breath right now, just check inside your body.
[DOCTOR]: How's your body starting to feel now?
[DOCTOR]: Like more tense or more calm?
[DOCTOR]: Calm.
[DOCTOR]: It is more calm, right?
[DOCTOR]: So we're moving your brain waves down into more alpha waves.
[DOCTOR]: Low states, alert, aware, relaxed.
[DOCTOR]: The next thing we want to do is you're going to see me in the screen in front of you.
[DOCTOR]: You're going to see my nose.
[DOCTOR]: You're going to stay looking at my nose as you see my fingers.
[DOCTOR]: Continue to breathe in that slightly slower and deeper way with your jaw slightly lowered and relaxing your tongue.
[DOCTOR]: As you see my nose and my fingers, they're going to start moving out of the range of the screen all the way out.
[DOCTOR]: So that with your peripheral vision, I want you to begin to pay more attention to the space that's towards the sides of you.
[DOCTOR]: Begin to notice the space that's right between you and the screen.
[DOCTOR]: And even the space beyond the screen.
[DOCTOR]: The space that's underneath where you're sitting.
[DOCTOR]: The space that's behind you towards the TV.
[DOCTOR]: And even the space above your head towards the ceiling.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And notice what's starting to happen in your body as you're becoming more aware of the space.
[DOCTOR]: Mm-hmm.
[DOCTOR]: How's your body feeling now?
[DOCTOR]: It's relaxed.
[DOCTOR]: It is, isn't it?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: It's a little freaky.
[DOCTOR]: I bet it is, right?
[DOCTOR]: Because that's uncommon.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But here's a really cool thing, and I don't know whether you realize this or not, because it's something I've just begun to learn.
[DOCTOR]: There is more information.
[DOCTOR]: Mm-hmm.
[DOCTOR]: in the immaterial than in the material right it's weird so check it out yeah like more information in the immaterial than there is in the material yeah and the weirdest thing i'm gonna say is maybe not the weirdest but one of the weirdest
[DOCTOR]: If we thought of our body, the part of our body that's actually solid, you have to go out five decimal points.
[DOCTOR]: It's 0.00001% of our body is solid.
[DOCTOR]: The rest of us is made up of space.
[DOCTOR]: Now that sounds crazy, I know.
[DOCTOR]: Push my finger through my arm.
[DOCTOR]: If I was made up of space, I should be able to, right?
[DOCTOR]: Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: But here's the analogy.
[DOCTOR]: You know that when a ceiling fan is off, I can see the space between the blades.
[PATIENT]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: Right?
[PATIENT]: Oh, but when it's moving, you can't.
[DOCTOR]: When it's moving at high, I don't see the space between the blades.
[DOCTOR]: And even if I tried to push my hand through it, it bounced right off.
[PATIENT]: So we're moving at high frequencies.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: But we're moving at high frequencies in that the ceiling fan is spinning at a high rate.
[DOCTOR]: It seems like a solid disk.
[DOCTOR]: We are made up of tiny subatomic particles that are vibrating frequency at a high rate that makes us feel solid.
[DOCTOR]: So I'm not even real.
[DOCTOR]: you are but we're all in the matrix and if you've ever played a virtual reality game we wear a headset and the problem with our headset is our headset doesn't show us all and everything it only shows us what's in 3d okay so you're saying
[DOCTOR]: But there's more that's not in 3D than there is in 3D.
[DOCTOR]: Just like in the room you're in, there's more space than there are objects or things.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: The difference is I see the objects and things and I don't see the space.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Because normally we don't pay any attention to space because it doesn't look like it's there.
[DOCTOR]: Yet there's space in between you and the screen.
[DOCTOR]: And there's space behind you towards the TV and there's space underneath you.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So the other parts of your brain that are totally interested in working in the ways that are best for you have access to information that as things open up, we can transform how you've been feeling.
[DOCTOR]: So that as you connect more to the space, it's not just space in physical distance, it's space in emotional freedom.
[DOCTOR]: Because the problem in the interactions with that guy is that you haven't felt free to be okay in you.
[DOCTOR]: There's been that tug of war, I want, I don't, I wish, that.
[DOCTOR]: And so we're working towards the you who's free
[DOCTOR]: who's clear, who's distanced both physically and emotionally, and is experiencing herself as being much more calm.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Much more present.
[DOCTOR]: Happier.
[DOCTOR]: Feeling good in the moment, both about what she's doing, glad as she thinks back about it and having done it in this way.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So one more time, slightly lower your jaw.
[DOCTOR]: Relax the back of your tongue.
[DOCTOR]: It rests at the bottom of your mouth.
[DOCTOR]: Breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out.
[DOCTOR]: Continue to breathe in this way as you see my nose and my fingers.
[DOCTOR]: They go all the way out.
[DOCTOR]: You begin to pick up more of the space towards the sides.
[DOCTOR]: you notice the space between the screens, beyond the screen, underneath you, behind you, above your head, and begin to realize the space actually expands and goes beyond the room.
[DOCTOR]: That it goes really to outer space and beyond.
[DOCTOR]: That's a lot of space.
[DOCTOR]: And with your eyes closed, imagine floating up and out of your body, beyond the ceiling, beyond the roof, so that you rise way up above it all in the sky.
[DOCTOR]: You're having what we like to call a bird's eye view, meaning from up above, you're seeing everything as being underneath and below you, because you are above and over it all.
[DOCTOR]: Not just a bird that's perched, a bird that's soaring, flying and gliding through the expanse of the sky, moving in any direction it wants.
[DOCTOR]: Big wide arching turns and curves, it soars, it flies, it glides, moves, it's free.
[DOCTOR]: That's right, you're becoming more freed up to be much more okay.
[DOCTOR]: Bring your awareness back down and into your body to reassociate inside of you.
[DOCTOR]: As you do, take a nice, slow, and big, deep breath in.
[DOCTOR]: And now exhale.
[DOCTOR]: And open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And how's your body feeling now?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: It is, isn't it?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That's crazy.
[DOCTOR]: And what that's done, Katie, is now we're in a different brainwave state.
[DOCTOR]: And by being in a different brain state, we can add additional information because the earlier you who's been tied to him doesn't know all of what you know.
[DOCTOR]: Because immediately when she first got with him, she wasn't knowing any of the stuff that you know.
[DOCTOR]: She wasn't knowing how manipulative he was.
[DOCTOR]: She doesn't know that he was using psychological warfare.
[DOCTOR]: She doesn't know that he was being coercive.
[DOCTOR]: She doesn't know that he was manipulative in those ways.
[DOCTOR]: She didn't know.
[DOCTOR]: You know it now.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because if that you back then had known any of that stuff, she certainly wouldn't have stayed with him and damn well wouldn't have had a kid.
[PATIENT]: She might not have a kid, just not with him.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[DOCTOR]: Just not with him.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: So what we want to get in is that there's information that the earlier you doesn't know that you know from here.
[DOCTOR]: So that the earlier you gets to see the entire picture, what's created that interference between how I feel and what I know,
[DOCTOR]: is that heart aspect is only being able to see that small moment of time when he occurred as somebody who was really good.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Do you follow me with that?
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: That part is yearning for that only because it doesn't see the whole picture of all the other stuff.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Doesn't know about the body shaming.
[DOCTOR]: Doesn't know about the multiple tap.
[DOCTOR]: Doesn't know about the...
[DOCTOR]: verbal abuse, doesn't know about how it's impacted and changed how she's felt about herself and what she was believing about herself.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because prior to that, you were okay with what your body looked like, even if all the time it wasn't how you wanted it to be.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You were more okay in you.
[DOCTOR]: Like you were loving you.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Do you follow me with that?
Mm-hmm.
[DOCTOR]: That's what we want to get connected.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Make sense?
[DOCTOR]: So what's going to happen is one more time, slightly lower your jaw.
[DOCTOR]: Relax the back of your tongue.
[DOCTOR]: Begin to breathe a little bit slower and deeper on the way in and a little bit longer on the way out.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how much easier it is to become aware of the space.
[DOCTOR]: And that as you do, your body becomes more settled and your mind gets a little bit quiet.
[DOCTOR]: Go ahead and close your eyes and imagine floating up above and beyond.
[DOCTOR]: So from that lens way above, you're over all that.
[DOCTOR]: You're free to be much more okay in you.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Things are beginning to lighten up so that I'm seeing that clearly.
[DOCTOR]: And with distance, it becomes smaller and less significant.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: All of these things are beginning to integrate in the deeper parts of your mind.
[DOCTOR]: And because your unconscious is listening to everything we're talking about and knows how to heal you from the inside out,
[DOCTOR]: Every cut you've ever had, any broken bone, anything that your body is healing is always from the inside out.
[DOCTOR]: So your unconscious has direct access to the control panels.
[DOCTOR]: You don't even have to know which moments would be useful to unplug, whether they have to do with him or other things, because your unconscious knows.
[DOCTOR]: And so as you slowly begin to bring your awareness back down and into your body, simultaneously, your unconscious is going to travel back down the timeline of experiences that happened that created the faulty programming that's had me hooked in ways that I don't want to be hooked.
[DOCTOR]: And so as your awareness moves back into your body and your unconscious travels back and selects a moment,
[DOCTOR]: Good long exhale.
[DOCTOR]: And open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: And a moment will come to mind for us to unplug.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: I know, isn't that weird?
[DOCTOR]: What's the experience that just came to mind?
[DOCTOR]: It happened when?
[PATIENT]: It happened like one of the first times we saw it.
[DOCTOR]: So how we unplug something, I'm just going to recover that is, you're going to intend to be with me.
[DOCTOR]: You want to be with me because this is and that isn't.
[DOCTOR]: Two, we're organizing for the future.
[DOCTOR]: You, three, I'm hoping to be a little more enjoyable than that sucky moment.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Got it.
[DOCTOR]: Then we're going to go through just the facts about what happened.
[DOCTOR]: It'll go that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, that happened, and we're done.
[DOCTOR]: Three, because there's been things you've done later in life that were more enjoyable.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: What's something you've done any time from when that ended until yesterday that was more fun than that?
[PATIENT]: I bought a car.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: What's something else?
[PATIENT]: I am in college.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Beautiful.
[DOCTOR]: Awesome.
[DOCTOR]: And one other thing.
[PATIENT]: I have my own place.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: All of those things happen after that.
[DOCTOR]: There's an aspect of your brain that got stuck that doesn't know anything beyond it that was better.
[DOCTOR]: So we have good news to get into that part.
[DOCTOR]: So the moment that came to mind, when that moment happened, you were where?
[DOCTOR]: At my house.
[DOCTOR]: So you're at the house, right?
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: Was it daytime or nighttime?
[DOCTOR]: Daytime.
[DOCTOR]: And you're where in the house?
[DOCTOR]: In my room.
[DOCTOR]: In your room.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: He was.
[DOCTOR]: He came into the room.
[PATIENT]: We were talking like texting.
[DOCTOR]: So you were texting right on the phone.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: Then he got mad at me.
[DOCTOR]: On the text and started typing with like, you know, big bold letters.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: And because he thought like a tattoo was too small.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[DOCTOR]: Good detail.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: And then he said, oh, I'm going to show you like how my name is supposed to be tattooed.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[DOCTOR]: Good detail.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: What happened next?
[PATIENT]: And then he sent me a picture of his ex's privates that had his tattoo.
[DOCTOR]: Good job, good detail, right?
[DOCTOR]: And that's a lovely thing to get in the text.
[DOCTOR]: Definitely wanted to see that anyway, right?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, it was great.
[PATIENT]: And then he started belittling me.
[DOCTOR]: Then he said hurtful things, right?
[PATIENT]: Mm-hmm.
[DOCTOR]: She clearly cared more about me than you did.
[PATIENT]: You don't really.
[PATIENT]: She had a better body than.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, she looks better.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: All that stuff.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Good.
[DOCTOR]: Then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: Then.
[PATIENT]: He kept like putting me down so much.
[DOCTOR]: More stuff in the text.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then what happened next?
[PATIENT]: Then I went and got it tattooed even bigger.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then you got off the phone.
[DOCTOR]: Then you went to the tattoo place and got a bigger one.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And then that was over.
[PATIENT]: Mm hmm.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And what that, right.
[DOCTOR]: And then later on you did something more fun.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Got your own place.
[DOCTOR]: Now notice as you were describing that there was still the discomfort.
[DOCTOR]: It was a little less because you were intending to be with me.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: We never go backwards with memories, but when we do it unplugs and it takes away the charge.
[DOCTOR]: So we go backwards.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: So we got get in your own place.
[DOCTOR]: We got start in college.
[DOCTOR]: We got, you know, buying a car.
[DOCTOR]: And then he was still doing body shaming.
[DOCTOR]: And then you had gotten a bigger tattoo and then you'd gone to the tattoo place and then you got off the tax and he's saying, see, she's better looking.
[DOCTOR]: She's got a better body.
[DOCTOR]: She really cared more.
[DOCTOR]: Look at hers.
[DOCTOR]: That's how it's supposed to be.
[DOCTOR]: And he's like, that was too tiny.
[DOCTOR]: You really don't care.
[DOCTOR]: And then you had gotten the tattoo.
[DOCTOR]: Before that, you were doing whatever you're doing.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: As we go through it backwards compared to forward emotionally, how was it?
[PATIENT]: It wasn't.
[DOCTOR]: You notice how it's starting to be less because your brain is getting that information about something that happened.
[DOCTOR]: Not happening.
[DOCTOR]: Remember, third, the emotional brain doesn't get logic.
[DOCTOR]: It does get patterns of association.
[DOCTOR]: And the air is that the memory and the experience got glued.
[DOCTOR]: but you can remember putting your shirt on or putting your glasses on and you know that they're on, but you know that the memory of you putting it on is not the same thing as you doing it.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: If I said to you, remember getting dressed, putting your glasses on.
[DOCTOR]: And then I went, Katie, stop putting on your glasses.
[DOCTOR]: You'd say to me, I'm not putting on my glasses.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because your brain knows the difference between the memory and the experience.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember him doing that body shaming, saying those mean and hurtful things, how you needed to be more.
[DOCTOR]: You can remember all that happening, right?
[DOCTOR]: You can remember putting your glasses on.
[DOCTOR]: Katie, stop putting on your glasses.
[DOCTOR]: Say, I'm not putting on my glasses.
[PATIENT]: I'm not putting on my glasses.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Well, stop me from putting on my headband.
[DOCTOR]: Say, you're not putting on your headband.
[DOCTOR]: You're not putting on your headband.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then stop him from saying those things.
[DOCTOR]: He's not saying those things.
[DOCTOR]: He's not saying those things.
[DOCTOR]: Stop him from sending that photo.
[DOCTOR]: See, he's not sending the photo.
[DOCTOR]: He's not sending the photo.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then stop that from happening.
[DOCTOR]: Say, that's not happening.
[DOCTOR]: That's not happening.
[DOCTOR]: Well, you stop going and getting the big one.
[DOCTOR]: Say, I'm not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: I'm not doing that.
[DOCTOR]: Well, then where is that moment?
[DOCTOR]: Say, it no longer exists.
[DOCTOR]: It no longer exists.
[DOCTOR]: Bingo, which is what we want to get in.
[DOCTOR]: And as it starts to get in, what do you notice happening to the feelings?
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: I can breathe.
[DOCTOR]: I know you can breathe and see that earlier you thought by doing that and then subsequently doing more.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: That that was going to have him stop.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: The mean and hurtful words, the body shaming.
[DOCTOR]: How come you're not enough?
[DOCTOR]: You're this, that, that, this, that.
[DOCTOR]: Why?
[DOCTOR]: Because she was pledging her allegiance to
[PATIENT]: To the American flag.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, but not to the American flag.
[DOCTOR]: Nobody gets that fucker tattooed.
[DOCTOR]: I guess that's not true.
[DOCTOR]: Some people do.
[DOCTOR]: Some people get that tattooed, right?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, who've lost their damn mind.
[DOCTOR]: But as we're looking at it clearly, right?
[DOCTOR]: So now close your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: Picture that earlier.
[DOCTOR]: You let her know that him saying that and acting that way had nothing to do with you or the size of the tattoo.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know that even getting a bigger one or more didn't stop him from doing that so that she gets it.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know that him being that way was not about you.
[DOCTOR]: It was about him not being well so that she gets it.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Let her know that she didn't need him to be okay.
[DOCTOR]: In order for her to move out.
[DOCTOR]: In order for her to find her own place.
[DOCTOR]: In order for her to go to Iowa.
[DOCTOR]: In order for her to start college.
[DOCTOR]: In order for her to raise her daughter.
[DOCTOR]: In order for her to get a car.
[DOCTOR]: So that the earlier you is getting it, that you're okay.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And as this earlier you, Katie, starts to get it, what do you notice happening to her face?
[PATIENT]: It disappeared.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And as you're checking in your body, how's your body feeling now?
[PATIENT]: Calmer.
[PATIENT]: Like more at peace.
[PATIENT]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Calmer and more at peace.
[PATIENT]: Like I can breathe.
[DOCTOR]: You can, can't you?
[DOCTOR]: And you can breathe because breathing is happening because you're getting more space.
[DOCTOR]: Emotional space.
[DOCTOR]: You already got the physical space, but notice that it had been way close up.
[DOCTOR]: but now it's gaining space.
[DOCTOR]: And as you're gaining space, your head and your heart are beginning to become more in alignment, beginning to become more coherent.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Because that earlier you in that moment was really wanting to get him to love her in the way that she cared about him.
[DOCTOR]: yeah and as we're looking at it clearly the you know now that his love was about coercion manipulation psychological influence not about love yes that's why in the moment he goes wow i love you and i can't wait to get to you and so can you give me 60 bucks
[DOCTOR]: I mean, you're the one that's taking care of the kids, so you should have the money.
[DOCTOR]: I mean, all white kids, all white girls that are single moms have a shitload of money.
[PATIENT]: All of them.
[PATIENT]: Never met one who didn't have money.
[PATIENT]: Not one.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Whites just have a lot more money than blacks.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[PATIENT]: Always.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, right.
[PATIENT]: That's the only answer logically in this man's fucking tiny brain.
[DOCTOR]: Check inside of you.
[DOCTOR]: What are you noticing now?
[DOCTOR]: It's okay in there.
[DOCTOR]: You notice how it's becoming more okay, right?
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: It's becoming more okay.
[DOCTOR]: You're becoming more okay in you.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Because there was an aspect that thought that I needed...
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: His love in order for me to be okay.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: But that part hasn't been realizing that it's not worth it to me to devalue me for love that I don't get from him.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And see what's starting to happen, which is why I moved, which is why I left, which is why I got far away.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Is that I'm worth it.
[DOCTOR]: I am.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And it's not worth it for me to be with someone who doesn't get my worth.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And so again, just check inside.
[DOCTOR]: What are you noticing now?
[PATIENT]: Um, I mean, I felt a little like sadness, I guess, but like also, um,
[PATIENT]: Like it's not as heavy.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how it's already lightened up, even though there's a little bit of sadness.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: It's not as heavy.
[PATIENT]: It's like, I feel bad for like that girl, but like, I don't have to.
[DOCTOR]: What if we stopped feeling bad for her?
[DOCTOR]: What if we have her recognize?
[DOCTOR]: Cause you know that she just didn't know then.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: She just didn't, you know, now you just didn't know.
[DOCTOR]: It's not like she was intentionally going, you know what, I'm going to do this thing that later on I'm really going to wish I hadn't.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You follow me with that?
[DOCTOR]: She just didn't know.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, she didn't.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: She was thinking by doing that and having more, it was proving.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Ah, there's a good breath.
[DOCTOR]: So again, slightly lower your jaw.
[DOCTOR]: Relax the back of your tongue.
[DOCTOR]: Breathe a little bit slower and deeper.
[DOCTOR]: Exhale a little bit longer.
[DOCTOR]: Pay more attention to the space.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Notice that when your eyes are closed, you no longer see me or the screen.
[DOCTOR]: You don't see what's out in front of you.
[DOCTOR]: What you're really seeing is just the backs of your eyelids.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And we can tell that it's different because go ahead and open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: And as they're open, notice how you see me in the screen and everything that's in front of you.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Close your eyes again and notice that you don't see the screen anymore.
[DOCTOR]: You just see the backs of your eyelids.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And so without using your memory or your imagination, what do you see behind you?
[DOCTOR]: No memory, no imagination, but what do you see?
[DOCTOR]: Because that might surprise you that what you see is nothing.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[DOCTOR]: You see nothing behind you.
[DOCTOR]: So now, what would it be like to float into nothing?
[DOCTOR]: Being the space.
[DOCTOR]: Floating into nothingness.
[DOCTOR]: No one, no body, no thing, nowhere.
[DOCTOR]: Because what if in nothing is nothingness?
[DOCTOR]: field of potentiality meaning there's a you in however you want to be the one who's clear and calm and peaceful and free so that she's happy about what she's doing satisfied in having done it has much more flexibility and ease to move through the different stuff that might come her way that's right in nothing
[DOCTOR]: Bring your awareness back out of nothing.
[DOCTOR]: Reassociate in the now.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Take one more big, deep breath in.
[DOCTOR]: Nice, long exhale.
[DOCTOR]: And open your eyes.
[DOCTOR]: And how's your body feeling now?
[DOCTOR]: I'm like...
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Watch what starts to happen.
[DOCTOR]: I want you to think of him and think of that whole thing where there's been that push pull around like heart want to not, he is, he's not right.
[DOCTOR]: And feel some of the discomfort and notice that as you feel it, there's a little bit of it.
[DOCTOR]: But notice how it's already less.
[PATIENT]: It's not as heavy.
[DOCTOR]: It isn't as heavy.
[DOCTOR]: Just now get curious about the sensations because normally we freeze them and they're like a weight.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: We want to begin to subtly pay attention to how the sensations are changing because they're like a wave and a wave is in constant motion.
[DOCTOR]: It never stays the same.
[DOCTOR]: It's always moving.
[DOCTOR]: So as you get curious about what you're noticing about the sensations, even use the sound of curiosity.
[DOCTOR]: Go, hmm.
[DOCTOR]: I'm wondering how I'm able to notice these changing.
[DOCTOR]: Hmm.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Hmm.
[DOCTOR]: I'm getting a little bit curious.
[DOCTOR]: Even if they're not changing in the way I want them to, I'm just noticing how they're changing.
[DOCTOR]: Hmm.
[DOCTOR]: And as you are, what are you noticing happening to
[PATIENT]: I don't know.
[PATIENT]: They kind of doing this, you know?
[DOCTOR]: They are kind of doing this, aren't they?
[DOCTOR]: Mm-hmm.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that interesting?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And see, we know what it was like for you when you were able to get your own place, start school, and buy a car.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: And how all of it feels, right?
[DOCTOR]: When you got your own place, you started school, and you bought a car.
[DOCTOR]: And as you think about this, where are you feeling it in your body?
[PATIENT]: Like everywhere?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, it is.
[DOCTOR]: Like everywhere, isn't it?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And notice how it's different.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, way different.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And you can just notice the difference in the sensation.
[PATIENT]: It's just different.
[PATIENT]: It's like it's not heavy.
[DOCTOR]: No, it's light because you're feeling good.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: of what you've been able to accomplish and do and what you're doing.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: What's the schooling?
[PATIENT]: Human and family services.
[DOCTOR]: Good for you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: I want to work with, I want to do like what Misty does.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: So I have a lot of credibility.
[PATIENT]: yeah i will yeah right don't you think and like the place i i so i went to i went to a program out here yeah but they're like super like christian and so they didn't like they didn't do a lot of whole lot of like this kind of stuff sure right so there was like a lot of stuff that i needed to work on and i didn't get to work on and then i got out of that place and then
[PATIENT]: you know, I fell back into his trap and then, you know, I started kind of becoming that same girl again, you know, where like I'm fighting for him to want me.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: You know, and I wonder who would make sense for you to want you, maybe you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: I need to want him.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Maybe you can want you.
[DOCTOR]: I wonder what it would be like for you to begin to feel like you're worth it to you.
[DOCTOR]: I mean, that is why you moved.
[DOCTOR]: That's why you went to the program.
[DOCTOR]: That's why you started school.
[DOCTOR]: Cause you are worth it to you.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: You are.
[DOCTOR]: And that's starting to get installed even more.
[DOCTOR]: How much you're worth it to you.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: I am worth it.
[DOCTOR]: You are worth it.
[DOCTOR]: Aren't you?
[DOCTOR]: And I deserve more.
[DOCTOR]: So now think of him.
[DOCTOR]: Think of that conflictual stuff that shows up.
[DOCTOR]: You know, does he love me?
[DOCTOR]: Does he love me not?
[DOCTOR]: Does he love me?
[DOCTOR]: Should I be with him?
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: Like all that thing.
[DOCTOR]: And oh, he's really nice.
[DOCTOR]: And maybe we could.
[DOCTOR]: And he's the daughter of my, he's the father of my daughter.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: And feel a little bit of that, you know, discomfort.
[DOCTOR]: And just kind of notice it.
[DOCTOR]: Not doing anything with it.
[DOCTOR]: Just kind of notice the sensations.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: This is where you're feeling them.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: And now we're going to flip.
[DOCTOR]: Think about you starting college, right?
[DOCTOR]: Getting your own place, buying a car, like really taking care of you and how that kind of feels like all over.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Just notice the difference in the sensations.
[DOCTOR]: No judgment, no evaluation, just noticing the difference.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And then we're going to go back to him.
[DOCTOR]: Oh my goodness.
[DOCTOR]: Could I be with him?
[DOCTOR]: He's the father and maybe he'll be different this time.
[DOCTOR]: And okay.
[DOCTOR]: He really loves me.
[DOCTOR]: And I really want somebody to love me and right.
[DOCTOR]: And feel all that discomfort.
[DOCTOR]: Mm-hmm.
[DOCTOR]: I don't really feel it.
[DOCTOR]: I know.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that weird?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, it's really weird.
[DOCTOR]: It is really weird, isn't it?
[DOCTOR]: You're not.
[DOCTOR]: How are you?
[DOCTOR]: No.
[DOCTOR]: Try to really, really wanting, you know, affection from him.
[PATIENT]: I mean, a little, but not like.
[DOCTOR]: Right, good, perfect.
[DOCTOR]: Got a little bit of it.
[DOCTOR]: Notice the sensations.
[DOCTOR]: I got it.
[DOCTOR]: And again, just the sensations, that situation, just sensations.
[DOCTOR]: And now think about you.
[DOCTOR]: Getting your own car, starting school, having your own place.
[DOCTOR]: And what is it like feeling it all over?
[DOCTOR]: And how the feelings are different.
[DOCTOR]: Notice the sensations are different.
[PATIENT]: Okay.
[PATIENT]: I'm trying to get into that sensation.
[DOCTOR]: No, just think about it.
[DOCTOR]: Think about you.
[DOCTOR]: Having gotten your own car, what it was like to buy your own car, to have your own place, to start something, to better you.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: What's it like and how you feel it.
[DOCTOR]: And you notice this difference in the sensations.
[DOCTOR]: Okay.
[DOCTOR]: Right?
[DOCTOR]: Now back to him.
[DOCTOR]: Gosh, I really wish he would love me in the way that I wanted to be loved because I've been loved.
[DOCTOR]: And I really thought he did love me.
[DOCTOR]: And I showed him how much I cared about him because I got him and put stuff all over my body.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That girl really cares about you with that down there?
[DOCTOR]: Look at me.
[PATIENT]: That's right.
[PATIENT]: That's right.
[PATIENT]: How stupid is that?
[DOCTOR]: That's crazy.
[DOCTOR]: Look at me.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Look at me.
[DOCTOR]: I got more, huh?
[DOCTOR]: I really do.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And how much does that make him a nicer guy?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Now that totally took away him saying things about your body.
[PATIENT]: Right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Oh, that was good.
[DOCTOR]: I know.
[PATIENT]: I woke all these cats up.
[DOCTOR]: Notice what's starting to change.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: It's not anxiety.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: yeah okay right so again think about you moving on your own to a program getting out of the program there was that stuff with him and oh geez maybe we could and i'll be that person again and i really want him to want me because i really thought he did in that time when we were first together and yeah right and she just didn't know what you know she didn't no she didn't know right
[DOCTOR]: But think about you getting your own place, putting the stuff up and in that you want.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Think about you getting, buying your own car, starting school.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: And how I'm doing that because I know my struggles can make a difference for others.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: That's right, that I can let others know that you're not stuck there forever.
[DOCTOR]: You can get up too.
[DOCTOR]: And not just physical distance, but notice how much more freed up you are now.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: I know, isn't that cool?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Notice what's changing inside.
[PATIENT]: Like I can breathe.
[PATIENT]: That's what I feel like.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right, try to feel like you really want him.
[DOCTOR]: You know, because my daughter somewhat looks like him, so I really want him.
[DOCTOR]: Maybe we can brand her.
[DOCTOR]: Put his name on her too.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, fuck no.
[DOCTOR]: You're so good.
[DOCTOR]: See, notice how that's crystal clear when it pertains to her.
[DOCTOR]: There was no like, well, maybe.
[DOCTOR]: It's like, fuck.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Got it?
[PATIENT]: Yeah, hell no.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, hell no.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, 100%.
[DOCTOR]: Notice how there's conviction in that.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: You've got to be convicting me for me.
[DOCTOR]: Just check it out.
[DOCTOR]: What do you start noticing now?
[DOCTOR]: Knowing what you've already been able to accomplish.
[DOCTOR]: I'm free.
[DOCTOR]: You are.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And not just physically free.
[PATIENT]: Mentally, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: And emotionally.
[PATIENT]: Emotionally, yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Try to in your heart really feel like I really want to be with that guy.
[DOCTOR]: Now that I'm seeing the whole picture of who he is.
[DOCTOR]: Because I didn't know when I really wanted to be with him.
[DOCTOR]: I know, isn't that crazy?
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, I can.
[DOCTOR]: I didn't know when I really wanted to be with him in that moment.
[DOCTOR]: I didn't know who he really was.
[DOCTOR]: I didn't know that it was psychological manipulation.
[DOCTOR]: I didn't know that it was coercion.
[DOCTOR]: I didn't know.
[DOCTOR]: I didn't know.
[DOCTOR]: That earlier you is now seeing him for who he truly is.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Not about me.
[DOCTOR]: Not about me.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: Not about my girl.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: I mean, he's being a great dad.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: The only great thing that he's doing about being a great dad is he's not in her life.
[DOCTOR]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: That's the best thing that he's doing.
[DOCTOR]: is not being in her life.
[PATIENT]: That's good.
[DOCTOR]: I know.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: That's good.
[PATIENT]: I did that.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: You got him out of her life.
[PATIENT]: I did.
[DOCTOR]: You did.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: I did.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[PATIENT]: I did a lot of hard shit.
[DOCTOR]: I know you're a strong.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Fuck him.
[DOCTOR]: You're a tough motherfucker.
[DOCTOR]: I knew that from the get-go.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: I knew that from the get-go.
[PATIENT]: I mean, what can I say?
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Not just the external and tough in that way, it's in here.
[PATIENT]: Yes.
[DOCTOR]: Because I'm much more in alignment.
[PATIENT]: Yes, and I want to be.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Maybe I should be with him for her.
[PATIENT]: No.
No.
[DOCTOR]: Well, maybe I should get lucky number seven and that would really change him.
[DOCTOR]: Then he'd really know.
[PATIENT]: Yeah, that'd really change him.
[PATIENT]: That'd really fucking do it.
[PATIENT]: That'll do it, right?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: That'll make him truly want money.
[DOCTOR]: Totally.
[DOCTOR]: 100%.
[DOCTOR]: He'll never say anything bad about my body.
[PATIENT]: Ever again.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Or compare me to somebody else that makes me feel right.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: Try to really want him now.
[DOCTOR]: Oh, geez.
[DOCTOR]: I really wish it could be.
[PATIENT]: No, I can't.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: It can't be.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: It's never going to be.
[DOCTOR]: Well, you just don't.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[PATIENT]: You don't need it.
[DOCTOR]: It's not even that you can't.
[DOCTOR]: You just don't want him.
[PATIENT]: I don't.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: And see, here's the coolest part.
[DOCTOR]: When something shifts from can't to don't.
[DOCTOR]: It has no power.
[DOCTOR]: For example, conflict shows up if I say to somebody, you know, they say to me, would you like a cigarette?
[DOCTOR]: And I say to them, oh, no, I can't.
[DOCTOR]: It's very different.
[DOCTOR]: They might say back to me, oh, no.
[DOCTOR]: Because that has power over you.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah, just have one.
[DOCTOR]: Just have a puff.
[DOCTOR]: You don't have to have the whole one.
[DOCTOR]: Just have one.
[DOCTOR]: But if I say, oh, no, I can't, I can't, I can't.
[DOCTOR]: But watch what's different if I say to somebody, says to me, do you want a cigarette?
[DOCTOR]: And I say, no, I don't smoke.
[PATIENT]: You have the power.
[DOCTOR]: Do they keep asking?
[PATIENT]: No.
[DOCTOR]: No, I don't smoke.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Right.
[DOCTOR]: It stops being this conflictual thing.
[DOCTOR]: I just don't do that.
[DOCTOR]: So it has nothing to do with that you can't be with him.
[DOCTOR]: It's that you're not.
Right.
[DOCTOR]: And I don't want to.
[DOCTOR]: That's right, because he doesn't support what you're up to.
[DOCTOR]: That's fucking right.
[DOCTOR]: And see, to the extent that you're realizing it now, any interest in him is in direct conflict with what you want for you in your life.
[PATIENT]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[PATIENT]: He is in direct conflict.
[PATIENT]: I can't have that.
[DOCTOR]: No, because you're up for bigger and better things for you and your kiddo.
[PATIENT]: I know.
[DOCTOR]: Isn't that cool?
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[PATIENT]: Good job.
[PATIENT]: Me.
[DOCTOR]: Good job.
[DOCTOR]: You.
[PATIENT]: Yeah.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: That's right.
[DOCTOR]: You did great work today.
