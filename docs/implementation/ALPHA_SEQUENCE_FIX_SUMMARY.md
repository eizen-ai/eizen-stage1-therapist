# Alpha Sequence Integration - Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
System said "advancing to alpha sequence" but never actually executed it. The flow was:
```
3.1_assess_readiness → stage_1_complete (WRONG)
```

### Solution
Changed the flow to:
```
3.1_assess_readiness → 3.2_alpha_sequence → stage_1_complete (CORRECT)
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/core/session_state_manager.py`

**Changes:**
- Line 349-353: Changed 3.1 to advance to `3.2_alpha_sequence` instead of `stage_1_complete`
- Line 355-360: Added new state handler for `3.2_alpha_sequence`
- Line 58-60: Added alpha tracking variables (`alpha_complete`, `alpha_started`)

**Code:**
```python
# Line 349-360
elif self.current_substate == "3.1_assess_readiness":
    if (self.stage_1_completion["pattern_understood"] and
        self.stage_1_completion["rapport_established"]):
        # Advance to alpha sequence instead of completing immediately
        return True, "3.2_alpha_sequence"

elif self.current_substate == "3.2_alpha_sequence":
    # Alpha sequence completion is handled by AlphaSequence class
    if hasattr(self, 'alpha_complete') and self.alpha_complete:
        self.stage_1_completion["ready_for_stage_2"] = True
        return True, "stage_1_complete"
```

### 2. `src/core/improved_ollama_system.py`

**Changes:**
- Line 19: Import `AlphaSequence` class
- Line 55: Initialize `self.alpha_sequence = None`
- Line 115-117: Check for alpha state and route to handler
- Line 146-194: New method `_handle_alpha_sequence()` for alpha execution

**Code:**
```python
# Line 115-117 - Route to alpha handler
if session_state.current_substate == "3.2_alpha_sequence":
    print(f"🧘 Alpha sequence active...")
    return self._handle_alpha_sequence(client_input, session_state, navigation_output, start_time)

# Line 146-194 - Alpha handler
def _handle_alpha_sequence(self, client_input, session_state, navigation_output, start_time):
    """Handle alpha sequence execution"""

    # Initialize alpha sequence if first time
    if not session_state.alpha_started:
        self.alpha_sequence = AlphaSequence()
        result = self.alpha_sequence.start_sequence()
        session_state.alpha_started = True
        therapist_response = f"{result['instruction']} {result['checkpoint_question']}"

    else:
        # Process checkpoint response
        result = self.alpha_sequence.process_checkpoint_response(client_input)
        therapist_response = result['response']

        if result.get('checkpoint_question'):
            therapist_response += f" {result['checkpoint_question']}"

        # Check if sequence is complete
        if result.get('action') == 'sequence_complete':
            session_state.alpha_complete = True
            session_state.current_substate = "stage_1_complete"
            print("   ✅ Alpha sequence complete!")

    # Return formatted response...
```

## How Alpha Sequence Works Now

### Flow:
1. **3.1_assess_readiness completes** → Advances to 3.2_alpha_sequence
2. **First alpha turn:**
   - System: "Let's do something simple. Lower your jaw slightly..."
   - System: "As you do that, are you feeling more tense or more calm?"
3. **Client responds:** "Calmer"
4. **Second step:**
   - System: "Good. Now, relax your tongue..."
   - System: "More tense or more calm?"
5. **Client responds:** "Calmer"
6. **Third step:**
   - System: "That's right. Now, breathe a little slower..."
   - System: "More tense or more calm?"
7. **Client responds:** "Calmer"
8. **Completion:**
   - System: "Perfect. Notice how your body feels now compared to when we started. You've just shifted your brain state."
   - Advances to `stage_1_complete`

### Resistance Handling:
If client says "more tense" or "weird":
- System normalizes: "Of course it feels different - you've never done this before..."
- Retries checkpoint: "More tense or more calm now?"

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (5 minutes):

```bash
cd /media/eizen-4/2TB/gaurav/AI\ Therapist/Therapist2
python3 -m src.core.improved_ollama_system
```

**Test Sequence:**
1. "I want to feel calm" → Goal
2. "Yes" → Accept vision
3. Continue through psycho-education
4. "Work stress" → Problem
5. "Chest" → Body location
6. "Tight" → Sensation
7. "Yes, right now" → Present moment
8. "When I see my calendar, I worry, then my chest tightens" → Pattern
9. "No, that's all" → Triggers 3.2_alpha_sequence
10. **"Calmer"** → Alpha step 1
11. **"Calmer"** → Alpha step 2
12. **"Calmer"** → Alpha step 3
13. **"stage_1_complete"** → Success!

## What to Test

### Critical Tests:
1. ✅ Alpha sequence triggers after 3.1
2. ✅ Three-step sequence executes (jaw, tongue, breathing)
3. ✅ Checkpoints ask "more tense or more calm?"
4. ✅ Completes and advances to stage_1_complete
5. ✅ Resistance normalization works

### Use BMAD Format:
See `BMAD_TESTING_PROTOCOL.md` for structured testing approach

```
📊 [State: 3.1_assess_readiness, Body Q's: 3/3, Time: 1.2s]

👤 YOU: No, that's all

🤔 Processing... Done!
🧘 Alpha sequence active...

🩺 THERAPIST: "Let's do something simple. Lower your jaw slightly - just let it drop a little. Not all the way, just enough to release the tension. As you do that, are you feeling more tense or more calm?"

📊 [State: 3.2_alpha_sequence, Body Q's: 3/3, Time: 0.1s]

👤 YOU: Calmer

🤔 Processing... Done!
🧘 Alpha sequence active...

🩺 THERAPIST: "Good. Now, relax your tongue. Let it rest gently in your mouth, not pressed against anything. More tense or more calm?"

📊 [State: 3.2_alpha_sequence, Body Q's: 3/3, Time: 0.1s]

👤 YOU: Calmer

🤔 Processing... Done!
🧘 Alpha sequence active...

🩺 THERAPIST: "That's right. Now, breathe a little slower. Not forcing it, just allowing your breath to slow down naturally. More tense or more calm?"

📊 [State: 3.2_alpha_sequence, Body Q's: 3/3, Time: 0.1s]

👤 YOU: Much calmer

🤔 Processing... Done!
🧘 Alpha sequence active...
   ✅ Alpha sequence complete!

🩺 THERAPIST: "Perfect. Notice how your body feels now compared to when we started. You've just shifted your brain state."

📊 [State: stage_1_complete, Body Q's: 3/3, Time: 0.1s]
```
