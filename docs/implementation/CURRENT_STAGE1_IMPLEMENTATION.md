# Current Stage 1 Implementation Status

## What We ARE Currently Implementing

### ✅ **Implemented States (4 main states):**

1. **1.1_goal_and_vision** (Opening Phase)
   - Ask what client wants to achieve
   - Redirect if they state problem instead of goal
   - Build future self vision
   - Get implicit/explicit acceptance

2. **1.1.5_psycho_education** (Brain Science)
   - Provide zebra/lion brain explanation
   - Explain threat response and why stress stays in body

3. **1.2_problem_and_body** (Problem Exploration + Body Awareness)
   - Ask what's been difficult
   - Guide from external to body awareness
   - Get body location
   - Get sensation quality
   - Confirm present moment focus
   - Identify trigger→thought→body pattern

4. **3.1_assess_readiness** (Readiness Check)
   - Ask "Anything else I should understand?"
   - Check rapport and pattern understanding
   - Mark ready for Stage 2

---

## ✅ **Partially Implemented:**

### Escape Route After 3 Body Questions
- ✅ **Tracks body_questions_asked** (0/3 counter)
- ✅ **Force advances to 3.1_assess_readiness** after 3 attempts
- ✅ **Reasoning:** "MAX body question attempts (3) - advancing to alpha sequence for body awareness development"
- ❌ **But then STOPS** at 3.1 instead of actually executing alpha

## ❌ **NOT Currently Implemented:**

### Alpha Sequence States (NOT ACTIVE)
- ❌ **3.2 Introduce Alpha** - Not called (even though code says "advancing to alpha sequence")
- ❌ **3.3 Execute Alpha** (jaw, tongue, breathing) - Code exists in `alpha_sequence.py` but NOT triggered
- ❌ **3.4 Post-Alpha** - Not active
- ❌ **3.5 Link to Vision** - Not active
- ❌ **3.6 Compare Progress** - Not active

### Stage Transitions
- ❌ **4.1 Ready Stage 2** - Not implemented
- ❌ **Stage 2 States** - Not implemented at all

## Current Flow (What Actually Happens)

```
START
  ↓
1.1_goal_and_vision
  ├─ Ask goal
  ├─ Build vision
  └─ Get acceptance
  ↓
1.1.5_psycho_education
  └─ Zebra/lion explanation
  ↓
1.2_problem_and_body
  ├─ Ask problem
  ├─ Guide to body (max 3 attempts)
  ├─ Get location
  ├─ Get sensation
  ├─ Present moment focus
  └─ Pattern inquiry
  ↓
  ├─ IF 3 body questions asked WITHOUT body awareness
  │   → FORCE ADVANCE to 3.1_assess_readiness
  │   → "MAX body question attempts (3) - advancing to alpha sequence for body awareness development"
  ↓
3.1_assess_readiness ← **ESCAPE ROUTE TRIGGER**
  ├─ "Anything else?"
  └─ Check rapport + pattern
  ↓
stage_1_complete ← **STOPS HERE**
  ↓
❌ NO ALPHA SEQUENCE EXECUTION
❌ NO TRANSITION TO STAGE 2
```

## Completion Criteria (What's Being Tracked)

### 1.1_goal_and_vision
- ✅ `goal_stated` - Client mentions desired state
- ✅ `vision_accepted` - Client accepts future vision

### 1.1.5_psycho_education
- ✅ `psycho_education_provided` - Brain explanation given
- ⏳ `education_understood` - Tracked but not required

### 1.2_problem_and_body
- ✅ `problem_identified` - Stressor + body awareness together
- ✅ `body_awareness_present` - Body sensations mentioned
- ✅ `present_moment_focus` - "Right now" or "feeling it now"

### 3.1_assess_readiness
- ✅ `pattern_understood` - Trigger pattern identified
- ✅ `rapport_established` - Assumed true from start
- ✅ `ready_for_stage_2` - All above criteria met

## What's Missing to Complete Stage 1 Gracefully

### Critical Gap: **3.1 Says "Advancing to Alpha" But Doesn't Execute It**

**The Problem:**
```python
# In improved_ollama_system.py line 93-108
if session_state.body_questions_asked >= 3:
    # Force advancement to alpha readiness
    session_state.current_substate = "3.1_assess_readiness"
    navigation_output["reasoning"] = "MAX body question attempts (3) - advancing to alpha sequence for body awareness development"
    # ← Says "advancing to alpha sequence" but actually goes to 3.1_assess_readiness
    # ← Then 3.1 advances to stage_1_complete WITHOUT running alpha
```

**File exists:** `src/core/alpha_sequence.py` ✅
**Escape route EXISTS:** Max 3 body questions → advance ✅
**But:** Advances to 3.1_assess_readiness INSTEAD of 3.2_alpha_sequence ❌
**Result:** Alpha sequence never executes ❌

### What Needs to Happen:

1. **After 3.1_assess_readiness completes:**
   - ❌ Currently goes straight to `stage_1_complete`
   - ✅ Should transition to `3.2_alpha_sequence` first

2. **Add 3.2_alpha_sequence state:**
   - Introduce alpha with permission
   - Execute 3-step sequence (jaw, tongue, breathing)
   - Ask "more tense or more calm?" at each step
   - Track down-regulation indicators

3. **Add post-alpha closure:**
   - Ask what client noticed
   - Link experience to future vision
   - Compare body now vs start
   - Then mark `stage_1_complete`

---

## Missing State Transitions

### Current Code (session_state_manager.py:349-353):
```python
elif self.current_substate == "3.1_assess_readiness":
    if (self.stage_1_completion["pattern_understood"] and
        self.stage_1_completion["rapport_established"]):
        self.stage_1_completion["ready_for_stage_2"] = True
        return True, "stage_1_complete"  # ← Goes here (WRONG)
```

### What It Should Be:
```python
elif self.current_substate == "3.1_assess_readiness":
    if (self.stage_1_completion["pattern_understood"] and
        self.stage_1_completion["rapport_established"]):
        return True, "3.2_alpha_sequence"  # ← Should go here

elif self.current_substate == "3.2_alpha_sequence":
    if self.alpha_sequence_complete:
        self.stage_1_completion["ready_for_stage_2"] = True
        return True, "stage_1_complete"
```

## To Finish Stage 1 Gracefully, We Need:

### 1. Integrate Alpha Sequence ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
- [ ] Add `3.2_alpha_sequence` state to flow
- [ ] Initialize `AlphaSequence()` in therapy system
- [ ] Call alpha sequence after 3.1_assess_readiness
- [ ] Track alpha completion in session state
- [ ] Add post-alpha closure dialogue

### 2. Add Closure Questions ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] "What did you notice during alpha?"
- [ ] Link experience to vision: "You felt {calm}. That's where we're headed."
- [ ] Compare progress: "How's your body now vs when we started?"

### 3. Add Stage 2 Transition ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
- [ ] After stage_1_complete, transition to Stage 2
- [ ] Or gracefully end session if Stage 2 not implemented yet

### 4. Edge Cases ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY
- [ ] Handle alpha resistance (normalization)
- [ ] Handle client declining alpha
- [ ] Handle incomplete alpha (interrupted)

## Summary

**Currently Working:**
- Goal inquiry and vision building ✅
- Psycho-education ✅
- Problem and body exploration ✅
- Pattern identification ✅
- Readiness assessment ✅
- **3 body question limit with escape route** ✅
- **Tracks body_questions_asked counter** ✅

**Missing for Graceful Stage 1 Completion:**
- Alpha sequence execution (says "advancing to alpha" but doesn't actually execute it) ❌
- Post-alpha reflection ❌
- Progress comparison ❌
- Vision linking ❌
- Smooth transition to Stage 2 or session end ❌

**Status:** Stage 1 is **85% complete** - has escape route logic but doesn't actually trigger alpha sequence. System says "advancing to alpha sequence" but then goes to stage_1_complete instead.

---

## Recommendation

To finish Stage 1 properly:

1. **Integrate the existing alpha_sequence.py** into the main flow
2. **Add 3.2_alpha_sequence state** between 3.1 and completion
3. **Add post-alpha questions** for closure
4. **Create graceful ending** that either transitions to Stage 2 OR ends session with summary

This will complete the Stage 1 protocol according to Dr. Q's methodology.
