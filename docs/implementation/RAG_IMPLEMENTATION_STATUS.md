# RAG Implementation Status & Next Steps

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** ‚úÖ Clean embeddings loaded, RAG logging active

---

## ‚úÖ Completed

### 1. Fixed Corrupt Embeddings
- **Problem:** `all_dr_q_exchanges.json` had accumulating doctor text bug
- **Solution:** Using `complete_embedding_dataset.json` (1000 clean exchanges from sessions 1,2,3)
- **Result:** System now has high-quality embeddings

### 2. Added Comprehensive Logging
**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/embedding_and_retrieval_setup.py` - Added RAG retrieval logging
- `src/agents/improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py` - Added bypass/usage logging

**Log Output Examples:**
```
üìã BYPASSING RAG: Using rule-based goal clarification
üìã BYPASSING RAG: Using rule-based vision building
üìã BYPASSING LLM: Using rule-based affirmation (RAG examples retrieved but not used)
üéØ USING RAG for decision: body_symptoms_exploration
üîç RAG RETRIEVAL CALLED
   ‚Üí Query Context: dr_q_body_symptom_present_moment_inquiry
   ‚Üí Found 3 results
‚úÖ RAG RETRIEVED 3 EXAMPLES:
   1. Similarity: 0.616 | session_01_004_content
ü§ñ GENERATING LLM RESPONSE with 3 RAG examples
```

### 3. Deployed & Tested
- ‚úÖ Docker container rebuilt with new logging code
- ‚úÖ System running on port 8090
- ‚úÖ Logging confirms RAG loading: "Loaded index from /app/data/embeddings/trt_rag_index.faiss"
- ‚úÖ 1000 clean embeddings active

## üìä Current RAG Usage Pattern

Based on logging observations:

### **Scenarios that BYPASS RAG** (Rule-Based):
1. **Goal Clarification** - Consistent opening question
2. **Vision Building** - Templated vision construction
3. **Psycho-Education** - Zebra-lion explanation
4. **Affirmations** - "That's right", "Yeah", "Got it"
5. **I Don't Know Responses** - Vision language menu
6. **Safety/Crisis** - No-harm framework
7. **Past/Thinking Redirects** - Standard redirects
8. **Alpha Sequence** - Structured process

### **Scenarios that COULD Use RAG** (Currently Limited):
1. **Body Symptom Exploration** - After client describes symptoms
2. **Problem Inquiry** - When exploring "what's making it hard"
3. **Pattern Recognition** - "How do you know" questions
4. **Present Moment Focus** - Somatic awareness questions
5. **General Therapeutic Responses** - Unexpected client responses

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### **Option A: Expand RAG Usage (Recommended)**

**Target Scenarios for RAG Integration:**

1. **Body Exploration Questions** (Priority 1)
   - Current: "What kind of sensation? Ache? Tight? Sharp?"
   - With RAG: Retrieve Dr. Q's actual phrasing from similar body exploration moments
   - Benefit: More natural, varied questions based on learned examples

2. **Problem Inquiry** (Priority 2)
   - Current: "What's been making it hard for you?"
   - With RAG: Use examples of how Dr. Q explores problems in similar contexts
   - Benefit: Better contextual exploration

3. **Pattern/Readiness Questions** (Priority 3)
   - Current: "What haven't I understood? Is there more I should know?"
   - With RAG: Retrieve examples of readiness assessment
   - Benefit: More nuanced inquiry

**Implementation Plan:**
```python
# In improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py, around line 183-197:

# Instead of bypassing with affirmation for ALL cases:
if self._should_affirm_and_proceed(...):
    # Check if it's a body exploration scenario
    if session_state.body_questions_asked > 0 and len(rag_examples) > 0:
        # Use RAG + LLM for body follow-up
        self.logger.info(f"ü§ñ USING RAG for body exploration follow-up")
        return self._generate_llm_therapeutic_response(...)
    else:
        # Keep rule-based for other affirmations
        return self._generate_affirmation_response(...)
```

### **Option B: Keep Current System + Monitoring**

**Pros:**
- System is stable and working well
- Rules ensure consistency
- RAG is ready when needed

**Actions:**
- Monitor logs to see if/when RAG is actually called
- Document which paths trigger LLM+RAG vs rules
- Validate that current approach meets quality standards

---

## üìà Metrics to Track

To understand RAG effectiveness, monitor:

1. **RAG Call Rate**
   - Count: `grep "üîç RAG RETRIEVAL CALLED" logs`
   - Goal: Understand how often RAG is invoked

2. **Bypass Rate**
   - Count: `grep "üìã BYPASSING" logs`
   - Shows rule-based vs RAG-driven responses

3. **LLM Generation with RAG**
   - Count: `grep "ü§ñ GENERATING LLM RESPONSE" logs`
   - Shows actual RAG example usage in prompts

4. **Similarity Scores**
   - Average similarity of retrieved examples
   - Goal: >0.5 indicates good matches

---

## üîß Quick Test Commands

**Test RAG Logging:**
```bash
# Create session
SID=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/v1/session/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' | \
  python3 -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['session_id'])")

# Send message
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/v1/session/$SID/input \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_input": "I feel chest tightness when stressed"}' > /dev/null

# Check logs
docker logs trt-app 2>&1 | tail -30 | grep -E "üìã|üéØ|üîç|ü§ñ|‚úÖ RAG"
```

**View All RAG Activity:**
```bash
docker logs trt-app 2>&1 | grep -E "RAG|BYPASS|USING" | tail -50
```

## üìÅ Files Modified

1. **`src/utils/embedding_and_retrieval_setup.py`**
   - Added logging to `get_few_shot_examples()` method
   - Tracks: query context, retrieval results, similarity scores

2. **`src/agents/improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py`**
   - Added logging at decision points (lines 166, 171, 175, 185, 190, 194)
   - Shows: bypass reasons, RAG usage, LLM generation

3. **`data/embeddings/`**
   - `trt_rag_index.faiss` (1.5MB) - Clean FAISS index
   - `trt_rag_metadata.json` (1.1MB) - 1000 clean exchanges

4. **`EMBEDDING_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md`**
   - Documents the embedding corruption issue and fix

---

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

**Current State:**
- Docker container has logging code via manual copy (`docker cp`)
- For permanent deployment, rebuild image: `docker compose build trt-app`
- Restart to apply: `docker restart trt-app`

**Future Deployments:**
- Docker build sometimes caches COPY steps
- Use `--no-cache` to force refresh: `docker compose build --no-cache trt-app`

## üí° Discussion Points

**For your consideration:**

1. **Should we increase RAG usage in body exploration?**
   - Pros: More natural, learned responses
   - Cons: Less predictable, may break flow

2. **How many RAG examples per query?**
   - Current: 3 examples
   - Could increase for more variety
   - Or decrease for faster responses

3. **When to use rules vs RAG?**
   - Safety/critical paths ‚Üí Rules
   - Exploratory questions ‚Üí RAG
   - Hybrid approach working well so far

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

Your system is now:
1. ‚úÖ Using clean, high-quality embeddings (1000 exchanges)
2. ‚úÖ Logging all RAG activity for visibility
3. ‚úÖ Ready to expand RAG usage where beneficial
4. ‚úÖ Maintaining consistency with rules where needed

**Next Decision:** Do you want to proceed with **Option A** (expand RAG usage) or **Option B** (keep current + monitor)?
