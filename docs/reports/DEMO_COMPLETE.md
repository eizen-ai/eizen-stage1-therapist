## 📋 QUICK OVERVIEW

### What Is This?

An AI conversation system that guides clients through **Stage 1 of Dr. Q's Trauma Resiliency Training (TRT)**:

- **31 carefully designed states** managing therapeutic conversation flow
- **LLaMA AI agents** for natural language understanding and generation
- **Safety-first design** with crisis detection and intervention
- **Loop prevention** ensuring sessions always progress forward
- **Framework integration** for alpha sequences, card games, and safety protocols

### Key Features

✅ **Smart Routing** - Detects client needs and guides conversation appropriately
✅ **Safety Protocols** - Automatic detection of self-harm mentions with immediate intervention
✅ **Loop Prevention** - Max 3 attempts with escape routes prevent getting stuck
✅ **Crisis Handling** - Specialized states for panic, resistance, and difficult situations
✅ **Natural Flow** - 60%+ affirmation vs questioning for therapeutic rapport

## 🏗️ HOW IT WORKS

### System Architecture

```
CLIENT INPUT → MASTER AGENT (LLaMA) → CSV STATE LOOKUP → FRAMEWORK CHECK →
DIALOGUE AGENT (RAG) → RESPONSE OUTPUT → NEXT STATE
```

#### **1. Master Agent (LLaMA)**
- Classifies client intent semantically (NOT keyword matching)
- "peaceful" = "calm" = "ecstatic" = same intent
- Detects: self-harm, thinking mode, past tense, body awareness, intensity
- Priority routing: SELFHARM > THINK/PAST > AFFIRM > Normal flow

#### **2. CSV State-Action Pairs**
- 31 states defined in `STAGE1_COMPLETE.csv`
- Each state has: RAG query, fallback response, framework triggers, routing logic
- Loop counters track repetitions, trigger escapes after 3 attempts

#### **3. Framework Triggers**
- **alpha_sequence** (State 3.3): Guided body relaxation, 6 steps
- **no_harm** (SELFHARM/CRISIS): Safety assessment and crisis intervention
- **card_game** (SILENT/2.1_seek): Non-verbal body awareness for stuck clients
- **metaphors** (on-demand): Concept explanation from vector DB

#### **4. Dialogue Agent (LLaMA + RAG)**
- Retrieves similar Dr. Q examples from vector database
- Generates natural, therapeutic responses in Dr. Q's style
- Falls back to CSV responses if RAG unavailable

### Priority Redirects (Can Interrupt Anytime)

```
ANY STATE
    ↓
PRIORITY CHECK:
    1. SELFHARM? → SELFHARM state + no_harm framework (HIGHEST)
    2. THINK? → THINK state (redirect thinking→feeling, MAX 3→alpha)
    3. PAST? → PAST state (redirect past→present, MAX 3→alpha)
    4. BODY+PRESENT? → AFFIRM state (60%+ of time)
    5. Normal → Continue progression
```

### Special States

- **EMOTION** - High intensity ("I'm SO STRESSED!!!") → validate + ground
- **CRY** - Client crying → normalize tears
- **SILENT** - Long pauses → gentle prompt, then card_game
- **OFF** - Off-topic → gentle redirect
- **VALID** - "Is this normal?" → normalize experience
- **RELATION** - People-pleasing patterns → redirect to body feeling
- **CRISIS** - Severe panic/incoherent → safety assessment
- **RESISTANCE** - "This isn't helping" → explain process
- **RAMBLING** - Excessive detail → gentle interrupt + refocus
