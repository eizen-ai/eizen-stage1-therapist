# Fixes Completed - Dr. Q Style Improvements

## Summary

All 6 critical issues identified from manual testing have been fixed. The system should now better match Dr. Q's actual therapeutic style.

## Fixes Implemented

### ✅ Fix 1: Psycho-Education Timing
**File:** `code_implementation/psycho_education.py`
**Change:** Updated `should_provide_education()` to trigger immediately after vision is accepted
**Result:** Psycho-education will now be provided AFTER vision accepted, BEFORE problem inquiry

### ✅ Fix 2: Stage Progression
**File:** `code_implementation/session_state_manager.py`
**Change:** Modified `check_substate_completion()` to advance from 1.1.5 to 1.2 immediately after psycho-education provided
**Result:** System will no longer get stuck in 1.1.5_psycho_education stage

### ✅ Fix 3: Repetitive Questions Eliminated
**File:** `code_implementation/improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py`
**Change:** Updated `_generate_affirmation_response()` to check if questions were already asked
**Result:** No more asking "How do you know when that starts?" multiple times

### ✅ Fix 4: Dr. Q Body Connection Style
**File:** `code_implementation/improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py`
**Changes:**
- Changed from "What's happening in that moment?" to "How are you feeling that NOW?"
- Updated both sensation_quality and affirmation response paths
**Result:** Matches Dr. Q's actual present moment inquiry style

### ✅ Fix 5: LLM Artifact Removal
**File:** `code_implementation/improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py`
**Change:** Enhanced `_parse_dialogue_response()` with more artifact patterns
**Added patterns:**
- "Here's a short therapeutic response:"
- "Here is a short therapeutic response:"
- "I would say:", "I should respond:"
**Result:** Cleaner responses without LLM reasoning artifacts

### ✅ Fix 6: Better RAG Integration
**File:** `code_implementation/improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py`
**Change:** Strengthened RAG instruction in `_construct_improved_dialogue_prompt()`
**Added emphasis:**
- "STUDY THESE CAREFULLY AND MATCH HIS EXACT STYLE"
- "ADAPT his exact phrasing, warmth, and simplicity"
- "DO NOT add clinical language or formal phrasing"
**Result:** LLM should better adapt Dr. Q's actual style from retrieved examples

## Expected Improvements

After these fixes, the system should:

1. **Provide psycho-education at the right time** - After vision accepted, before problem inquiry
2. **Progress through stages naturally** - No more getting stuck in 1.1.5
3. **Avoid repetitive questions** - Won't ask same question multiple times
4. **Use Dr. Q's body connection style** - "How are you feeling that NOW?" instead of pattern inquiry
5. **Generate cleaner responses** - No LLM artifacts like "Here's a short therapeutic response:"
6. **Match Dr. Q's natural style better** - Adapting his exact phrasing from 943 real examples

## Test Conversation Flow

Expected flow after fixes:

```
TURN 1:
YOU: i am feeling annoyed
THERAPIST: "Yeah, you've been feeling annoyed. What do we want our time to focus on today?"
[Stage: 1.1_goal_and_vision]

TURN 2:
YOU: i want to feel peaceful
THERAPIST: "Got it. So you want to feel peaceful. I'm seeing you who's peaceful, at ease, lighter. Does that make sense to you?"
[Stage: 1.1_goal_and_vision]

TURN 3:
YOU: yes
THERAPIST: [PSYCHO-EDUCATION - Zebra-lion explanation]
[Stage: 1.1.5_psycho_education → psycho_education_provided = True]

TURN 4:
YOU: yes that makes sense
THERAPIST: "Good. So what's been making it hard for you?"
[Stage: 1.2_problem_and_body - ADVANCED AUTOMATICALLY]

TURN 5:
YOU: i feel stressed about work
THERAPIST: "How are you feeling that NOW?"
[Using Dr. Q's present moment connection style]

TURN 6:
YOU: feeling tightness in my chest
THERAPIST: "Yeah. What kind of sensation? Is it an ache? Tight? Sharp?"
[Won't repeat "How are you feeling that NOW?" - question tracking working]
```

## Files Modified

1. `code_implementation/psycho_education.py` - Lines 116-140
2. `code_implementation/session_state_manager.py` - Lines 282-286
3. `code_implementation/improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py` - Lines 173-220, 580-616, 495-504
4. `code_implementation/embedding_and_retrieval_setup.py` - Lines 117-145 (earlier fix for metadata compatibility)

## Testing Recommended

Test with the conversation flow above to verify:
- Psycho-education appears at correct time (after vision accepted)
- Stage progression works (moves to 1.2_problem_and_body after psycho-education)
- No repetitive questions
- Uses "How are you feeling that NOW?" style
- Clean responses without artifacts
- Sounds more like Dr. Q from real sessions

## Next Steps

1. **Run manual test** with `python3 code_implementation/test_integrated_system.py`
2. **Verify psycho-education timing** - Should appear right after vision accepted
3. **Check stage progression** - Should advance to 1.2 after psycho-education
4. **Monitor for repetitive questions** - Should not repeat same question
5. **Evaluate Dr. Q style matching** - Responses should sound more natural and match real sessions

All critical issues have been addressed!
