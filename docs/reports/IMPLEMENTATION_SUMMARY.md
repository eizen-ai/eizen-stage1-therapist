# Dr. Q Recommendations Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implementation of Dr. Q's language techniques and therapeutic priorities for the AI Therapist system.

## Key Principles (From Dr. Q's Guidance)

### 1. Body Sensation Inquiry
**IMPORTANT: Don't push hard**
- Looking for: WHERE it feels in body, HOW it feels, SENSATION quality
- Answers can be VAGUE - that's okay
- **Goal**: Shift attention from thinking → sensory system
- Ask: "If you had to describe the sensation, or any specific body part where it is, where would it be and how is it?"
- Accept vague responses: "ache", "soft", "tight", anything
- **Key**: ENGAGEMENT (not precision), ACKNOWLEDGMENT (make them feel heard)

### 2. Tense Usage Strategy
**Put stress/problems in PAST, good things in PRESENT**
- "I am depressed" → "So you've been FEELING depressed?" (past tense + feeling insertion)
- Problems: "has had" not "is having"
- Desired states: "feeling calm NOW", "being at ease in this moment"
- Present focus: "What are you FEELING right now?"

### 3. Attention Shift Triangle
**FROM → TO**
- Thinking → Feeling
- Past → Present
- Problem → Body/Senses
- External → Internal

### 4. Engagement & Acknowledgment
- Acknowledge every response warmly: "That's right", "Yeah", "Got it"
- Make them feel HEARD
- Don't repeat questions
- Accept answers and move forward

## Implemented Modules

### 1. **language_techniques.py**
- Tense shifting: "I am X" → "You've been feeling X?"
- Feeling insertions: separate identity from state
- Past tense enforcement for problems
- Metaphor detection

### 2. **engagement_tracker.py**
- Confirmation detection ("Yes", "Okay")
- Silence/disengagement monitoring
- Intervention triggers
- Human handoff recommendations

### 3. **vision_language_templates.py**
- "I don't know" → offer vision language
- Universal positive outcomes: "lighter", "at ease", "free", "calm"
- Context-specific templates (goal, feelings, body awareness)
- Generic outcome framework

### 4. **psycho_education.py**
- Zebra-lion brain explanation (before problem inquiry)
- 3 versions: full, concise, brief
- Normalizes stress response
- Prepares for problem inquiry

### 5. **alpha_sequence.py**
- Structured down-regulation sequence
- Checkpoints: "More tense or more calm?"
- Resistance normalization
- Down-regulation indicator tracking

### 6. **input_preprocessing.py** (Updated)
- "I don't know" detection
- Context classification (goal, feelings, body_awareness)
- Integrated with existing self-harm, thinking mode, past tense detection

## Navigation Flow Update

**NEW SEQUENCE:**
```
1.1 Goal & Vision
  ↓
1.1.5 Psycho-Education (zebra-lion)
  ↓
1.2 Problem & Body
  ↓
1.3 Readiness Assessment
```

## Priority System Implementation

**Response Priority Hierarchy:**
1. **Past → Present redirection** (if past tense detected)
2. **Safety checks** (self-harm detection)
3. **Body sensation engagement** (shift to sensory awareness)
4. **Thinking → Feeling redirect** (if analysis mode detected)
5. **"I don't know" → Vision language** (offer universal outcomes)
6. **Engagement acknowledgment** (affirm and proceed)

## Key Implementation Details

### Body Awareness Approach (Following Dr. Q)
```python
# SOFT approach - don't push hard
if body_inquiry_needed:
    # Artfully vague, accepting
    response = "Where do you feel that in your body? If you had to point to one area, where would it be?"

    # Accept VAGUE answers
    if client_gives_location:
        acknowledge = "That's right."  # Make them feel heard
        next_q = "What kind of sensation? Ache? Soft? Tight? Anything at all?"

        # Accept ANY answer - key is engagement, not precision
```

### Tense Management
```python
# Problem statements → PAST
"the problem is affecting you" → "the problem has affected you"

# Desired states → PRESENT
"you want to feel calm" → "you're feeling calmer NOW"
"imagine being at ease" → "notice feeling at ease in this moment"
```

### Engagement Flow
```python
# Acknowledge → Proceed (don't repeat)
Client: "My chest feels tight"
Therapist: "That's right. What kind of sensation? Ache? Pressure?"

Client: "Pressure"
Therapist: "Got it. You're feeling that right now, aren't you?"
# (NOT repeating "what kind of sensation")
```

## Integration Points

### In improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py:
1. Import all new modules
2. Initialize in __init__:
   - LanguageTechniques
   - EngagementTracker
   - VisionLanguageTemplates
   - PsychoEducation
   - AlphaSequence

3. Add priority checks in generate_response():
   - Check "I don't know" → use vision templates
   - Check engagement level → intervene if needed
   - Apply language techniques to all responses

4. Update _generate_affirmation_response():
   - Use language techniques for tense shifting
   - Apply engagement acknowledgment patterns

5. Add psycho-education handler:
   - Trigger after vision accepted
   - Use PsychoEducation.provide_education()
   - Mark completion in session state

6. Integrate alpha sequence:
   - Trigger when ready for down-regulation
   - Track checkpoints
   - Normalize resistance

## Testing Strategy

1. **Language Techniques Test**
   ```bash
   python code_implementation/language_techniques.py
   ```

2. **Engagement Tracker Test**
   ```bash
   python code_implementation/engagement_tracker.py
   ```

3. **Vision Language Test**
   ```bash
   python code_implementation/vision_language_templates.py
   ```

4. **Psycho-Education Test**
   ```bash
   python code_implementation/psycho_education.py
   ```

5. **Alpha Sequence Test**
   ```bash
   python code_implementation/alpha_sequence.py
   ```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ All modules created
2. ✅ Navigation flow updated
3. ⏳ Integration into improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py
4. ⏳ Testing with manual session
5. ⏳ Refinement based on testing

## Key Takeaways from Dr. Q

> "Don't push hard on body sensations - just shift their attention"
> "Engagement is what we want, acknowledgment is what we give"
> "Make them feel heard, use tenses to put stress in past and good in present"
> "Shift attention towards body, senses, NOW, present, make them comfortable"
