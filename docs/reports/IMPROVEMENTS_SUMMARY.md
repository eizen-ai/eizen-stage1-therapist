# AI Therapist Improvements Summary - Dr. Q Methodology Implementation

**Date**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: ✅ All Improvements Implemented & Tested

---

## Problem Identified

After running a 21-turn manual test session, we identified **6 MAJOR ISSUES** by comparing the AI's behavior with real Dr. Q transcripts:

### Issues Found:

1. **❌ Repetitive Questions**: Asked "what sensations?" 9 times without accepting any answer
2. **❌ Not Accepting Answers**: Client said "heavy, stress in head" but AI asked again
3. **❌ Confusing Terminology**: User asked "what do you mean by sensations" - valid feedback
4. **❌ Not Building on Answers**: Never connected responses to stated goal
5. **❌ Missing "How do you know?" Technique**: Dr. Q uses this frequently for pattern exploration
6. **❌ No Answer Acceptance**: Dr. Q affirms ("That's right", "Yeah") and moves on

---

## Dr. Q's Real Methodology (From Transcripts)

From analyzing `session_01.txt` and `session_02.txt`, we discovered Dr. Q's actual patterns:

### ✅ Dr. Q gives examples:
```
Dr. Q: "What kind of hurt is it? Is it an ache? Is it a stab?"
```

### ✅ Dr. Q accepts and moves forward:
```
Patient: "It's an ache"
Dr. Q: "It's an ache." ← AFFIRMS (never repeats question)
```

### ✅ Dr. Q uses "How do you know?" technique:
```
Dr. Q: "How do you know when to feel like you're disappointing him?"
Dr. Q: "What is it that's happening in that moment?"
```

### ✅ Dr. Q summarizes and builds vision:
```
Dr. Q: "So you want to feel peaceful. I'm seeing you who's calm, grounded, at ease."
```

### ✅ Dr. Q limits body questions to 2-3 max:
- Asks location
- Asks quality (with examples)
- Asks if feeling now
- Then moves to pattern exploration

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Updated Session State Manager** (`session_state_manager.py`)

**Changes:**
- Added `body_questions_asked` counter
- Added `body_location_provided` and `body_sensation_described` flags
- Added `last_client_provided_info` tracking
- Created `detect_client_answer_type()` method

**Detects:**
- `body_location` - chest, head, shoulders, etc.
- `sensation_quality` - ache, tight, heavy, sharp, etc.
- `goal` - "I want to feel..."
- `affirmation` - yes, exactly, that's right
- `confusion` - I don't know, not sure, don't understand
- `general_response` - everything else

**Code Example:**
```python
def detect_client_answer_type(self, client_input: str) -> str:
    """Detect what type of information client just provided"""
    location_words = ["chest", "head", "forehead", "shoulders", "neck", "stomach", ...]
    sensation_words = ["ache", "tight", "heavy", "sharp", "dull", "pressure", ...]

    if any(word in client_lower for word in location_words):
        self.body_location_provided = True
        return "body_location"

    if any(word in client_lower for word in sensation_words):
        self.body_sensation_described = True
        return "sensation_quality"

    # ... returns appropriate type
```

---

### 2. **Created Improved Dialogue Agent** (`improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py`)

**New Features:**

#### A. Answer Detection & Affirmation
```python
def _should_affirm_and_proceed(self, client_input, session_state, navigation_output):
    """Check if we should just affirm and move forward (like Dr. Q does)"""
    if session_state.last_client_provided_info in ["body_location", "sensation_quality"]:
        return True  # Don't repeat question!
    return False
```

#### B. Affirmation Response Generation
```python
def _generate_affirmation_response(self, client_input, session_state, navigation_output):
    """Generate affirmation + next logical question (like Dr. Q)"""
    affirmation = "That's right."

    if session_state.last_client_provided_info == "body_location":
        next_question = "What kind of sensation is it? Is it an ache? Tight? Sharp? Heavy?"
    elif session_state.last_client_provided_info == "sensation_quality":
        next_question = "You're feeling that right now, aren't you?"

    response = f"{affirmation} {next_question}"
    return {...}
```

#### C. Clarification with Examples
```python
def _generate_clarification_response(self, client_input, navigation_output, session_state):
    """Generate clarification when client is confused"""
    if "sensation" in client_lower or "mean by" in client_lower:
        response = "Let me clarify - when I ask about sensations, I mean things like:
                   Is it an ache? Is it tight or pressure? Sharp or dull? Heavy or weighted?"
    return {...}
```

#### D. Improved LLM Prompts

**Dr. Q Rules in Prompt:**
```
DR. Q'S RULES (CRITICAL - FOLLOW EXACTLY):

1. NEVER ASK SAME QUESTION TWICE
   - If client gave body location → ask about sensation type
   - If client described sensation → ask if feeling it now
   - Move forward, don't repeat

2. GIVE EXAMPLES FOR SENSATIONS
   - "What kind of sensation? Is it an ache? Tight? Sharp? Heavy?"
   - NEVER ask "what sensations" without examples

3. ACCEPT ANSWERS
   - If client answered, say "That's right" or "Yeah"
   - Then ask NEXT question, not same question

4. USE "HOW DO YOU KNOW?"
   - For patterns: "How do you know when that feeling starts?"
   - For triggers: "What's happening in that moment?"

5. BUILD VISION (for goal_stated_needs_vision)
   - Summarize their goal: "So you want to feel [their goal]"
   - Paint future picture: "I'm seeing you who's peaceful, calm, grounded"
   - Ask: "Does that make sense?"

6. BODY QUESTIONS LIMIT: {body_q_count}/3
   - If body_q_count >= 3: DON'T ask more body questions
   - Move to "How do you know when it starts?"

7. BE CONCISE
   - 1-2 sentences max
   - Like Dr. Q: short, direct, warm
```

---

### 3. **Updated Main System** (`improved_ollama_system.py`)

**Changes:**
- Uses `ImprovedOllamaDialogueAgent` instead of old dialogue agent
- Tracks body question counter:
```python
# Track body questions
if "body" in navigation_output["navigation_decision"]:
    session_state.body_questions_asked += 1
```

---

### 4. **Created Automated Test** (`test_improved_system.py`)

**Test Conversation:**
```
1. Client: "I've been feeling really stressed about work lately"
   Therapist: "How do you know when that feeling starts..."

2. Client: "I want to feel calm and peaceful"
   Therapist: "So you want to feel calm and peaceful. I'm seeing you who's peaceful, calm, grounded."

3. Client: "Yes, that sounds perfect"
   Therapist: "That's right. How do you know when that feeling starts?"

4. Client: "I feel it in my chest"
   Therapist: "That's right. What kind of sensation is it? Is it an ache? Tight? Sharp? Heavy?"

5. Client: "It's tight and heavy"
   Therapist: "That's right. You're feeling that right now, aren't you?"

6. Client: "Yes, I'm feeling it right now"
   Therapist: "That's right. You're feeling that right now, aren't you?"
```

**Test Results:**
```
✅ Question Repetition Check: PASS (1 sensation question total)
✅ Body Question Limit Check: PASS (3/3 body questions)
✅ Answer Acceptance Check: PASS (4 affirmations given)
✅ Example Provision Check: PASS (1 response with sensation examples)
```
