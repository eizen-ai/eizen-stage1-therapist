2. ✅ `session_state_manager.py` - Added psycho-education tracking
3. ✅ `core_system/simplified_navigation.json` - Added psycho-education stage
4. ✅ `improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py` - **FULLY INTEGRATED** all modules

## Integration Details

### In `improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py`:

**Imports Added:**
```python
from language_techniques import LanguageTechniques
from engagement_tracker import EngagementTracker
from vision_language_templates import VisionLanguageTemplates
from psycho_education import PsychoEducation
from alpha_sequence import AlphaSequence
```

**Initialization in `__init__`:**
```python
self.language_techniques = LanguageTechniques()
self.engagement_tracker = EngagementTracker()
self.vision_templates = VisionLanguageTemplates()
self.psycho_education = PsychoEducation()
self.alpha_sequence = AlphaSequence()
```

**Priority System in `generate_response`:**
1. **Self-harm detection** (highest priority)
2. **Past tense redirect** (with language techniques applied)
3. **Thinking mode redirect** (with language techniques)
4. **"I don't know" handling** → vision language
5. **Engagement intervention** (when needed)
6. **Psycho-education** (zebra-lion, before problem inquiry)
7. **Alpha sequence checkpoints** (if active)
8. Goal clarification
9. Vision building

**New Handler Methods Added:**
- `_handle_i_dont_know()` - Offers vision language for uncertainty
- `_generate_engagement_intervention()` - Intervenes on disengagement
- `_generate_psycho_education_response()` - Provides brain explanation
- `_handle_alpha_sequence_checkpoint()` - Manages down-regulation steps

**Enhanced `get_system_status()`:**
Now returns:
- Enhancement module status
- Engagement summary
- Alpha sequence status (if active)

## Navigation Flow

**Updated Sequence:**
```
1.1 Goal & Vision
  ↓ (vision accepted)
1.1.5 Psycho-Education (zebra-lion explanation)
  ↓ (education understood)
1.2 Problem & Body (with soft body inquiry)
  ↓
1.3 Readiness Assessment
```

## Key Principles Implemented

### 1. Body Sensation Inquiry (Dr. Q's Guidance)
- **Don't push hard** - accept vague responses
- **Goal**: Engagement (not precision)
- **Approach**: "Where do you feel that? If you had to point to one area..."
- Accept: "ache", "soft", "tight", anything
- **Acknowledge warmly**: "That's right", "Got it"

### 2. Tense Management
- **Problems → PAST**: "has affected" not "is affecting"
- **Desired states → PRESENT**: "feeling calm NOW"
- **Identity separation**: "I am depressed" → "You've been feeling depressed?"

### 3. Attention Shift Triangle
```
FROM          →  TO
Thinking      →  Feeling
Past          →  Present
Problem       →  Body/Senses
External      →  Internal
```

### 4. Engagement & Acknowledgment
- Acknowledge every response
- Don't repeat questions
- Accept and move forward
- Make client feel HEARD

## Testing

### To Test Individual Modules:
```bash
# Language techniques
python code_implementation/language_techniques.py

# Engagement tracker
python code_implementation/engagement_tracker.py

# Vision language
python code_implementation/vision_language_templates.py

# Psycho-education
python code_implementation/psycho_education.py

# Alpha sequence
python code_implementation/alpha_sequence.py
```

### To Test Full Integration:
```bash
cd "/media/eizen-4/2TB/gaurav/AI Therapist/Therapist2"
source venv/bin/activate
python code_implementation/improved_ollama_system.py
```

## What Each Module Does

### 1. Language Techniques
- Transforms "I am X" → "You've been feeling X?"
- Adds "feeling" to separate identity from state
- Enforces past tense for problems
- Detects metaphors ("under stress", "drowning")

### 2. Engagement Tracker
- Monitors confirmation responses
- Detects silence/disengagement
- Triggers interventions: "What's happening now?"
- Recommends human handoff when needed

### 3. Vision Language Templates
- Handles "I don't know" with universal outcomes
- Offers: "lighter", "at ease", "free", "calm", "okay"
- Context-aware (goal/feelings/body awareness)

### 4. Psycho-Education
- Provides zebra-lion brain explanation
- 3 versions: full, concise, brief
- Normalizes stress response
- Transitions to problem inquiry

### 5. Alpha Sequence
- Structured down-regulation
- Steps: Lower jaw → Relax tongue → Breathe slower
- Checkpoints: "More tense or more calm?"
- Normalizes resistance

## Summary

- ✅ Language techniques for tense shifting
- ✅ Engagement tracking with interventions
- ✅ "I don't know" handling with vision language
- ✅ Psycho-education stage (zebra-lion)
