# AI THERAPIST - TRT Stage 1 System

**Text-Based Trauma Resiliency Training (TRT) Implementation**

---

## 🎯 WHAT THIS IS

Complete conversation management system for AI Therapist Stage 1:
- ✅ State-action pairs with RAG retrieval
- ✅ Framework triggers (alpha_sequence, metaphors, no_harm, card_game)
- ✅ Detection-based routing
- ✅ Multiple response paths
- ✅ Priority redirects (thinking→feeling, past→present)

**Built from 3 actual Dr. Q session transcripts**

## 🚀 QUICK START

### **1. Read the System:**
```bash
cd rasa_system/
cat README.md
```

### **2. Review Main CSV:**
```bash
cat STAGE1_COMPLETE.csv
```

**Main file** with state-action pairs, RAG tags, framework triggers.

### **3. Check Intents:**
```bash
cat intents/client_intents.yml
```

All possible client response types.

## 🔑 KEY CONCEPT: FRAMEWORK TRIGGERS

**You already have these frameworks:**
- `alpha_sequence` - Alpha induction (triggered at state 3.3)
- `metaphors` - Dr. Q metaphors (triggered strategically in Stage 2 based on client needs)
- `no_harm` - Safety protocol (triggered ONLY for self-harm mentions)
- `card_game` - For quiet clients (triggered when gentle prompts don't work)

**System TRIGGERS them strategically** based on client needs and TRT methodology:

```python
# From CSV "Framework_Trigger" column:

if state == "3.3":  # Execute Alpha
    alpha_sequence.trigger()  # Framework appears on screen

if state == "SELFHARM":  # Self-harm mention detected
    no_harm.trigger('safety_protocol')  # SAFETY ONLY

if state == "SILENT":  # Client not speaking
    card_game.trigger()  # Interactive cards

# Metaphors triggered strategically in Stage 2 (not Stage 1):
# - Based on client's specific trauma type
# - Per TRT PDF methodology steps
# - When explanation needed (zebra/lion, timing/meaning, etc.)
```

**Frameworks handle their own logic. System triggers them strategically.**

## 📊 CONVERSATION FLOW

```
1.1 Goal Inquiry → What do you want?
1.2 Build Vision → Peaceful, present, grounded?
1.3 Get Permission → Would it be okay?
  ↓
2.1 Problem Inquiry → What's been difficult?
2.2-2.4 Body Awareness → Where? Sensation? Feel it now?
2.5 Pattern Inquiry → How do you know?
  ↓
3.1 Assess Readiness → Anything else?
3.2 Introduce Alpha → Explain + get permission
3.3 Execute Alpha → [TRIGGER: alpha_sequence]
3.4-3.6 Post-Alpha → What noticed? Link to vision. Better?
  ↓
4.1 Ready Stage 2 → Transition (metaphors in Stage 2 strategically)

PRIORITY (can happen anytime):
SELFHARM → Safety protocol [TRIGGER: no_harm] ⚠️
THINK → Redirect thinking to feeling
PAST → Redirect past to present
AFFIRM → Just say "that's right" (60%+ of time)
EMOTION → Validate (no framework trigger)
CRY → Normalize (no framework trigger)
SILENT → Gentle prompt or [TRIGGER: card_game]
```

## 🎯 DETECTION-BASED ROUTING

Every client message analyzed by **LLM Master Agent** for semantic understanding:

```python
# LLM performs SEMANTIC detection, not keyword matching
detections = {
    'self_harm': llm_detects_self_harm_language(message),  # PRIORITY 1
    'body_words': llm_detects_body_reference(message),  # "chest", "ache", "knot", etc.
    'thinking_mode': llm_detects_cognitive_language(message),  # "i think", "because", etc.
    'tense': llm_detects_tense(message),  # 'present' or 'past' from context
    'intensity': llm_detects_emotional_intensity(message)  # caps, exclamations, word choice
}

# Route based on what's detected:
if self_harm → SELFHARM (TRIGGER: no_harm safety protocol)
if thinking_mode → THINK (redirect to feeling)
if past_tense → PAST (redirect to present)
if body_aware + present → AFFIRM (just affirm)
else → normal state flow
```

**LLM generalizes beyond example words. "peaceful" = "ecstatic" = "serene" (same intent).**

## 📚 FILES

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `rasa_system/STAGE1_COMPLETE.csv` | ⭐ State-action pairs with framework triggers |
| `rasa_system/intents/client_intents.yml` | Client response types |
| `rasa_system/stories/stage1_complete_stories.yml` | Conversation paths |
| `rasa_system/actions/therapist_actions.json` | Action definitions |

---

## 💻 IMPLEMENTATION

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load CSV
states = pd.read_csv('rasa_system/STAGE1_COMPLETE.csv')

# Get current state info
state_row = states[states['State_ID'] == current_state].iloc[0]

# Run detections
detections = detect_all(client_message)

# Check priority redirects
if detections['thinking_mode']:
    current_state = 'THINK'
elif detections['tense'] == 'past':
    current_state = 'PAST'
elif detections['body_aware'] and detections['present']:
    current_state = 'AFFIRM'

# Query RAG
rag_result = rag.query(state_row['RAG_Query'])
response = rag_result or state_row['Fallback_Response']

# Trigger framework if needed
if state_row['Framework_Trigger']:
    if 'alpha_sequence' in state_row['Framework_Trigger']:
        alpha_sequence.trigger()
    elif 'no_harm' in state_row['Framework_Trigger']:
        no_harm.trigger()
    elif 'metaphors' in state_row['Framework_Trigger']:
        metaphors.trigger()
    elif 'card_game' in state_row['Framework_Trigger']:
        card_game.trigger()

# Route to next state
next_state = route_based_on_detection(detections, state_row)
```

## ✅ KEY FEATURES

1. **Framework Triggers** - System triggers your existing frameworks
2. **Simple State IDs** - Easy tracking (1.1, 2.4, THINK, etc.)
3. **RAG + Fallback** - Not hardcoded
4. **Detection Routing** - Different paths per client response
5. **Priority Redirects** - THINK/PAST/AFFIRM can happen anytime
6. **Natural Flow** - Affirm 60%+ instead of always asking

  'goal_stated': True,
  'vision_accepted': True,
  'problem_identified': True,
  'body_awareness_present': True,
  'alpha_complete': True,

```bash
# Setup
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Use
cd rasa_system/
# Review STAGE1_COMPLETE.csv
# Implement detection functions
# Integrate with your LLaMA agents
# Add framework trigger logic
```

---

## ✅ PROJECT STATUS

**Status:** ✅ Complete & Ready

**Approach:** Trigger existing frameworks, don't rebuild them

**Integration:** Works with LLaMA Master + Dialogue agents

**Files:** 4 main files (CSV, intents, stories, actions)

**Frameworks:** 4 triggers (alpha, metaphors, no_harm, card_game)

---

**Location:** `/media/eizen-4/2TB/gaurav/AI Therapist/Therapist2/`

**System:** Framework trigger-based conversation management

**Stage:** Stage 1 (Safety Building)

**Ready For:** Integration → Testing → Deployment
