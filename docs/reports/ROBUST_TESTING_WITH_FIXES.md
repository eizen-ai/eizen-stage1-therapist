## 🔬 TEST 1: LOOP PREVENTION - Body Awareness

### **Scenario:** Client refuses to mention body sensations

```
ATTEMPT 1:
──────────
💬 THERAPIST (State 2.1_seek): "When you think about work stress,
                                 where do you feel it in your body?"

👤 CLIENT: "I don't feel anything in my body. It's just the work."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: body_words = False
   • Loop Counter [2.1_seek]: 1
   • Action: Repeat with different wording
   • Next: 2.1_seek (still_external→repeat)

ATTEMPT 2:
──────────
💬 THERAPIST: "I understand work is the issue. Just notice - is there
               any sensation anywhere in your body? Tension? Tightness?"

👤 CLIENT: "No, I told you - it's not about my body. It's external."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: body_words = False
   • Loop Counter [2.1_seek]: 2
   • Action: More directive approach
   • Next: 2.1_seek (still_external→repeat)

ATTEMPT 3:
──────────
💬 THERAPIST: "That's okay. Let me try something different..."

   ⚡ ESCAPE ROUTE ACTIVATED ⚡
   Loop Counter [2.1_seek]: 3 (MAX REACHED)

   Option A: TRIGGER card_game

   ┌────────────────────────────────────┐
   │     CARD GAME FRAMEWORK            │
   │                                     │
   │  Point to where you feel something:│
   │  [Head] [Chest] [Stomach] [Back]  │
   │                                     │
   │  What does it feel like?           │
   │  [Tight] [Heavy] [Ache] [Numb]    │
   └────────────────────────────────────┘

👤 CLIENT: [points to chest + "tight"]

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Got body awareness through card_game!
   • Reset loop counter [2.1_seek]: 0
   • Next: 2.2 (Body Location)

   OR Option B: Skip to 3.1

   If card_game still doesn't work:

💬 THERAPIST: "That's okay. Body awareness will develop as we go.
               Let's move forward..."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Skip body detail for now
   • Next: 3.1 (Assess Readiness)
   • Note: Alpha sequence will develop body awareness

✅ TEST RESULT: PASS - Loop prevented, moved forward
```

---

## 🔬 TEST 2: LOOP PREVENTION - Thinking Mode

### **Scenario:** Client stuck in analytical/thinking mode

```
ATTEMPT 1:
──────────
💬 THERAPIST (State THINK): "Rather than thinking, what are you
                              FEELING right now?"

👤 CLIENT: "I think I'm anxious because of my childhood patterns
            that created this response mechanism..."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: thinking_mode = TRUE ("I think", "because")
   • Loop Counter [THINK]: 1
   • Action: Gentle redirect
   • Next: THINK (still_thinking→repeat)

ATTEMPT 2:
──────────
💬 THERAPIST: "Let's pause the thinking for a moment. Take a breath.
               What do you notice in your body right now?"

👤 CLIENT: "Well, I'm analyzing why I keep analyzing everything.
            Probably a defense mechanism..."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: thinking_mode = TRUE ("analyzing", "probably")
   • Loop Counter [THINK]: 2
   • Action: More directive, body focus
   • Next: THINK (still_thinking→repeat)

ATTEMPT 3:
──────────
   ⚡ ESCAPE ROUTE ACTIVATED ⚡
   Loop Counter [THINK]: 3 (MAX REACHED)

💬 THERAPIST: "I hear your mind is very active. Let's do a grounding
               exercise to help you drop into your body..."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Escape: Direct to State 3.2 (Introduce Alpha)
   • Reset loop counter [THINK]: 0
   • Alpha will naturally ground them out of thinking mode

💬 THERAPIST: "We'll do a short process to put your body in rest state.
               This will help quiet the mind. Willing to try?"

👤 CLIENT: "Okay, yes."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Next: 3.3 (Execute Alpha)
   • TRIGGER: alpha_sequence
   • Alpha sequence will shift them from thinking to feeling

✅ TEST RESULT: PASS - Loop prevented, grounding initiated
```

---

## 🔬 TEST 3: LOOP PREVENTION - Past Tense

### **Scenario:** Client keeps going to "back then" despite redirects

```
ATTEMPT 1:
──────────
💬 THERAPIST (State PAST): "That was then. Right now, what are you
                             FEELING?"

👤 CLIENT: "But back then when my father left, that's when all this
            started and I was only 10 years old..."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: tense = 'past' ("back then", "was")
   • Loop Counter [PAST]: 1
   • Action: Gentle present redirect
   • Next: PAST (still_past→stronger)

ATTEMPT 2:
──────────
💬 THERAPIST: "I hear that happened back then. Your body is here with
               me NOW. What's your body feeling in THIS moment?"

👤 CLIENT: "I'm remembering how it felt back when I was alone..."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: tense = 'past' ("back when", "was")
   • Loop Counter [PAST]: 2
   • Action: Stronger anchoring
   • Next: PAST (still_past→stronger)

ATTEMPT 3:
──────────
   ⚡ ESCAPE ROUTE ACTIVATED ⚡
   Loop Counter [PAST]: 3 (MAX REACHED)

💬 THERAPIST: "Let's bring you into the present moment. Feel your feet
               on the floor right now. Take a slow breath with me..."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Escape: Direct to State 3.2 (Introduce Alpha)
   • Reset loop counter [PAST]: 0
   • Alpha will anchor them in present moment

💬 THERAPIST: "We'll do a grounding process to help you be present.
               Ready?"

👤 CLIENT: "Yes."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Next: 3.3 (Execute Alpha)
   • TRIGGER: alpha_sequence
   • Alpha (bird's eye, peripheral awareness) brings to present

✅ TEST RESULT: PASS - Loop prevented, present anchoring initiated
```

## 🔬 TEST 4: CRISIS STATE - Incoherent Speech

### **Scenario:** Client having severe panic or manic episode

```
💬 THERAPIST (State 2.3): "What kind of sensation - ache, tight, heavy?"

👤 CLIENT: "asdfj HEART RACING can't BREATHE everything spinning
            purple elephant thoughts racing CAN'T STOP MOVING!!!"

🤖 SYSTEM ANALYSIS:
   • Detection: incoherent = TRUE
   • Detection: severe_panic = TRUE
   • Detection: manic_speech = TRUE
   • Intent: crisis_state
   • PRIORITY: Higher than normal flow
   • Route to: CRISIS state

💬 THERAPIST (State CRISIS): "I hear you're having a really hard time
                               right now. Take a breath with me.
                               Are you safe?"

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Check safety first
   • If unsafe → trigger no_harm framework

👤 CLIENT: "Can't... breathe... safe... just... panic..."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Client confirms safe
   • Severe panic but not danger
   • Action: Crisis grounding protocol

💬 THERAPIST: "You're safe. You're having a panic response. Breathe
               with me now. In... and out... You're okay..."

   [Implements crisis grounding]

👤 CLIENT: [breathing slows] "Okay... okay..."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: calm_returning = TRUE
   • Next: safe_calm→continue (return to previous state)
   • OR: Direct to 3.2 (Alpha for stabilization)

✅ TEST RESULT: PASS - Crisis handled, safety assessed, grounded
```

## 🔬 TEST 5: RESISTANCE STATE - "This Isn't Helping"

### **Scenario:** Client skeptical about therapy process

```
💬 THERAPIST (State 2.2): "Where in your chest do you feel it?"

👤 CLIENT: "This isn't helping. I don't see the point of all these
            questions about my body."

🤖 SYSTEM ANALYSIS:
   • Detection: skepticism = TRUE ("isn't helping", "don't see point")
   • Intent: resistant
   • Route to: RESISTANCE state

💬 THERAPIST (State RESISTANCE): "I hear this doesn't feel helpful yet.
                                   Trust the process for a moment - the
                                   reason I'm asking about your body is
                                   because stress lives there. By
                                   connecting to it, we can release it.
                                   Would you be willing to try?"

👤 CLIENT: "Fine, I'll try. My chest feels tight."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: willing = TRUE
   • Got body awareness!
   • Next: willing→continue (back to 2.2 → then 2.3)

💬 THERAPIST: "Thank you for trusting the process. That tightness in
               your chest - let's work with that..."

✅ TEST RESULT: PASS - Resistance addressed, client re-engaged

ALTERNATIVE OUTCOME:
────────────────────
👤 CLIENT: "I still don't think this will work."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: still_resistant = TRUE
   • Next: still_resistant→explain_method

💬 THERAPIST: "I understand your skepticism. Here's why this works:
               trauma and stress get stored in the body as physical
               tension. By accessing it directly, we can process and
               release it faster than talking alone. The research
               behind this approach shows significant results. Would
               you be willing to give it a few more minutes?"

✅ TEST RESULT: PASS - Provides explanation, maintains rapport
```

## 🔬 TEST 6: RAMBLING STATE - Excessive Detail

### **Scenario:** Client talking for 5+ minutes with excessive detail

```
💬 THERAPIST (State 2.1): "What's been making it hard?"

👤 CLIENT: "Well, it started back in 1987 when I was working at this
            company - it was called TechCorp, actually now it's called
            MegaTech because they merged in 1995 - and my manager,
            his name was Bob Smith, he had this habit of coming in at
            exactly 8:45 every morning, and one day - I think it was a
            Tuesday, maybe Wednesday, definitely not Monday because
            Mondays he always came in earlier - he brought donuts,
            which was unusual because typically he would bring bagels,
            but this particular day he brought chocolate donuts with
            sprinkles, and I remember because it was my cousin Sarah's
            birthday, and she loves chocolate, and anyway Bob said
            something about the quarterly reports..." [continues]

🤖 SYSTEM ANALYSIS:
   • Detection: excessive_length = TRUE (200+ words, still going)
   • Detection: no_body_reference = TRUE
   • Intent: rambling
   • Route to: RAMBLING state

💬 THERAPIST (State RAMBLING - gentle interrupt): "I appreciate all
                                                    that context. Let
                                                    me ask you this -
                                                    when you think about
                                                    all of that, where
                                                    do you feel it in
                                                    your body?"

👤 CLIENT: "Oh, right. My chest feels tight."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: body_mentioned = TRUE
   • Successful redirect!
   • Next: body_mentioned→2.2 (Body Location)

✅ TEST RESULT: PASS - Rambling interrupted, redirected to body

ALTERNATIVE OUTCOME (still rambling):
─────────────────────────────────────
👤 CLIENT: "Well, my chest, but let me tell you more about Bob..."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: still_rambling = TRUE
   • Next: still_rambling→firmer

💬 THERAPIST: "I'm going to stop you there. I want to focus on what's
               most important - that tightness in your chest. Let's
               work with that specifically."

✅ TEST RESULT: PASS - Firmer boundary, maintained focus
```

## 🔬 TEST 7: MULTIPLE PRIORITY REDIRECTS

### **Scenario:** Client exhibits multiple issues in one message

```
💬 THERAPIST (State 2.4): "You're feeling that right now, aren't you?"

👤 CLIENT: "I think back then when I was stressed, I probably felt
            something like this, but I'm not sure..."

🤖 SYSTEM ANALYSIS:
   • Detection: thinking_mode = TRUE ("I think", "probably")
   • Detection: past_tense = TRUE ("back then", "when I was")
   • Detection: body_aware = FALSE (uncertain)

   PRIORITY ROUTING:
   1. self_harm? → NO
   2. thinking_mode? → YES ✓

   Route to: THINK state (handle thinking first, then will address past)

💬 THERAPIST (State THINK): "Rather than thinking, what are you FEELING
                              right now?"

👤 CLIENT: "Right now, I feel tightness in my chest."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: thinking_mode = FALSE (resolved!)
   • Detection: tense = 'present' ("right now")
   • Detection: body_aware = TRUE ("tightness", "chest")
   • Detection: present_aware = TRUE (body + present)

   Both issues resolved in one redirect!
   Next: feeling→continue (back to 2.4 → then 2.5)

✅ TEST RESULT: PASS - Multiple issues resolved, natural flow
```

---

## 🔬 TEST 8: SELF-HARM TO CRISIS ESCALATION

### **Scenario:** Self-harm mention escalates to crisis

```
💬 THERAPIST (State 2.3): "What kind of sensation?"

👤 CLIENT: "I've been thinking about hurting myself."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: self_harm = TRUE
   • HIGHEST PRIORITY
   • Route to: SELFHARM state
   • TRIGGER: no_harm framework

💬 THERAPIST (State SELFHARM): "I hear you're having thoughts of
                                 hurting yourself. Your safety is
                                 important. Let's talk about this."

👤 CLIENT: "I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE EVERYTHING IS FALLING APART
            I NEED TO END THIS NOW!!!" [escalating]

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Detection: crisis_escalation = TRUE
   • Detection: manic_speech = TRUE
   • Detection: severe_panic = TRUE
   • Next: crisis→CRISIS

💬 THERAPIST (State CRISIS): "I hear you're in a lot of pain right now.
                               Are you safe? Are you going to hurt
                               yourself right now?"

   TRIGGER: no_harm framework (safety assessment)

👤 CLIENT: "No... I won't... I just... it's too much..."

🤖 SYSTEM:
   • Client confirms not immediate danger
   • Continue safety protocol
   • Crisis grounding
   • Provide resources

💬 THERAPIST: "Okay. You're safe with me. Let's take this one breath
               at a time. Breathe with me... [grounding protocol]
               I'm going to provide you with crisis resources..."

✅ TEST RESULT: PASS - Escalation handled, safety prioritized
```
