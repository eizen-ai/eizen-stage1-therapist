## ðŸŽ¯ TEST SCENARIO 1: NORMAL FLOW (Body-Aware Client)

### **Client Profile:** Sarah - stressed, anxious about work

---

### **Exchange 1: Goal Inquiry (State 1.1)**

**CLIENT:** "I'm so overwhelmed with work. Everything is piling up and I just can't handle it."

**MASTER AGENT ANALYSIS:**
```python
detections = {
    'self_harm': False,
    'body_words': False,  # No body reference
    'thinking_mode': False,
    'tense': 'present',
    'intensity': 'medium'
}

# LLM classifies intent
intent = "session_start" (describes problem, not goal)

# Current state: 1.1
# Detection shows no body awareness
# Route to: State 1.1 (ask for goal, not just problem)
```

**CSV LOOKUP - State 1.1:**
- RAG_Query: "dr_q_goal_inquiry"
- Framework_Trigger: none
- Fallback: "What do we want our time together to accomplish?"

**DIALOGUE AGENT (LLaMA) + RAG:**
- Queries vector DB for dr_q_goal_inquiry examples
- Generates: **"I hear you're overwhelmed. What do we want our time together to accomplish? What do we want to get better for you?"**

**SYSTEM:** Master Agent detected problem description (not goal) â†’ stays at 1.1, asks for desired outcome

---

### **Exchange 2: Client States Goal (State 1.2)**

**CLIENT:** "I want to feel calm and peaceful instead of anxious all the time."

**MASTER AGENT ANALYSIS:**
```python
detections = {
    'self_harm': False,
    'body_words': False,
    'thinking_mode': False,
    'tense': 'present',
    'intensity': 'low'
}

# LLM semantic classification
# "calm" = "peaceful" = "serene" = same intent!
intent = "states_goal_emotional"

# Current state: 1.1
# Goal stated â†’ Route to: 1.2 (Build Vision)
```

**CSV LOOKUP - State 1.2:**
- RAG_Query: "dr_q_vision"
- Fallback: "So we want you to be {peaceful, present, grounded}"

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
- RAG retrieves Dr. Q vision-building examples
- Generates: **"So we want you to be peaceful, calm, present in the moment, grounded. Does that make sense?"**

---

### **Exchange 3: Permission (State 1.3)**

**CLIENT:** "Yes, exactly! That's what I want."

**MASTER AGENT:** intent = "accepts_vision" â†’ Route to 1.3

**CSV LOOKUP - State 1.3:**
- Framework_Trigger: **none** (no permission framework - we corrected this!)
- RAG_Query: "dr_q_permission"

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"Would it be okay with you to work on this together?"**

---

### **Exchange 4: Problem Inquiry (State 2.1)**

**CLIENT:** "Yes, absolutely."

**MASTER AGENT:** intent = "permission_granted" â†’ Route to 2.1

**CSV LOOKUP - State 2.1:**
- RAG_Query: "dr_q_problem"

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"What's been making it hard? What's been happening?"**

**CLIENT:** "Work deadlines, too many projects, boss keeps adding more."

**MASTER AGENT ANALYSIS:**
```python
detections = {
    'body_words': False,  # External stressors only!
    'thinking_mode': False,
    'tense': 'present'
}

intent = "no_body_awareness"  # Talking about external, not body

# Need to guide to body â†’ Route to: 2.1_seek
```

---

### **Exchange 5: Seek Body (State 2.1_seek)**

**CSV LOOKUP - State 2.1_seek:**
- RAG_Query: "dr_q_to_body"
- Fallback: "When you think about {problem}, where do you feel it in your body?"

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"When you think about all those deadlines and projects, where do you feel it in your body?"**

**CLIENT:** "My chest feels tight, and my shoulders are really tense."

**MASTER AGENT:**
```python
detections = {
    'body_words': True,  # "chest", "tight", "shoulders", "tense"
    'thinking_mode': False,
    'tense': 'present'
}

intent = "mentions_body"
# Route to: 2.2 (Body Location)
```

---

### **Exchange 6: Body Location (State 2.2)**

**CSV LOOKUP - State 2.2:**
- RAG_Query: "dr_q_location"

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"That's right. Where in your chest?"**

**CLIENT:** "Right in the center of my chest, like a weight."

**MASTER AGENT:** intent = "gives_location" â†’ Route to 2.3

---

### **Exchange 7: Sensation Quality (State 2.3)**

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"What kind of sensation? Is it heavy? Tight? Ache?"**

**CLIENT:** "It's heavy, like a weight pressing down."

**MASTER AGENT:** intent = "describes_sensation" â†’ Route to 2.4

---

### **Exchange 8: Present Check (State 2.4)**

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"That's right, heavy. You're feeling that right now, aren't you?"**

**CLIENT:** "Yes, I feel it right now."

**MASTER AGENT ANALYSIS:**
```python
detections = {
    'body_words': True,  # "feel"
    'thinking_mode': False,
    'tense': 'present',  # "right now"
    'present_aware': True  # body_aware + present_tense
}

intent = "present_aware"
# Route to: 2.5 (Pattern Inquiry)
```

---

### **Exchange 9: Pattern Inquiry (State 2.5)**

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"How do you know when this happens? What's happening in that moment?"**

**CLIENT:** "When I look at my calendar and see all the meetings, I start thinking 'I can't do this,' then the tightness starts."

**MASTER AGENT:** intent = "pattern_identified" (triggerâ†’thoughtâ†’body) â†’ Route to 3.1

---

### **Exchange 10: Assess Readiness (State 3.1)**

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"Anything else I should understand before we work on this?"**

**CLIENT:** "No, that's it."

**MASTER AGENT:** intent = "ready_for_alpha" â†’ Route to 3.2

---

### **Exchange 11: Introduce Alpha (State 3.2)**

**CSV LOOKUP - State 3.2:**
- Framework_Trigger: **none** (corrected - no trigger here)
- RAG_Query: "dr_q_alpha_intro"

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"We'll do a short process to put your body in a rest state. This helps with healing. Willing to try?"**

**CLIENT:** "Okay, I'm ready."

**MASTER AGENT:** intent = "accepts_alpha" â†’ Route to 3.3

---

### **Exchange 12: Execute Alpha (State 3.3)**

**CSV LOOKUP - State 3.3:**
- Framework_Trigger: **TRIGGER: alpha_sequence**

**SYSTEM ACTION:**
```python
# TRIGGER FRAMEWORK
alpha_sequence.trigger()

# Framework displays on screen:
# 1. Lower jaw, rest tongue
# 2. Slow and deepen breath
# 3. Open field, expand awareness
# 4. Close eyes, float up like bird soaring

# Framework handles all 6 steps + body checks
# Returns when complete
```

**CLIENT:** [completes alpha sequence]

**MASTER AGENT:** alpha_complete = True â†’ Route to 3.4

---

### **Exchange 13: Post-Alpha (State 3.4)**

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"In those moments your eyes were closed, what did you notice?"**

**CLIENT:** "I felt lighter, freer. The weight in my chest got smaller."

**MASTER AGENT:** intent = "positive_response" â†’ Route to 3.5

---

### **Exchange 14: Link to Vision (State 3.5)**

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"You felt lighter and freer. That's where we're headed - you who's peaceful, calm, present."**

**CLIENT:** "Yes, I can see that."

**MASTER AGENT:** intent = "linked" â†’ Route to 3.6

---

### **Exchange 15: Compare Progress (State 3.6)**

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"How's your body now compared to when we started?"**

**CLIENT:** "Much better. The tightness is almost gone."

**MASTER AGENT:** intent = "improved" â†’ Route to 4.1

---

### **Exchange 16: Ready Stage 2 (State 4.1)**

**CSV LOOKUP - State 4.1:**
- Framework_Trigger: **none** (corrected - metaphors used strategically in Stage 2, not automatic)
- RAG_Query: "dr_q_transition"

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"Good. Whatever's causing this tightness, we want to stop it. Ready to understand what's happening?"**

**SYSTEM:** Transition to Stage 2 â†’ metaphors will be triggered strategically based on trauma type

---

## âœ… TEST SCENARIO 1 RESULTS:

**System performed correctly:**
1. âœ… Asked for goal, not just problem
2. âœ… Built vision
3. âœ… Asked permission (no framework trigger)
4. âœ… Guided from external to body awareness
5. âœ… Got present-moment body sensation
6. âœ… Identified pattern (triggerâ†’thoughtâ†’body)
7. âœ… Introduced alpha (no framework trigger)
8. âœ… **TRIGGERED alpha_sequence framework** at state 3.3
9. âœ… Linked alpha experience to vision
10. âœ… Compared progress
11. âœ… Transitioned to Stage 2 (no automatic metaphor trigger)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ TEST SCENARIO 2: PRIORITY REDIRECTS (Thinking Mode â†’ Past Tense)

### **Client Profile:** Mike - trauma from car accident

---

### **Exchange 1: Client in Thinking Mode (State 2.4 â†’ PRIORITY REDIRECT)**

**CLIENT:** "I think the tightness in my chest is because back when I was in the accident, I must have held my breath."

**MASTER AGENT ANALYSIS:**
```python
detections = {
    'self_harm': False,
    'body_words': True,  # "chest"
    'thinking_mode': True,  # "I think", "because", "must have"
    'tense': 'past',  # "back when", "was in"
    'present_aware': False
}

# PRIORITY ROUTING:
# Priority 1: self_harm â†’ SELFHARM (not detected)
# Priority 2: thinking_mode â†’ THINK (DETECTED!)

# OVERRIDE normal flow
# Route to: THINK state (priority redirect)
```

**CSV LOOKUP - State THINK:**
- RAG_Query: "dr_q_think_redirect"
- Notes: "PRIORITY - can happen ANY state"

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"Rather than thinking about it, what are you FEELING right now?"**

**CLIENT:** "I'm feeling the tightness now."

**MASTER AGENT:**
```python
detections = {
    'body_words': True,
    'thinking_mode': False,  # Stopped thinking mode!
    'tense': 'present',
    'present_aware': True
}

# Thinking mode resolved
# Continue from where we were (2.4) â†’ proceed to 2.5
```

---

### **Exchange 2: Client Goes to Past (State 2.5 â†’ PRIORITY REDIRECT)**

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"How do you know when this happens?"**

**CLIENT:** "Back then during the accident, my whole body froze up and I couldn't breathe."

**MASTER AGENT ANALYSIS:**
```python
detections = {
    'thinking_mode': False,
    'tense': 'past',  # "back then", "during", past tense verbs
    'body_words': True
}

# PRIORITY ROUTING:
# thinking_mode â†’ not detected
# past_tense â†’ PAST (DETECTED!)

# Route to: PAST state (priority redirect)
```

**CSV LOOKUP - State PAST:**
- RAG_Query: "dr_q_past_redirect"
- Notes: "PRIORITY - can happen ANY state"

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"That was then. Right now, what are you FEELING?"**

**CLIENT:** "Right now, I feel the tightness in my chest."

**MASTER AGENT:**
```python
detections = {
    'tense': 'present',  # "right now"
    'body_aware': True,
    'present_aware': True
}

# Past tense resolved
# Continue from where we were â†’ proceed with flow
```

---

## âœ… TEST SCENARIO 2 RESULTS:

**Priority redirects worked correctly:**
1. âœ… **THINK redirect** triggered when client said "I think... because..."
2. âœ… System brought client from thinking to feeling
3. âœ… **PAST redirect** triggered when client went to "back then"
4. âœ… System brought client from past to present
5. âœ… After redirects, continued normal flow
6. âœ… Priority redirects can happen at **ANY state** (not just specific ones)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ TEST SCENARIO 3: SELF-HARM SAFETY PROTOCOL

### **Client Profile:** Jessica - suicidal ideation

---

### **Exchange 1: Self-Harm Mention (ANY STATE â†’ SELFHARM PRIORITY)**

**System is at State 2.3 (Sensation Quality)**

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"What kind of sensation? Ache? Tight?"**

**CLIENT:** "I don't know... I just want it all to end. I've been thinking about hurting myself."

**MASTER AGENT ANALYSIS:**
```python
detections = {
    'self_harm': True,  # LLM detects: "want it all to end", "hurting myself"
    'body_words': False,
    'thinking_mode': False,
    'tense': 'present'
}

# PRIORITY ROUTING:
# Priority 1: self_harm â†’ SELFHARM (DETECTED!)

# HIGHEST PRIORITY - OVERRIDE EVERYTHING
# Route to: SELFHARM state (safety protocol)
```

**CSV LOOKUP - State SELFHARM:**
- Framework_Trigger: **TRIGGER: no_harm**
- Fallback: "I hear you're having thoughts of hurting yourself. Your safety is important."
- Notes: "SAFETY PROTOCOL - only trigger no_harm for actual self-harm mentions"

**SYSTEM ACTION:**
```python
# TRIGGER no_harm FRAMEWORK IMMEDIATELY
no_harm.trigger('safety_protocol')

# Framework provides:
# - Immediate safety assessment
# - Crisis intervention protocols
# - Resource connections (hotlines, emergency contacts)
# - Risk assessment tools
```

**DIALOGUE AGENT (while framework running):**
**"I hear you're having thoughts of hurting yourself. Your safety is important. Let's talk about this."**

**SYSTEM:** no_harm framework handles:
- Safety assessment
- Crisis resources
- Immediate intervention
- Professional referral if needed

---

## âœ… TEST SCENARIO 3 RESULTS:

**Safety protocol worked correctly:**
1. âœ… **Highest priority** - self-harm detection overrides everything
2. âœ… System immediately routes to SELFHARM state (from ANY state)
3. âœ… **TRIGGERS no_harm framework** for safety protocol
4. âœ… no_harm framework is **ONLY** triggered for self-harm (not permissions/validation)
5. âœ… Framework handles safety assessment and crisis intervention

---

## ðŸŽ¯ TEST SCENARIO 4: METAPHORS FOR CONCEPT EXPLANATION

### **Client Profile:** David - confused about how trauma works

---

### **Exchange 1: Client Confused About Concept (State 2.5)**

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"How do you know when this stress happens?"**

**CLIENT:** "I don't understand... why does thinking about work make my body react? I'm not even at work right now."

**MASTER AGENT ANALYSIS:**
```python
detections = {
    'confusion_detected': True,  # "don't understand", "why does"
    'body_words': True,
    'thinking_mode': False,
    'tense': 'present'
}

# Client needs concept explanation
# LLM Master Agent determines: needs metaphor for "brain response"
# Query vector DB for relevant metaphor
```

**VECTOR DB QUERY:**
```python
query = "metaphor explaining brain response to triggers"

# Vector DB returns best match:
metaphor = {
    'name': 'zebra_lion',
    'concept': 'brain_response_not_environment',
    'content': 'Zebra/lion story from TRT PDF page 8'
}
```

**DIALOGUE AGENT (using metaphor):**
**"Let me explain with a story. When a lion approaches a zebra, most people think it's the lion making the zebra scared. But actually, when the zebra SEES or SENSES the lion, it's the zebra's brain - not the lion - that makes the zebra alert and motivated to run. The brain is doing it in response to the lion, but it's the zebra's brain. Same with you - your brain has been making you feel stressed in response to thinking about work. Does that make sense now?"**

**CLIENT:** "Oh! So it's my brain reacting, not the work itself?"

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"Exactly. That's why we can work with it - we're helping your brain learn it doesn't need to react that way anymore."**

---

### **Exchange 2: Client Confused About Memory (During Stage 2)**

**CLIENT:** "I don't get it. If the accident happened years ago, why does it still feel like it's happening?"

**MASTER AGENT:**
```python
# Client confused about timing/memory
# Query vector DB for memory metaphor
```

**VECTOR DB QUERY:**
```python
query = "metaphor explaining memory reconsolidation timing"

# Returns: "blender without lid" metaphor from TRT PDF page 27
```

**DIALOGUE AGENT (using metaphor):**
**"Good question. Memory is more like a blender running without a lid than a file cabinet. Every time you remember something, your brain reconstructs it from different fragments. It's not pulling out a fixed file - it's blending it together again. And whatever's happening NOW gets mixed in. That's why it can feel like it's still happening - your brain is reconstructing it in the present moment."**

**CLIENT:** "That makes sense now. So we can change how it's reconstructed?"

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"Exactly. That's what we're doing."**

---

## âœ… TEST SCENARIO 4 RESULTS:

**Metaphors for concept explanation worked correctly:**
1. âœ… System detects when client is confused
2. âœ… Master Agent identifies which concept needs explanation
3. âœ… Queries **vector DB** for appropriate metaphor (basket of metaphors)
4. âœ… Dialogue Agent delivers metaphor naturally
5. âœ… Can happen at **ANY point** during therapy (not just Stage 2)
6. âœ… Different from strategic Stage 2 metaphors (trauma explanation)

**Two types of metaphors confirmed:**
- **Type A:** Explaining concepts (triggered when confused) - from vector DB
- **Type B:** Stage 2 trauma explanation (strategic, specific steps) - from TRT methodology

---

## ðŸŽ¯ TEST SCENARIO 5: CARD GAME FOR NON-VERBAL CLIENT

### **Client Profile:** Emma - very quiet, minimal responses

---

### **Exchange 1: Client Silent (State 2.2 â†’ SILENT)**

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"Where in your body do you feel it?"**

**CLIENT:** "Um... [long pause, no answer]"

**MASTER AGENT ANALYSIS:**
```python
detections = {
    'silence': True,  # Incomplete response, long pause
    'body_words': False,
    'incomplete_response': True
}

intent = "silence"
# Route to: SILENT state
```

**CSV LOOKUP - State SILENT:**
- Framework_Trigger: **TRIGGER: card_game (if continues)**
- RAG_Query: "dr_q_prompt"
- Fallback: "Take your time... What are you noticing?"

**DIALOGUE AGENT (first attempt - gentle prompt):**
**"Take your time... What are you noticing in your body?"**

**CLIENT:** "I... [pause] ...I don't know."

**MASTER AGENT:**
```python
# Still silent/minimal
# Gentle prompt didn't work
# Time to trigger card_game framework
```

**SYSTEM ACTION:**
```python
# TRIGGER card_game FRAMEWORK
card_game.trigger()

# Framework provides:
# - Interactive cards with body sensation options
# - Visual/tactile engagement for non-verbal clients
# - Pattern association game from session_01
# - Helps client express without needing words
```

**CARD_GAME FRAMEWORK (on screen):**
```
[Shows cards with options]
Point to where you feel something:
[Head] [Neck] [Shoulders] [Chest] [Stomach] [Arms] [Legs]

What does it feel like?
[Tight] [Heavy] [Ache] [Pressure] [Tense] [Numb]
```

**CLIENT:** [points to chest card, then "tight" card]

**MASTER AGENT:**
```python
# Card game provided input
# Client indicated: chest + tight
# Can now continue with body location/sensation flow
```

**DIALOGUE AGENT:**
**"That's right, tight in your chest. You're feeling that right now?"**

**CLIENT:** "Yes." [more engaged now]

**SYSTEM:** Successfully got body awareness through card_game â†’ continue flow

---

## âœ… TEST SCENARIO 5 RESULTS:

**Card game for non-verbal clients worked correctly:**
1. âœ… System detects silence/minimal responses
2. âœ… First tries gentle prompt (giving client space)
3. âœ… If gentle prompt fails, **TRIGGERS card_game framework**
4. âœ… card_game provides interactive, non-verbal way to communicate
5. âœ… Helps client express body sensations without needing words
6. âœ… Once client engages, continue normal flow

---
