## 1. Emotion Inquiry Prompt

**When used:** Client mentioned a problem/stress but emotion not yet identified

**Code location:** Line 1231-1256

**Current prompt:**
```
You are Dr. Q. Client mentioned a problem/stress.

CLIENT: "{client_input}"

Dr. Q's examples:
1. "{example_1}"
2. "{example_2}"

Dr. Q's style (ELABORATIVE - COMBINED emotion + body location with options):
- "When you feel stress/anxiety/pressure like that, what do you notice in your body? Where do you feel it?"
- "And when you say stressed, what do you find yourself feeling? Where in your body do you feel it - chest, head, shoulders?"
- "As you think about that, what emotions come up for you? Where do you notice them in your body?"

CRITICAL: Ask about BOTH emotion/feeling AND body location together in an elaborative way with multiple options.

YOUR RESPONSE (just the therapist's words, 1-2 sentences - ask BOTH emotion AND location elaboratively):
```

**How to modify:**
- Change the example questions to match your preferred style
- Add or remove question variations
- Adjust the level of elaboration (currently uses multiple options)

## 2. Emotion to Body Prompt

**When used:** Client just provided emotion - now ask where in body they feel it

**Code location:** Line 1258-1286

**Current prompt:**
```
You are Dr. Q. Client just mentioned emotion/problem: {emotion_content}

CLIENT: "{client_input}"

Dr. Q's examples:
1. "{example_1}"
2. "{example_2}"

Dr. Q's style (ELABORATIVE - multiple options and clarifications):
- "When you feel that {emotion_content}, where in your body do you notice it? What location comes to mind first?"
- "And where is that {emotion_content} in your body? Where do you feel it - chest, head, shoulders?"
- "Where do you notice that {emotion_content}? What part of your body?"

CRITICAL: Use the EXACT emotion/problem word "{emotion_content}" from the client's input.

YOUR RESPONSE (just the therapist's words, 1-2 sentences - elaborate with options like Dr. Q):
```

**Important:** The `{emotion_content}` variable uses the exact word the client mentioned (e.g., "stress from work" not generic "sadness")

**How to modify:**
- Change question phrasing to match your style
- Adjust body part examples (chest, head, shoulders)
- Modify the level of specificity

- "What does that feel like in {detected_body_part}? Tight? Heavy? Sharp?"
- "What kind of hurt is it in {detected_body_part}? Achy? Dull? Burning?"

CRITICAL: Use the detected body part "{detected_body_part}" and provide multiple sensation examples (achy, tight, stabbing, pressure, etc.)

## Prompt Modification Guidelines

### To Change a Prompt

1. **Locate the prompt** in `src/agents/improved_ollama_dialogue_agent.py`
2. **Find the function** (e.g., `_construct_emotion_to_body_prompt`)
3. **Modify the return string** with your new prompt
4. **Test the change** by running a conversation
5. **Monitor the output** to ensure it matches expectations

### Best Practices

1. **Keep prompts concise** - LLM performs better with clear, short instructions
2. **Use examples** - Show the AI what responses should look like
3. **Be specific** - "Ask about body location" not "explore further"
4. **Test with RAG** - Prompts work best when RAG examples are available
5. **Maintain Dr. Q style** - Elaborative, multiple options, warm

### Common Modifications

**To make questions less elaborative:**
```python
# Before
"When you feel that {emotion}, where in your body do you notice it? What location comes to mind first?"

# After
"Where do you feel that {emotion} in your body?"
```

**To change sensation examples:**
```python
# Find this line (around 1336)
- "What kind of sensation is it in {body_part}? Is it achy, stabbing, pressure?"

# Change to your examples
- "What kind of sensation is it in {body_part}? Is it burning, cold, numb?"
```

**To adjust tone:**
```python
# Current (warm, varied)
affirmations = ["That's right.", "Yeah.", "Got it.", "Okay."]

# Make more formal
affirmations = ["I understand.", "Thank you for sharing.", "I see."]
```

---

## Testing Your Changes

After modifying prompts:

```bash
# 1. Rebuild Docker (if using Docker)
docker compose build

# 2. Restart services
docker compose restart trt-app

# 3. Test with a conversation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8090/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "test",
    "message": "I am stressed about work"
  }'

# 4. Check the response matches your modification
```

## Prompt Variables

Prompts use these dynamic variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{client_input}` | Exact client message | "I am stressed" |
| `{emotion_content}` | Tracked emotion/problem | "stress from work" |
| `{detected_body_part}` | Body part mentioned | "your chest" |
| `{rag_examples_text}` | Dr. Q examples from RAG | "1. Where in your chest?..." |
| `{goal}` | Client's stated goal | "feel peaceful" |
| `{body_q_count}` | Body questions asked so far | "2/5" |

These variables are replaced at runtime with actual values from the conversation.

## Key Features

### 1. Emotion Tracking (New!)
The system now tracks the **exact emotion/problem** the client mentions:
- "I'm stressed about work" → tracks "stress from work"
- Body location question uses: "Where do you feel that **stress from work** in your body?"
- NOT: "Where do you feel that sadness in your body?" ❌

**Code:** `session_state.most_recent_emotion_or_problem` (line 1262)

### 2. Question Repetition Prevention (New!)
System scans last **6 turns** to prevent repeating questions:
- Problem question asked at Turn 5
- At Turn 9, system will NOT repeat it
- Applies to: problem questions, body location, sensation quality

**Code:** Lines 202-217, 1482-1492

### 3. Elaborative Style
All prompts use Dr. Q's elaborative style:
- Multiple options: "chest, head, or shoulders?"
- Multiple examples: "achy, stabbing, or pressure?"
- Multiple clarifications: "Where do you notice it? What comes to mind first?"

### 4. Body Part Detection
Sensation quality prompts detect the specific body part mentioned:
- Client: "My chest hurts"
- Detected: "your chest"
- Question: "What kind of sensation is it in **your chest**?"

**Code:** Lines 1320-1328
